Principle 1 : Object Identification ( Categorization )
In his influential “ Six Easy Pieces ” , Richard Feynman used the description “ the Mother of all physics experiments ” for the famous two - slit experiment , ( 1 ) because the results of many other experiments in quantum physics can be traced back to the observations in the two - slit experiment .
Is there any such example in cognitive science that can serve as “ the Mother of all cognitive problems ” ?
Indeed , there is .
Consider Figure 1.1 : Figure 1.1 .
The most fundamental cognitive problem : what does this figure show ?
The question in Figure 1.1 is : “ What is depicted ? ”
Most people would answer : “ Two groups of dots . ” ( 2 ) ( 3 ) It is possible of course to reply : “ Just a bunch of dots ” , but this would be an incomplete , a lazy fellow ’s answer .
What is it that makes people categorize the dots as belonging to two groups ?
It is their mutual distances , which , roughly , fall into two categories .
Using a computer we can easily write a program that , after assigning x and y coordinates to each dot , will reach the same conclusion i.e. , that there are two groups of dots in Figure 1.1 . ( 4 ) Why is this problem fundamental ?
Well , let us take a look at our surroundings : if we are in a room , we might see the walls , floor , ceiling , some furniture , this document , etc .
Or , consider a more natural setting , as in Figure 1.2 , where two “ sun conures ” are shown perching on a branch .
Notice , however , that the retinas of our eyes only send individual “ pixels ” , or dots , to the visual cortex , in the back of our brain ( see a rough approximation of this in Figure 1.3 ) .
How do we manage to see objects in a scene ?
Why do n’t we see individual dots ?
Figure 1.2 .
Image of two sun conures ( Aratinga solstitialis ) perching on a branch Figure 1.3 .
Conversion of previous image to “ dots ” , akin to retinal cells ( an exaggeration ; assume each dot is of one color ) Figure 1.3 approximates the raw input we receive : each dot comes from a rod or cone ( usually a cone ) of the eye ’s retina , and has a uniform “ color ” ( hue , luminosity , and saturation ) .
( 5 ) The brain then “ does something ” with the dots , and as a result we see objects .
What the brain does ( among other things ) is that it groups together the dots that “ belong together ” .
For example , most dots that come from the chest of the birds in Figure 1.3 are yellowish , so they form one group ( one region ) ; dots from the belly of the birds are more orangy , so again they “ belong together ” , forming another region .
Both yellow and orange dots are very different from the background gray–brown dots , so the latter form another region , or regions .
How many regions will be formed depends on a parameter setting that determines when dots are “ close enough ” ( both physically and in color ) so that they are lumped together in the same group .
In reality , visual object recognition is much more complex : the visual cortex includes edge detectors , motion detectors , neurons that respond to slopes and lengths , and a host of other special - purpose visual machinery that has been honed by evolution ( e.g. , see Thompson , 1993 ) .
But a first useful step toward object identification can be performed by means of solving the problem of grouping dots together .
Notice that by solving the object identification problem we do n’t perceive “ two birds ” in Figure 1.2 ( that would be object recognition ) , but merely “ there is something here , something else there , ... ” and so on .
Look again at Figure 1.1 : in that figure , dots belong together and form two groups simply because they are physically close ; that is , their “ closeness ” has a single feature : physical proximity , with two dimensions , x and y .
But in Figure 1.3 , dots belong together not only because of physical proximity , but also because of color ; thus , in Figure 1.3 the closeness of dots depends on more features ( more dimensions ) .
If color itself is analyzed in three dimensions ( hue , saturation , and luminosity ) then we have a total of five dimensions for the closeness of dots in that figure .
A real - world visual task includes a third dimension for physical proximity ( depth , arising from comparing the small disparity of dots between the two slightly different images formed by each eye ) , and it might include motion as an additional feature that overrules others ( “ dots that move together belong together ” ) .
Thus , the “ closeness of dots ” is a multi- dimensional concept , even for the simplest visual task of object identification .
Now let ’s consider a seemingly different problem ( but which will turn out to be the same in essence ) .
In our lives we perceive faces belonging to people from different parts of the world .
Some are East Asian , others are African , Northern European , and so on .
We see those faces not all at once , but in the course of decades .
We keep seeing them in our personal encounters , and in magazines , TV programs , movies , computer screens , etc .
During all these years we might form groups of faces , and even groups within groups .
For example , within the “ European ” face , we might learn to discern some typically German , French , Italian faces , and so on , depending on our experience .
Each group has a central element , a “ prototype ” , the most typical face that in our view belongs to it , and we can tell how distant from the prototype a given face of the group is .
( Note that the prototype does not need to correspond to an existing face , it ’s just an average . )
This problem is not very different from the one in Figures 1.1 and 1.3 : each dot corresponds to a face , and there is a large number of dimensions , each a measurable facial feature : color of skin , distances between eyes or between the eye - line and lips , length of lips , shape of nose , and a very large number of other characteristics .
Thus , the facial space has a large dimensionality .
We can imagine a central dot for each of the two groups in Figure 1.1 , located at the barycenter ( the center of gravity , or centroid ) of the group , analogous to the prototypical face of a group of people .
( And , again , the dot at the barycenter is imaginary , it does n’t correspond to a real dot . )
But there are some differences : contrary to Figure 1.1 , faces are probably arranged in a Gaussian distribution around the prototypical face ( Figure 1.4 ) , and we perceive them sequentially in the course of our lifetimes , not all at once .
Abstractly , however , the problem is the same .
Figure 1.4 .
Abstract face space ( pretending there are only two dimensions , x and y )
But vision is only one perceptual modality of human cognition .
Just as we solve the problem of grouping faces and categorizing new ones as either belonging to known groups or becoming candidates for new groups , so we solve abstract group - formation problems such as categorizing people ’s characters .
We learn what a typical arrogant character is , a typical naïve one , and so on .
The dimensions in this case are abstract personality features , such as greed–altruism , gullibility –skepticism , etc .
Similarly , in the modality of audition we categorize musical tunes as classical , jazz , rock , country , etc .
In each of these examples ( dots in Figure 1.1 , pixels of objects , people ’s faces , people ’s characters , etc. ) , we are not consciously aware of the dimensions involved , but our subconscious cognitive machinery manages to perceive and process them .
What kind of processing takes place with the perceptual dimensions is not precisely known yet , but the observed result of the processing has been summarized in a set of pithy formulas , known as the Generalized Context Model ( GCM ) ( Nosofsky 1984 ; Kruschke , 1992 ; Nosofsky , 1992 ; Nosofsky and Palmeri , 1997 ) .
The GCM does not imply that the brain computes equations ( see them in Figure 1.5 ) any more than Kepler ’s laws imply that the planets solve differential equations while they orbit the Sun.
Instead , like Kepler ’s laws , the formulas of the GCM in Figure 1.5 should be regarded as an emergent property , an epiphenomenon of some deeper mechanism , the nature of which is unknown at present .
Equation 1 Equation 2 Equation 3 Figure 1.5 .
The formulas of the Generalized Context Model ( GCM )
The formula in Equation 1 gives the distance d ij between two “ dots ” , or “ exemplars ” , as they are more formally called , each of which has n dimensions , and is therefore a point in an n-dimensional space , or a so - called n- tuple ( x 1 , x 2 , ..., x n ) .
For example , each dot in Figure 1.1 is a point in 2 - dimensional space .
The w k ’s are called the weights of the dimensions , because they determine how important dimension k is in calculating the distance .
For instance , if some of the dots in Figures 1.1 or 1.3 move in unison , we ’d like to give a very high value to the w k of the k - th dimension “ motion with a given speed along a certain direction ” ( this actually would comprise not one but several dimensions ) ; that ’s because the common motion of some dots would signify that they belong to the same moving object , and all other dimensions ( e.g. , of physical proximity ) would be much less important .
Normally there is the constraint that the sum of all w k must equal 1 .
Finally , the r is often taken to be equal to 2 , which turns Equation 1 to a “ weighted Euclidean distance ” .
Equation 2 gives the similarity s ij between two points i and j ( or “ dots ” , or “ exemplars ” ) .
If the difference d ij is very large , then this formula makes their similarity to be nearly 0 ; whereas if the difference is exactly 0 , then the similarity is exactly 1 .
The c in the formula is a constant , the effect of which is that if its value is high , then attention is paid to only very close similarity , and thus many groups ( categories ) are formed ; whereas if its value is low , the effect is the opposite : fewer groups ( categories ) are formed .
( How groups are formed is determined by Equation 3 , see below . )
Note that in some versions of the GCM , the quantity c·d ij is raised to a power q , so that if q=1 ( as in Equation 2 ) we have an exponential decay function , whereas if q=2 we have a Gaussian decay .
Finally , Equation 3 gives the probability P( G | i ) that point i will be placed in group G .
The symbol K stands for “ any group ” , so the first summation in the double - summation formula of the denominator says “ sum for each group ” .
Thus , suppose that some groups have already been formed , as in Figure 1.4 , and a new point ( dot ) arrives in the input ( a new European face is observed , in the context of the example of Figure 1.4 ) .
How can we decide in which group to place it ?
Answer : we compute the probability P( G | i ) for i = 1 , 2 , and 3 ( because we have 3 groups ) from this equation , and place it in the group with the highest probability .
An allowance must be made for the case in which the highest probability turns out to be too low — lower than a given threshold .
In that case we can create a new group .
In practice , Equation 3 is computationally very expensive , so some other heuristic methods can be adopted when the GCM is implemented in a computer .
A question arising from Equation 3 is how we determine the very initial groupings , when there are no groups formed yet , and thus K is zero .
One possible answer is that we entertain a few different grouping possibilities , allowing the reinforcement of some groups as new data arrive , and the fading of other groups in which no ( or few ) data points are assigned , until there is a fairly clear picture of which groups are the actual ones that emerge from the data ( Foundalis and Martínez , 2007 ) .
What ’s nice about the GCM equations is that they were not imagined arbitrarily by some clever computer scientist , but were derived experimentally by psychologists who tested human subjects , and measured under controlled laboratory conditions the ways in which people form categories .
Experimental observations provide strong support for the correctness of the GCM , according to Murphy ( 2002 ) .
What the above formulas do not tell us is how to decide what constitutes a dimension of a “ dot ” .
For example : you see a face ; how do you know that the distance between the eyes is a dimension , whereas the distance between the tip of the nose and the tip of an eyebrow is not ?
Now , we people do not have to solve this problem , because our subconscious cognitive machinery solves it automatically for us , in an as yet unknown way ; but when we want to solve the problem of “ categorization of any arbitrary input ” in a computer we are confronted with the question of what the dimensions are .
There is a method , known as “ multidimensional scaling ” , which allows the determination of dimensions , under certain conditions .
( 6 ) But more research is currently needed on this problem , and definitive answers have not arisen yet .
Opinions differ on which theory is best suited to describe the GCM .
The question is : if categories are formed and look like those in Figure 1.4 , then how are they represented in the human mind ?
This is the source of the well - known “ prototype ” vs. “ exemplar ” theory contention ( see Murphy , 2002 , for an introduction ) .
The prototype theory says that categories are represented through an average value ( but see Foundalis , 2006 , for a more sophisticated statistical approach ) .
The exemplar theory says that categories are represented by storing their individual examples .
Many laboratory tests of the GCM with human subjects appear to support the exemplar theory , although no consensus has been reached yet .
However , although the architecture of the brain seems well - suited for computing the GCM according to the exemplar theory , the architecture of present - day computers is ill - suited for this task .
In Phaeaco ( Foundalis , 2006 ) , an alternative is proposed , which uses the exemplar theory as long as the category remains poor in examples ( and thus the computational burden is low ) , and gradually shifts to the prototype theory as the category becomes more robust and its statistics more reliable .
Whatever the internal representation of a category in the human mind is , the important observation is that the GCM formulas capture our experimental data of people ’s behavior when they form categories .
The reader probably noticed that this section started with the question of object identification , and ended up with the problem of category formation .
How was this change of subject allowed to happen ?
But the beauty of the First Principle is that it unifies the two notions into one : object identification and category formation are actually the same problem .
It is tempting to surmise that the spectrum that starts with object identification and ends with abstract category formation has an evolutionary basis , in which cognitively simpler animals reached only the “ lower ” end of this spectrum ( concrete object identification ) , whereas as they evolved to cognitively more complex creatures they were able to solve more abstract categorization problems .
The power of the First Principle is that it allows cognition to happen in a very essential way : without object identification we would be unable to perceive anything at all .
Our entire cognitive edifice is based on the premise that there are objects out there ( the nouns of languages ) , which we can count : one object , two objects ...
Based on the existence of objects , we note their properties ( a red object , a moving object , ... ) , their relations ( two colliding objects , one object underneath another one , ... ) , properties of their relations ( a slowly moving object , a boringly uniform object , ... ) , and so on .
Subtract objects from the picture , and nothing remains — cognition vanishes entirely .
A related interesting question is whether there are really no objects in the world , and our cognition simply concocts them , as some philosophers have claimed ( e.g. , Smith , 1996 ) .
But I think this view puts the cart in front of the horse : it is because the world is structured in some particular ways ( forming conglomerations of like units ) that it affords cognition , i.e. , it affords the evolution of creatures that took advantage of the fact that objects exist , and used this to increase their chances of survival .
Cognition mirrors the structure and properties of the world .
“ Strict constructivism ” — the philosophical view that denies the existence of objects outside an observer ’s mind — cannot explain the origin of cognition .
Last week , attorneys for special ed student Marshawn Pitts released the security video below , which shows Pitts being beaten by Christopher Lloyd , a police officer in Dolton , Illinois who was working security at the school .
Pitts ' attorneys say Lloyd administered the beating because Pitts had n't tucked in his shirt , as required by the school 's dress code .
When the video first emerged last week , the Dolton police department refused to release Lloyd 's name .
With good reason .
Lloyd is in jail in Indiana .
He was arrested last month for raping an Indiana woman at knife point .
He had also threatened the woman weeks earlier , but apparently was n't arrested or disciplined for it .
But it gets worse .
Lloyd was also fired last year from another suburban Chicago police department . . . for killing his ex-wife 's husband in front of their children .
The town of Robbins fired Lloyd after the February 2008 shooting , but Chicago police bought Lloyd 's claim that the shooting was self - defense , so he was never charged .
That enabled Lloyd to find work at the Dalton police department 11 months later .
According to a lawsuit filed by Lloyd 's ex-wife , autopsy reports contradict the police investigation .
The autopsy shows that Lloyd shot the man 24 times .
When contacted by the Chicago Tribune , a spokesman from Chicago PD said details of the department 's investigation of the shooting " could not immediately be found . "

UNITED NATIONS ( CNN ) -- A United Nations report issued Tuesday says both Israel and the Palestinians committed actions amounting to war crimes during Israel 's military incursion into Gaza from December 27 to January 18 .
A member of Hamas walks through a building damaged during fighting with Israel in Gaza last January .
Although the U.N. investigation found that Palestinian militants also committed war crimes , the overwhelming majority of the criticism in a summary of the 574 - page report targets Israel .
Israel " committed actions amounting to war crimes , possibly crimes against humanity , " the report says .
The findings were revealed by the head of the U.N. Fact Finding Mission on the Gaza Conflict , headed by Richard Goldstone , a South African judge .
Israel did not cooperate in the investigation .
The Israeli Foreign Ministry issued a statement saying Israel " did not feel able to cooperate with the Fact Finding Mission because its mandate was clearly one - sided and ignored the thousands of Hamas missile attacks on civilians in southern Israel that made the Gaza Operation necessary . "
Sami Abu Zuhri , a spokesman for Hamas , which controls Gaza , told CNN : " This report is evidence of the crimes committed by the occupation forces against Palestinian citizens . "
He rebutted claims in the report that Hamas militants also committed war crimes by saying that " the Palestinian factions were defending themselves , which international law allows them to do . "
The report claims that the Israel Defense Forces " failed to take feasible precautions required by international law to avoid or minimize loss of civilian life , injury to civilians and damage to civilian objects . "
The U.N. findings also conclude that Israel fired the chemical agent white phosphorous in civilian areas , intentionally fired high - explosive artillery shells upon hospitals , and failed to provide effective warnings to civilians or U.N. workers before attacks .
It also claims that Israel used Palestinian civilians as human shields and deliberately attacked Palestinian food supplies in Gaza .
The report recommends that the U.N. Security Council require the government of Israel to launch appropriate independent investigations into the findings of the report within three months .
The findings also recommend that the alleged Israeli war crimes be explored by the International Criminal Court 's prosecutor .
The findings also call on Palestinian leadership to investigate alleged war crimes , for militants to respect humanitarian law , and for the release of Israeli soldier Gilad Shalit on humanitarian grounds .

In Baden - Württemberg ist einmal mehr eine Gamer - Veranstaltung dem Killerspiel - Schlaghammer der Politik zum Opfer gefallen .
Nach der Absage eines ESL - Turniers in Stuttgart und in Karlsruhe ist nun erstmals eine LAN - Party für volljährige Teilnehmer betroffen , deren Veranstalter nun finanziell in die Bredouille geraten könnte .
Auf der für den 28 .
bis 30 .
August geplanten 14 .
Convention - X- Treme ( CXT14 ) wurden mehrere hundert Teilnehmer erwartet .
Veranstalter der LAN - Party ist der in der Gemeinde Karlsdorf - Neuthard ansässige Verein „ Computerfreunde Karlsdorf - Neuthard e.V. “ , der nunmehr von der Gemeindeverwaltung mitgeteilt bekommen habe , dass das Spielen sogenannter „ Killerspiele “ auf der LAN - Party zu unterlassen sei .
Zu diesem Entschluss kam der zuständige Bürgermeister nach Rücksprache mit Lehrern und Polizisten , wie es heißt .
Diese hätten ihn darauf hingewiesen , dass Killerspiele negative Auswirkungen auf Kinder und Jugendliche haben könnten .
Auf der CXT14 sind allerdings nur volljährige Spieler zugelassen , wie der Veranstalter mitteilt .
Zudem fielen auch Spiele wie Counterstrike ( freigegeben ab 16 Jahren ) und Warcraft 3 ( freigegeben ab 12 Jahren ) unter die Gemeinderestriktionen , womit das Ausrichten der LAN - Party nach Meinung des Vereins unmöglich sei .
Die 9.000 - Seelen - Gemeinde hat die Veranstaltung dagegen nicht selbst abgesagt .
Kritisch könnte es nun nach eigenem Bekunden für den Verein werden , da dieser unter finanziellen Druck gerät und die Eintrittsgelder zurückzahlen muss , ohne aber Einnahmen aus für ihn wichtigen Veranstaltungen wie dieser LAN - Party zu ziehen .
Die aufgebrachten Vorleistungen , sowie die mehreren tausend Euro an Eintrittsgeldern , die nun zurück überwiesen werden , würden die Vereinskasse stark belasten und den Fortbestand der Computerfreunde gefährden .
Es müsse jedoch keiner über den bereits bezahlten Eintritt bangen , wie es weiter heißt .
Auch suche man bereits nach alternativen Veranstaltungsorten und plane ein weiteres Gespräch mit der Gemeindeverwaltung , um bestehende Brücken nicht einzureißen .
Aufgebrachte Spieler bittet man darum , sich gegenüber der Gemeindeverwaltung nicht im Ton zu vergreifen und Kritik sachlich zu übermitteln .
Es sei auch möglich , entsprechende Bekundungen beim Verein einzureichen , sodass dieser sie gebündelt im Gespräch vorlegt .
In der Spielerszene wird die aktuelle politische Entwicklung dabei weiterhin für Unmut sorgen , da auch dieses Ereignis ein Vorbild für weitere Gemeinden sein könnte .
Dabei stehen mit den beginnenden Sommerferien auch mehr private und öffentliche LAN - Partys an .
Besonders pikant ist in diesem Fall außerdem , dass ein örtliches Schützenturnier in der Gemeinde Karlsdorf - Neuthard in der Zeit vom 8 . bis zum 9 .
August stattfinden darf .
Auf diesem sind auch Teilnehmer unter 14 Jahren zugelassen .

This is the story of two Joe Wilsons , and two Americas .
Both challenged a president , the most powerful man in the free world .
One is a liar and the other is a courageous truth - teller .
One enjoys impunity for his falsehood and epochal rudeness , bespeaking an America ruled with civility and tolerance .
The other was subjected to a ruthless campaign of smears , and the career of his wife was ruined , bespeaking an America controlled by heartless men bent on achieving their nefarious ends by running roughshod over others .
On September 9 , 2009 , a man named Joe Wilson , a congressman from South Carolina , yelled “ You lie ! ” at the president as he was defending his universal health coverage proposals from nutty rightwing smears .
Joe Wilson , whom the Health Industry lobby has given $ 244,196 in campaign contributions , was of course himself lying when he implied that President Obama ’s plan will cover illegal immigrants .
It will not .
President Obama graciously accepted Wilson ’s subsequent apology , even though no modern president has been yelled at that way by a minor rural politician .
On July 6 , 2003 another Joe Wilson called a president a liar , in an opinion essay for the New York Times .
This Joe Wilson had bravely stared down Saddam Hussein in fall , 1990 as acting ambassador in Baghdad and been commended for his courage by George H. W. Bush .
George W. Bush had falsely alleged in his State of the Union Speech that Iraq had recently bought yellowcake uranium from the West African country of Niger .
The allegation was based on a clumsily forged document that had been discounted by the CIA and was proven false within 24 hours when finally shared with the International Atomic Energy Agency .
Wilson ’s complaint that the assertion had been false and that he had shown it false before the war was deeply embarrassing to the Bush administration .
It responded by smearing Wilson and then attempting to out his wife , Valerie Plame , as an undercover CIA operative working against Iran ’s nuclear program .
Plame ’s career was destroyed and all her known agents and contacts around the world were burned ; some of them may have quietly been killed ( we have no way of knowing ) .
Ultimately , the truth of the anti-Wilson , anti-Plame campaign came out and Richard Bruce Cheney ’s chief of staff , was found guilty of an attempted cover - up .
Cheney had ordered the outing of Plame ; it happened via another route , but Cheney was conniving at it .
Cheney is a traitor and should be rotting in jail .
Note that the first Joe Wilson was dead wrong , but that the Obama administration responded in a gentlemanly way to his charge .
The Bush - Cheney administration , in contrast , attempted to besmirch the reputation and the life of a dedicated lifetime civil servant because he spoke the truth to the president .
The story of the two Joe Wilsons and how they were treated is the story of two visions of America .
The Bush - Cheney vision is a nightmarish landscape of blighted lives and cruel indifference to basic human decency .
The Obama vision is just the Golden Rule , with which the people who vote for the evil Joe Wilson typically profess acquaintance .
The evil Joe Wilson ( R- SC ) is the remnant of Cheneyism in this new America , painfully being born from the rubble made by the old .
He need n’t remain in office , defiling the halls of the Congress of the United States of America .
He has an opponent in the next election , Rob Miller , an Iraq War veteran .
An honorable man .
Here is his campaign site .
We only need the one kind of Joe Wilson , the one who shouts “ truth ” to lies ; not the one who shouts “ lies ” to the truth .

On the same day that The New York Times said ( buried in its Media Decoder blog ) that it would cut 100 newsroom jobs ( again ) , Columbia University said it would not accept applications next year for its dual - degree graduate program in environmental journalism .
The former is no surprise ; the latter is a sad sign of the impact of newsroom job cuts on what news gets reported — or not .
In a letter to faculty , the directors of the program wrote :
As you know , media organizations across the county are in dire financial straits and thousands of journalists ’ jobs have been eliminated .
Science and environment beats have been particularly vulnerable .
Although our graduates have done well in their careers , even those still employed are finding few opportunities to do the kind of substantive reporting for which the dual degree program has trained them , as they scramble to do their own work plus that of laid - off colleagues .
[ emphasis added ]
The ability of newspapers to report credibly and capably on news other than sports , entertainment , business and politics has been severely undercut by the loss of several thousand journalists over the past three years .
In the case of environmental issues , such as climate change , the loss is incalculable .
In the summer issue of SEJournal , the quarterly journal of the Society of Environmental Journalists , editor Mike Mansur interviewed Curtis Brainard , editor of the Columbia Journalism Review ’s Observatory .
The blog critiques the coverage of science .
Mr. Brainard discussed the impacts of newsroom cuts on environmental journalism :
Obviously , it ’s a very discouraging time to be working in journalism with so many layoffs , buyouts , and closings .
There are fewer staff jobs for specialized environmental reporters and fewer resources available to those who do have jobs .
Tragically , this is happening at a time when environmental issues are finally getting more attention from the political and business realms .
… the fate of newspapers will be the fate of science and environmental journalism at newspapers .
They ’re hemorrhaging jobs like mad , as so many of this journal ’s readers are painfully aware , and I certainly have no idea what will staunch the bleeding .
However , I can say that it ’s been phenomenally impressive to watch how well print reporters have transitioned to the Web over the last few years .
I really have no idea how practical it is — because there ’s still no reliable business model for any kind of ( web ) journalism … [ emphasis added ]
The increasing loss of science and environmental reporters from the nation ’s newspapers is socially costly .
It stills experienced voices that can comprehend the science behind issues such as climate change ; present it in readable , interesting ways ; and explain both the human and environmental context .
Those are not easy skills to master .
The nation ’s best environmental journalists have developed their craft over decades .
One of those training grounds has been at Columbia .
The directors of its suspended program , however , can read the tea leaves :
Their graduates cannot reliably find reporting jobs at the nation ’s daily newspapers .
Yes , various online environmental journalism operations have sprouted .
But their readership still can’t match the nearly 50 million newspapers printed daily .
Though declining , that amount of paid circulation still has some muscle .
But the decline in numbers of environmental journalists hurts , says the Observatory ’s Brainard :
But who is watching all the municipal waste departments out there , looking over the environmental impact statements of local energy projects , or paying attention to water quality ?
Who will be keeping track of all environment - and energy - related stimulus money as it filters down to the lowest levels of government and out to businesses and contractors ?
Regional news outlets are the only ones who can reliably monitor such things .
That ’s exactly where we ’ve lost so many of our very best journalists .
Again , as usual , the public is the loser .
It wo n’t get information it needs to make informed consumer and political decisions .
[ Disclosure : I am a member of the SEJournal editorial board and its former chair . ]
Huge day for TV ratings .
Lots of returning shows and a limited number of viewers to court .
House was the big winner pulling in an average 6.6 ( !! ) for the 2 hours .
That 's way more than the last season started and creamed all competition .
The CBS comedies did well though they were down from last year .
How I Met Your Mother had 3.5 , the new comedy Accidentally on Purpose got 3.2 , and Two and a Half Men got 4.4 .
The big CBS story of the night was The Big Bang Theory which in the new timeslot got 4.6 which matches the series high .
CSI : Miami returned with a good 4.3 , down slightly from last year .
Dancing with the Stars came back shockingly low with a 4.1 average over the 2 hours .
This translated into worse ratings for Castle which had a pretty disappointing 2.3 .
There 's something about the show that skews it older .
It 's not flashy , it 's not edgy like CSI : Miami .
Last but not least ( ok , it this case it was ) is Heroes .
People are starting to give up on the show and the episode got 2.7 , lower than the season 3 finale .
If it has the same weekly ratings drop as the last season , expect a cancellation .
The episodes are expensive to make and a 2.7 to start off with does not help .
Jay Leno continues his drop until stabilization getting 1.8 .
In the end , I expect him to hover around 1.2 .

My very favorite cookware is old some of it very old .
It ’s nonstick , is equally at home in the kitchen or wilderness camp , is the ultimate slow - cooker , and you can whop a mountain lion on the head with it and kill it .
( Okay …maybe that last is a bit of a stretch . )
Of course , it ’s my cast ironware .
I love it so much that I have a real wide assortment : two small 6 - inch fry pans ( great for an egg or two ) , an 8 - inch fry pan , a 10 - inch fry pan , and a huge 18 - inch frying pan that you could certainly frighten a mountain lion with .
I also own a Dutch oven , waffle iron , cornbread stick pan , muffin pan , two griddles , and a roaster .
Yes , cast iron is heavy .
Especially the larger pieces of cookware .
But that weight is why it cooks so very well .
The iron heats up quickly , distributes that heat evenly , and holds the temperature a long time .
You have fewer burned meals where a spot on the pan scorches your dinner , fewer “ undone ” spots in your baked foods , and , because you season the pans , the surface is quite “ stick - free , ” without Teflon coating to chip out in your food .
( Which , by the way , has dubious health cautions . )
The iron does leach minute amounts of iron into the food you cook , which is good for you , preventing iron deficiency without taking a vitamin supplement !
Even old , ugly , rusted cast iron pans can be rehabilitated for cooking .
Cast ironware has been around for centuries .
It became very popular in the 1700s , often becoming part of a family inheritance or a bride ’s dowry .
European immigrants to the New World often brought a treasured cast iron pot or frying pan along with them , even when they had to leave other valuables behind .
A couple of my own frying pans are more than a hundred years old .
I was given them by an elderly neighbor , who was given them as a young housewife by her elderly neighbor back in the homesteading days .
I ’m cooking with history every day .
One wonders what those pans have seen .
Buying cast iron
I truly believe the older cast iron cookware is better than the newer pots and pans .
I have several “ unnamed ” pans that are my oldies , then several Griswold pans that are great .
I have one old Lodge frying pan that is excellent and one made in China , which is not .
It was a gift from a well - meaning relative .
It ’s too light and just wo n’t take a seasoning well , no matter what I do .
The newer Lodge brand cast iron cookware is not as finely polished as the older pans were , but the company claims that they are preseasoned and will cook well .
I have n’t yet tried a new one ; my old bunch does not need replacing .
And after raising nine kids , they got a whole lot of use .
You can certainly buy new cast iron cookware through such places as Lehman ’s Hardware or the Cumberland General Store , many local and mail order sports stores , such as L.L. Bean , or your local farm and ranch store or well - stocked hardware store .
( From my own experience , stay away from “ made in China ” ironware . )
Or you can keep an eye out at your thrift stores , Goodwill , Salvation Army , yard sales , or auctions .
I ’ve picked up many of my treasured pots and pans at just such places , for prices that made me smile .
Of course , you can also get word around that you ’re really interested in picking up some cast ironware .
You never know when you might find your next piece right at the neighbor ’s , unused and unwanted … but your pot of gold .
Now , not all used cast iron cookware looks nice .
Being iron , it easily rusts .
My Dutch oven was found in a shed , full of water and rusty nails !
Ugly ?
Oh yes .
But now it ’s a black beauty .
Rust can be dealt with .
Another thing that makes cast iron look nasty is the accumulation of black goop that sticks to the outside of frying pans that are used on kitchen ranges .
( It does n’t happen with campfire cooking ; it burns right off . )
This , also , is a minor cosmetic fault and is easy to fix .
Restoring rusty cast iron
Rusty cast iron is easily reclaimable unless the rust has deeply eaten into the iron , causing deep pits or holes .
This is not commonly seen , but is always a possibility .
Most of the time , all that is needed is a good washing with hot , soapy water and a green nylon scrubby .
With lots of elbow grease and a couple of trips through the sink , the pot or pan is often smooth and nearly as good as new .
If the rust is more tenacious , you can use a steel wool pad and scour it off with that .
In severe cases , I ’ve taken a sanding disc to it , removing the rust first , then using a very fine grit to re-polish the surface of the iron .
Once your pan is clean and smooth , rinse it well with boiling water , then dry it with a kitchen towel .
As the iron is now unprotected , even a little moisture can quickly rust your new pan .
You will now season the pan , as if it were new .
( See instructions later on . )
Cast iron pots and pans with the “ crud ” caked on are a lot easier to clean than you ’d imagine .
I just build a nice campfire on a damp day , toast a few marshmallows , then shove my iron pan into the hot coals and pile them over the pan with a stick .
I keep the fire going for awhile , then check the pan .
It usually only takes a little while in the fire to burn off all the icky build - up on the sides of the pan .
Suddenly it looks like new .
Wow , almost magic !
Cool your pan gently , then wash it with hot soapy water and a scouring pad , if necessary , rinse with boiling water , and dry .
Again , you will need to season the pan to make it cook well again .
Seasoning your cast iron
Cast iron is made by pouring molten iron into molds .
This iron has tiny pores that will absorb grease , which , when gently heated over a period of time , form a natural , slick , stick - free surface .
This is called “ seasoning , ” and is necessary for much new ironware … which is often treated with an inedible coating at the factory to prevent rusting .
It is also necessary for all “ saved ” cast iron cookware that has been scoured , burned , or sanded .
You will also need to re-season any cast iron cookware that you have washed with very soapy water , as it removes some of the seasoning and foods will now stick .
Jackie burns two of her cast iron pans in a fire to remove year ’s worth of crusted - on food and grease .
I ’ve experimented with several different tried and true seasoning methods , and the one that works best for me is also the easiest .
Wow !
I like that .
Simply wash , rinse , and dry your pan ( new or reconditioned ) , then rub shortening gently all over the inside .
Wipe away any excess with a paper towel .
Then place your pan in the oven , turned down very low about 200° F. is good .
Let the pan remain in the oven at that temperature for several hours .
Then take it out and inspect the surface .
It should be darker and evenly coated with a slick glazed finish .
If not , just repeat the process .
The end product will be a pan that is nearly as stick - free as Teflon … and the pan will last for generations without scratches or dents .
I even season the top of my kitchen range .
I do n’t cook directly on the top , but the seasoning prevents rust and gives it a nice mellow , dark finish .
It ’s much nicer than blacking it with stove polish .
The stove looks “ lived with , ” not like a showpiece .
I use olive oil and rub it on with an old rag .
Then I build a gentle small fire and just warm up the top for an hour or two .
It does smell a little , but the results are definitely worth it .
Frying with cast iron
Because iron heats quickly and evenly , it is an excellent choice for a frying pan .
To fry a piece of meat or mess of potatoes , heat the pan on your stove until it is quite warm but not hot .
Add your grease or oil and let it melt while the pan heats up further .
Then , before the grease is very hot , add your meat or potatoes .
Do not add potatoes or meat to your pan while the grease is still cold ; you ’ll invite sticking , despite your neat non -stick finish .
It needs to sear just a bit before getting down to medium frying temperatures .
I use a wooden spatula when frying , but I also have used a metal spatula .
Just try not to scrape or dig around in your pan more than necessary .
You can scratch your natural nonstick surface and make areas that will eventually expand into places where food may stick .
Some people like to use plastic or nylon spatulas on their cast iron , but I prefer the thinner , stiffer wood or metal .
Roasting in the Dutch oven
To roast a piece of meat in your cast iron Dutch oven , add a tablespoonful of grease or oil to the inside surface and heat it to medium hot , rocking the pan so that the entire bottom surface is coated with the oil .
Then add your seasoned meat gently to avoid spattering hot grease on your hands .
I use two long forks to place the meat in the pan .
It will begin searing on contact .
I sear all surfaces , browning them lightly to keep in juices .
Then add a cupful of water and place the lid on , turning the heat to medium .
You can also use your Dutch oven in your range oven ; the results are the same .
If using your oven , turn it to 350° F. or less if you want the meat to cook slower .
Before :
The bottom of this cast iron pan is crusted up from years of use .
After :
This frying pan has been scrubbed , burned , and re-seasoned .
With a smaller piece of meat , a pound or two , you can also add vegetables after you ’ve added the water so they can roast along with the meat .
In this way they ’ll absorb the flavors from the seasoned meat and brown slowly to a gorgeous color .
I often add halved potatoes , carrots , onions , summer squash , parsnips , or turnips .
This makes a great “ quick ” one - dish meal .
Add some homemade biscuits or rolls and you ’ll have a meal folks will rave over .
If your roast is large , cook it for about an hour and half , then add your vegetables so that they do n’t overcook and become mushy .
The Dutch oven became famous as a campfire cooking essential .
And it still is !
The handiest Dutch ovens have a lid that has a rim around the sides .
That is so that when you place hot coals on the lid , they do n’t slide off .
To roast a meal in your Dutch oven over a campfire , start it off like you would at home .
You want to cook on a bed of coals , not a blazing fire .
I like to make a “ nest ” in the bed of hot coals , then drag a layer of white ashes on top of that , place the Dutch oven full of meat and vegetables on that , then scoop a layer of coals onto the lid .
You may have to replace the coals on the lid , as they ’ll cool off faster than the bed of coals under the Dutch oven .
Try to resist the urge to “ check up ” on your meal ; it ’s a little more involved than when you do it at home , simply lifting the lid !
You have to be careful of the coals on the lid , so they do n’t fall off or worse yet , dribble into your meal .
In addition , each time you lift the lid , you set back the time your meal will take to cook as you release heat and steam from the pot .
This method of cooking is the original slow cookery .
You could pile coals up around your Dutch oven , pile coals on the lid , go off and do something else , and your meal would be ready when you are hungry .
Nifty , huh ?
Baking in the Dutch oven
You can also bake in your Dutch oven .
That ’s why they called it a Dutch oven !
You can bake anything from biscuits to breads , cobblers , and even pies in one .
Even on a campfire .
Mom used her trusty
Dutch oven to bake cherry cobblers for us in camp when I was just a kid .
One night , though , we heard a clanking sound outside , where she ’d left the cobbler sitting on a bench to keep cold overnight .
In the morning , the top was all sticky cherry goop .
The cobbler was half gone and there were little cherry raccoon tracks all over the bench …
He ’d taken the cover off with one paw , gobbled the cobbler , then put the lid back on !
Using the Dutch oven to bake in a traditional oven is easy , but baking on campfire coals does require a little practice .
I snuggle the oven down in a bed of coals , covered with a two - inch layer of ash , and pre-heat it with the lid on for about ten minutes .
Then I take a piece of clean rag , rubbed with shortening , and quickly grease the bottom of the oven lightly .
You do n’t want pools of melted shortening , just a light greasing .
Quickly lay your biscuits in the pan and put the lid on .
Add coals to the top ; about five three - inch pieces is about right .
Let the biscuits bake for about ten minutes , then check them .
If the bottom is browning too quickly , flip them over so the top will also brown as they finish baking .
Old time pioneers and cowboys greased their Dutch oven with a square of salt pork or bacon fat .
They said it gave the biscuits a real good taste .
I agree !
Waffle irons , muffin pans , and cornbread stick pans
When I was learning to bake waffles , muffins , and cornbread sticks using cast iron , I could not get them to come out right .
They always stuck and burned and I had the very devil of a time getting the nasty mess picked out of the pans .
Yuck !
Then a lady asked me if I preheated my pans enough .
Enough ?
I did n’t heat them at all , except for the waffle iron , and I only heated that enough to barely melt the shortening so I could grease it .
So I tried to preheat the iron .
Wow !
What a difference that made .
I could finally make those delicate little cornbread sticks that look like ears of corn , and my waffles popped right out of the waffle iron .
To preheat your muffin and cornbread stick pans , place them in the oven at 250° F. for 10 minutes .
Then quickly remove them , lightly grease them , and spoon in your batter .
In the meantime , as you remove the pans , turn the oven up to 350° F .
When the pans are full , slide them back into the hotter oven and bake as usual , until they are springy firm to the touch .
Then remove them from the oven to cool for about ten minutes or so , until they pull away from the pan slightly .
At this time , they are ready to remove from the pans .
Using a fork or knife with the muffins can help release them with no tearing .
Using a cast iron griddle
This Dutch oven has a “ lip ” around the edge of the lid to keep hot coals in place .
It is equally at home on the stove top , in a regular oven , or over a campfire .
Baking pancakes , flatbreads , crepes , and tortillas on a cast iron griddle is easy , but it does require a little practice .
Pancakes and crepes need a hotter griddle than do flatbreads and tortillas .
To determine if a griddle is hot enough for pancakes or crepes , heat it , grease it lightly , then wait a bit .
If it is hot enough , a few drops of water dripped from your fingers will
sputter and dance across the surface .
If it is too hot , they will zip , steam , and sizzle and the grease will start smoking .
When the griddle is hot , pour your batter onto it .
A smaller common - sized round or square one - burner griddle will hold three nice - sized pancakes or four smaller ones .
Space your batter so when it spreads out and rises , it wo n’t touch its neighbor .
If this happens , the pancakes will be hard to turn without ripping or folding pieces under .
Let them bake until there are bubbles across the surface .
You can gently lift an edge to see if the bottom is as golden as you ’d like , then flip it over .
No .
I ’m not nimble enough to actually “ flip ” my pancakes , but my son , Bill , can flip them neatly .
( Show off ! )
Tortillas and flatbreads need a medium griddle , which is cooler than the hot griddle for pancakes and crepes .
Tortillas and other flatbreads are denser than pancakes and need more time to bake through and you do n’t want to burn them in the process .
Simply grease your hot griddle lightly and put your tortillas on it .
You ’ll be baking them for about two minutes on each side , and flatbreads about twice that long .
Again , you can gently lift the edges of the tortilla to peek at the underside .
You want it baked nicely , but not have burned spots .
Deep frying in cast iron
You can deep fry in a special cast iron saucepan , made for a deep fryer , but you can also deep fry in your Dutch oven .
In fact , you can use any deep cast iron pot or pan not a frying pan because the hot grease could rise and overflow into your fire .
You do not want a frying pan full of fire !
I have great memories of making homemade doughnuts in my Dutch oven , way up in our remote Montana homestead .
( If you ’ve never made homemade doughnuts , give ’em a try .
Nothing you buy can even come close .
Besides , they ’re easy and fun to make , too ! )
No wonder cowboys would ride for miles to visit a ranch where the wife made “ bear sign , ” the local lingo for doughnuts !
Of course you can make French fries , but I use mine more for frying egg rolls , sopapillas , onion rings , tortillas for tacos , chulupas , fried chicken , fry bread , and , of course , doughnuts !
To fry in your Dutch oven or other iron pot , add several inches of shortening or oil .
Never add too much or it can boil over and cause a fire .
Heat the pan until the grease is very hot , but not smoking .
When you drop in your first piece , it should rapidly float , not sink to the bottom and just sit there .
If that happens , the grease is not hot enough and the food will absorb grease and be heavy .
Properly fried food , when drained well on paper towels after frying , should not feel greasy .
When your larger food pieces have fried on one side , you may need to turn them so the other side will also cook well .
I ’ll spoon hot grease over my sopapillas and corn tortillas I ’m frying , so they ’ll get bubbles and become light and crispy .
When the food you ’re frying is done , quickly spoon it out with a slotted spoon , taking care not to drizzle hot grease on yourself or on the fire to prevent accidents .
Then place it on a multi - thickness of paper towels to drain well .
Be sure to remove all pieces , especially French fries or bits of breading .
If they burn , it ’ll ruin your grease .
You can seldom get rid of the scorched taste .
When you ’re done frying , you can pour the hot grease through a clean piece of old towel or cheesecloth to strain it , saving the grease for another time .
The deep frying actually helps maintain the seasoning of your pan , so it serves a double duty .
Problems with cast iron
While cast iron is about the perfect cookware , there are a few things that you should n’t do with it .
You really should n’t use cast iron when you ’re making dishes that include tomatoes or highly acidic fruit , such as pineapple .
Cast iron reacts to acid , giving the food a nasty taste .
So make your chili in another pot , your pineapple upside - down cake in something else , and make beef stew with gravy instead of tomatoes .
The two pieces of this cast iron waffle iron are set together on the ring after you have added your batter .
The iron is oiled and heated before the batter is added .
You would n’t believe it , but cast iron is actually kind of brittle sometimes .
I dropped my very favorite old frying pan on the kitchen floor after washing it , and it broke the handle right off , taking a chunk of pan with it .
Luckily , my blacksmith felt sorry for me and took it home with him .
And the next visit , he presented me with my pan , all welded and ground down nicely .
It was even re-seasoned !
How nice .
So , yep , they do break .
Likewise , do n’t put an ice cold cast iron pan on a fire or hot stove or a hot pan in cold water .
Either can cause it to warp or crack .
Cast ironware rusts quite easily .
Even seasoned pans can rust in spots , where the seasoning has worn out .
So always dry your pans after washing and keep them in a dry spot .
In camp , I pack mine in a heavy duty garbage bag , inside a waterproof canvas pack sack , just to keep them safe .
The handles of frying pans and pans out of the oven are hot .
So is the bail or handle on your Dutch oven .
Use hot pads or suffer burned fingers .
You ’ll find a heavy wire hook a great camp tool for lifting the lid on your Dutch oven .
They have these nifty slip - on frying pan handle covers in some stores nowadays .
They ’re sort of like custom hot pads that slide over the handle when you want to move the pan .
I have two and really like them .
Washing your cast iron
Here we enter the grounds of The Great Debate .
Some folks swear you should never , never wash cast iron cookware .
You just wipe them out after use .
Other people just throw them in the sink and wash as usual .
I kind of take the middle road .
Yes , I do wash my cast iron cookware .
And the sooner after use , the better .
Often , I just pour boiling water in a hot pan , let it sit until I can reach my hand in the water , then use a nylon scrubbie and wash out the pan .
This softens any hard crusted food , melts any grease , yet leaves the seasoning in the iron .
When you use dish detergent , you do remove the seasoning , and will soon have trouble with foods sticking and often burning in your pans .
Cow country cooks and pioneers used the boiling water method , along with a handful of sand to scour out stubborn food .
They did n’t have green nylon scrubbies !
After you have washed your cast iron , rinse it with boiling water while it is hot , then wipe it dry with a kitchen towel .
The waffle iron and cornbread stick pans can be dried nicely in a warm oven , with the pans turned upside down .
Any time you do n’t dry your pans right after washing , you are risking rust forming where the seasoning is getting thin .
And rust not only looks ugly , but it will shorten the usable life of your pan and make food stick .
Once you try cooking with properly seasoned cast iron cookware , I ’m sure you ’ll be hooked .
I know I was , and that was more than 50 years ago .
It just ca n’t be beat for ease of cooking as well as clean - up later .
I ’ll swear that food even tastes better when cooked in cast iron .
All those cowboys and pioneers who cooked on cast iron could n’t be wrong .
I , not “ we , ” made an error in the Sunday edition of Osborne Ink .
By failing to sufficiently fact - check a timeline , I included Michelle Malkin ’s screencapture in a post on FreedomWorks ’ vastly inflated attendance estimates .
Having ensured the fairness of Osborne Ink , here is the balance :
FreedomWorks , the main organizers of the Tea Party event in Washington this past weekend , has dramatically lowered its estimate for the size of the crowd at the event from 1.5 million , a number the group now concedes was a mistake , to between 600,000 and 800,000 people — though this is still substantially more than the tens of thousands that most mainstream media outlets have estimated , and which FreedomWorks wholeheartedly rejects .
The politically charged issue of crowd size is complicated by the fact that there is no official estimate — not from the Park Service , not from the D.C. Police , nor the Fire Department , etc .
In fact , a Fire Department spokesman that I talked to told me that whoever had given a figure of 60,000 - 70,000 to ABC
News had not been authorized to do so .
So there ’s no independent source to verify FreedomWorks ’ latest number .
Further balance from TPM
The rest of the article is substantively true , including the role of “ coffee260 . ”
I am always happy to correct the record ; but I will not apologize to Mrs. Malkin until she apologizes for “ nutroots . ”
She has no room to talk about the sanity of others .
Manufacturing employment in the U.S. peaked in June 1979 with 19,553,000 jobs (
data here
) , and by July of this year manufacturing employment had fallen to 11,817,000 , the lowest level of manufacturing jobs since April 1941 ( see chart above ) .
As a percent of the total labor force , manufacturing employment fell below 9 % in July ( see chart below ) , the lowest level in BLS history ( back to 1939 ) .
Blizzard offered a day - long hands - on demo of StarCraft II : Wings of Liberty , the first chapter in the StarCraft II trilogy .
We played about a third of the game and we'd like to tell you about it — minus the spoilers .
Advertisement
While there was n't much in the way of massive story revelations in what we played — we were just getting access to some of the Terran vehicles by the end of our demo — there are some key characters that spoiler - phobic StarCraft fans may want to experience only for themselves .
That 's what this post is for .
Feeling brave ?
Then read our full , potentially spoiler - laden in - depth write - up of StarCraft II : Wings of Liberty , just watch out for details on who said what , who 's killing who , and details on some of Jim Raynor 's new pals .
If you 'd like to keep it plot - point free , read on for our abridged impressions and a blow - by - blow account of our time at Blizzard .

StarCraft II : Wings of Liberty opens in a bar .
Rendered in real - time , the opening cinematic starts intimately , with Jim Raynor drinking alone , his only company a Zerg skull mounted on the wall behind him and a jukebox that plays two kinds of music — country and Western .
All the songs seem to be about drinking or the having Zerg blues .
There may be a fly or two on the wall .
He 's at a run down watering hole , Joey Ray 's , watching the news .
He 's the subject of that night 's intergalactic newscast .
He sneers at the screen , happier to be boozing .
In between Jim 's monologue and the broadcast , the player can interact with portions of Joey Ray 's bar , anything that glows with a bright outline when moused over .
Have a drink .
Listen to music .
Reflect on the previous Zerg war by clicking on the mounted Hydralisk skull .
Interact with old friends who might stop by .
Or click on the nearby cork board , see a bit of history on the Terrans .
Advertisement
That mechanic gives StarCraft II 's single - player campaign a bit of an adventure game feel , even if most of what the game offers during these moments is atmosphere and small doses of narrative .
These moments replace the talking head intermissions from the original StarCraft .
And thankfully , as these moments in Joey Ray 's and , later , on board the Battlecruiser Hyperion , make StarCraft II feel less like a cycle of missions and briefings , and something more interactive .
Advertisement
From Joey Ray 's bar and the bridge of the Hyperion , Raynor and his allies are briefed on whatever mission they face next .
Some are missions of mercy , some are simply to refresh Raynor 's bank account .
All of those mission briefings are directed well , with expert voice over work and attention to detail , like the spot - on lip synching .
Those early missions are simple .
Most are an introduction to the world of StarCraft II , its units and its technology .
It starts off small , with Raynor controlling a small squadron of Marines , but it quickly grows .
Raynor adds Firebats , Medics , Marauders , Hellions and more to his arsenal , adding new units mission - by - mission .
Advertisement
Those missions range from guarding a small group of refugees , to building out and defending a large Terran base , to mining a lava - scorched planet , its previous mining colony leaving behind mineral - rich deposits .
Blizzard is mixing up those missions with secondary objectives and level - specific achievements , usually about three per chapter .
These include completely wiping out a Zerg infestation while following a convoy and finishing missions on hardcore levels of difficulty .
Many are easy to accomplish on a first play through .
Others will require serious dedication and frequent quick saves .
Advertisement
Missions also make Raynor money , which can be spent on new technology .
Many Terran units and buildings have two available upgrades that can be purchased in the Hyperion 's armory .
These include things like the ability to research Stimpacks — permanently — for your Marines and Marauders , and a fire suppression system that prevents Terran buildings from catching fire and slowly destroying themselves .
Speaking of infantry , fans of the original StarCraft 's amusing sound bites delivered by click - harassed units will be well served .
There are some great one - liners here , but some of those bits of dialogue seem to be recycled from the original games .
Advertisement
In the Hyperion 's armory , you 'll have access to plenty of units , technology and buildings that did n't make the multiplayer cut .
This makes StarCraft II 's single - player campaign much more than a series of mission - based levels using multiplayer style rules .
( For a list of every upgrade that we saw during our playthrough at Blizzard , refer to this post . )
Advertisement
Beyond the bridge and armory , the Hyperion has two additional areas players can visit .
Advertisement
The ship 's lab and cantina present other opportunities to make and spend money , respectively .
Blizzard 's Dustin Browder says that the lab portion of the ship is still undergoing some refinement .
Browder did n't sound too thrilled with the current implementation of that section of the ship , saying that the reconnaissance and research missions just were n't that much fun yet .
We would n't know .
Those mission were locked out of our demo .
All we could do in the lab was chat with the pimply faced scientist Stetmann and review research objectives .
These were just cash - in opportunities to learn more about Zerg evolution or Protoss shield technology .
These side missions may offer some variety and an injection of funds , but we wo n't know what they 'll look like for a while .
Advertisement
The last section of the ship , the cantina , is multi-faceted .
You 'll be able to catch up on intergalactic news , chat with the NPC crew of the Hyperion , ogle holographic strippers , play games and hire mercenaries .
The cantina is home to a mercenary agent , hiring special units that you can deploy once per mission .
Advertisement
Those mercs , which come at a cost , obviously , are somewhat like the hero units Blizzard introduced in Warcraft III .
More powerful than your stock infantry unit , they can be deployed from the structure at which you 'd normally build a Marine , Marauder or Firebat .
These extra strength " elite " soldiers are good to have around , as they can help fortify a budding squadron .
Based on the seven missions we played , the proceeds Raynor nets from completing a mission usually amounts to two to three technology upgrades or the hiring of mercenary squad and one upgrade .
Some of the game 's greedier missions earn Raynor 's team more money than the more charitable ones .
Advertisement
Fortunately , both the materialistic and merciful missions are a hell of a lot of fun .
One section that we played consisted of Raynor 's forces trying to earn as much cash as quickly as possible .
Farming for minerals and gas is n't the draw here , it 's the defense against regular waves of enemies and the cyclical flooding of the planet with lava .
Add to that the fact that players must be mindful of their own spending — all those minerals go into one pool of funds — and the multi- tasking required gets , well , about as fun as multi-tasking gets .
Advertisement
Another change to the standard formula was a spooky night and day cycle that had us on the hunt for enemies during the day , retreating to base at night , as hordes of enemies would attack only after dark .
Throughout these missions , Blizzard spices up the action with unique , single - player campaign - only units , just for fun .
Advertisement
We racked up about 7 hours of play time with StarCraft II : Wings of Liberty , revisiting some missions on harder difficulties , some just to satisfy a completionist itch .
Reaching that mark put us about a third of the way through the single - player campaign in terms of mission count — there were 26 missions mentioned in the build we played .
But in terms of how that ultimately plays out in terms of what one can do in single - player , when including splitting story arcs , research missions in the lab and replaying levels on higher difficulty for extra achievements , remains to be seen .
StarCraft II 's single - player mode looks meaty , far more robust in terms of scope and presentation than what we were expecting .
Advertisement
StarCraft II 's units and structures feel much more broad in their scope than what we 've seen in the game 's multiplayer mode — all those upgrades would be nothing short of impossible to balance .
It 's clear that Blizzard is heavily investing in both single and multiplayer for Wings of Liberty .
The storytelling in the Terran campaign is expert , with plenty to dig deep into should players want to hear every single word of spoken dialogue , through which bits and pieces of backstory are delivered .
The decision to split StarCraft II into three separate campaigns was , obviously , concerning .
But the amount of content that Blizzard appears to be packing into the first third of that trilogy allays most of those concerns .
There 's an incredible amount of game here .

Now we just want to see how they 're going to do this for the Zerg .
Do they even have bars ?
A father was hacked and beaten to death in front of his heavily pregnant wife — who gave birth the next day — and seven - year - old daughter , a jury has heard .
Belfast Crown Court also heard allegations that Julia Mongan pleaded with masked men to stop attacking her husband John Mongan “ but they ignored her and continued with the beating ” .
Denying the murder are Londonderry men 34 - year - old Christopher Stokes , Edward Gabriel Stokes ( 38 ) and a 16 - year - old boy who can not be identified because of his age .
The three also deny causing criminal damage to a Mitsubishi Shogun jeep owned by Mr Mongan and Edward Stokes denies a further charge of wounding Mrs Mongan with intent to cause grievous bodily harm , with all the offences dated on February 7 last year .
Opening the case , prosecuting QC Gordon Kerr said Mr Mongan was beaten to death in his Fallswater Street home in west Belfast after a gang of four men burst into the bedroom .
He told the jury the main Crown witness would be Mrs Mongan .
Speaking as a number of female relatives of Mr Mongan cried in the packed public gallery , where the two families were kept apart by up to 10 uniformed police officers , Mr Kerr outlined how the pair had been married for 10 years , had three children but suffered the tragedy of one dying as an infant and had another child on the way .
On the day before he was killed , Mr Mongan had gone down south to see about buying a van .
Mr Mongan got back just before 1 am and soon joined his wife in bed but the pair were soon awoken by the front door being smashed open and heard male voices shouting “ get up , where are you ?.
“ Her evidence will be that she recognised one voice as being the voice of Christopher Stokes , ” claimed the lawyer , adding that he was a cousin to Mrs Mongan and had known him since she was a child .
Mr Kerr told the jury there had been “ bad blood ” between Mr Mongan and the Stokes ' so when she heard the voices , she thought they were there “ to give John a beating ” .
As she closed their bedroom door , Mrs Mongan heard another voice she recognised as belonging to Edward Stokes , another cousin of hers , before there was a “ thud ” at the door .
“ A hatchet came through the door , ” said Mr Kerr , “ she was terrified and tried to move the bed to the door to stop it opening ” adding that she shouted she was due to have a baby “ but that did n't deter them in any way ” .
It is the Crown case , said Mr Kerr , that Christopher Stokes was the first man through the door and that he struck the first blow with a hatchet , hitting Mr Mongan on the shoulder and felling him , after which he never got up .
He claimed that Edward Stokes was next through , armed with a baton , followed by the teenager , who appeared to have a baseball bat .
As the men rained blows on him with their weapons , Mrs Mongan continually begged them to stop , but her husband remained silent throughout , never uttering a word , said the lawyer .
As the attack carried on , the lawyer said , Mrs Mongan got the impression there was another man standing outside the bedroom door and added that at one stage , her seven - year - old daughter came out of her bedroom “ and was able to see this brutal attack on her daddy ” .
When the men left , Mrs Mongan went to follow them out to make sure they did not go into her children ’s bedroom but as they walked out , Edward Stokes allegedly hit her on the head and shoulder with whatever weapon he had , before he was pushed away by the teenager who said “ do n't be hitting her ” .
Parked outside the house was Mr Mongan 's Mitsubishi Shogun 4x4 jeep and the gang attacked it , smashing in the windows and beating the panels before a total of four men , as one neighbour described , walked away and sped off in an Isuzu Trooper jeep .
Mr Mongan 's body was examined by Assistant State Pathologist Dr Ingram , who said that his death had been due to multiple cuts and stab wounds .
Among the numerous injuries he suffered , Mr Mongan had received cuts and stab wounds to his left shoulder and chest , the left side of his abdomen and left arm , his thumb was partially severed and there was a cut to his scalp which was so deep the skull was visible .
The result of the injuries , said Mr Kerr , would have been “ torrential bleeding ” and many of the wounds were caused by a bladed implement such as a knife , machete , axe or hatchet .
The lawyer claimed that as well as being identified as the attackers by Mrs Mongan , Edward Stokes was allegedly linked to the attack by a blood - stained shirt , recovered from the washing machine at his Cornfields home in Derry which , on being examined , contained the DNA profile of Mr Mongan on a small blood smear which was on the lower back of the garment .
Arrested at a house in the Glengalia area of Derry , Christopher Stokes , said Mr Kerr , could be shown to be linked to a mobile phone which was in Derry on the evening of February 6 but which cell - site analysis showed had travelled to west Belfast at the time of the attack and then left , travelling to Kesh and then back to Derry .
The trial , set to last up to two months , continues .
At hearing .

Robert Spencer Video : Reclaiming American History From the Left
Why it 's so urgent for every American to become well - versed in American history .
There are so many apps available for the iPhone , one might even say there are a plethora .
We would like to take a moment to help you find a few that might help with your hacking projects .
Ever have problems remember a formula when you need it ?
Need to track the acceleration of your brand new rover ?
How about beginners needing help remember resistor codes .
Well , there ’s an app for that .
Check out our suggestions after the break .
Here at Hack A Day , we are strong believers in frugality .
We think most hackers are .
With that in mind , lets start off with our recommendations of free applications to get the job done .
These are in no particular order .
The iPhone camera :
Not only is this free , its already on your iPhone .
yeah , we know its not a great camera , but it is indispensable .
Taking apart a project ?
Snap some pics along the way so you can refer back to them when you reassemble .
Project ready for testing ?
Document it quickly and easy with pictures .
Project burst into flames on the tarmac ?
Snap a pic for posterity .
We love the camera .
Electrical toolkit :
Even the most experienced hackers need a little help sometimes .
Need to find the SCR Firing angles this app can help with that .
Electronics toolkit : Another app meant to help us find the missing pieces to a circuit .
This one has some different circuits than the Electrical toolkit above .
i Resist : Maybe you never committed the resistor codes to memory , or maybe you ’re a beginner just learning .
Either way , this appears to be a pretty useful application .
Simply select the appropriate colors and it will tell you the value of your resistor .
ResistorCode : Another resistor code application .
This one has the ability to do up to 6 band resistors .
We listed both because some people really have a preference between the text selection or color selection .
We like the more robust feature set of this one .
LED resist :
Who has n’t been left scratching their head when wiring LEDs ?
This handy little app will help you figure out what resistance value is needed to keep those LEDs functioning optimally .
Runkeeper free : Runners have been raving about this one for a while now .
It will track your time , distance , GPS location , and speed .
You can view your path on a google map .
We ’re not exactly sure what project would merit this , but it just seems perfect for tracking rovers or measuring experimental vehicle performance .
Though we do love the free applications , sometimes things just merit a little payment .
We really only found 2 apps that we thought could be useful enough to pay for when it comes to hacking .
Formula Pro :
We do n’t care how l337 of a hacker you are .
You simply ca n’t know everything .
This application is a compendium of the most common formulas needed for Engineering , Optics , Thermodynamics , Electronics and much more .
There are over 680 formulas out of the box , with features like the ability to modify and save formulas or even add your own .
At 1.99 , this is a steal .
Accelleration 3d detector :
This feature rich acceleration detector will log and chart in 3d your acceleration information .
You can even download the results to your computer for inspection .
Though we have concerns about the destruction of our iPhone , this just seems like it would be a great tool in a pinch for finding out some acceleration data .
Lastly , we understand that no project goes perfectly .
Sometimes you are so frustrated and your brain is so fried , you just ca n’t function .
It is times like these that Bubble Snap comes to the rescue .
There are no rules , just the soothing pleasure of popping bubble wrap .
Careful though , your kids or significant others might get addicted to this one and steal your phone .
Well , those are our favorites .
What do you use ?
Did we miss any ?
The iPhone is supposed support accessories with the latest iteration , are there any must have accessories for the hacker ?
WASHINGTON -- A group of American Indians who find the Washington Redskins ' name offensive wants the Supreme Court to take up the matter .
The group late Monday asked the justices to review a lower court decision that favored the NFL team on a legal technicality .
The seven Native Americans have been working through the court system since 1992 to have the Redskins trademarks declared invalid .
A U.S. Patent and Trademark Office panel ruled in their favor in 1999 , but they 've since suffered a series of defeats from judges who ruled that the plaintiffs waited too long to bring their suit in the first place .
A lawyer for the group says he'd like to see the court decide once and for all whether the Redskins name defames Native Americans .
Child bride , 12 , dies in Yemen after struggling to give birth for THREE days
A 12 - year - old Yemeni child bride died after struggling to give birth for three days , a local human rights organisation said .
Fawziya Abdullah
Youssef died of severe bleeding on Friday while giving birth to a stillborn in the al - Zahra district hospital of Hodeida province , 140 miles west of the capital Sanaa .
Child marriages are widespread in Yemen , the Arab world 's poorest country which has a population of 23 million , where tribal customs dominate society .
More than a quarter of the country 's females marry before age 15 , according to a recent report by the Social Affairs Ministry .
The issue of child brides came to prominence in the country two years ago when ten - year - old Nujood Ali ( pictured ) went by herself to a courtroom and demanded a judge dissolve her marriage to a man in his 30s
Youssef was only 11 when her father married her to a 24 - year - old man who works as a farmer in Saudi Arabia , said Ahmed al - Quraishi , chairman of Siyaj human rights organization .
Al - Quraishi , whose group promotes child rights in Yemen , said that he stumbled upon Youssef in the hospital while investigating cases of children who had fled from the fighting in the north .
' This is one of many cases that exist in Yemen , ' said al - Quraishi .
' The reason behind it is the lack of education and awareness , forcing many girls into marriage in this very early age . '
Impoverished parents in Yemen sometimes give away their young daughters in return for hefty dowries .
There is also a long - standing tribal custom in which infant daughters and sons are promised to cousins in hopes it will protect them from illicit relationships .
Al - Quraishi said there are no statistics to show how many marriages involving children are performed every year .
The issue of child brides vaulted into the headlines here two years ago when Nujood Ali , aged ten , went by herself to a courtroom and demanded a judge dissolve her marriage to a man in his 30s .
She eventually won a divorce , and legislators began looking at ways to curb the practice .
In February , parliament passed a law setting the minimum marriage age at 17 .
But some lawmakers are trying to kill the measure , calling it un -Islamic .
Before it could be ratified by Yemen 's president , they forced it to be sent back to parliament 's constitutional committee for review .
Such marriages also occur in neighboring oil - rich Saudi Arabia , where several cases of child brides have been reported in the past year , though the phenomenon is not believed to be nearly as widespread as in Yemen .

If you listen to Apple , pretty much all they did for the Finder in their latest OS was rewrite it using the Cocoa frameworks ( oh , and report hard drive size differently ) .
But they tend to dwell less on just what the Finder gained from all that rewriting .
File Icons As Big As Your Screen Used To Be
The file icons in Snow Leopard can be bigger than the original Mac ’s screen .
Consider that for a minute .
This icon for the System folder in Snow Leopard is larger than the entire screen of the original line of Macs .
To put the two into perspective , they ’re shown below full - size with the Mac ’s 512 x 342 desktop on top of a Snow Leopard 512 x 512 icon .
Wow .
We see proof of how far we ’ve come in computing every day , but for some reason this one kind of blows me away :
You can preview these large icons .
For example , you can scroll though a PDF page by page , or even play a movie .
With sizes this large it ’s actually workable .
However , when I want to preview something I use the excellent QuickLook , which opens an even bigger window .
For me , the larger icons ( and slider in each window to control them ) have other purposes .
For example , they ’re perfect when browsing through a folder full of images .
Sure , you could use QuickLook there , too , but it ’s a little clumsy just for random browsing .
Much better to make the icons a big size — kind of like a photographer ’s light table — and scroll through them , as below :
In case you ’re wondering , those are 224 x 224 icon sizes .
Previously , the highest you could go was 148 which was n’t large enough sometimes , forcing you into QuickLook .
However , at the larger size it ’s easy to distinguish them , so now a selection can be made ( if necessary ) for more detailed viewing via QuickLook or an app .
I go though lots of images for this blog , and I already find this feature great .
For another Finder feature , notice the above window has the toolbar and sidebar neatly hidden .
Just a click on the “ pillbox ” in the upper right of the title ( or Command - Option - T ) takes care of that .
Do again and the window ’s back to normal .
Saved From The Trash
Classic Mac OS used to have this , and Windows has it , so I ’m only dwelling on the new Put Back feature in the Trash because it ’s one of those things that , simple as it seems , I believe they had to dig into the OS to add .
Without a rewrite this likely does n’t happen .
The same is true for the improved disc eject , where the Finder is now kind enough to tell you what app has a hold of the drive you ’re trying to get rid of .
Apple said addressing this required getting “ deep ” into the OS , and only a rewrite was going to make it possible .
By the way , no keyboard command for Put Back is listed , but it has one .
It ’s the same as the one that put the file in the trash to begin with : Command - Delete .
The Finder on Speed
There are no screenshots or benchmarks that do this justice .
You ’ll just have to see ( and feel ) it for yourself .
But the 64 - but rewrite of the Finder brings much speed to the interface .
Icon previews — even in the new larger sizes — draw much faster than before .
File operations , windows openings , and stacks draw faster than ever .
It ’s very noticeable , so much so that when you move to a Leopard box after only a day you begin to feel that OS is slow .
The Finder is Stacked
I looked forward to the navigation of Finder stacks perhaps as much as any other feature of Snow Leopard .
The good news is I love it , though it ’s not without a downside for me .
The good news is obvious , many times I do n’t want to go to a Finder window , but would rather just keep navigating the stack .
Previously , if you clicked a folder the Finder window opened and you were on your own .
Now , it opens up in the stack and you can just keep navigating .
An arrow in the upper left corner takes you back up the hierarchy .
I love this .
The bad news is , well , sometime I wanted to open a Finder window , and now I ca n’t easily do so .
For example , consider this stack :
You can see by the arrow at the top left that I got here via stack navigation , which is good .
But now I want to open the “ _Blog Potential ” folder in the Finder .
If there were a keyboard shortcut ( say , Option - click ) , that would be great .
But there ’s not .
What I have to do is click the folder ( opening it in the stack ) , scroll to the bottom , and then click Open in Finder .
Alternatively , I could Command - click it , which opens the enclosing folder in the Finder with the clicked folder highlighted , and double - click it .
Either way it ’s more clicks or scrolls than I ’d like .
Apple , please provide a keyboard - click in stacks to avoid either of these options .
The above does n’t spoil stack navigation for me .
I ’d much rather have it than go back .
But it does put a damper on the process .
I also wish I had some control of icon size in the stack ’s grid view .
They were shrunk quite a bit in Leopard to show as much as possible .
Since Snow Leopard can scroll , I guess Apple felt they may as well make them huge .
I ’d rather make them a bit smaller , especially since I have a 13 ” MacBook and it does n’t fit that many on one stack “ page ” .
Other Niceties
I love that the Finder has more control over file searching now .
Why go to a folder and do a search when the Finder could n’t start there ?
Well , now it ’s your call .
Set the new option to Search the Current Folder and you ’re all set .
If you invoke a search from a folder that ’s where it will begin to search .
And once the Finder has found your stuff , you can change the order in which it ’s displayed .
After a find is completed , the View / Arrange menu lists multiple options , each with a keyboard shortcut .
Finally .
Further , a preexisting or saved search can now have the view setting changed like any other Finder folder , and those setting will be retained .
I have a saved search for recent image files , and it ’s great now to always have it in the order and icon size I want .
Finally , if you drag everything out of a Finder sidebar category , the heading itself is smart enough to disappear .
A nice touch .
You Ca n’t Be Done , What About the Dock and Exposé ?
Actually , I am done .
This article is long enough .
Besides , I want to write about the Dock , Exposé ( and Spaces ) in their own article to point out the great window and workspace management they provide , and how it ’s enhanced in Snow Leopard .
That ’ll be the next article in my Discover series .

Apparently we do not know what 's normal anymore A survey suggests the vast majority of those who are obese do not realise they are so .
How is this possible amid what some see as saturation coverage of the nation 's burgeoning bellies ?
The poll , carried out by YouGov for Slimming World , found just over a quarter of 2,000 people questioned had measurements which would place them squarely in the obese camp .
But only 7 % of those asked classified themselves as so .
Over half of those deemed morbidly obese believed they ate a healthy diet , while more than a third of the overweight said they had never tried to shed the pounds .
The findings appear to be fresh evidence of a phenomenon that health professionals have long suspected : as those around us get fatter , our perceptions of our own size change accordingly .
Meanwhile pictures of children too fat to toddle or the adults so large they need to be hoisted from his house have transformed obesity into a freak show rather than a shared problem .
You 're bigger than me Many have found solace in the suggestion that Marilyn Monroe was apparently a size 16 : sadly dress sizes have changed dramatically down the decades as our bodies have grown , and those who can squeeze into a size 8 today would not have been able to do so in 1940 .
These figures do suggest that the discrepancy has widened with worryingly few people recognising their weight is potentially harmful to them
Dr Ian Campbell
Weight Concern
While our life expectancies have increased at the same time as our weight , the consensus now is that cases of diseases such as diabetes and even cancer could be reduced if everybody strove to be within the " normal " Body Mass Index ( BMI ) range .
But our perceptions of normal have changed .
" In my view there is a very clear tendency for individuals with obesity to feel that they do not stand out from the crowd , " says Jonathan Pinkney , a consultant in endocrinology and diabetes from the Association for the Study of Obesity ( ASO ) .
BODY MASS INDEX Calculated by dividing weight in kilograms by height in metres squared Normal : 18.5 - 24.9 Overweight : 25 - 29.9 Obese : Above 30
Calculate your BMI " This is because the median BMI has increased so much .
For example , if some 4 % of women now have a BMI of more than 40 , then arguably you need this sort of BMI to begin to look obviously obese when you walk down the street .
" That may be one reason why self - reported obesity underestimates its true prevalence . "
The focus on the extreme in television documentaries about the very large but also in the pictures that are chosen to illustrate articles about obesity have also been held up as another potential culprit .
" If you see people with BMI of over 50 , say , and you have a BMI of 40 then you may well think you are n't too bad , " says Dr Krystyna Matyka of the University of Warwick Medical School .
Not my baby Studies have also started to document a particular problem among parents in identifying weight issues among their children : Australian research recently found half of parents thought their child of average weight when in fact they were overweight .
Everybody knows obesity is a problem for the nation , but they do n't accept it 's a problem for them
Dr Susan Jebb
MRC
But professionals also note the picture is a complicated one .
While large may be becoming the norm , the fat - and particularly children - are often seen as a legitimate target for abuse .
" All the discussion around overweight children is so negative that it is not surprising parents find it difficult to acknowledge there is a problem .
It 's a defence mechanism , " says Dr Susan Jebb of the Human Nutrition Research Laboratory of the Medical Research Council .
" We need to get to a point where we can talk about this in a measured way .
" Everybody knows obesity is a problem for the nation , but they do n't accept it 's a problem for them - as this latest survey shows .
We need to give people the confidence to recognise that it is problem , and that it 's one they can do something about . "

Earth Impact by an Asteroid : Prospects and Effects
In the past two decades , the topic of an asteroid impacting Earth has become very popular for various reasons , including :
The theory that an asteroid impact led to the demise of the dinosaurs
Scientific recognition of additional asteroid impact sites and other evidence of Earth impacts in ancient times
The movies Deep Impact and Armageddon , plus some other dramatic videos
Probes to asteroids and comets by NASA and other space agencies , which return photos for the general public ( and data )
Promotional campaigns for asteroid detection programs , including to the US Congress which funds them
With better telescope coverage , the discovery of asteroids which make close approaches of the Earth , and news thereof
Occasional meteor sightings , which get better coverage on the internet Impact of Earth by an asteroid would be sensational and possibly cataclysmic .
Many people think this is the worst thing which could possibly happen to civilization .
However , they 're most probably wrong .
A far more probable , as well as much more devastating , threat is by simply the advance of human military or commercial biotechnology regarding superviruses and some other agents which could wipe out millions or billions of people , and possibly make humans extinct , as covered on another website of mine , www.GainExtinction.com ( where I hardly even mention asteroid impact , as I do n't consider them an extinction risk , just a cataclysm ) .
The solution to both problems -- human extinction risks as well as asteroid impact threats -- is to develop the resources of outer space for human colonization as well as planetary defense , which means utilizing the asteroids for their resources .
Awareness of the risks of advancing biotechnology and nanotechnology are at about the same stage now as the threat of asteroids was in the 1980s , but the risks of biotechnology are sure to eventually be recognized and pass the perceived threat of asteroid impact within the next decade .
In history up to the 1970s , there was little interest in asteroids , including near Earth asteroids .
They were considered low class astronomical objects .
Indeed , the small comet which destroyed hundreds of square kilometers in remote Tunguska , Siberia , in 1908 was an event little known to the general public .
In the 1970s , things started to change .
A small but increasing number of astronomers interested in asteroids began to realize the abundance of asteroids which passed close to Earth , by instituting processes to catalog asteroids accidentally seen on telescopic plates and previously not recorded ( in most cases ) but seen as a nuisance , as discussed in the PERMANENT section on discovering and cataloging asteroids .
Theoretical models , assisted by computer calculations , revealed that the gravity of the planets caused a sizeable number of asteroids from the Main Belt between Mars and Jupiter to cascade down into lower orbits approaching or crossing Earth's .
Further , a significant fraction of comets passing through the inner solar system would be diverted into orbits near Earth due to gravitational encounters with the inner planets .
As a result of these discoveries , the estimated numbers of near - Earth objects ( NEOs ) dramatically expanded by about 1000 times !
Scientists started to take note and interest .
Ever improving U.S. Defense Dept. sensor technology looking for the satellites of adversaries recorded a surprisingly high frequency of asteroid viewings as well as meteor fireballs hitting Earth 's upper atmosphere , the latter greatly augmented by sound sensors listening for the booms of nuclear tests .
Part of this process was discriminating between satellites and distant asteroids seen , and nuclear tests vs. meteor fireballs heard .
New telescope technology ( CCDs ) emerging around 1990 increased the discovery rate of all asteroids and confirmed the above theory on the abundance of asteroids ( based on solid statistical sampling rates ) .
In fact , the latest estimates project that there are about 300,000 near - Earth asteroids over 100 meters in diameter .
Approximately 1000 near Earth asteroids of size 1 kilometer in diameter have already been found , though the total is not expected to be more than 20 % over this amount .
Smaller asteroids are much more difficult to detect .
The cutoff size of what could cause major damage to Earth , such as a tsunami or an airburst , is difficult to state because it depends upon what the asteroid is made of , e.g. , a metal asteroid vs. a soft one .
Some sources put it at about 150 meters .
A 10 meter asteroid can produce an explosion with approximately the same power as the nuclear bomb at Hiroshima , but that would occur very high in the atmosphere where it would be harmless .
If a hard asteroid of size 200 meters hit the ocean ( which covers 70 % of the Earth ) , the tsunami ( i.e. , giant wave ) it would create would inflict catastrophic destruction of coastal cities and substantial worldwide human casualties along coastlines .
If an asteroid of size 1 kilometer hit Earth , it would cause a dust cloud which would block out sunlight for at least a year and lead to a deep worldwide winter , exhausting food supplies .
The latter is what caused the dinosaur extinction , as well as other major extinctions of smaller creatures in geologic time scales .
The 200 meter asteroid hits , which are far more common than the 1 km + hits , would n't show up much in geologic histories on a global scale .
In the general press , too much emphasis is put on the big , 1 km size asteroids like the one that killed off the dinosaurs , which are unlikely to hit Earth for hundreds of thousands of years , if not millions of years .
Too little coverage is given on the small asteroids which could cause terrible local destruction ( e.g. , to nearby coastal cities ) but little worldwide impact , and which probably hit once per few hundred years .
Our best telescopes can hardly see the 100 meter asteroids because they 're so small , and many are dark .
The Tunguska , Siberia asteroid of 1908 An asteroid hit Tunguska , Siberia on June 30 , 1908 .
It was a tiny asteroid , only about 30 to 60 meters across , i.e. , difficult and unlikely to be detected by even the most modern ground - based telescope in existence today , given their necessarily selective partial coverage of the sky , and between 10,000 and 100,000 tons in mass .
The Tunguska event was caused by a volatile rich asteroid which exploded due to heating during reentry .
Fortunately , the asteroid was just grazing the Earth and did not come straight down , causing a long streak in the sky seen over many territories , and was packed with volatiles rather than nickel - iron metal .
It exploded in the air about 5 kilometers ( 3 miles , or 15,000 feet ) above remote Tunguska .
However , the energy released was equivalent to a nuclear bomb .
In fact , the explosion was greater than the Hiroshima or Nagasaki nuclear bombs .
The forest was flattened , out to about 30 kilometers ( 18 miles ) from the center .
Below the explosion , trees were incinerated , though some remained standing -- just like at Hiroshima and Nagasaki .
Trees were scorched on one side out to 14 kilometers ( 9 miles ) from ground zero .
About 200 kilometers ( 120 miles ) away , carpenters were thrown off of a building from the shock wave , and shelves were emptied .
At 100 kilometers , an eyewitness reported " the whole northern part of the sky appeared to be covered with fire ...
I felt great heat as if my shirt had caught fire ... there was a .. mighty crash ... I was thrown onto the ground about [ 7 meters ] from the porch ... A hot wind , as from a cannon ...
Many panes in the windows [ were ] blown out , and the iron hasp in the door of the barn [ was ] broken . "
The closest surviving observers on record were some reindeer herders asleep in their tents about 80 kilometers ( 50 miles ) from ground zero .
They were blown with their tents into the air , several of them losing consciousness momentarily .
They reported thick smoke and fog from the burning trees .
About 1,500 reindeer were killed in the area .
At 500 kilometers ( 300 miles ) observers reported " deafening bangs " and a fiery cloud on the horizon .
Large seismic vibrations were recorded 1000 km ( 600 miles ) away , and an English weathermen 3600 km ( 2200 miles ) away noted unusual air pressure waves .
However , that was a remote part of the Earth and the year was 1908 .
The stories kept coming in from that desolate cold place .
Due to the state of Russian science at the time , the remoteness of the area , and the harshness of the temperature during most of the year , it took 19 years until a group of scientists went on an expedition to study that remote site in 1927 .
What they found prompted additional expeditions , the best of which were conducted in the 1950s ( when a nearby airport was built ) , led by those scientists of the previous expedition who had survived the second world war .
What they found was a flattened forest with young saplings growing up between the fallen trees , and a layer of carbonaceous dust , round glass melts , free metal granules and elements not normally found in the crust of the Earth , adding evidence of a carbonaceous chondrite asteroid hit .
( Alternatively , some think it was a comet captured by the inner solar system whose outer volatiles had been burnt off eons ago , leaving just inner volatiles . )
It 's theorized that by grazing the Earth 's atmosphere , the volatiles under the surface of the asteroid heated up and eventually caused the asteroid to explode .
An asteroid would enter Earth 's atmosphere much faster than a re-entering spacecraft and would have practically no heat protection .
The asteroid probably had plenty of hydrogen and carbon in its interior , which was basically ignited all at once .
It 's thought that the asteroid pretty much vaporized entirely into dust and gas in the air due to the high - heat explosion .
No large chunks were found .
" [ I ] f the same object had exploded over New York City , the scorched area would have reached nearly to Newark , New Jersey .
Trees would have been felled beyond Newark ...
The man knocked off his porch could have been in suburban Philadelphia .
' Deafening bangs ' might have been heard in Pittsburgh , Washington , D.C , and Montreal . "
If instead it had been a nickel - iron asteroid and a little bit larger , and hit the ocean ( which covers 70 % of Earth 's surface ) , it could cause a tsunami wave giant enough to smash into numerous modern 20th century coastal cities with no warning .
There are n't nearly as many remote areas in the world like Tunguska , Siberia , any more due to population growth and industrialization .
Bolides : Meteor explosions and shockwaves in Earth 's atmosphere Many meteors can be detected and analyzed by sensitive sound equipment , due to their hypervelocity shock waves as well as any explosion .
For example , national defense departments monitor sound waves in order to detect things like nuclear test explosions and any incoming missiles .
While a meteor also causes a bright flash of light locally , optical measurements from the ground or satellites may be missed or incomplete , so in many cases it is better analyzed by the recorded acoustic signature .
Bolides are detected by satellites , and the visual and acoustic data can be put together for analysis .
Unfortunately , defense departments do n't always wish to reveal the capabilities of their technology .
However , non-defense entities do release information , such as the European Network ( EN ) , the Canadian Network ( CN ) and the Prairie Network ( PN ) .
Typical sizes of bolides have been estimated to range from 1.2 meters to 15 meters , with corresponding masses of 3.5 tons to 80 tons .
Meteors usually explode in the upper atmosphere , and have severe shock waves due to their hypervelocity .
Besides bolides , there is n't much else which can come close to the acoustic profile of a nuclear bomb explosion , except a large exploding volcano .
It was important to develop this technology to analyze bolides not only for intelligence purposes but also to prevent false alarms caused by bolides .
Most bolides have an explosive force in the kilotons range , but are high enough in the atmosphere to not cause damage on Earth , just creating a very bright flash and a loud bang .
Data collected by one site , the Air Force Technical Applications Center at the Patrick Air Force Base in Florida , between 1960 and 1972 was made public .
It characterized 20 explosions on 10 different dates ( some dates had multiple hits ) .
Most of the detections were within only about 5000 km ( 3000 miles ) range .
However , two bolides delivered the energy of over one megaton of TNT , which is the same as a large nuclear warhead , and over 50 times the power of the nuclear bomb dropped on Hiroshima .
( ReVelle et al. , 1996 ) Effects of impacts on Earth - different sizes , frequencies of impact
The press and Hollywood often focus on the impact of a large asteroid , say 1 km diameter .
Those kinds of catastrophic hits have dramatic impacts for all life on the planet , but are extremely rare and quite unlikely to occur in the next few thousand years .
Of much greater concern should be the Tunguska - size asteroids .
The population of asteroids of size 1000 meters ( 1 km ) or larger which cross or closely approach Earth 's orbit is thought to be about 1,200 .
We know of many of these , which is why they make the press .
They are big , so we have seen some of them with telescopes .
We know the orbits of many of them , and that they wo n't hit us in the forseeable future , at least not for many hundreds of years .
The only potential 1 km impactors would have to come from the approximately 20 % still undiscovered ( as of 2012 ) 1 km class asteroids , or else a new comet coming down .
The Meteor Crater in Arizona , measuring about a kilometer in diameter , was caused by a nickel - iron rock only about 30 meters across , which is n't all that much larger than for the largest of the bolides we 've seen over the past few decades .
That 's a very small asteroid which we could n't see from telescopes on Earth 's surface until it 's right above Earth -- when it 's much too late to do anything but duck for cover .
The reason why the asteroid penetrated the atmosphere and hit Arizona is because it was a nickel - iron asteroid , not a volatile rich asteroid , and it came almost straight down rather than near a grazing angle .
This small size of asteroid is very difficult to detect .
At the other end of the spectrum are the 1 km asteroids .
That kind of impact would wipe out life within proximity of the impact site .
However , more serious is how it would affect the whole world in indirect ways .
The dust and / or vapor cloud created by an impact to either the land or the ocean could be big enough to create a " nuclear winter " like mini-ice age , and disrupt climatological wind patterns , adversely affecting major food - growing regions of the world , thus straining world food supplies , prices , governments and civilization .
However , such an impact is quite unlikely over the next thousand years , at least .
The most damaging kind of impact would be an asteroid that hits the ocean , not the land .
An asteroid hitting land causes mainly localized damage .
An asteroid hitting the ocean can cause a tsunami ( i.e. , huge wave ) that would inflict catastropic damage to coastal cities and assets to great distances .
The Earth is covered 70 % by oceans , so an ocean impact is more likely .
Earth 's atmosphere gives protection against the vast majority of small asteroids which hit .
Asteroids hit the atmosphere at typical speeds in excess of 10 km / sec -- an average of about 20 km / sec for asteroids whose entire orbits reside within the inner solar system , with exact relative speed depending upon their angle of approach , and with speeds over 50 km / sec common for small cometary objects making a pass from the outer solar system .
At this speed , they usually break up due to severe shock pressures , and burn up due to friction with the atmosphere .
Think about it -- 10 kilometers per second ( 6 miles per second ) is awfully fast -- about 36,000 kilometers ( 22,000 miles ) per hour .
For asteroids coming in at 20 km / sec , it 's generally thought that to penetrate the atmosphere and cause major damage by tsunami , an iron asteroid must be around 40 to 60 meters in diameter , and a stony asteroid 200 meters in diameter ( Hills , 1994 , paper ref . ) .
However , a stony asteroid 60 meters in diameter can cause significant damage by airbursts ( Hills and Goda , 1993 , paper ref . ) .
The exact damage inflicted by an asteroid or comet depends upon a number of factors -- size , speed , composition of object , and whether it hits land or ocean .
For a land impact , it can be said in general that an object of roughly 75 meters diameter can destroy a city , a 160 meter object can destroy a large urban area , a 350 meter object can destroy a small state , and a 700 meter object can destroy a small country .
For an ocean impact , the destruction is much greater -- smaller objects can cause far more widespread damage .
The effects of an ocean impact are felt much further away than the effects of an airburst due to the more effective propagation of water waves , and the fact that human populations and assets are largely concentrated in coastal cities which historically became established due to water transport ( i.e. , shipping and trade ) and businesses near ports .
For example , the earthquake - induced tsunami in Chile in 1960 produced waves in Hawaii 10,600 km away of height up to over 10 meters ( 30 feet ) , and up to 5 meters ( 15 feet ) in Japan 17,000 km away with an average of 2 meters , causing heavy damages and loss of lives .
What happens with a tsunami is that when a deep water wave of , say , a third of a meter hits a continental shelf its speed decreases but its height conversely rises .
For example , the tsunami from the 1960 Chile earthquake created a deep water wave of only 20 cm ( 8 inches ) above sea level , but when it hit the shore it had risen to a height an average of ten times its ocean size -- over 2 meters ( 6 feet ) , and in some places much higher .
However , the size varies depending upon the coastal features , and was higher in many places .
Understand , this is not just a narrow surfable wave that dies down when it approaches the shore , but is a wide body of water that grows into a wall that smashes into the land .
( When the wave hits the shallow coast it slows down , and the water of the deep ocean wave behind it piles up on top to form a wall of water . )
The effects of an airburst are far more localized because the intensity of the phenomenon decreases with the inverse square of the distance in a three - dimensional way , whereas the height of a water wave decreases only with the inverse of the distance , i.e. , to the first power , due to its circular , two - dimensional nature .
The damage caused by a tsunami is due not just by a heavy wall of water hitting things , but much more due to the solid debris carried by up the powerful , churning deep water wave as it hits the continental shelf -- the solid debris rams and batters anything in its way .
The 1998 earthquake - induced tsunami in Papua New Guinea that wiped out coastal villages and killed uncounted thousands of people was only a few meters high .
If an asteroid hit the ocean , we could see a tsunami wave 100 times higher .
It 's not easy to determine the frequency of tsunamis in the world historically .
Unusual debris has been found in high places in many parts of the world which could be the result of a tsunami , though it 's not easy to determine what happened for sure and when , by the ordinary nature of the material .
There has been little effort to date to systematically assess the frequency and nature of tsunamis well before the 20th century .
Recorded history by civilizations along the Atlantic Ocean has not noted major tsunamis , though there wouldn�t be many people around to report it .
There�s not much recorded history from many coastal regions in the world , and many long coastlines were devoid of cities .
Searches for small tsunami in the geological record have mostly been started only in the 1990s .
Of particular interest are tsunami along the Atlantic coast , where earthquake - induced tsunami are rare , so that any detected tsunami would probably be due to an asteroid .
The results of these ongoing efforts will shed some light on the frequency of asteroid hits into the oceans .
A mainstream scientific analysis currently estimates that an asteroid - induced tsunami exceeding 100 meters in height along the entire coast probably occurs once every few thousand years , which slightly exceeds written history in most of these ocean coastal regions .
We 've been living on the edge for a long time now .
Such a 100 meter tsunami would cause unprecedented damage to now - developed low lying areas all along the U.S. east coast , and may totally submerge vast areas in Europe such as in Holland and Denmark .
A 100 meter tsunami would travel inland about 22 km ( 14 miles ) and a 200 meter tsunami would travel inland about 55 km ( 34 miles ) ( Hills , 1994 , paper ref . ) .
In any case , it is clear that the cost of dealing with damage due to a hit by a sizeable asteroid causing even just a small tsunami like the 1960 one could be far higher than it would cost to embark on a crash program of developing space on a large enough scale using asteroidal materials which would in turn give us the infrastructure necessary to detect and prevent impending Earth impacts -- a Rapid Deployment Force of rockets and a few people ready on standby in space , to nudge the incoming object so that it misses Earth .
Contrary to movies and popular belief , we probably would n't want to blow it up as that would cause a lot of pieces being thrown in unpredictable directions .
Nudging its trajectory a little is probably the most reliable way to make it miss Earth , and would be easier and cheaper , if we got to the asteroid long enough in advance .
Yet , we hardly even know what exists in our neighborhood , and a dedicated asteroid sentry system is needed .
Of course , such a sentry system would also discover economically attractive asteroids .
Many close encounters with Earth - approaching asteroids are found out AFTER the near - miss has already passed .
The Spaceguard Foundation
The Spaceguard Foundation is an international body officially set up by a convention in Rome and with a large number of participating government officials and professionals from around the world .
Their website gives updates to the master worldwide list of asteroids which could potentially strike Earth , though it is technically oriented rather than for the general public .
Besides asteroids in orbits near Earth 's orbit , there are also small comets that pass through the inner solar system , making one in - out double pass of Earth orbit every few centuries .
New ones are n't going to show up in the Spaceguard Foundation 's catalog because their orbit does n't reside in the inner solar system and they are n't detected or known until they come down from the far reaches of the solar system , and we generally would n't know about them until shortly before their arrival .
( This is what the movie Deep Impact had hitting the Earth . )
Looking at the entire situation , one could conclude that an early warning system is of limited use unless it comes with an interceptor system .
The latter would require a government body ( or else a high gamble by a private initiative with prices negotiated shortly before impending disaster ! ) .
Despite all the threats , the government bodies are not funding any asteroid intercept systems , and are providing only small amounts of funding for asteroid searches and cataloging potentially threatening asteroids , plus a little bit of money for paper studies into methods to deal with a threat .
Effects on satellites and space stations in low Earth orbit When comet Shoemaker - Levy impacted Jupiter in July 1994 , the event was watched by the Hubble Space Telescope .
When scientists saw the big splash of Jupiter 's atmosphere rise up like a huge atmospheric wave , many could not help but wonder what would happen to satellites and space stations in low Earth orbit if a large asteroid or comet hit Earth 's atmosphere , or even a large bolide .
With the increased data and analyses of asteroids , comets and bolides , it has been estimated that once per century an asteroid , comet or bolide will hit Earth 's atmosphere and cause a plume to rise about 1000 km up over an area thousands of kilometers in diameter ( Boslough et al. , 1996 , paper ref . ) .
Countless satellites currently operate well below 1000 kilometers up , as well as the International Space Station .
The effects on these satellites and space stations would be catastrophic if they hit the plume .
They would be travelling at 7 km/sec and could sustain physical damage .
Unless they have substantial thrust capability , they would probably be slowed down enough to fall down into the Earth 's atmosphere and burn up ... and possibly crash down onto Earth , nobody knows where .
Meteor showers
On occasion , there are meteor showers , e.g. , when Earth passes through the tail of a comet .
Many comets have tails of significant debris stretching hundreds of millions of miles behind the comet .
The chances of a satellite being impacted by a meteor can increase by a factor up to about 10,000 times during the heaviest meteor shower , the Leonids .
The probabilities are vague because we just do n't have enough data on the population density of sand and small pebbles , which are sufficient to destroy a satellite at their impact speeds .
For example , a meteor from the Perseid Meteor Stream is thought to have killed the OLYMPUS telecommunications platform in 1995 .
The largest meteor shower is the Leonids .
Of all the meteor showers chronicled over the last 1000 years , almost half were unknowingly reporting the same cause - the Leonids , which are in turn debris from the comet 55P / Temple - Tuttle , which returns to the vicinity of Earth 's orbit every 33 years .
However , the severity of the meteor shower is not always the same and is unpredictable .
When Earth passed through the tail of Comet Tempel - Tuttle in 1966 , it was near the dawn of the space age when there was n't much manmade hardware up in space .
However , photographic and radar data is available from this hit .
In fact , one measurement of meteors on November 17 , 1966 , reported 150,000 per hour ( that 's forty per second ) over a two hour period , which is by far the heaviest bombardment ever recorded .
Comet Tempel - Tuttle crossed Earth 's orbit in February 1998 and the Earth passed through its tail in November .
It was expected to be a fantastic meteor shower but instead it was remarkably very light , producing a maximum of only about 1,000 meteors per hour during a brief peak period of a couple of hours .
Satellites were lucky in 1998 , as we were spared with a surprisingly very light meteor shower .
The occurance of a meteor shower may justify vacating humans from space stations which do not have a decent level of shielding , which includes all those which exist today .
The only protection against such storms is good thick multilayer shielding , e.g. , from asteroidal materials .
Planetary defense methods
There have been many scientific analyses on alternative ways to deal with a large object on a collision course with Earth .
The methods can be split into two categories -- destruction and deflection .
( A third option is obvious -- turning it into useful products . )
Destruction means assuredly breaking up the object into small enough pieces so that none can penetrate the Earth 's atmosphere .
For example , if done by nuclear detonation , the dispersion of the fragments would mean that most pieces would miss the Earth , but some pieces could still hit Earth .
The further away the detonation , the more dispersed the pieces by the time they arrive in Earth 's vicinity .
As you can see , blowing up the object is actually a combination of destruction and deflection -- the dispersion is a sort of deflection .
The problem with destruction is the uncertainty of explosions -- success is risky .
Deflection means nudging the body so that it misses Earth .
The further away the object is from Earth , the less we need to nudge it because the change in its trajectory adds up over time .
For example , for an asteroid on a trajectory to hit the Earth in the middle ( as seen from its approach ) , we would need to deflect it a minimum of about 8000 km or 5000 miles ( since Earth has a radius of 6400 km or 4000 miles ) in the direction perpendicular to its trajectory .
If we were to land on the asteroid roughly 6 months ( 4300 hours ) before it would impact , then we would need to nudge it by accelerating it roughly 2 km / hour ( or a little over 1 mile / hour ) in a quick thrust , or about 4 km / hr ( 2.5 miles / hr ) for a slow 6 month thrust .
We 'd probably want to accelerate it even more just for the sake of safety , and would certainly want to rendevous with it further in advance if possible .
While a few km / hr speed seems small , keep in mind that we are moving mountains , not little cars .
The main problem is that we would probably have less than 6 months notice between detection time and impact , especially if the object is a comet coming in from the outer solar system at 50 km / sec .
While we have some recently scaled up search programs , they give us very little coverage of the entire sky , and they do n't detect small objects until they are close .
By small , we 're still talking about city - smashing tsunami sized objects .
If we detect an object on an impact trajectory , then we will need to make a decision on a method of planetary defense .
The method chosen will depend upon the size of the object , how soon we can rendezvous with it , what the object consists of , the rotation rate of the object , the object 's geometry , and any fractures in the object .
There would be considerable uncertainty regarding the composition of the object without a thorough on - site visit .
For analysis purposes at this point in time , models have considered objects consisting primarily of ice , friable material , gravel , hard rock and pure metal .
Most proposed methods have been rejected due to risk and economic and / or technical feasibility in the near future .
The remaining candidate methods seriously considered to date include : Blowing it up by nuclear bomb --
This option is generally unfavored because it seems unlikely that it would completely break up most objects into small enough pieces , or assuredly move all pieces into a non-impact trajectory .
It 's still considered because it is economical and technically feasible -- it might work , and it might be all we can do if given very short notice .

It 's still considered because it is economical and technically feasible -- it might work , and it might be all we can do if given very short notice .
Nudging it by nuclear bomb --
This option explodes a nuclear bomb above the surface of a volatile rich asteroid or comet to cause intense heat at the surface in order to create gas jets which would thrust it away from Earth .
Another nuclear nudge option is to chip off a piece by a subsurface explosion along an existing natural fracture -- split it into two but so that both dangerous pieces miss Earth in a straddling way ( as in the movie Armageddon ) .
The drawback to both options is the risk that it would work .
However , it very well might work , and it might be the most reasonable option if given very short notice .

Nudging it by kinetic impact --
This option simply has a sizeable object strike the asteroid or comet at high speed in order to nudge it , possibly with an explosion upon impact to enhance the effect .
This could work with small objects .
The risk is that it will fragment the target and leave a sizeable chunk on a collision course with Earth .

thrusting the object --
This option is attractive for very small objects whereby it would be feasible to launch up the required fuel propellant with a very high performance engine , or for small to medium sized objects known to be rich in water which we could extract and use as fuel propellant in a thermal rocket .
Nuclear rockets ( which use a small nuclear reactor to heat any kind of propellant ) would be preferred for their simplicity and high performance .
The advantage of thrusting is that the object wo n't be fragmented and we have more control .
The disadvantage is that it wo n't handle very large objects in a short time frame .

This has hit the popular news circuits , as a " tractor beam " .

... and many , many other techniques proposed ...
If an object were approaching Earth and we were given sufficient time , we could send out multiple missions using different techniques so that if the first mission failed , a second mission could give it a shot .
If an earlier mission fragments the asteroid , then a later mission may need to deal with a fragment on a collision course with Earth .
If it 's a large object then it could possibly fragment into multiple threats .
In all cases , the more advanced notice we have , the greater our chances for success .
Time is a critical element which can make all the difference in the world .
Telescope programs to detect near Earth objects could also use telescopes in orbit ( above Earth 's atmosphere ) to see in difficult places , such as near the horizon , and actually in all directions without regard to day or night side .
However , that 's not in the government budgets .

FOR years now , many businesses and individuals in the United States have been relying on the power of government , rather than competition in the marketplace , to increase their wealth .
This is politicization of the economy .
It made the financial crisis much worse , and the trend is accelerating .
Well before the financial crisis erupted , policy makers treated homeowners as a protected political class and gave mortgage - backed securities privileged regulatory treatment .
Furthermore , they allowed and encouraged high leverage and the expectation of bailouts for creditors , which had been practiced numerous times , including the precedent of Long - Term Capital Management in 1998 .
Without these mistakes , the economy would not have been so invested in leverage and real estate and the financial crisis would have been much milder .
But we are now injecting politics ever more deeply into the American economy , whether it be in finance or in sectors like health care .
Not only have we failed to learn from our mistakes , but also we ’re repeating them on an ever - larger scale .
Lately the surviving major banks have reported brisk profits , yet in large part this reflects astute politicking and lobbying rather than commercial skill .
Much of the competition was cleaned out by bank failures and consolidation , so giants like Goldman Sachs and JPMorgan had an easier time getting back to profits .
The Federal Reserve has been lending to banks at near - zero interest rates while paying higher interest on the reserves the banks hold at the Fed .
“ Too big to fail ” policies mean that the large banks can raise money more cheaply because everyone knows they are safe counterparties .
Telstra shares lost 14 cents , or 4.3 per cent , to close at $ 3.11 .
Telstra operates as a Universal Service Obligation , which outlines the company 's obligations to consumers , including reasonable access to standard telephone services and payphones .
If the proposed changes are adopted , the minister will have the power to '' specify the standards , terms and conditions of services , connection and repair periods , and reliability requirements of the standard telephone service ' ' .
If Telstra opts to ignore the demand , the Government will have to power to force Telstra to : - conduct its network operations and wholesale functions at arm 's length from the rest of the company ;
- provide the same price for its retail business and it does for other carriers in accessing its wholesale network ;
- implement governance structures to make the separation transparent .
Australia 's largest telco will also need to choose between holding on to some of its existing assets and gaining access to spectrum space that will allow it to provide so - called 4G services .
The draft laws will require Telstra to lose its cable network and divest its interests in the pay television arm , Foxtel .
Telstra will be prevented from acquiring additional spectrum for advanced mobile services .
It will be prevented from gaining new spectrum while it remains vertically integrated , owns a hybrid fibre coaxial cable network and holds onto its interest in pay TV operator Foxtel .
But as an incentive to Telstra to co-operate , the legislation gives the minister the right to ditch the last two requirements if the structural separation wins the approval of the Australian Consumer and Competition Commission .
New benchmarks
Under the proposals , Telstra will be subject to tough new guidelines under the threat of hefty penalties .
'' Telstra will be required to meet new minimum performance benchmarks .
Failure by Telstra to meet the requirements will expose Telstra to a civil penalty of up to $ 10 million . ''
'' The legislation also includes more stringent rules on the removal of payphones ...
Failure to comply with the new rules will expose Telstra to civil penalties or on - the - spot fines . ''
" For years industry has been calling for fundamental and historic micro-economic reform in telecommunications , " he said .
" Today we are delivering this outcome in Australia 's long - term national interest . "
The reforms would address the structure of the telecommunications market and provide Telstra with the flexibility to choose its future path .
" It is the Government 's clear desire for Telstra to structurally separate , on a voluntary and cooperative basis , " Senator Conroy said .
" The Government believes it is possible to achieve a win -win outcome in the interests of Telstra , its shareholders and , more broadly , all Australians . "
Telstra was one of the most highly integrated telecommunications companies in the world across the fixed - line copper , cable and mobile platforms , Senator Conroy said .
' Long - standing inadequacies ' '' These fundamental reforms address the long - standing inadequacies of the existing telecommunications regulatory regime .
They will drive lower prices , better quality and more innovative services , '' Senator Conroy said .
'' Unless it structurally separates , divests its ... cable network and divests its interests in Foxtel , '' Senator Conroy said .
Previous governments had failed to undertake serious reforms of the telecommunications sector , Senator Conroy said .
Loading
'' The measures in this legislation will finally correct the mistakes of the past , '' he said .
In a statement to the market this morning , Telstra said it was '' examining the detail of the reforms and will provide an update to the market as appropriate . ''
Hanging with the new flesh
“ Your reality is already half video hallucination .
If you ’re not careful , it will become total hallucination .
You ’ll have to learn to live in a very strange new world . ” – Media philosopher Brian O’Blivion in David Cronenberg ’s “ Videodrome ” ( 1983 )
So far , the bulk of gifted documentarian Ondi Timoner ’s work has dealt with the forces that persuade human beings to give up some part of themselves , whether it be in pursuit of creative growth , God , or fame .
Her latest film , takes that as far as it can possibly go .
Unlike her remarkable “ DiG ! , ” about the cultish neo- psychedelic rock band , the Brian Jonestown Massacre , or “ Join Us , ” about an actual religious cult , this time the cult is not just a few fanatics , it ’s you and me .
I first praised the Sundance Grand Jury prize - winning “ We Live in Public , ” opening Friday at L.A. ’s Nuart Theater ( with special Q& As Friday and Saturday nights ) , back in June when I saw it at the Los Angeles Film Festival .
The screening was capped off with the then somewhat surprising appearance by the documentary ’s antihero , Internet entrepreneur and self - styled conceptual artist Josh Harris .
Having returned from an idyll in Ethiopia , he said that his next project was something he called “ the Wired City ” and that , in his view , a typical human ’s life in the future is going to be something like the present day existence of “ a Purdue chicken . ”
He also said he had n’t seen the movie and was n’t sure when he would .
Back in the 1990’s , Harris made a large fortune largely by being one of the first to see the full communications potential of the web and was a dot - com era sensation via his groundbreaking web entertainment company , Pseudo .
Leaving that when his eccentric and creative side grew to be too artsy and weird for the corporate room , he then spent a good chunk of that fortune on two highly provocative experiments / art projects .
First came “ Quiet ” – basically a month - long party / community in an underground compound on the west side of New York with overt fascistic overtones .
Harris recruited roughly 100 artists and creative types to live there 24/7 for an indefinite period ( it turned out to be a month ) .
He would provide all the food , ( legal ) party favors , a firing range and plenty of weaponry ( blanks only , I ’m told ) , as well as a fake church and real interrogation tactics borrowed from the Cold War-era East German secret police .
Cameras were everywhere – bedrooms , bathrooms , and showers very much included — and it was all subject to web broadcast .
As Harris starkly put it : “ Do n’t bring your money with you .
Everything is free – except the video that we capture of you .
That we own . ”
The results were as fraught as you might imagine , though it was managed well enough that Harris says not a single lawsuit emerged , something of an achievement in 21st century Manhattan .
“ Quiet ” was followed by “ We Live in Public , ” in which Harris turned his privacy - robbing ways inward .
The net - artiste and the woman he now insists to everyone ( including me ) was his “ fake ” girlfriend , Tanya Corrin , allowed themselves to be put on web display in the most intimate fashion possible , naturally including their loft bedroom and bathrooms .
( Somewhat gruesomely , Harris added toilet bowl mounted cameras to the mix . )
Not too surprisingly the project ended with the break - up of the apparently real couple , and the near breakdown of Harris .
To make matters worse , his remaining fortune was largely evaporating in the wake of the bursting of the nineties dot - com bubble .
Cut to Tuesday , when I met with writer - director Ondi Timoner at a conference room in a Beverly Hills boutique hotel .
I was supposed to interview Harris there as well , but when Timoner reached him via cell , he turned out to be in the middle of a Hold - ‘ Em tournament at the Hollywood Park Casino in Inglewood and could n’t talk for long .
However , he volunteered that he had finally seen “ We Live in Public . ”
Timoner was naturally anxious to get his reaction , but Harris said he had yet to fully absorb the film ’s impact .
However , he liked the film ’s graphics and wished the movie would be about an hour longer .
Timoner countered that “ There ’s that weird thing where you have to make a movie 90 minutes long , ” and said there ’s be more for him on the DVD .
Poker tournaments , it turns out , are part of how the onetime web millionaire is currently getting by financially , and so rather than get in the way of his livelihood , we agreed to have a separate conversation later that day .
My conversation with Timoner , some of it sadly lost to time due to likely user error and definite unwise reliance on analog technology ( farewell , my tape recorder ) , focused on the filmmaking ’s slightly jagged , off - kilter , but very compelling approach to filmmaking — which she describes as “ written ” and storytelling oriented — as well as her interest in cults and cult - like groups .
“ It ’s really more about the followers than the leader .
With “ DiG ! , ” the question was :
What are we willing to give up to go down the road of making music ?
What kind of commitment is required that goes beyond just being in a band ?
Or in the case of ‘ We Live in Public , ’ what are we willing to give up to make a connection with a number of people — fame ?
The answer is ‘ everything ’ : our lives , our freedom . ”
Her connection to Josh Harris began in 2000 when he hired the young filmmaker to document “ Quiet . ”
Keeping a hotel room “ to keep myself sane . ”
She spent the entire month filming the events and had completed a rough cut of a documentary feature when , in the midst of his financial and emotional crisis , Harris confiscated all of the footage and , Timoner says , reneged on her fee .
The project was nevertheless revived a few years later when Harris called her back and promised to give her full creative control and 50 % of whatever take there was .
Still , she says , she was n’t fully energized about the project until she saw her first Facebook update somewhat later .
“ Someone posted , ‘ I ’m going west on the freeway . ’
I thought ‘ is there some reason I ’m supposed to know this ?
Am I am supposed to meet this person or something ? ’”
It was then that the cartoon light bulb appeared over her head and she realized , with some alarm , “ this is the future . ”
Though Timoner is an energetic woman who describes herself as personally quite upbeat , she admits that her films tend to be dark , because they are about the extreme of what human beings are willing to give up , including their very humanity .
Next up for Timoner is her dramatic filmmaking debut , to be co-produced with actress Eliza Dushku .
“ The Perfect Moment ” will be a biopic about the life of the artist Robert Mapplethorpe , whose on - the - edge work sparked a national right / left debate about censorship , homophobia , and government funding for the arts following his death in 1989 .
Nevertheless , making sure that “ We Live in Public ” gets as much distribution and exposure as possible – and a shot at what would be a well - deserved Oscar nomination — is very much top of mind .
As is the film ’s disturbing subject matter , something she ’s constantly reminded of every time she gets a new message via her very busy Blackberry .
I asked her about how it seems that , despite having such a seemingly bleak vision of the future of humanity , Josh Harris does n’t appear to be in any way trying to prevent it .
“ He ’s trying to capitalize on it . ”
She added with a metaphorical wink : “ I ’m Luke Skywalker and he ’s Darth Vader . ”
****
And so it was a few hours later than I found myself having a chat in Vader ’s lair , a guest house in an ultra-upscale portion of Brentwood , just north of UCLA … and being helped out with my recurring audio issues by a surprisingly tolerant and relaxed Mr. Vader .
Perhaps the better movie villain to compare Josh Harris to would be Prof. Brian O’Blivion , the evangelist of “ the new flesh ” – humanity merged with media — in David Cronenberg ’s “ Videodrome . ”
Even so , it ’s somewhat comforting to note that even a man whose IQ is likely significantly north of most smart people , and who saw the possibilities of the Internet decades early , can be a bit boggled by how to get an audio file off his cell phone .
( Later on I also had the pleasure of explaining via e-mail to the ‘ net pioneer how to make screen capture images from a DVD . )
As to Harris ’s reaction to the film about him , he seemed to have decided he generally was pleased with it .
On the other hand , he admitted that he was talking with friends while watching it , and it was possible he had missed more than a few things on the sound track .
“ I was more interested in which imagery she chose .
The imagery is what ’s interesting to me personally . ”
Still , it did n’t take much time to get to the one topic I knew for sure was coming .
“ There ’s only piece of the film that did n’t ring true was when Ondie did the voiceover saying that Tanya and I were in love . ”
Timoner and the vast majority of people who see the film seem to agree that Harris ’s denial of the reality of the relationship is a pretty transparent means of maintaining some emotional distance from an obviously painful episode .
When I expressed even greater skepticism when Harris explained that he ’d “ cast ” Tanya Corrin in late 1996 and dated her for the entire period up to “ We Live in Public ” in late 2000 , “ suffering ” for his art for years only to follow through on his vision for “ We Live in Public , ” Harris tried to explain it to me using references to Peter Weir ’s “ The Truman Show , ” not surprisingly a favorite film of his .
He eventually got to the heart of the matter more directly .
I think .
“ It was n’t like ‘ I ’m casting you and five years later we ’re going to be with the cameras on in the loft and fifteen years later we ’re going to be in this movie . ’
It just happened … But I certainly cast her and I certainly have proof of that casting , ” Harris said , promising to send me a link to a video which he was certain proved his point .
“ If you look at me in a certain light everything make sense .
If you do n’t [ it does n’t ] .
Virtual …real .
We ’re right at the cusp right now of the mingling of virtual and real .
Ten or fifteen years ago I understood that problem , so I did name my company ‘ Pseudo . ’
If I can prove to you the premeditation of a fake girlfriend , then you might believe that the company is named ‘ Pseudo ’ … That edge of reality and virtual is my pursuit relative to this work . ”
While I brought up the probability that the thousands of ‘ net users who tuned into the Harris / Corrin loft would never have bothered if they believed that they were seeing a partially staged relationship , we found ourseves in “ all the world ’s a stage ” territory .
It was time to move on to another topic : the mere future of mankind .
I mentioned his “ Purdue Chicken , ” line , one of many dystopian predictions Harris has made over the years .
Still , he ’s not in the position of futuristic writers of the past like Aldous Huxley or George Orwell , trying to prevent mankind from going down a perilous path — as he sees it , there ’s no point .
“ Unless the world blows up , it ’s gonna happen .
You just have to accept it .
It ’s evolution .
You can stop evolution , but you ca n’t deny it . ”
It ’s tempting to deny Harris ’s prediction as the mouthings of a wacked out genius with too much unfocused brainpower and too much energy – except that he ’s one of the very few people who saw the future of the Internet literally decades early .
“ I ’m very adept at extrapolating .
So I know what ’s gonna happen .
I ’m not guessing ….
I know this is hard to believe and all that , but all of this is hard to believe .
I can keep you harder - to - believing it until the cows come home . ”
Harris was as good as his word .
In fact , I have to admit that we wandered some what far afield discussing media and his newest project and the possible source of his next fortune , the Wired City .
It ’s a hard to describe virtual community involving home studios in which users make their own videos and share them in a set - up which sounds something like an audio-visual reimagination of Facebook , perhaps combined with a user - driven community blog along the lines of the liberal DailyKos .
I was finding all of this a bit too much fun and to an outsider , it might have looked like that scene from “ Animal House , ” with me as Tom Hulce ’s naïve freshman and Harris as Donald Sutherland ’s vaguely evil , pot-smoking professor .
Only no mind - expanding substances were involved .
Indeed , I ’m not sure what my excuse was , but Harris probably can’t help being a bit of a visionary .
Still , there ’s no denying the dark side of all this .
And , that came later that night when Harris sent me the promised link to a site belonging to a friend where I could see the video “ proof ” of the falseness of his now long - dead relationship with Tanya Corrin .
The video is a conversation between Harris and friend , Internet entrepreneur and vastly more restrained web visionary , Jason Calacanis , who figures prominently in “ We Live in Public ” and is promoting the film on his blog .
In the video , a younger Harris describes Tanya Corrin in some very unflattering terms as being an essentially hollow person and , for the life of me , he really does seem to be saying that he has been searching for someone to use in some form of art project and that Corrin will be it .
Indeed , he adds that she seems to realize there is some kind of deception going on , which sounded a lot like one of Harris ’s “ Truman Show ” comparisons .
As of this writing , the video is viewable only through a private website .
Not that it reveals or explains much , though it is somewhat disturbing .
Calacanis , if not quite approving , does n’t seem put off by a project that , assuming it ’s all true , would be cruel and deceptive .
To be fair , however , I have to add that there ’s something about Harris that sort of defies literal reading ; you do n’t want to believe he ’s entirely serious even though you know he mostly is .
On the other hand , we males sometimes tell themselves things to minimize the importance of relationships early on , only to later realize we ’ve gone the whole nine emotional yards .
Jason Calicanis , in a January 28h post on his blog , refers to Tanya Corrin as “ the love of his [ Harris ’s ] life . ”
He was there .
I was n’t .
Who am I to try and make sense of any of this ?
And , then , I thought of the strangest exchange from the previous night , in which I asked Harris about a remark that Ondi Timoner said he had thrown her off somewhat , which was that his entire life ’s work could be boiled down to “ Launder My Head , ” a two - minute CGI video Harris had made in the early nineties using a pair of augmented Amiga computers .
The animation features a group of bodies with monitors displaying their faces for heads , chanting the title and some other , vaguely creepy , words .
As recounted by Harris :
We are here to tell you , How we tell you ;
How to live ;
We are you conscience ;
We are not conscious .
Harris tried to explain how the video relates to his life ’s work .
“ I believe that , however they did it , maybe it was watching all that media or whatever , from on high , that next evolutionary force had me make that little video because that ’s them introducing themselves to us in advance . ”
Just who does Harris mean by “ them ” ?
“ ‘ Who , ’ ‘ it , ’ whatever you call it .
The singularity . ”
Does n’t that sound a little …religious ?
Is he talking about God ?
“ Whatever you want to call it .
It got downloaded , and I opened the file . ”
Make of all that , what you will , because I ’m still trying to figure it out .
But I guess I should have expected that I ’d finish this piece with more questions than I started with .
When you go down the rabbit hole , the light is going to be poor .

Anyone who has read this far and lives in the Los Angeles area really should make it down to the Nuart Theater while the highly entertaining and reasonably mind - blowing “ We Live in Public ” runs through this week .
Preferably on Friday or Saturday night when , for the first time ever in public , filmmaker Ondie Timoner and her infuriating , amoral , and oddly likable visionary subject , Josh Harris , will be discussing the film for the first time in public since he ’s seen the film .
If you ’re not in the area but still want to check out what ’s bound to be a fascinating moment , anyone who ’s interested will also be hear the discussion live via the “ We Live in Public ” website .
President Obama says he wants an honest debate over healthcare .
I would take his plea more seriously if he gave the following speech :
" My fellow Americans , today I propose a program to help those among us who , because of an existing serious illness , do not qualify for health insurance .
I do not blame insurance companies for being unwilling to write policies for existing illnesses .
Forcing the companies to cover already sick people would be wrong because it would not be true insurance .
Insurance is about future risk and uncertainty , not about past or present actualities .
Insuring against an existing illness would be like insuring against a house fire when the house is already aflame .
That makes no sense .
Insurance companies are businesses in which shareholders , among whom are people living or counting on retirement accounts , have invested to make money .
There is nothing wrong with that .
But the companies can't make money if they are forced to cover people who have never paid premiums .
" Nevertheless , such people are ill and cannot afford coverage .
They deserve our compassion and our help .
So I propose a new welfare program .
Yes , I said ' welfare , ' for reasons that will be clear .
I will recommend to Congress that everyone 's taxes be raised to create a fund from which we will pay the medical bills of those whose existing illnesses prevent them from buying health insurance .
" Why do I say that everyone 's taxes should be raised ?
Because if we as a society decide to help these unfortunate people , the burden should be spread throughout society .
As tempting as it would be , it would be wrong to impose that burden on only a few segments of the population , such as the rich or the insurance companies ' shareholders .
Everyone should make some sacrifice in this good cause . "
I would have more respect for Mr. Obama if he gave such a speech , but that does n't mean I would agree with him .
Such a program would be what 19th century French economist Frédéric Bastiat called " legal plunder " – forcibly transferring taxpayers ' money to others .
It would also create an incentive to hold off buying insurance until one got sick .
The program fails on both moral and practical terms .
The genuine alternative to the status quo is what we do not have now : the free market – that is , the elimination of all medical - business privileges , including rigged tax laws , licensing , anticompetitive insurance regulation , and patents .
We know from experience that when free markets are allowed to work , competition lowers prices , raises quality , and universalizes access .
Independent mutual - aid associations would also have a large role in a free society , as they did in the past .
Yet I 'd respect the speech outlined above because , unlike what Obama called for Wednesday night – regulations compelling insurance companies to cover preexisting conditions – the proposal would at least have the virtue of honesty .
Obama undermines his call for honest debate when he proposes to force insurance companies to administer a covert welfare program and calls it " insurance reform . "
The name , however , is not the only intellectually dishonest part of Obama 's plan .
He has promised that no one making less than $ 250,000 a year will be taxed to pay for the new medical benefits he advocates .
But in fact , middle - and working - class people would pay higher taxes .
To see this , it is important to understand that any expense imposed on people indirectly by a government program is in fact an implicit tax .
As the imagined Obama speech shows , the government could accomplish its objective by imposing an open tax .
Either way , people face costs only because of the program .
Look at healthcare : Obama 's plan to force insurance companies to cover people with preexisting conditions combined with his plan to force everyone to buy health insurance whether he or she wants it or not would impose an implicit tax on all policyholders in the form of insurance premiums that are higher than they would have been without the program .
( Some would have opted out of insurance and paid nothing . )
The rich would not be the only ones taxed , no matter what Obama says .
Implicit taxes are worse than open ones because people are unaware they are paying them .
Therefore they would not know how much Obama 's scheme truly costs .
In a supposedly free and democratic society , that is just wrong .
We should at least know how much government costs .
By relabeling welfare " insurance " and claiming that only the rich will pay for his plan , Obama misleads the American people when he talks about healthcare .
This is strange coming from someone who insists on honesty from his opponents .

September 28 , 2009 — Alderson Warm - Fork
Everyone knows that socialists think ‘ equality ’ is quite a good thing ( although some consider such talk too fluffy and just speak of ‘ abolishing classes ’ , but whatever ) .
And the ideal of equality has become a widely used motif in all sorts of areas of politics .
But often the way that it gets expressed , especially by liberals and social - democrats , makes it appear quite different to how actual socialism would mean it .
Which , since many people ’s impressions of socialism are drawn largely from such things , can then cause confusion .
So !
What are the Top 6
Ways to subtly distort the meaning of ‘ equality ’ ?
Read on to find out !
1 ) Focusing primarily on personal consumption , and not on control of production .
If people own the means of production together , and control them democratically , at least a rough equality of consumption flows naturally ; if ownership of the means of production remains in minority hands ( private business or the state ) , then inequality of consumption will be stark , regardless of how many new initiatives and reforms are introduced to reduce it .
More to the point , even if it were possible , being handed an equal slice of wealth by a power over which you have no control ( the state or the market ) is still alienating and disempowering .
2 ) Presenting only claims of need , not of right .
The people with 50 times someone else ’s wealth are not 50 times as worthy – often they are less worthy .
Everything around us has been produced by thousands of people ’s efforts , living and dead , and splitting it into the rightful property of various individuals would be impossible , and even then would not look much like the actual distribution .
People deserve equal shares not because they need them ( though that ’s not irrelevant ) but because they have as much right to it as anyone else .
3 ) Implying , by accepting any comparability with private charity , that a rich person who lets some of their wealth go to others is displaying generosity beyond the call of duty , rather than returning some of what they have usurped .
4 ) Talking as if equality was primarily for the benefit of ‘ the poor ’ , some fraction of the population who are worse off than ‘ the average ’ .
The majority of the population are dispossessed by capitalism and would benefit from equality .
5 ) Calling for ‘ redistribution ’ : if you need to redistribute , your original distribution was badly off , and will probably override whatever efforts at re-distribution you tack on .
If the distribution is broken , then change that primary distribution , so that the basic workings of the economy produce equality .
6 ) Implying that equality is something to be produced by a body standing outside the rest of society and independent of the ‘ normal ’ economy – a body thus separating itself from society being pretty close to a state already , whatever its other traits .
Obviously these are n’t entirely separate – each one connects with the others .
But I thought it might be worthwhile separating them out .
According to Carl Bialik , “ za , ” “ qi , ” and “ zzz ” were added recently to the list of official Scrabble words .
I ’m not so bothered by “ zzz ” –if somebody has two blanks to blow on this one , go for it !– but “ za ” and “ qi ” ???
I do n’t even like “ cee , ” let alone “ qat , ” “ xu , ” and other abominations .
( I ’m also not a big fan of “ aw . ” )
Without further ado , here are my suggestions for reforming Scrabble .
1. Change one of the I ’s to an O .
We ’ve all had the unpleasant experience of having too many I ’s in our rack .
What ’s the point ?
2. Change one of the L’s to an H .
And change them both to 2 - point letters .
The H is ridiculously overvalued .
3. V is horrible .
Change one of them to an N and let the remaining V be worth 6 points .
4. Regarding Q : Personally , I ’d go the Boggle way and have a Qu tile .
But I respect that Scrabble traditionalists enjoy the whole hide - the - Q game , so for them I guess I ’d have to keep the Q as is .
5 . Get rid of a bunch of non-English words such as qat , xu , jo , etc .
Beyond this , for friendly games , adopt the Ubs rule , under which , if others are n’t familiar with a word you just played , you ( a ) have to define it , and ( b ) ca n’t use it this time–but it becomes legal in the future .
6 . This brings me to challenges .
When I was a kid we ’d have huge fights over challenges because of their negative - sum nature : when player A challenges player B , one of them will lose his or her turn .
At some point we switched to the mellower rule that , if you ’re challenged and the word is n’t in the dictionary , you get another try–but you have to put your new word down immediately , you get no additional time to think .
And if you challenge and you are wrong , you do n’t lose your turn .
( We could ’ve made this symmetric by saying that the challenger would have to play immediately when his or her turn came up –that seems like a reasonable rule to me–but we did n’t actually go so far , as challenges were always pretty rare . )
Regarding points 1 , 2 , and 3 above : I know that traditionalists will say that all these bugs are actually features , that a good Scrabble player will know how to handle a surplus of I ’s or deal with a V . I disagree .
There ’s enough challenge in trying to make good words without artificially making some of the rare letters too common .
I mean , if you really believed that it ’s a good thing that there are two V ’s worth only 4 points each , why not go whole hog and get rid of a bunch of E’s , T’s , A’s , N’s , and R’s , and replace them with B ’s and C’s and suchlike ?
P.S. Also interesting is this chart showing the frequencies of letters from several different corpuses .
I ’m not surprised that , for example , the frequency of letters from a dictionary is different from that of spoken words , but I was struck by the differences in letter frequencies comparing different modern written sources .
For example , E represents 12.4 % of all letters from a corpus of newspapers , whereas it is only 11.2 % in corpuses of fiction and magazines .
I wonder how much of this is explained by “ the . ”

Fantasy stories , myths , legends , tall tales , fairy tales , horror , all these have been with us for a very long time .
Science fiction , as well , has been with us since Mary Shelley found herself in a bet with Lord Byron about the possibility of writing a new kind of horror , one not grounded in the gothic . *
So the presence in our popular culture of stories based in unreality of one form or another is certainly nothing new .
It seems to me that there ’s been a lot more of it lately , though .
I do n’t have the means to conduct the kind of thorough study we ’d need to prove the point , but a cursory examination of what ’s on television demonstrates that a good bit of our attention is being occupied by various hyper-realities .
In this TV.com list of most popular shows , at least 20 deal with the supernatural in some form .
A quick look at the networks ’ fall line - up reveals 11 non-reality - based shows .
Add to this Chuck , which will be back mid-season sometime .
That list does n’t include cable , of course .
In addition to SyFy ( or whatever the heck it ’s being called these days ) , HBO is currently burning it up with True Blood , an exceptional vampire / mystery series .
When you factor out reality and game shows , soap operas and children ’s programming , the ratio of supernatural - to - natural ( such as it is ) is quite high .
And we ’re not even including ludicrously fanciful programming that ’s ostensibly based in the plausible ( think Desperate Housewives here ) .
Now let ’s have a look at the top - grossing films of 2008 :
The Dark Knight
Iron Man
Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull
Hancock
WALL·E
Kung Fu Panda
Twilight ( 2008 / I)
Madagascar : Escape 2 Africa
Quantum of Solace
Horton Hears a Who !
And 2009 :
Transformers : Revenge of the Fallen
Harry Potter and the Half - Blood Prince
Up
The Hangover
Star Trek
Monsters vs Aliens
Ice Age : Dawn of the Dinosaurs
X - Men Origins : Wolverine
Night at the Museum : Battle of the Smithsonian
The Proposal
Beginning to notice a pattern ?
I can’t help wondering why .
Cultures behave the way they do for reasons , and studied examinations of those behaviors ( and most especially , of the culture ’s popular artifacts ) tell us a great deal about the society .
What does it love , what does it hate ?
What does it dream of , what does it fear ?
What are its dysfunctions …
In this particular case , what are we running from ?
We Are the Hollow Men
I have a theory .
Well , actually , it ’s not well developed enough to be a theory .
Or even a hypothesis , for that matter .
So let ’s just call it a question .
I recently read Affluenza , a book that sets out to examine our culture ’s pathological need for stuff .
The editor ’s review at Amazon sums it up this way :
The definition of affluenza , according to de Graaf , Wann , and Naylor , is something akin to “ a painful , contagious , socially - transmitted condition of overload , debt , anxiety and waste resulting from the dogged pursuit of more . ”
It ’s a powerful virus running rampant in our society , infecting our souls , affecting our wallets and financial well - being , and threatening to destroy not only the environment but also our families and communities .
Having begun life as two PBS programs coproduced by de Graaf , this book takes a hard look at the symptoms of affluenza , the history of its development into an epidemic , and the options for treatment .
In examining this pervasive disease in an age when “ the urge to splurge continues to surge , ” the first section is the book ’s most provocative .
According to figures the authors quote and expound upon , Americans each spend more than $ 21,000 per year on consumer goods , our average rate of saving has fallen from about 10 percent of our income in 1980 to zero in 2000 , our credit card indebtedness tripled in the 1990s , more people are filing for bankruptcy each year than graduate from college , and we spend more for trash bags than 90 of the world ’s 210 countries spend for everything .
“ To live , we buy , ” explain the authors–everything from food and good sex to religion and recreation–all the while squelching our intrinsic curiosity , self - motivation , and creativity .
They offer historical , political , and socioeconomic reasons that affluenza has taken such strong root in our society , and in the final section , offer practical ideas for change .
These use the intriguing stories of those who have already opted for simpler living and who are creatively combating the disease , from making simple habit alterations to taking more in - depth environmental considerations , and from living lightly to managing wealth responsibly .
Grist notes that in the wake of 9/11 , affluenza seems to have evolved from social disease into official policy :
In each of the past four years , more people declared bankruptcy than graduated from college .
On average , the nation ’s CEOs now earn 400 times the wages of the typical worker , “ a tenfold increase since 1980 . ”
Although the United States makes up less than five percent of the world ’s population , we produce 25 percent of all greenhouse gas emissions ; since 1950 , we “ have used up more resources than everyone who ever lived on earth before then . ”
Many of us also know that bigger houses , bigger cars , more gadgets , and more expensive clothes do not make us more content , despite the glossy promises of advertisers .
Yet consumer spending has long been used as an indicator of both the national economy and the national mood .
The more we spend , the better off we are — or so we ’ve been told .
This mantra has been particularly insistent in the past year , as the great blooming bubble of stock market riches began to deflate and the Bush administration chose instant gratification as an economic strategy .
Since Sept. 11 , national leaders have been telling us with ever - increasing urgency that consumer confidence must and will rebound .
While confidence — as an indicator of our faith in the future — should return , it ’s equally clear that the past few decades ’ rate of consumption is neither sustainable nor desirable .
Moreover , we must assume — and hope — that tragedy has made us wiser , and tempered the impulse of so many Americans to affirm their existence with a pleasing new purchase .
To be honest , reading Affluenza is one of the hardest things I ’ve done in some time .
I not only saw the moral emptiness of my society laid bare , there were entirely too many pages that described my own life .
Even in instances where I feel like I ’ve won the battle against consumerist addiction , I still had to acknowledge that once upon a time I was eaten up by a craving for material things that not only could n’t have made me whole , it would have made the hollow space even larger .
I had to slog through passages that seemed specifically written about people I know , people close to me .
Worst of all , the book flogged me relentlessly with details about how our obsessions with status and toys are annihilating the physical world that sustains us … for the moment .
Affluenza ripped at my guts in ways that brought me literally to the brink of illness .
Or maybe past the brink – I have n’t written about it before , but I ’m currently battling at least a couple of medical conditions that may ultimately be the result of affluenza .
One of them – a blood sugar issue that I ’m now taking medication for daily – is certainly a product of the American food complex .
If you drink , on average , two liters of soda a day for the better part of 25 years , how many milligrams of high - fructose corn syrup have you strained through your body ?
I ’m not blaming anybody for my stupidity , which was considerable , but let ’s not pretend that our consumption patterns exist in a vacuum , either .
The physical impact pales next to the psychological , though .
I grew up desperately seeking the sort of validation that comes with success in America , and if you are n’t careful you can fixate on all the wrong goals .
Is success a certain income level ?
Is it a house in a certain neighborhood ?
Is it the security that comes from knowing that your children have newer , cooler and more expensive basketball shoes than their friends ?
Is it a Lexus or Beemer or Mercedes ?
Is it having a certain number of people reporting to you ?
Is it the satisfaction that comes from working so many hours your wife does n’t recognize you when you come home ?
Is it the number of ulcers you have ?
Is it having a physical stress level so consistently high that your body is more or less always sick in some way ?
Affluenza made me think about the lies we tell ourselves about success .
About the “ American Dream . ”
We grow up enculterated into a consumerist assumption ( unless our parents raise us in the woods , miles from the nearest television – and then we have a whole ‘ nother set of problems ) .
At some point we realize that we ’re not happy ( although “ realize ” may be the wrong word – one thing affluenza seems to do is systematically kill off our self - awareness – in any case , we are n’t happy ) .
Everywhere we look , though , we see happy people ( these are called advertisements ) , and the happiness we see emanates from a thing .
A car , a haircut , a shirt , a house , an iPhone , a particular brand of computer … whatever it is , it ’s something that can be purchased .
So we purchase it .
And after a few minutes , we ’re not happy again .
I once watched a young boy on his first real Christmas morning .
The monetary value of the presents he had under the tree was probably triple the value of all the presents I ’d ever had under all the trees during my entire life .
He ripped into the first present – it was spectacular .
He looked at it , then put it aside and ripped into the second one .
And the third .
And the fourth , and fifth , and so on .
He never paused to play with any of them .
It was only about more , more , more .
And when there were no more , he still did n’t play with them .
The look on his face at that moment was one of profound and unmistakable disappointment .
There were no more .
I had never seen anything like it , and I was as horrified as he was unfulfilled .
That young boy has had several more Christmas mornings since then , and as best I can tell each one has been little more than a re-enactment of that first one , only with escalating price tags .
He ’s a smart kid and a very good kid in many ways , but I shudder at the hollowness that now threatens to consume his entire life .
Can I complain about the parenting decisions that have been made in this boy ’s life ?
Well , I could , but in truth the significance of the story is n’t what happened to him , it ’s that what happened to him happens millions of times a day all across our consumerist nation .
The more we have , the emptier we are .
We ’re a nation of addicts , and all the stuff that we ’re Jonesing for is a million times more addictive and destructive than crystal meth .
What Happens When We Run Out of Fantasies ?
We are the age of insubstantiation ,
a generation of digital bells ,
loose change on the sidewalk .
Our days are loops ,
our nights tight spirals ,
and if the virtual is
even better than the real thing
it ’s only because the real thing is so goddamned empty .
So here ’s my theory / hypothesis / question .
We ’re a hollow nation , a society that provides nearly all of us with rampant access to more material goods than we know what to do with .
But we cannot find happiness in the material because there is not happiness in it .
On the contrary – it ’s a system that ’s rigged to feed us a shiny , pretty lie that hollows us out some more , all the while whispering that only more of the lie will make us happy .
This is our reality .
So should we be surprised that our favorite television shows and movies are n’t about “ reality ” ?
That instead , we turn toward the magical , the mystical , the alien , the supernatural and hyper - real realms that can promise us even more ?
Even when these narratives are dystopian , they ca n’t help but be more interesting than stories about this world .
After all , we have everything that this world can offer and we ’re still bored to tears .
These are heady days for fantasy merchants .
But where will we go next , when even better than the real thing grows dull ?

Electric cars are little more than glorified golf carts , goes the old saw , and along comes Volvo to prove it .
Pro Green Nordic got a little help from Volvo designing a golf cart that resembles the C70 , and the Swedish automaker loves it .
" We 're really pleased with the end result , " Volvo designer Lennart Ekdahl said in a statement .
The Swedes are quick to note the little EV is remarkably versatile .
It can navigate golf courses , retirement communities and trade fairs with equal ease .
Range is 37 miles , but with a top speed of just 15 km / hour ( about 9 mph ) you 'll get bored long before you run out of juice .
Price ?
A completely reasonable 60,000 kronor ( about $ 8,700 ) .
Look for the C70 cart to debut during the European leg of the Volvo World Match Play Championship on Oct. 29 .

You just have to love Tim Hawkins ' snark , and the fact that he was able to get these kids on board to help decry the criminal bailout .
His knock on how the government continually promotes its own ideology to promote its own crackpot theories and personnel is spot on .
People often talk nicely about how " stable " working for the federal government is .
They talk in more hushed tones about how no one can get fired no matter how badly they screw up .
So accurate , it 's hard to know whether to laugh or cry .
NEW YORK ( CNN ) --
Criminal charges will not be filed against the 18 - year - old college freshman who falsely accused five men of raping her in a dormitory bathroom at Hofstra University , an official said Friday .
Instead , Danmell Ndonye must participate in a year - long psychiatric program and spend 250 hours in community service for lying to police about what was a consensual sexual encounter with four of the five accused men , Nassau County District Attorney Kathleen Rice said in a written statement .
Ndonye said she did not engage in sexual activity with Rondell Bedward , the only one of the men who attends Hofstra University .
He has returned to classes .
Rice said she retains the option of filing criminal charges against Ndonye if she fails to complete the course of therapy or community service .
Rice added that filing criminal charges might have made any future false accuser reluctant to recant and tell the truth , possibly leading to an innocent person serving a lengthy prison sentence .
Authorities dropped charges and freed the four men they had taken into custody after their accuser changed her story about having been tied up and sexually assaulted in a dormitory bathroom .
The woman recanted after authorities told her that part of the incident was recorded on a cell phone video , Rice said .
" That was when she began to tell the truth , " she said .
It is against the law to report a crime when there was not one , the district attorney said .
" Her actions and her demeanor depict a very troubled young woman in need of much help , " Rice said .
Hofstra University has suspended Ndonye .

Eight months into it , it now seems pretty clear that the Obama administration is finished .
There were some of us -- indeed , many of us , myself included -- who thought there was a possibility that Barack Obama might seize this moment of American crisis , twinned with the complete failure for all to see of the regressive agenda , to become the second coming of Franklin Roosevelt .
Many think that was a naïve position from the get - go .
I disagree .
Not only do I believe that it was a legitimate possibility , I would argue that it was the logical choice even just from the narrow perspective of Obama 's personal fortunes .
The president is every day committing political suicide by a thousand cuts because he chose not to take that track .
That 's certainly his prerogative , and at this point I wish him all the worst of luck in whatever comes next .
Since I never assumed he would be a progressive once elected , any bitterness that I feel is not rooted in his failure to become the new FDR .
However , I am irate that , in domain after domain , President Obama has become the personification of the very Bush administration policies that Candidate Obama so roundly criticized .
And I feel deep hostility toward him about the betrayal of legions of voters -- especially the young -- who believed his message of hope and thought they were getting a president on their side , not Wall Street's .
More on that in another column .
Right now , the question is what comes next ?
The Obama presidency is probably already toast , though of course anything can happen in three or seven years .
But he is on a crash course for a major clock cleaning and , what 's worse , he does n't seem to have it remotely within him to seize history by the horns and steer that bull in his preferred direction .
Indeed , near as I can tell , he does n't even have a preferred direction .
Obama was complete fool if he ever believed for a moment that his campfire kumbaya act was going to bring the right along behind him .
Even s'mores would n't have helped .
These foaming - at - the - mouth lunatics have completely lost all sense and proportion , and were bound to viscerally hate any president left of Cheney , let alone some black guy in their white house .
Meanwhile , centrist voters in this country seem pretty much only to care about taxes and spending , and so he 's lost them , too , without the slightest rhetorical fight in his own defense .
And he 's blown off a solid progressive base by spitting in their eyes at every imaginable opportunity , beginning with the formation of his cabinet , ranging through every policy decision from civil rights to civil liberties to foreign policy to healthcare , and culminating with his choice not to even mobilize his email database in support of his policies .
So if he 's lost the left , right and center , just who does he think is going to be clamoring to give him a second term three years from now , especially if the economy remains lousy for most people in the country , as it's likely to do regardless of GDP or Dow Jones growth ?
There is the possibility that Obama could change course significantly , just as Bill Clinton did in 1995 , following the mid-term election in which his most astute political stewardship managed to turn both houses of Congress over to the Republican Party .
But Clinton turned to the right and became just a less snarly version of the Republicans , while Obama is already there .
I do n't really think he could conceivably turn further rightward at this point , and I do n't think he has anywhere near the guts to turn to the left and do what he should have done in the first place .
What all this suggests to me is that Obama and his party will manage by 2012 to snatch defeat from the jaws of victory and return the GOP -- and probably an even nastier version of it than the Bush - Cheney junta , at that -- to power .
It suggests that the Democrats , who were riding high six months ago over an all but destroyed Republican Party , will be switching places with them within three years time , if not sooner -- and all because of their own cowardice , corruption and ineptitude .
This outcome is hardly inevitable , but it is fast approaching .
Looking out over the horizon , I see five key factors most likely to effect the health and longevity of the Obama administration , and not one of them looks positive .
The eight - hundred pound gorilla rummaging around in the kitchen right now is the economy .
Indeed , this factor alone could readily swamp the combined effect of all the others , particularly if it swings dramatically in one direction or another .
My guess , as a non-economist ( which , of course , only means that I have a better shot at an accurate prediction than the economists do ) , is that the economy will exhibit some substantial signs of growth over the next three years .
But I suspect the recovery will be tepid , even according to establishment measures such as GDP growth or the state of the Dow .
More importantly , I strongly suspect that this will be another jobless recovery , like the last ones we 've had , and that the new mean standard of living for the middle class will be pretty mean indeed , significantly diminished compared to what people were already struggling to hold on to when the Great Recession began .
Personally , I think if American history teaches us anything at all about presidential elections , it is that for an incumbent president this is more or less the worst possible scenario imaginable upon which to go asking the public to punch his ticket again .
Americans vote their pocketbook , and that alone is likely to be the kiss of death for Obama 's second term aspirations .
Meanwhile , of course , he 's also chosen to put healthcare reform on the table as the signature legislative initiative probably of his entire presidency .
That 's fine , but watching him in action I sometimes wonder if this clown really and actually wants a second term .
I mean , if you had asked me in January , " How could Obama bungle this program most thoroughly ? " , I would have written a prescription that varies little from what we 've observed over the last eight months :
Do n't frame the issue , but instead let the radical right backed by greedy industry monsters do it , on the worst possible terms for you .
And to you .
Do n't fight back when they say the most outrageous things about your plan .
In fact , do n't even have a plan .
Let Congress do it .
Better yet , let the by - far - and - away - minority party have an equal voice in the proceedings , even if they ultimately wo n't vote for the bill under any circumstances , and even while they 're running around trashing it and you in the most egregious terms .
Have these savages negotiate with a small group of right - wing Democrats , all of them major recipients of industry campaign donations .
Blow off your base completely .
Cut secret sweetheart deals with the Big Pharma and Big Insurance corporate vampires .
Build a communications strategy around a series of hapless press conferences and town hall meetings , waiting until it 's too late to give a major speech on the issue .
Set a timetable for action and then let it slip .
Indicate what you want in the bill but then be completely unclear about whether you necessarily require those things .
Travel all over the world doing foreign policy meet - and - greets .
Go on vacation in the heat of the battle .
Rinse and repeat .
Altogether , it 's an astonishingly perfect recipe for getting rolled , so much so that I 'm not the first person to have wondered out loud if that was actually the president 's intention all along .
Look at this freaking fool .
Now look at the guy who ran a letter - perfect , disciplined , textbook , insurgent , victorious campaign for the White House .
Can they possibly be the same person ?
And , since they obviously are , is there possibly another explanation for this disaster besides an intentional boot ?
I dunno .
But what I do know is this .
Obama 's very best - case scenario for healthcare legislation right now represents a ton of lost votes in 2010 and 2012 .
And the worse that scenario gets , the worse he and his party do .
But even a ‘ success ' in the months ahead will produce a tepid bill , a mistrustful public , an inflamed and unanswered radical right , and a mealy - mouthed new government program that does n't even begin to go online until 2013 .
A real vote - getter that , eh ?
Which brings us to a third major electoral liability for Obama .
Human beings , by and large , like to be led .
They like their leaders to inspire their confidence -- even when doing so takes the form of the most fantastically shallow dress - up kind of blowhard buffonery , à la George W. Bush -- so that they do n't have to think too much about how little personal confidence they themselves actually possess .
Obama is the complete antithesis of this model of the presidency .
He is Harry Reid 's incontinent grandmother as president .
He is Neville Chamberlain 's squirrely little nephew knocking shit over in the Oval Office while he plays " Mr. President " , in - between episodes of SpongeBob SquarePants .
He is a bowl of Jell - O . That someone forgot to put in the fridge .
He exhibits no competence as a chief executive .
He inspires no confidence as a national leader .
And , increasingly , his credibility is coming into question .
Who wants to vote for that ?
A related problem is that he loves to flash that big toothy grin of his right before his venomous adversaries knock his choppers back into his head .
I 'm trying to imagine what a wimpier president would look like , and having a very hard time coming up with an answer .
I 'm trying to imagine how the regressive right could possibly bathe their country 's president in a more acidic pool of vitriol , and I 'm having a difficult time topping their assertions that he's out to kill the elderly while simultaneously indoctrinating grade - schoolers into the ranks of the Revolutionary Spartacist League .
I 'm trying to conceive of how vacant a White House could possibly be of any whiff of push - back against these assaults , and I can't quite envision it .
Maybe if they went out and did some real scandals and filmed it all as a gift for the GOP ?
Perhaps they could dig up Vince Foster 's body and murder him all over again , this time on video ?
Or they could hire Ken Starr to just run amok in the White House for a few years , looking for anything remotely juicy ?
But could Obama 's Keystone Kops even do a scandal properly ?
I 'm not sure , but I 'm pretty confident the public is losing trust in this guy as their Big Daddy Protector .
Who in America would vote for this eunuch to be in charge of keeping their little suburban Happy Meal - stuffed brats safe from tawny evil - doers with bad intentions ?
As if all that were n't enough , Obama is probably also sitting on several national security powder kegs - including Guantánamo , which he is unlikely to close ; Iraq , which he is unlikely to leave ; and Afghanistan , which he is unlikely to win .
The latter in particular has now become his war , and lately it is smelling a lot like Vietnam , circa 1964 .
An decades - long struggle against a popular nationalist adversary .
Endless calls from the Pentagon for more troops .
Incredibly inhospitable terrain for fighting a war .
An American - made puppet government hated for its corruption and for its gross incompetence at every task other than raw predation .
Mmmm-mmm .
What a yummy stew .
Have n't dined on that fine cuisine since 1975 .
And what another great vote - getter to add to this sorry list , eh ?
Put it all together and it's pretty hard to see how Obama gets a second term .
Which can mean only one thing :
We 're looking at a Romney or a Palin or some sort of similar monster as the next president , despite the fact that their party was absolutely loathed only a year ago , and actually still is today .
It wo n't matter .
People will be voting against the incumbent , not for any candidate , and that will leave only one viable choice , especially for centrist and right - wing voters .
Whoever wins the Republican nomination will be the next president , crushing Obama in the general election ( assuming he survives the Democratic primaries ) .
And that 's a particularly scary notion , since the party 's voting base who will make that choice in the Republican primaries is the same crowd you 've seen featured all this summer at town hall meetings .
Olympia Snowe is not going to be the Republican nominee in 2012 .
Know what I mean ?
So the question then becomes , what next ?
What happens after Obama ?
I see two possible general paths going forth from that point -- one bad , and one worse .
The bad path would involve a frustrated but essentially beaten - into - submission public oscillating between incompetent Republican and Democratic administrations , turning one after the other out of office -- not on ideological grounds , but instead seeking any change that has the possibility of stanching the empire 's hemorrhaging wounds .
This would look a fair bit like Japan or Britain does today .
The former just replaced its government and the latter will likely do so next spring .
But I do n't think either of these major party shifts are really ideological in nature , and I do n't think either new government is likely to be hugely different from the one it succeeded .
But Americans seem to me especially piggish critters these days , and the benign model that is sufficient to placate disgruntled citizens of long - lost empires may not suffice to soothe the savage soul of Yanquis still deep in the process of watching theirs crumble around their feet .
That moves us from the bad path to the worse .
Given what the American public is capable of happily countenancing during relatively flush times ( can you say " Reagan " ?
" Bush " ? ) , imagine what could happen when spoiled Baby Boomers go to the polls under conditions approaching the 1930s .
Such a crisis could conceivably entail a sharp turn to the left , and in every rational country certainly would .
But this is America .
We pretty much do n't go anywhere near socialism , at least not overtly , and in any given decade -- especially the recent ones -- we 're lucky to get away with anything less than creeping fascism .
Moreover , elections are almost always reactions to the status quo .
Since Obama is ridiculously -- but nevertheless widely -- perceived as a liberal , the reaction is all the more likely to involve a sharp turn to the right in response .
Under this scenario , anything portside of Torquemada would be buried alive if not annihilated , and the next regime would likely be one that could make Dick Cheney shudder .
And that 's the happy side of the equation .
If history is any guide , a nifty ( not so ) little war could only be right around the corner , for the helpful purpose of jump - starting the economy , crushing the domestic opposition , and distracting the public from that pesky nuisance once affectionately referred to as ‘ reality ' .
I do n't want to lay odds on which of these outcomes is the more likely , but I feel pretty confident , I 'm sad to say , that any happier scenario is considerably less likely than either of these .
For a lot of reasons , America 's near - term future looks bleak to me , and this country -- which already has a remarkable tendency to make dangerously foolish and sickeningly selfish political choices -- is altogether too likely to do something that would make the Bush years look like a scene from a Norman Rockwell canvas by comparison .
This tragedy , if it comes , will have many sires who share responsibility for driving America from Republican red to fascist black .
But on that list must certainly be included the powder blue of the effete Obama administration that came in between .
Rahm Emanuel once famously averred that " You never want a serious crisis to go to waste .
And what I mean by that is an opportunity to do things you think you could not do before . "
I do n't really believe that corporate - controlled fascism is what he had in mind when he said that .
But , who knows ?
Maybe that 's exactly what he was thinking .
The EU says it may have to consider visas for US travellers US plans to charge European travellers , who normally enjoy visa - free travel , to visit have come under attack .
The European Union ( EU ) has criticised proposals to charge $ 10 for those in the normal visa waiver programme , and have threatened retaliatory charges .
The charge would be used to fund a new programme - to promote foreign travel to the US .
The EU sees this as yet another burden to many of its citizens , after new rules that recently came into effect .
Visa waiver " Only in ' Alice in Wonderland ' could a penalty be seen as promoting the activity on which it is imposed , " said John Bruton , the European Commission 's ambassador to Washington .
As of this year , travellers in the visa waiver programme - a list of 35 countries including the UK , France , Germany , Singapore and Japan - must now register online at least 72 hours before travel and renew their registration every two years .
The new plans would mean that those visitors would have to pay a $ 10 charge when they register .
That money would be used to find a new public - private partnership that would educate visitors , among other things , on the online registration for visa - free travel to the US .
US Representative William Delahunt , who has sponsored the bill that includes the charge , said it was a " nominal fee " and urged the EU not to exaggerate the issue .
" This is a tempest in a teapot , " he said .
But Mr Bruton said the EU would have to consider whether the new charge , if signed into law , would amount to a new visa against its travellers .
If so , the EU might have to consider visas for US travellers .

Experimental mouse breeding in a near - zero - gravity space simulation suggests making babies is best left to Earthlings .
According to Japanese biologists , defects in their microgravity embryos suggest that " fertilization can occur normally " in space , but standard Earth gravity may be needed for embryo development .
The experiment , published Tuesday in Public Library of Science ONE , is the latest addition to a surprisingly large body of literature on how the space environment affects the cellular basics of reproduction .
Among the animals that have been bred in space are frogs , salamanders , sea urchins — who did n't do so well — and fish .
( Birds and bees are , understandably if unfortunately , not on the list . )
Rather less research , however , has been done on mammalian reproduction in space , and there 's reason to think the potential effects of low gravity would be pronounced in mammals , whose embryonic development is more complicated and sensitive than other animals .
To test these effects , the researchers artificially fertilized mouse eggs with sperm that had been stored inside a three - dimensional clinostat , a machine that mimics weightlessness by rotating objects in such a way that the effects of gravity are spread in every direction .
Fertilization took place normally , suggesting that microgravity had n't harmed the sperm .
But as the embryos continued to develop inside the clinostat , many developed problems .
Their cells had trouble dividing and maturing .
Some were ultimately implanted in female mice and survived to a healthy birth , but at lower numbers than a regular - gravity control group .
Part of the difference could be the result of performing tricky procedures on sensitive cells , but the researchers suspect they also reflect the affect of a low - gravity environment on cellular processes that evolved for Earth - specific physics .
" Sustaining life beyond Earth either on space stations or on other planets will require a clear understanding of how the space environment affects key phases of mammalian reproduction , " write the researchers .

As I explain in the chapter by that title in Breaking the Spell , " belief in belief " is a common phenomenon not restricted to religions .
Economists realise that a sound currency depends on people believing that the currency is sound , and scientists recognise that the actual objectivity of scientific studies on global warming is politically impotent unless people believe in that objectivity , so economists and scientists ( among others ) take steps to foster and protect such beliefs that they think are benign .
That 's acting on belief in belief .
Sometimes the maintenance of a belief is deemed so important that impressive systems of propaganda are erected and vigorously defended by people who do not in fact share the belief that they think is so important for society to endorse .
For instance , imbecile monarchs have been kept on their thrones by widespread conspiracies of oblivion and deception when it has been deemed too socially disruptive to confirm to the populace what everybody suspects : the king is an idiot .
Religion offers an extreme case of this .
Today one of the most insistent forces arrayed in opposition to us vocal atheists is the " I 'm an atheist but " crowd , who publicly deplore our " hostility " , our " rudeness " ( which is actually just candour ) , while privately admitting that we 're right .
They do n't themselves believe in God , but they certainly do believe in belief in God .
It 's not always easy to tell who just believes in belief , since the actions motivated by believing in belief ( while not actually believing in God ) are – with the exception of those rare sotto voce confessions – well - nigh indistinguishable from the actions of genuine believers : say the prayers , sing the hymns , tithe , proclaim one 's allegiance , volunteer for church projects , and so on .
Sometimes I wonder if even 10 % of the people who proclaim their belief in God actually do believe in God .
I am particularly unimpressed by those who proclaim the loudest ; they demonstrate by their very activism that they fear the effect of any erosion of religion , and they must think that erosion is likely if they do n't put their shoulders to the wheel .
If they were more confident and secure in their religious convictions , they probably would n't waste their time trying to discredit a few atheists .
For instance , since they are confident that the moon landings really happened , they do n't bother working to discredit the moon - landing sceptics who lurk on the internet , even though those people do pose something of a threat to public confidence in the veracity of the media and the government .
I am confident that those who believe in belief are wrong .
That is , we no more need to preserve the myth of God in order to preserve a just and stable society than we needed to cling to the Gold Standard to keep our currency sound .
It was a useful crutch , but we 've outgrown it .
Denmark , according to a recent study , is the sanest , healthiest , happiest , most crime - free nation in the world , and by and large the Danes simply ignore the God issue .
We should certainly hope that those who believe in belief are wrong , because belief is waning fast , and the props are beginning to buckle .
A national study by evangelicals in the United States predicted that only 4 % of their children would grow up to be " Bible - believing " adults .
The Southern Baptists are baptising about as many today as they were in 1950 , when the population was half what it is today .
At what point should those who just believe in belief throw in the towel and stop trying to get their children and neighbours to cling to what they themselves no longer need ?
How about now ?
• This article was amended on Thursday 16 July 2009 .
Moon - landing sceptics were referred to as " loonies " , contrary to the Guardian style guide .

What are penny stocks ?
Penny stocks are usually defined as stocks that trade on the OTC BB or Pink Sheets exchange .
Many consider penny stocks anything under $ 5 .
No wo n't see stocks run from $ 30 to $ 100 very often , but with penny stocks $.30 to $ 1.00 happens almost on a daily basis .
Several prominent Leftists and centrists are planning to launch a new campaign supporting Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and the agenda he presented in his Bar Ilan speech , Ynet learned Tuesday .
The campaign , titled " Blue & White Peace , " is meant to bolster Netanyahu 's support of the a two - state solution
Among those lending their support to the new initiative are former ministers Ami Ayalon and Amnon Lipkin - Shahak , former Israeli Air Force Chief Eliezer Shkedy , former Deputy Foreign Minister Dr. Yehuda Ben Meir and Attorney Gilad Sher , who headed the 1999 Israeli mission to Camp David .
Bar Ilan Speech Netanyahu backs creation of Palestinian state Roni Sofer Prime minister endorses creation of Palestinian state , stresses any such entity will have to be demilitarized and acknowledge Israel as a Jewish nation .
' The claim that territorial withdrawals will bring peace with the Palestinians has up till now not stood the test of reality , ' says Netanyahu Netanyahu backs creation of Palestinian state
Geneva Initiative CEO Gadi Baltiansky , former Shin Bet chiefs Yaakov Peri and Carmi Gilon , former deputy minister Dalia Rabin and former Knesset Member Etti Livni .
Another individual involved is former Foreign Ministry Director - General Avi Gil , who is a close associate of President Shimon Peres
Sources familiar with the campaign told Ynet Peres has been kept abreast of its details .
' We need to focus on the main agenda '
The group came together following the prime minister 's June policy speech at Bar Ilan University .
The speech focused on the two - state solution , a notion to which Netanyahu lent public support for the first time , as well as Israel 's need to separate itself from the West Bank .
" We want to focus on the main agenda and it 's important to us to bring in people who are not affiliated with the Left in order to send the message to as many publics as possible , " said a source close to the group .
" Movements that believe in this solution should support the government , not oppose it .
We have to push the consensual issues , or those that are near - consensual .
The prime minister is facing more than ideological hurdles , we have to lend him our public support , " a former top security figure who joined the group told Ynet .
Willing to elasticize ?

The group 's efforts to enlist the support of as many public figures as possible is in full swing .
Future plans include forming a public council to represent the members , as well as fundraising activities .
The first phase of the group 's campaign is expected to include massive online presence .
" The primary goal is to form online support groups , " said a group source .
Several leftist initiatives , meant to promote private plans aimed at achieving a breakthrough in the Israeli - Palestinian peace process , have been put forward over the years , many of them stemming from the premise that a Right - led government would be unwilling to pursue the peace process .
' Go with the flow '
According to a source close to the group , while Netanyahu has given no indication that an ideological change on his part is imminent , " he has been willing to elasticize his positions on various matters " .
" We feel that if he thinks he has significant public support for the two - state solution it would be easier for him to act on it .
The majority of the Israeli public supports this solution and we want to express that support , " an official source told Ynet .
" Blue & White Peace " will have nothing to do with the prime minister 's political affiliation , said other sources in the group , as it will focus solely on promoting the idea of a Palestinian state .
" The idea is to go with the flow , so to speak .
The Left may have won an ideological victory in the last election , but it lost politically , " said another source .
" Some in the Left have already given up , so we have to help those in power – whoever they are .
We do n't care about political affiliation , we care about pushing the idea .
If Netanyahu can enter negotiations , we want to help him . "
Nevertheless , the group stressed that the future campaign will not signal any personal endorsement of Netanyahu .
" The idea is to back anyone who truly wants to advance the two - state solution .
As long as Netanyahu truly acts on the agenda expressed at Bar Ilan , we will support him . "

See the solution
The negative comments on my previous column ( there were many positive ones too ) fall neatly into two groups , the attacks on me and the attacks on my ideas .
Let ’s do the ad hominem stuff first .
More than a few posters declared that while I talk the talk , I do n’t walk the walk .
Eric issues a challenge : “ So Mr. Fish , how about teaching some comp classes yourself ? ” English Professor is confident that “ we can safely assume that Mr. Fish has never actually taught a composition class himself . ”
Ditto anonymous writing instructor : “ I ’m sure that Fish is paid too dearly for his opinions here and elsewhere to actually teach composition classes . ”
Maeve asks ,
“ By the way , when ’s the last time you taught a freshman composition class ? ”
That one ’s easy .
The last time I taught a regularly scheduled freshman composition class was my last year teaching in a liberal arts college .
That was 2004 - 2005 , and in the years before that , when I was the dean , I taught the course every fall .
Since 2005 , I ’ve been a faculty member at a law school where there are no freshmen to teach , so I ’ve had to make do with offering a non-credit writing workshop on Mondays ; it ’s my version of pro bono work and last fall 50 or so students and a few colleagues took advantage of it .
Earlier in my career I taught composition ( sometimes two courses in a semester ) for 12 years at the University of California , Berkeley .
I was one of two full professors to do so .
In 1974 , I moved to Johns Hopkins , where there was no writing course because of the ( mistaken ) assumption that students who were good enough to get into the university did n’t need one .
An enterprising graduate student named Pamela Regis enlisted my help in setting up a fledgling program , and by the time I left for Duke in 1985 the program was established and growing .
At Duke writing instruction was not housed in the English department , and so I could neither participate in it nor direct its course .
After that to the University of Illinois at Chicago , where I was able to get involved again .
As dean , I held seminars for the T.A. ’s in my college and the business college and blocked attempts to add a service learning component to the writing course .
( That ’s an answer to Margaret Boerner ’s question , which she thinks is rhetorical : “ Did he do anything about it when he was dean ? ” )
Now I give workshops in colleges across the country , most recently at Columbia University ’s Teachers College .
When Max Byrd says ( contemptuously ) , “ Professor Fish might get off his high horse and teach a course himself , ” I reply , Professor Byrd should climb off his low horse and do some fact - checking before he pronounces .
So that ’s the experience part .
Then there ’s the expertise part .
I am told by MC that I “ do n’t know a damn thing about composition . ”
Liz is kind enough to inform me that “ there is an entire field of study on this topic ; countless articles and books are written about the subject by experts . ”
And , she adds , it ’s all too typical that people like me “ who complain about poor writing do n’t want to teach it themselves . ”
Straight face advises me to “ know your limitations and defer your ignorant ‘ common sense ’ to the DECADES of theory and practice IN THE FIELD ” and wonders why I “ failed ” to leave the matter of writing instruction to the “ specialists ” in my department .
Maybe because I was one .
I have n’t written “ countless articles ” on the subject , but I have written some and they have been part of the conversation , especially a 1987 piece titled “ Anti-Foundationalism , Theory Hope and the Teaching of Composition . ”
I have been on the editorial board of one of the leading journals , and the essays in that and other composition venues often discuss my work ( not always favorably ) .
I have written columns on writing , also widely discussed , in this newspaper and I have studied and taught many of the major composition theorists .
Of course , the fact that I can claim experience and credentials in the field does n’t make my views correct .
Those views can certainly be criticized , as they are by a number of posters .
The main criticism is that my emphasis on teaching forms and only forms ( a ) leaves out everything interesting , ( b ) leads to boring classes no student would want to take and ( c ) has been discredited by the research years ago .
That research , according to Dee , shows that “ teaching grammar out of context ” is ineffective , in part because , as writer teacher observes , “ students are afraid that they are n’t abiding by the rules . ”
If that is what is meant by teaching grammar — memorizing rules and being always afraid of breaking them — I agree .
If the effect of instruction is to make students fear that they are walking through a minefield of error and that at any moment they are going to step on something that will wound them , the odds of their learning anything are small .
The research that led Richard Braddock , Richard Lloyd - Jones and Lowell Schoer to conclude in 1963 that “ the teaching of formal grammar has a negligible . . . even a harmful effect on improvement in writing , ” is no doubt correct but beside my point ; all it proves is that “ drilling students on parts of speech ” ( McLoughlin ) does n’t work .
What does work , I have found , is something quite different : drilling students in the forms that enable meaning ; and these are not inert taxonomic forms , but forms of thought .
A small example .
Let ’s say I ’m teaching the neither / nor form .
I begin by producing a simple neither / nor sentence .
“ Neither his age nor his disability prevented him from competing . ”
I then ask my students to write their own sentences on that model .
Most of them are able to do it , and they produce sentences with 20 different contents , but only one form .
The next step is for the students to figure out what that form is .
Just how does a neither / nor sentence organize items and actions in the world ?
It takes a while to work that out , but in not too much time students are able to explain that the form organizes three components : two conditions ( age and disability ) and the resolution ( to compete ) in relation to which they may have presented an obstacle , but did not .
The important thing students learn , in addition to being able to generate neither / nor sentences forever , is that the relationship among those components , whatever they are , is always the same : two assertions that have a relationship to each other combine to highlight the unlikeliness of an action or an attitude .
Notice that this is an abstract and purely formal account of the matter and that it will fit innumerable narratives ( and a narrative is what a neither / nor sentence is ) .
While the content is variable and abundant — as David Berman says , “ content is everywhere ” — the form is unvarying .
It follows then that what students must learn are the forms ; the content will follow .
A neither / nor sentence , or an even - though sentence or a nevertheless sentence , or a thousand other forms that can be studied and mastered — these do not clothe an antecedent content ; they make it possible ; they are not brought in to adorn a story ; they are the story .
In short — and I borrow this phrasing from my book editor Julia Cheiffetz — in learning how to write , it ’s not the thought that counts .
That is my answer to the many posters who said things like , “ students can not write about nothing ” ( cyndy ) or “ students need to write about something ” ( ISE ) or “ the practice of writing has to be embedded in something ” ( Erik Borg ) .
Writing is its own subject , and a deeper and more fascinating one than the content it makes available .
Content just sprawls around ; forms constrain and shape it .
As Jamakaya says , “ good writing skills instill good thinking , ” not the other way around .
Robin T. agrees : “ Young people who ca n’t write ca n’t think . ”
Shunyam would have it that “ one ca n’t teach writing without topics and texts that students can be involved in , ” but I have found that students very quickly become involved in the extraordinary power and generativity of ordinary forms ; they are amazed , delighted and fascinated by the new analytic skills they are able to exercise .
And the texts ?
Well , they can be anything ; they are disposable ; they are just filler ; they are not and should not be the center of interest , which again is not mere form but enabling form .
I call this the “ Karate Kid ” method of teaching writing .
You will remember that in the 1984 movie the title figure is being trained to perform in matches , but his teacher has him waxing cars and painting fences , repeating over and over again the same stylized motions .
The kid thinks he ’s not learning anything .
But he ’s learning everything .
Like the forms my students study , these motions — formal moves — need no context and can be made effective in any context , as the final scenes show .
Of course , “ The Karate Kid ” is fiction , but real - life contexts are brought in by two posters who make my point .
In response to George B. ’s dictum that “ a class in painting should not be about brushes , tubes and canvas , ” Laurie declares that in fact “ a course in painting should be about brushes , tubes , and canvas . ”
If you do n’t have control of what the tools do , you ’re not going to be able to go on to the “ higher ” activity .
Chefesse , whose name identifies her profession , tells us that “ learning to cook , you have to practice over and over again how to chop vegetables before you master the sauté pan . ”
The formal repertoire makes content - based performance possible ; without a formal repertoire , internalized to the extent of being automatic , performance is haphazard and without shape or boundaries .
Finally , one criticism of me is certainly justified .
It goes to my own writing in this column .
Blago , among others , finds me prolix .
He gives a one - word piece of advice : “ Concision . ” ( I have n’t followed it this time , either . )
Johnny provides a deeper analysis .
I wrote , he says , two essays , one about writing skills , the other about conservative efforts to undermine professorial autonomy .
They did n’t quite mesh and got in each other ’s way .
He ’s right .
I should have remembered a fellow columnist ’s golden rule — one topic at a time .
I ’ll try to do better in the future .
Da L'espresso on line
La prima patacca accertata è del 1990 , ai tempi in cui Vittorio Feltri dirige " L'Europeo " : un'intervista sul rapimento Moro a tale Davide , " carabiniere infiltrato nelle Br " che avrebbe fatto irruzione nel covo di via Montenevoso .
E' un racconto " esplosivo " su presunti memoriali e audio di Moro dalla prigionia , con tanto di dettagli erotici sui brigatisti Franco Bonisoli e Nadia Mantovani sorpresi nudi a letto .
Peccato che sia tutto falso , dalla prima all ' ultima riga , e il " Davide " in questione non esista neppure .
Nasce così , quasi vent ' anni fa , il fenomeno Feltri : un misto di bufale ( come quella su Alceste Campanile " assassinato da Lotta Continua " , mentre è stato ucciso da Avanguardia nazionale ) , rivalutazioni del fascismo ( " Peccato che a scuola si continui a studiare la Resistenza " ) e linguaggio da bar ( vale per tutti il titolo sul calcio negli Usa : " Agli uomini piace , alle donne no , ma i negri non lo sopportano " , da cui si deduce che i " negri " non appartengono alla categoria né degli uomini né delle donne .
Nel ' 92 Feltri è contattato da Andrea Zanussi , editore de " L'indipendente " , al quale spiega che il quotidiano " ha bisogno di una bella iniezione di merda " .
Detto , fatto .
è il periodo di Mani Pulite e lui lo cavalca proponendo titoli come " Cieco , ma i soldi li vedeva benissimo " , riferito a un presunto tangentista non vedente .
Segue un falso scoop sulla morte di Pinelli , un attacco a Indro Montanelli ( " è arrivato il tuo 25 luglio " ) , e il linciaggio di Norberto Bobbio ( " mandante morale dell ' omicidio Calabresi " ) , più un po ' di insulti alla Guardia di Finanza ( che in quel periodo sta indagando sul Cavaliere ) .
Quasi inevitabile nel ' 94 la promozione al " Giornale " , appena lasciato da Montanelli .
Qui Feltri si fa riconoscere subito per i titoli farlocchi tra cui un mitico " La lebbra sbarca in Sicilia , contagiati a Messina quattro italiani " ( vero niente ) .
Notevole anche " Berlusconi vende la Fininvest " , così come la patacca sui miliardi di Milosevic " trasportati in sacchi di juta dalla Serbia all ' Italia " .
Altrettanto sballate le accuse ai giudici Piercamillo Davigo e Francesco Di Maggio di essere soci in una cooperativa edilizia con Curtò e Ligresti .
Non mancano nuove " inchieste " revisioniste sul fascismo , come quella sull ' attentato di via Rasella corredata da una foto falsificata della testa di un bambino staccata dal tronco : la cosa arriverà alla Cassazione , che nell ' agosto 2007 condannerà il direttore parlando di un " quadro di vere e proprie false affermazioni " .
Avanti così , e nel '95 Feltri si inventa che " la scorta del presidente Scalfaro ha sparato a un elicottero dei pompieri " ( ovviamente è il periodo dello scontro politico fra il Quirinale e Berlusconi ) .
Di due anni dopo è un'intervista taroccata a Francesco De Gregori contro il Pci , un pezzo per cui il cantante porta Feltri in tribunale ottenendone la condanna .
Sempre nel ' 97 una nuova - più grave - patacca costa a Feltri il posto : è quella sul presunto " tesoro " di Antonio Di Pietro , cinque miliardi di lire che l'ex pm è accusato di aver preso da Francesco Pacini Battaglia .
Dopo parecchie querele , alla fine è lo stesso direttore a dover ammettere che si tratta di " una bufala " .
Segue per Feltri un periodo al " Borghese " e al gruppo Riffeser , fino alla fondazione di " Libero " , dove chiama a scrivere il puparo di Calciopoli Luciano Moggi e l'ex agente del Sismi Renato " Betulla " Farina .
Per lanciarsi , il quotidiano ha bisogno di fuochi artificali : di qui la falsa notizia che un centro sociale milanese è un covo dell ' Eta basca , di qui uno " scoop " su Donna Rachele titolato " Mussolini era cornuto " .
Poi arrivano le accuse trasversali a Sergio Cofferati per l'omicidio Biagi ( " La Cgil indica i bersagli da colpire " ) e un altro falso scoop su Berlusconi ( " Vuole lasciare la politica " ) .
Ma non basta , e allora Feltri parla di pedofilia pubblicando cinque foto di preadolescenti nudi in pose inequivocabili ( con conseguente radiazione dall ' Ordine , poi tramutata in " censura " ) .
Di questa fase resta però ai posteri soprattutto l'elegante prima pagina con un disegno di Prodi nudo a quattro zampe e con il sedere alzato , pronto a farsi sodomizzare da un tappo di champagne con la faccia di Berlusconi .
Richiamato in agosto al " Giornale " , Feltri parte subito con la campagna più desiderata dal suo editore , puntando a tre obiettivi : intimidire i giornalisti non allineati ( occhio che se critichi il premier ma poi paghi la colf in nero o non versi gli alimenti all 'ex moglie , io lo scrivo in prima pagina ) ; livellare tutti nel fango per provare che Berlusconi non è peggiore di chi lo attacca , in base al " così fan tutti " autoassolutorio ; far fuori quanti nella Chiesa osano criticare il premier .
Così in poche settimane " il Giornale " diventa una fabbrica di linciaggi in serie : da Eugenio Scalfari a Enrico Mentana , da Gustavo Zagrebelsky a Concita De Gregorio , da Dino Boffo a Ezio Mauro , fino a Ted Kennedy e Gianni Agnelli ( a Feltri infatti piace sparare anche sui morti ) .
A proposito : negli ultimi anni di vita , Indro Montanelli diceva che non riconosceva più il suo " Giornale " , gli sembrava " un figlio drogato " .
Adesso pare entrato in un'overdose senza ritorno .
How many basic trigonometric functions are there ?
I will present the arguments for 1 , 3 , 6 , and at least 12 .
The calculator answer : 3
A typical calculator has three trig functions if it has any : sine , cosine , and tangent .
The other three that you may see — cosecant , secant , and cotangent — are the reciprocals of sine , cosine , and tangent respectively .
Calculator designers expect you to push the cosine key followed by the reciprocal key if you want a secant , for example .
The calculus textbook answer : 6
The most popular answer to the number of basic trig functions may be six .
Unlike calculator designers , calculus textbook authors find the cosecant , secant , and cotangent functions sufficiently useful to justify their inclusion as first - class trig functions .
The historical answer :
At least 12
There are at least six more trigonometric functions that at one time were considered worth naming .
These are versine , haversine , coversine , hacoversine , exsecant , and excosecant .
All of these can be expressed simply in terms of more familiar trig functions .
For example , versine ( θ ) = 2 sin2 ( θ/2 ) = 1 – cos(θ ) and exsecant ( θ ) = sec( θ ) – 1 .
Why so many functions ?
One of the primary applications of trigonometry historically was navigation , and certain commonly used navigational formulas are stated most simply in terms of these archaic function names .
For example , the law of haversines .
Modern readers might ask why not just simplify everything down to sines and cosines .
But when you ’re calculating by hand using tables , every named function takes appreciable effort to evaluate .
If a table simply combines two common operations into one function , it may be worthwhile .
These function names have a simple pattern .
The “ ha - ” prefix means “ half , ” just as in “ ha’penny . ”
The “ ex - ” prefix means “ subtract 1 . ”
The “ co - ” prefix means what it always means .
( More on that below . )
The “ ver - ” prefix means 1 minus the co-function .
Pointless exercise : How many distinct functions could you come up with using every combination of prefixes ?
The order of prefixes might matter in some cases but not in others .
The minimalist answer : 1
The opposite of the historical answer would be the minimalist answer .
We do n’t need secants , cosecants , and cotangents because they ’re just reciprocals of sines , cosines , and tangents .
And we do n’t even need tangent because tan ( θ ) = sin(θ ) / cos (θ ) .
So we ’re down to sine and cosine , but then we do n’t really need cosine because cos(θ ) = sin( π / 2 – θ ) .
Not many people remember that the “ co ” in cosine means “ complement . ”
The cosine of an angle θ is the sine of the complementary angle π/2 – θ .
The same relationship holds for secant and cosecant , tangent and cotangent , and even versine and coversine .
By the way , understanding this complementary relationship makes calculus rules easier to remember .
Let foo( θ ) be a function whose derivative is bar (θ ) .
Then the chain rule says that the derivative of foo ( π / 2 – θ ) is - bar ( π / 2 – θ ) .
In other words , if the derivative of foo is bar , the derivative of cofoo is negative cobar .
Substitute your favorite trig function for “ foo . ”
Note also that the “ co - ” function of a “ co - ” function is the original function .
For example , co-cosine is sine .
The consultant answer :
It depends
The number of trig functions you want to name depends on your application .
From a theoretical view point , there ’s only one trig function : all trig functions are simple variations on sine .
But from a practical view point , it ’s worthwhile to create names like tan ( θ ) for the function sin(θ ) / sin( π/2 – θ ) .
And if you ’re a navigator crossing an ocean with books of trig tables and no calculator , it ’s worthwhile working with haversines etc .

An employee of Japan 's auto giant Nissan demonstrates the new concept vehicle , the " Land Glider " , a tandem - ride ultra light - weight electric vehicle with a narrow body at the company 's design center at Atsugi city in Kanagawa prefecture , suburban Tokyo .
The car shifts its centre of gravity whilst turning by leaning like a motorcycle .
Nissan unveiled Thursday a futuristic concept car that tilts to the side when going around bends to make drivers feel like they are gliding through the air .
The zero-emission electric " Land Glider " seats two people -- one in the front and one in the back .
Just 1.1 metres ( 3.6 feet ) wide , it can easily squeeze into tight parking spaces and through narrow streets .
" In the past a car used to move only in a two dimensional way but the Land Glider can move in a three dimensional way , " said Nissan 's Ryusuke Hayashi , who is overseeing the project .

Ms Baines was believed to have been the oldest African - American voter
The oldest person in the world has died in Los Angeles at the age of 115 of suspected heart failure .
Gertrude Baines , born 6 April 1894 , had held the title since January , when a Portuguese woman , Maria de Jesus , died , also at the age of 115 .
Ms Baines 's doctor said she had attributed her long life to a healthy lifestyle and her religious beliefs .
The title of world 's oldest person now passes to a 114 - year - old Japanese woman , Kama Chinen .
Officials at the Western Convalescent Hospital , where Ms Baines had lived for several years , said she had died at 0725 local time ( 1425GMT ) .
" She told me that she owes her longevity to the Lord , that she never did drink , she never did smoke and she never did fool around , " the AFP news agency quoted Dr Charles Witt as saying .
He said two days before her death she had been " in excellent shape " .
" She was mentally alert .
She smiled frequently , " he said .
Ms Baines , whose father was once a slave , was believed to be the oldest ever African - American voter when she cast her ballot for US President Barack Obama in November 2008 .
She said she was voting for him " because he 's for the coloured people " .
She celebrated her 115th birthday in April and received a letter of congratulations from Mr Obama .

MEXICO CITY ( AP )  Mexico enacted a controversial law on Thursday decriminalizing possession of small amounts of marijuana , cocaine , heroin and other drugs while encouraging government - financed treatment for drug dependency free of charge .
The law sets out maximum “ personal use ” amounts for drugs , also including LSD and methamphetamine .
People detained with those quantities will no longer face criminal prosecution ; the law goes into effect on Friday .
Anyone caught with drug amounts under the personal - use limit will be encouraged to seek treatment , and for those caught a third time treatment is mandatory  although no penalties for noncompliance are specified .
Mexican authorities said the change only recognized the longstanding practice here of not prosecuting people caught with small amounts of drugs .
London Bridge is a place in Central London , and refers to the bridge that crosses the River Thames .
The bridge runs from Southwark to the City of London ; the structure that currently stands was built in March of 1973 , however several other bridges were previously in that spot .
The area is very active with retail , offices and the tourism industry .
Right by the London Underground station that links London Bridge to the rest of the city you will find ' London Dungeons ' and the ' Britain at War ' Experience ; these are very popular attractions for school trips and tourists .
Arranged tours are available to take the London Bridge Experience , learning about the interesting history .
If you 're not interested in the tourism side of things , you may wish to spend your time instead with a London Bridge escort .
Bustling with things to do , you will easily find plenty of pubs , bars and restaurants in the immediate area .
London Bridge escorts are equally happy to stay in with you if you fancy a quiet night - she will be brought directly to your home or hotel at a time to fit in with your schedule .
The type of gentlemen who hire escorts in London Bridge varies greatly ; some are city men who work in the area .
Some live locally and others are just visiting for a short stay .
Whoever you are , as long as you know how to treat a lady you are eligible to spend time with our gorgeous girls .
We are sure that once you have met one of our London Bridge escorts , you will want to book again and again .
We offer an all round great service , from your booking with the receptionist through to the prompt arrival of your chosen escort .
You will have a memorable time together , which you 'll only want to repeat !
Thüringen : CDU kapituliert vor der NPD - Hetze
Noch gestern gaben sie sich alle kampfbereit und entschlossen : Thüringens CDU - Ministerpräsident
Althaus und sein Wahlkampfteam stellten sich demonstrativ in aller Öffentlichkeit hinter den von der NPD wegen seiner Hautfarbe angegriffenen CDU - Politiker Zeca Schall .
Doch über Nacht ist es offenbar schon vorbei mit der Solidarität ...
In den späten Abendstunden rückten sie an : Überall in Thüringen waren die Klebekolonnen eifrig zugange , um gezielt jene Wahlplakate zu überkleben , von denen noch gestern der von der NPD rassistisch attackierte CDU - Politker Zeca Schall dem Wahlvolk freundlich zulächelte .
In meinem Heimatort - einer kleinen Stadt südwestlich von Erfurt - war heute morgen nicht ein einziges der bisherigen Plakate mehr zu sehen .
An deren Stelle prangen nun beliebig austauschbare Standardphrasen der CDU .
Das sympathische Konterfei Schalls wurde über Nacht mit deutscher Gründlichkeit aus dem Stadtbild ausradiert !
Auch auf dem Weg zur Arbeit waren fast alle betroffenen Plakate überklebt worden .
Man sah , dass der Kleister teilweise noch nicht einmal trocken war .
Einzig in der Stadt Erfurt selbst konnte ich noch einige der alten Bilder entdecken - aber wahrscheinlich haben sie die nur vergessen ?
Scheinbar glaubt man in der CDU - Zentrale , dass Schalls schwarzes Anlitz der Partei schaden könne , anders kann ich mir die Tilgungsaktion der letzten Stunden kaum erklären .
Wahrscheinlich fürchtet man , dass auch viele der Thüringer CDU - Wähler klammheimlich die rassistischen Ansichten der NPD teilen und nun , wie durch eine Art Initialzündung getrieben , in der Wahlkabine zu dieser hinüberschwenken könnten .
In jedem Fall ist das Verhalten der CDU eine offene Kapitulation vor der menschenverachtenden Hetze der Nazis .
Diese können sich nun leider zurecht damit brüsten , die stärkste Partei des Landes nach Belieben vor sich herzutreiben .
Ausserdem sind sie wieder mal an prominenter Stelle in Presse und öffentlicher Diskussion vertreten - soviel Wahlwerbung könnten die mit ihrem gesamten Geld nicht bezahlen !

President - elect Barack Obama ’s swearing - in Tuesday will incorporate several elements out of America ’s Masonic past .
A d v e r t i s e m e n t
One - third of the signers of the Constitution , many of the Bill of Rights signers and America ’s first few presidents ( except for Thomas Jefferson ) were Freemasons , a fraternal organization that became public in early 18th - century England .
Although it became fabulously popular in America , at one time encompassing 10 percent of the population , Pope Clement XII condemned Freemasonry in 1738 as heretical .
The latest pronouncement was issued in 1983 by then - Cardinal Joseph Ratzinger – now Pope Benedict XVI – who called Masonic practices “ irreconcilable ” with Catholic doctrine .
Still , as the first president , George Washington had to come up with appropriate rituals for the new country .
He borrowed many of them from Masonic rites he knew as “ worshipful leader ” of a lodge in Alexandria .
His Masonic gavel is on display at the Capitol Visitor Center .
Until this inauguration , Washington ’s Masonic Bible – on which he swore his obligations as a Freemason – was used for the presidential oath of office .
President - elect Barack Obama will use Abraham Lincoln ’s Bible .

In a recent interview , Gearbox CEO Randy Pitchford — the developer behind the upcoming Borderlands — revealed some surprising opinions about Valve 's Steam digital distribution platform .
While the common sentiment among both gamers and developers tends to be positive , Pitchford told Maximum PC that " I do n't trust Valve " and that he believes " a lot of the industry does n't " as well .
Pitchford 's main criticism is that with Valve being both a game developer and a platform holder , this situation creates " so much conflict of interest ... that it 's horrid . "
According to the Gearbox CEO , Valve 's position allows them to exploit developers who use Steam to distribute their games .
Given the surprising nature of these comments ,
Ars contacted several game developers to see just how widespread these opinions are .
" I agree with Pitchford about there being potential for conflict of interest and abuse of power , but I have n't seen even the faintest sign of this power being abused , " Ron Carmel from World of Goo developer 2D Boy told Ars .
" Quite the contrary , Valve offers the most developer - friendly terms for digital distribution in the industry .
Do you know the saying ' there 's nothing better than a good king and nothing worse than a bad one ' ?
I think it applies here , and Steam has clearly been a good king so far . "
Dylan Fitterer , whose rhythm game Audiosurf was released on Steam in February of last year , agrees , telling Ars , " If this is exploitation , more please . "
Audiosurf has achieved some great success on the platform , and still remains one of the top sellers in the indie games section of Steam .
" In my experience , Valve has been an amazing business partner , " Fitterer added .
But it 's more than just independent developers that have had favorable experiences with the platform .
Telltale Games , the studio behind episodic gaming series like Tales of Monkey Island and Wallace & Gromit 's Grand Adventures , currently has its entire catalog available on Steam .
" We put Steam as one of the A - list distribution channels , up there with XBLA and WiiWare , " Telltale CTO Kevin Bruner told Ars over the phone .
With a line - up consisting entirely of episodic gaming series , digital distribution is obviously something that is very important to Telltale .
In addition to Steam , Telltale 's games are available to purchase via the company 's own online store , as well as other portals like Direct2 Drive .
But Bruner still has the utmost respect for Valve 's service .
" Steam may be one the greatest things to happen recently , " he told Ars .
With its unique distribution model , Telltale has had issues with other digital portals in the past , but not once with Valve , which he describes as being " very accommodating . "
As for the whole conflict of interest issue , none of the developers we spoke to were very worried .
" We 've done third - party digital distribution in the past as well , " Bruner explained , though it 's not something Telltale has dabbled in recently .
Still , according to Bruner , the concept of conflict of interest in a digital space is pretty much non-existent : without the financial and logistical barriers of retail , if you do n't like what a particular online portal is doing , you can simply set up your own online store or move to another platform .
We were also unable to find any developers who would admit to feeling exploited by Valve .
Quite the opposite actually .
Jakub Dvorsky , from Machinarium developer Amanita Design , told Ars that Valve offers a comparable , and in many cases higher , revenue percentage when compared with other digital distribution outlets .
And for a small independent developer , this makes all the difference .
" I think it 's very good service , " Dvorsky explained .
" It works well and it encourages some people to favor digital copies to boxed versions , which is great for indie developers . "
As for why Pitchford made these comments in spite of the seemingly overwhelmingly positive response we gathered from other developers , we 're still unsure .
Fitterer believes it may have something to do with drumming up some controversy with the impending release of Borderlands .
Which , by the way , is receiving a very nice promotion on Steam right now .

Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi will stop in St. John's , N.L. after leaving the United Nations General Assembly meeting in New York City , the prime minister 's office has said .
Foreign Affairs Minister Lawrence Cannon has been asked to meet with Gadhafi while he's on Canadian soil , to voice concerns regarding Libya 's treatment of the Lockerbie bomber .
" Prime Minister Harper has asked Foreign Affairs Minister Lawrence Cannon to go to St. John 's and meet the Libyan leader , " Dimitri Soudas , a spokesperson for the prime minister 's office , said in a statement .
" Minister Cannon will voice Canada 's strong disapproval over the hero 's welcome organized for Abdel Baset al - Megrahi , the man responsible for the Lockerbie terrorist bombing . "
Soudas underlined that it's not an official visit , and that transatlantic flights often stop to refuel in Newfoundland and Labrador .
It 's also unclear whether Gadhafi will agree to the meeting .
Last month , the Libyan government staged a grandiose celebration to welcome home al - Megrahi , the only person to be convicted in the Lockerbie bombing .
Al - Megrahi was released from a Scottish prison in August on compassionate grounds , because he has terminal cancer .
His high - profile reception in Libya " constituted an insult to all the victims who died including Canadians , " the prime minister 's office said Thursday .
Three Canadians were aboard the doomed plane , which exploded above the Scottish town of Lockerbie in 1988 , killing 270 people .
The Libyan leader is returning from his first appearance before the UN General Assembly .
While there , he delivered an unprecedented 96 minute speech that rambled from one topic to another .
Gadhafi seized power in Libya four decades ago in a military coup .
Since then he has become known as much for his eccentric personality as his political office .
He has been an international pariah for much of his political career .
After the Sept.11 , 2001 attacks , however , Gadhafi publicly renounced his support for terrorism and moved to rekindle ties with the West .

The Perth hospital in which a woman gave birth to a stillborn baby without staff noticing has defended its level of care .
Sharon May was in an induced coma in intensive care while being treated for pneumonia and swine flu at Sir Charles Gairdner Hospital .
Mrs May was 24 weeks ' pregnant , when last month while still in a coma she gave birth to a stillborn boy .
He was found in her bed when a nurse checked on her .
Mrs May 's husband , Danny , says the system has let the family down .
" I think they failed us big time , " he said .
" How can you grieve ?
The body is a broken vessel at the moment .
" How do you deal with it ?
It 's not a question I can answer . "
Hospital management says it is doing all it can to assist the family and it stands by its medical care delivered to all patients admitted with swine flu .
Spokeswoman Dr Shirley
Bowen says the level of care was appropriate .
" We do not believe we have provided anything but excellent care to this woman , " she said .
" We provided a high standard of care .
We followed the obstetrician 's advice completely .
" I do not believe that there was anything in terms of her care that should have been provided and did not provide to prevent this outcome . "
The May family 's lawyer has called for a coronial investigation .
Mr May 's lawyer , John Hammond , says there needs to be a coronial inquiry .
" And there should be a full ministerial investigation as to why the health system has so dramatically failed and is it now in a permanent state of collapse , " he said .
Huzzah : A president at newswire operator Thomson Reuters says traditional journalism is not actually being strangled by Google , blogs and the rest of the internet .
And that anyone who thinks so — * cough * AP * cough* — should get a grip .
Thomson Reuters ' media group president Chris Ahearn recently tweeted that his company " stands ready to help those who wish an alternative to the AP , " the Reuters competitor that has proclaimed it is " mad as hell " at various internet fiends .
AP is trying to charge people for quoting as few as five words of its content .
Ahearn has elaborated on his " alternative " in a blog post , writing that too many traditional media organizations waste manpower " recycling commodity news " and that they should instead seek to retool , including by forging a new " win-win relationship " with new media .
The executive dispenses bluntly with those who would point the finger , like AP :
Blaming the new leaders ... or saber - rattling and threatening to sue are not business strategies – they are personal therapy sessions .
Go ask a music executive how well it works ...
Let 's stop whining and start having real conversations .
It sounds like Ahearn has started just such a " real conversation " himself .
TechDirt has already blogged back .
And Reuters is even authorizing bloggers to " hyperlink " and excerpt its side of things , as God and the U.S. Code intended .
Imagine that .
( CORRECTION :
This post originally stated that Ahearn was president of all Thomson Reuters ; in fact he is president of the firm's " media group . " )

While watching Penn and Teller ’s : Bull Shit ! , a Showtime series about various topics that are about , well bull shit , I noticed this week ’s episode was on violence in video games ( season : 7 episode : 3 , 7 mins ) .
Of course the infamous Jack Thompson was profiled and spouted his usual anti-video game violence babble .
But I was shocked when I saw this right on my TV …
I assume he uses it to play marathon sessions of GTA IV online , but that ’s just my opinion .
What do you think ?
Penn And Teller Bullshit ! : Video Games

Awesome design .
Who else of you have to think of good old Commander Keen ?
The Mintpass Pet Robot has and can the following :
The Pet Care Robot is a Wi -Fi enabled robot with 2 large eyes ( cameras ) , a speaker , microphone and a ball for your pet to play with .
This sounds pretty ordinary , does n't it ?
But ... it is nothing less than a RE - VO - LU - TION !
Just imagine .
Here we do not have a robot , that tries to imitate some pet in a clunky manner , but this is a robot , especially designed to play with your pet .
See the difference ?
Not designed like , but designed for !
Anyway .
I think your pets will need some training as well , to be entertained by this strange looking robot .
How does it work ?
Well , the robot is designed for home - alone pets .
It can play ball with the pet and got cameras to observe the scene .
With a special remote - screen you can observe the scene , i.e. from your workplace , and play with your pet from remote - in form of the robot .
Totally awesome !
Please hand them out the robot - innovation award for lifetime !!

Back in May , I posted this story :
California teacher Jim Corbett lost his case against student Chad Farnan .
Farnan had accused his history teacher of make anti-Christian comments during class and the court agreed .
Based on the lawsuit and the comments I ’d read Corbett had made , I was n’t siding with the teacher ( though I agreed with what he said ) .
I felt his comments were inappropriate .
In any case , there ’s an interesting update to all this .
The student , Chad Farnan , is now a senior in high school and he ’s been giving several speeches at Republican fundraisers in California .
“ Now is the time to fight back , so our rights as Christians and conservatives can be taken back , ” said Farnan , 17 , a senior at Capistrano Valley High School in Mission Viejo . …
“ All these people support me , so I need to support them back and do fundraisers like this , ” Farnan said in an interview . …
“ We need to pray for him because he is under attack for his faith , ” said the fundraiser ’s master of ceremonies , Deborah Pauly , a Villa Park councilwoman . …
“ It ’s important for Republicans like us to support organizations like Advocates for Faith & Freedom , ” Farnan said at the end of his speech Friday .
“ If we all stand together , we can change the world one step at a time . ”
Like I said before , I was n’t siding with the teacher in this case .
And Farnan has the right to speak for whatever causes he wants to .
But I do n’t know what he thinks ought to be “ changed . ”
This was an isolated incident in which a public school teacher disparaged somebody ’s faith .
It does n’t happen very often in the classroom .
You hear far more stories about Christian teachers preaching in the classroom than you do about atheist teachers ripping on religion .
And who is “ attacking ” his faith ?
He can believe what he wants , he can pray in the classroom , he can bring his Bible to school , and he can worship at the flagpole .
What “ rights ” does he want that he does n’t already have ?
I ’m curious about what he plans to do next year .
In college , religion is a much more open topic of discussion and he will be challenged about his faith .
As he should be .
Not by professors directly , but if he takes a science class , they wo n’t be talking about Jesus .
If he dares to interact with students from other faiths , those discussions are going to happen , too .
You ca n’t shelter yourself forever and reality trumps religion every time .

Ancient skeletons discovered in Georgia threaten to overturn the theory of human evolution
For generations , scientists have believed Africa was the cradle of mankind .
Now a stunning archaeological discovery suggests our primitive ancestors left Africa to explore the world around 800,000 years earlier than was previously thought before returning to their home continent .
It was there - hundreds of thousands of years later - that they evolved into modern humans and embarked on a second mass migration , researchers say .
Astonishing discovery : Archaeologists have unearthed six ancient skeletons dating back 1.8 million years in the hills of Georgia
Archaeologists have unearthed six ancient skeletons dating back 1.8 million years in the hills of Georgia which threaten to overturn the theory of human evolution .
The Georgian bones - which include incredibly well preserved skulls and teeth - are the earliest humans ever found outside Africa .
The remains belong to a race of short early humans with small primitive brains who walked and ran like modern people .
They were found alongside stone tools , animal remains and plants - suggesting that they hunted and butchered meat .
Professor David Lordkipanidze with one of the skulls from the Georgia site
Archaeologists now believe that our ancestors left for Europe at least 1.8 million years ago , before returning to Africa and developing into Homo Sapiens
Prof David Lordkipanidze , the direct of the Georgian National Museum , said : ' Before our findings , the prevailing view was that humans came out of Africa almost 1 million years ago , that they already had sophisticated stone tools , and that their body anatomy was quite advanced in terms of brain capacity and limb proportions .
But what we are finding is quite different '
He said Africa was still the unchallenged cradle of mankind .
But he added : ' Georgia may have been the cradle of the first Europeans . '
Their discovery muddies the already complicated history of mankind .
Archaeologists believe that the first true humans - a race of squat people called Homo habilis - evolved in Africa around 2.5 million years ago .
The were followed by a taller athletic species called Homo erectus who migrated out of Africa to colonise Europe and Asia .
Outside Africa their descendents are thought to have died out .
But in Africa , they turned into modern man who began a second wave of migration around 120,000 years ago .
The new finds suggest Homo erectus left Africa far earlier than was previously estimated and lived for a while in Eurasia .
Three skulls all found at the Dmanisi site
The new ancestors - found in Dmanisi - were around 150 cm tall , and had brains half the size of modern people's .
' While the Dmanisi people were almost modern in their body proportions , and were highly efficient walkers and runners , their arms moved in a different way and their brains were tiny compared to ours , ' he told the British Science Festival at Surrey University .
' Their brain capacity is about 600 cubic centimetres .
The prevailing view before this discovery was that the humans who first left Africa had a brain size of about 1,000 cubic centimetres .
' Nevertheless they were sophisticated tool makers with high social and cognitive skills . '
The first Dmanisi fossils were found in 2001 .
The most recent has only just been unearthed and its details have yet to be published in a scientific journal .
Prof Lordkipanidze said the Dmanisi bones may have belonged to an early Homo erectus which lived in Georgia before moving on to the rest of Europe .
Or the early humans may then have returned to Africa , eventually giving rise to our own species , Homoe sapiens , he said .
' The question is whether Homo erectus orginated in Africa or Eurasia , and if in Eurasia , did we have vice - versa migrations ?
This idea looked very stupid a few years ago , but not today , ' he told the British Science Festival .
The KDE community announced yesterday the official release of version 4.3 , a significant new version that brings a number of compelling improvements to the popular open source desktop environment .
According to the developers , over 10,000 bug reports have been resolved since the last version , and over 63,000 changes were committed to the project 's version control system .
These statistics reflect the enormous amount of refinement that is visible in the 4.3 release .
Social Desktop
KDE 4.3 is the first version of the desktop environment to include integration with the KDE community 's Social Desktop initiative .
This project was largely conceived by Frank Karlitschek , the developer behind the openDesktop.org network -- including the popular theming community sites KDE - Look.org and GNOME - Look.org .
Karlitschek has created an API that allows desktop software to interact with his Web sites , making it possible for applications to dip into the community - oriented social networking features and content that he hosts .
The openDesktop.org services include friend and identity systems , a microblogging component , private messaging , desktop theme hosting and search , event tracking , and several other features .
He hopes that his Web APIs will gain cross - desktop acceptance and serve as a generic , vendor - neutral standard that can be implemented by third - party Web services .
He has documented the API , which he calls the Open Collaboration Services ( OCS ) specification , at the FreeDesktop.org wiki and is actively looking for feedback from application developers .
The OCS APIs can be used today to interact with his Web sites , but there are no third - party server implementations yet .
One of the fundamental ideas behind the Social Desktop effort is to facilitate community - building by providing a vehicle for connecting open source software enthusiasts to each other .
It can be used to help inform others about Linux user group meetings , release parties , and similar events .
It can also help you find fellow Linux enthusiasts in your region .
Another important motivator behind the project is the need to simplify the process of providing community - based software support for new users .
The OCS knowledgebase framework , for example , allows users to ask questions about open source software and get answers from other members of the community .
The KDE developers have created a Plasma data engine that supports the OCS APIs .
In KDE 4.3 , it is used by a new social desktop Plasmoid that allows you to send messages to your friends and find users who live in your region .
It is very simple , and its functionality is still somewhat limited , but it 's a good start because it demonstrates how OCS can be used to bring social networking directly to the desktop .
Karlitschek has also launched a Social Desktop contest , offering prizes for developers who can create the most useful and innovative applications with OCS .
This will encourage broader adoption of the APIs and could help attract GNOME developers to OCS , making it a truly cross -desktop effort .
The contest could potentially spawn some new OCS - based applications for future versions of KDE .
It will also help Karlitschek obtain much - needed developer feedback that can aid him in guiding the development of the standard .
Developers can learn more about the contest and how to participate at the Social Desktop web site .
I began examining OCS several months ago , and I discussed the APIs with Karlitschek .
He 's highly receptive to developer input and made a number of improvements to the APIs based on my own feedback and suggestions .
As an experiment to ascertain the viability of bringing OCS to GTK + applications , I implemented support for several features of the service — such as theme searching — in my program , a microblogging client for GNOME called Gwibber .
OCS has a lot of potential , but the APIs still need further refinement before it will be ready for adoption as a cross - desktop standard .
The XML output of some of the API methods , particularly those relating to content , have some idiosyncrasies that will create challenges for parsing and validation .
For example , individual content items can have a variable number of preview and download items , which each have a number in the tagname : downloadlink1 , downloadlink2 , downloadtype2 , etc .
It would obviously be better to structure download items into nested tags so that client applications can simply iterate over a sequence of download element nodes .
I proposed this to Karlitschek , who says that such a change could potentially be considered for future versions of the API but can't be adopted right now because he wants to avoid breaking compatibility with existing applications .
The following example demonstrates how to connect to the service and retrieve the latest items in the activity stream with Python .
It uses the JSON output format .
#!/usr/bin/env python import urllib , urllib2 , json , base64 OCS_USERNAME = " segphault " OCS_PASSWORD = " XXXXXXXXXXXX " HEADER = { " Authorization " : " Basic " + base64.encodestring ( " %s : %s " % ( OCS_USERNAME , OCS_PASSWORD ) ) } API_ROOT = " http://api.opendesktop.org/v1 " request = urllib2.Request ( API_ROOT + " / activity ? " + urllib.urlencode( {" format " : " json " } ) , headers = HEADER ) response = json.load(urllib2.urlopen( request ) ) for message in response [ " data " ] : print message [ " firstname " ] , " - " , message [ " message " ]
OCS is still at a relatively early stage of development , and KDE integration is still largely experimental , but the underlying concept and broader vision are both highly promising .
If the API can be refined and made suitable for broader adoption , it could gain serious traction .

“ Bond yields nudged mortgage rates slightly lower this week , with the fixed - rate mortgage rates falling to three month lows , ” said Frank Nothaft , Freddie Mac vice president and chief economist .
But FBR 's Paul Miller pegs it more on the government buying mortgage backed securities .
" If the Fed backed out of a liquidity stance , treasuries would scream , " says Miller .
" I think the government will try to keep it right around 5 percent . "
That 's because the government needs low mortgage interest rates to support a housing recovery , especially now , as the first time home buyer tax credit expires Nov. 30 .
But will rates go any lower ?
Or did we all miss the boat last spring , when rates hit record lows ?
" Treasury yields and mortgage rates have pulled back on concerns about the sustainability of the economic recovery , particularly with household income and consumer spending weak , " says Bankrate.com 's Senior Financial Analyst Greg McBride .
" However mortgage rates are very dependent on the Fed 's purchases of $ 300 billion in Treasury debt that will expire in October and $ 1.25 trillion in mortgage bond purchases that will expire at year - end .
Unless the economy stumbles , we 're likely to see higher rates in the fourth quarter . "

Two Montana Teacher 's Aides Charged With Abuse of Special Needs Students
Teacher 's aides face felony charges for allegedly abusing special needs teen .
Oct. 22 , 2009  --
Two teacher 's aides face felony charges stemming from allegations that they abused special needs students in their Montana middle school classroom .
Julie Ann Parish and Kristina Marie Kallies are each charged with one felony count of assault on a minor and one misdemeanor charge of endangering the welfare of children after the Great Falls Police Department investigated the alleged December abuse of student Garrett Schilling , then 13 .
The aides are accused of holding Schilling 's head under running water after he fell asleep in class , forcing him to sit in his soiled pants for hours and making him eat his own vomit when he got sick at Great Falls ' North Middle School .
Schilling 's mother , Tifonie Schilling , said her son , now 14 , has Fragile X syndrome , a genetic disorder that leaves him with limited means of communication and results in his showing symptoms often associated with autism .
Because of this , Schilling said , her son was never able to tell her about the brutal treatment he was allegedly receiving at the hands of his own teacher 's aides , which they have denied .
" If the teachers thought Garrett was being lazy or falling asleep at his desk , they forcibly took my son to the kitchen sink in the room and forced his head under the water while he was screaming for his mother , " Schilling said of the alleged incidents .
" And if he had an accident in his pants he was made to sit in it all day .
They would taunt him and say , ' You stink like a baby . '
" They were waterboarding my son , " Schilling said , adding that she learned of the alleged abuse in April 2008 , when a teacher 's aide with whom she was friendly sent her an e-mail warning her of Garrett 's teacher 's aides .
Aides Have Denied the Charges
" Garrett does n't have the verbal skills to tell me what 's happening , " Schilling said .
" He can tell me if he wants a drink or an apple , but he can't have a back and forth conversation with me .
I can never just ask him how his day at school was . "
Parish appeared in Cascade County District Court Monday and was released on $ 5,000 bail .
Kallies is returning from Texas to face charges .
Neither Parish or Kallies have entered formal pleas .
A lawyer for Kallies has not yet been identified , but Daniel Donavan , the attorney representing Parish , declined to comment on the allegations .
Parish and Kallies are no longer teaching in the district schools , according to local media reports .
But , according to court documents , Parish and Kallies both denied abusing Garrett , who attended the school from the fall of 2008 until April 2009 , when his mother pulled him out .
Parish said that while she would " occasionally splash water in [ Garrett 's ] face to wake him up , " she " normally used a wet washcloth , " according to the court documents .
She added that she felt they cleaned Garrett up " appropriately " and never let him remain in his soiled pants for more than a short time , sometimes until the next restroom break .
Kallies , according to the court documents , did admit to pouring water over the back of Garrett 's head but said she used her " cupped hands as a cup " and never " held his head under the faucet . "
But substitute teachers , as well as the teacher 's aide who first informed Schilling that she suspecting something was going on in her son's classroom , said in the court documents that they 'd witnessed firsthand the alleged abuse .
Maria Bubb , a substitute teacher in Garrett 's classroom in October and November of 2008 , said in the court documents that the staff was " mean and degrading " to Garrett , and that Kallies would " point her finger in his face and scream at him . "
Other teachers testified that they saw Garrett 's head held under running water and witnessed him being forced to sit in his feces for hours , not just a few minutes , as the teacher 's aides suggest .
Other Families Come Forward
Randy Tarum , the attorney representing the Schillings , said that since news of the charges against Parish and Kallies were made public , several other families in the school district who have children with special needs have come forward with claims of alleged abuse , some against the same two teacher 's aides .
" I have about 14 other families who have kids who have been subjected , in one way or another , to different schools in the district , " Tarum said of the allegations .
" The abuse comes in varying degrees , and not every child says they were tortured . "
Tarum said that one family said their child was slapped or that behavior devices such as restraints were often misused in special education classrooms .
One mother said that she noticed that her daughter , who has cerebral palsy , was missing chunks of hair on her head , a result of what she believes was the punishment of getting dragged across the floor , Tarum said , declining to say if the charged teacher 's aides were involved in either of these alleged incidents .
So far , Tarum said , he has not received any feedback from the school district .
Repeated calls and messages left for the school district 's attorney , Jean Faure , were not immediately returned .
Tarum said that while the criminal case brought forth by the state is proceeding , he is working to change the way the school system treats special education students before filing a lawsuit on behalf of his clients .
" We 're trying to work with the school district , " Tarum said .
" We 're asking them to identify the children that may have been in contact with these teachers . "
Tarum has also requested that school district officials bring in outside experts to counsel them on how they can improve the district 's special education program .
" A lawsuit is not a great fix for the system , and we 're trying to fix the system , " Tarum said .
As for Garrett , his mother said that while he has since been re-enrolled in a different special education program at an area high school , he is still suffering from the alleged abuse he endured at North Middle School .
" Garrett lives in a world of fear , " she said .
" He does n't understand that when we take him to new places , people wo n't abuse him .
" He 's a great kid .
He loves to swing outside and play with his toys with his brother , " she said .
" He 's a really wonderful , outgoing kid and it's just been devastating to see what 's happening to him . "
Schilling said she is worried that Garrett 's younger brother , Brandon , who also has Fragile X syndrome , could go through a similar experience if the school system is not improved .
" I trusted those teachers , I never in a million years thought this would happen , " Schilling said of the allegations .
" If I do n't change things now this could all happen to Brandon , too . "
For a poignant vignette of Britain 's fabled " special relationship " with the United States , you should know that back in the day , visitors to Tony and Cherie Blair 's small private flat above Downing Street would note that they had prominently displayed no fewer than four pictures of themselves with the Clintons .
How many do you reckon Bill and Hillary had of themselves with the Blairs ?
I 'd guess the full nought , though perhaps the help would have been charged with sticking a small one up in one of the meeting rooms each time the couple paid a fawning visit in their capacity as Dearest Allies .
Just memories now , alas , but owing to Barack Obama 's perceived snubbing of Gordon Brown at one of the 37 summits taking place this week , there has been much talk of " another blow " to the special relationship , as though it were possible to land one on something that does n't exist .
Without wishing to let daylight in on the magic only certain British politicians can see , the special relationship is cobblers .
It is the kind of imagined relationship that a stalker has with the distant target of their affections , whose oblivious " snubs " are taken weirdly , terribly personally .
I need hardly tell you which role is taken by Blighty .
We 're Partridgean mentalists , plastering our house with photos of our crush , and have been ever since Churchill coined the " special relationship " phrase , knowing even as he did so that he was being done over by the Americans on lend - lease .
Three years ago a senior State Department adviser stated that the special relationship was a " myth " .
" It has been , from the very beginning , very one - sided , " Kendall Myers explained starkly .
" There never really has been a special relationship – or at least not one we 've noticed . "
Quelle bitch !
But he 's right , of course .
There have been special interpersonal relationships , like Callaghan and Ford , and Reagan and Thatcher , although the latter became irrationally crestfallen when Ronnie forgot to mention to her that he was invading Grenada .
But for all these pashes , the upshot has been a catalogue of give and take .
We give ; they take .
And who can blame them ?
One of the many geniuses of Armando Iannucci 's movie
In the Loop was the way it showed how that lopsided , anxiety - riven puppy love percolates all the way down the chain of power , with even bag carriers fretting about how to secure face time with their imagined opposite number .
From PMs to PAs , we 're always the rubes in Washington , giddily grateful to be near the seat of real power , scarcely one up from the real - life tourists who gawp their way round the West Wing .
The syndrome is part of our national political makeup , and the minute anyone accedes to power they crave the pat on the head they probably once swore they did n't give a fig for .
He might be standoffish now , but allow me to go out on a limb and wager that David Cameron – who already has plans to reconfigure Downing Street in the mould of the White House West Wing – will do the same .
The more protectionist Obama is forced to get , the more desperate to be noticed Cameron will become .
And so it was this week in New York , with reports claiming that Brown 's request for bilateral talks had been snubbed by Obama five times .
Even the suggestion that the froideur was due to the release of the Lockerbie bomber reinforces the poignancy of the joke , with America 's studied refusal to distinguish between Brown 's government and the Scottish one run by his old adversary redolent of that familiar inquiry of uninterested Americans to touring Scots : " Scotland ?
Is that a town ? "
Eventually , after some heavily publicised angst , Brown got his " walk and talk " , as he and the president took a shortcut out of a dinner through a kitchen .
Do n't you love the idea that they finally hooked up in the kitchen ?
It 's the anti-cool to the uber - cool of that famous shot in Scorsese 's Goodfellas , where the Steadicam follows Henry and Karen into a nightclub via the kitchen entrance .
The New York jockeying , fellow unsophisticates , is what passes for highfalutin diplomacy .
And yet , to those of us unable to take such things seriously , it far more closely resembles high school movies like Clueless , or possibly Mean Girls , with Brown in the Lindsay Lohan role .
And it is n't the most enormous surprise to find Obama not prioritising Brown , what with the class yearbook having voted him " most likely to … not win the next election " .
Still , the PM's got the whole nuclear armageddon thing to take his mind off it for now .
But one can't help feeling that with his number looking fairly up , Brown should start acting in the manner of those divas whose best days are long behind them , but who still insist on playing the big I - Am .
Whenever the next big summit is ( it 'll be around in a fortnight at the current rate ) , British diplomatic aides should fax the prime minister 's demands in advance .
" Mr Brown 's summit rider insists on 37 Diptyque candles ( Narcisse ) , M&Ms with all the brown ones removed , and a public guffaw with the leader of the free world .
Otherwise he does n't come out of his dressing room . "
How could it play out any worse ?
Approximate colors can be assigned to areas on the CIE Chromaticity Diagram .
These are rough categories , and not to be taken as precise statements of color .
The boundaries and the color names are adapted from Brand Fortner , " Number by Color " , Part 5 , SciTech Journal 6 , p32 , May / June 1996 .
Any attempt to depict the gamut of human color vision on a computer monitor must be accompanied by numerous qualifications and exceptions .
In the first place , you cannot display the range of human color perception on an RGB monitor - the gamut of normal human vision covers the entire CIE diagram while the gamut of an RGB monitor can be displayed as a triangular region within the CIE diagram .
Another qualification is that the hue and saturation associated with a given color name can vary over a considerable range .
Add to that the variations with different kinds of display monitors , and you rightly conclude that an accurate rendition is impossible .
With all those excuses , however , it still might be instructive to provide a rough idea of the regions of the CIE Diagram associated with common color names .
The display here was created by choosing representative RGB values for the color regions from a rendition of the 1976 CIE Chromaticity Diagram provided by Photo Research , Inc .
Note that one representative value in about the middle of the hue and saturation ranges was chosen for each section of the diagram .
The point chosen was just a visual judgment of a representative color in the range .
The RGB values obtained are listed in the table at right .
A different observer would likely have chosen different points to represent the color names , but at least these values might provide a starting point for preferred variations .
One characteristic of the commonly used 1931 CIE Chromaticity Diagram that is evident even from this crude portrayal is that the green takes up far too much of the landscape compared to the number of visually different colors in the region .
That was one of the shortcomings that the 1960 and 1976 revisions sought to address .

Though she 's gotten more than 1,000 invites , Sarah Palin has n't made any commitments yet .
Palin gets 1,070 + invitations
Former Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin this week will begin accepting and rejecting the more than 1,070 invitations she has received for paid speeches and political appearances since she resigned from office , aides said .
Twenty speakers ’ bureaus made offers to represent her .
She has signed with Washington Speakers Bureau , which represents everyone from George and Laura Bush to Bob Woodward and Katie Couric to Alan Greenspan , Colin Powell and Rudy Giuliani .

More than 950 requests for speeches have poured in for Palin , and over 120 candidates for office have asked her to appear , including folks running for Senate , House and state Legislature , aides said .
Palin will be doing both paid speeches , which are expected to go for six figures apiece , and unpaid speeches for political and charitable causes , including Christian organizations , groups that support families with special - needs children and military families .
Palin has made no commitments so far , and Washington Speakers Bureau will start responding to the invitations this week .
She ’s about 85 percent finished with her book , due out this spring from HarperCollins .
Then she ’ll begin looking through the inch - and - a - half thick file her lawyer , Robert Barnett , has built of offers for network and cable pundit gigs , documentaries and business opportunities .
Back in June , astronauts onboard the International Space Station took a few spectacular photos of the Sarychev Peak volcano as it exploded in a 5 - mile high plume of ash and gas .
Here 's the even more spectacular video .
The ISS was flying 220 miles over the island of Matua when the volcano erupted in a pyroclastic flow , a howling mass of ash and gas that moves at 130 miles per hour , reaching temperatures up to 1,112 ºF ( 600 ºC ) .
Such a terrible mayhem , yet so beautiful .

Playing into the hands of racists
The implications of the fastest population growth in our history are truly alarming .
This is n't about race .
It 's a question of sheer numbers .
For these overcrowded islands cannot absorb an extra 10 million inhabitants over the next 24 years - more than two - thirds of them first - generation immigrants and their children - without seriously damaging the quality of life for all who live here , whatever the colour of their skin .
Housing and public services are already under huge strain from mass migration .
Yet the Office for National Statistics says we must now brace ourselves for a population of 70 million in just 20 years .
Vile cause : Mainstream parties who ignore the public are doing a favour for the likes of Nick Griffin's BNP
At this rate of growth , we 'll need a new city the size of Bristol every 12 months .
Where is everyone to live ?
With money so tight , who is to pay for the extra roads , trains , hospitals and schools ?
Even more worrying , what impact will these vast numbers have on social cohesion - particularly in the most congested parts of London and the South East , where two - thirds of immigrants settle ?
As Migrationwatch chairman Sir Andrew Green argues so powerfully , this is a timebomb ticking under our environment and the whole nature of our society .
Yet to listen to Immigration Minister Phil Woolas , you 'd think it had already been defused .
With breathtaking complacency , he argues that the Government 's new points - based entry system is solving the problem .
Yet this is the man who promised only last year that the population would never reach 70 million .
Meanwhile , Home Secretary Alan Johnson yawns that he ' does n't lie awake at night ' worrying about it .
Well , opinion polls show 84 per cent of us , including two - thirds of the ethnic minority population , do worry about it .
Rightly , ministers have scrambled to condemn the racist Nick Griffin as he prepares for tonight 's Question Time .
But has anyone done more for the BNP 's vile cause than the mainstream politicians of all parties who ignore the public ?
Act of sabotage
If ministers had legislated 12 years ago to end NHS discrimination against elderly patients , the Mail would have applauded .
But when they do it now , at the very tail end of their administration , we can only gasp at their cynicism .
Health Secretary Andy Burnham is fully aware that lifting the age - bar on expensive treatments will be unaffordable in this grim economic climate .
But he also knows he wo n't have to put the law into practice .
That job will almost certainly fall to the Tories , who will either have to repeal the Equality Act - and look mean - or saddle the country with yet more crippling debt .
This has nothing to do with dignity for the elderly .
Like so many of Labour 's lastminute laws , it 's just a grossly irresponsible attempt to sabotage the next government of Britain .
Sound judgement
Three cheers for the Lord Chief Justice , after his timely warning that judges should never seek to gag Parliament .
Lord Judge also deserves high praise for condemning the ' libel tourism ' that attracts wealthy foreigners to London in the hope of silencing criticism .
It 's good to know that somebody in our increasingly politicised judiciary values Britain 's hard - won freedoms and the public 's right to know .
First - class folly
As tens of thousands of the unemployed gratefully accept the national minimum wage to fill in for them , should n't striking postal workers be asking if this is really the right moment to walk out ?
Or are they truly bent on self - destruction ?
How I grew to hate every computer language Posted by Louis Brandy on 17 August 2009
In the beginning , I knew Basic .
Those were good times .
The Apple II was a pretty decent machine to learn to program on .
It actually did n't take me long to run into the fundamental limits of basic programming , even as a kid .
In particular , it was insanely slow .
I wanted to write games like the games that were already on my computer .
I had learned graphics programming and everything but basic ( QBasic in particular ) just could n't keep up .
There were probably dirty hacks that would make it work , but at the time I realized I needed to switch to a " real " language , and so I bought a C book .
The syntax phase
In this phase , I knew many languages , and I liked them all .
I learned C and some of C++ on my own .
They made me learn Pascal in high school .
And then Java as a freshman in college .
I liked all of these languages .
They were basically all the same .
It was just a matter of trading one syntax for another .
All of the features of each language that made them different were of no interest to me .
I did n't use , need , or want any of those features .
I saw no need for them .
C++ had templates .
Who needs that nonsense ?
Java came with a ton of libraries .
That was alright but it seemed like you were just trading one problem ( a lack of features ) for another ( the need to be married to huge piles of documentation ) .
I was always the kind of guy who preferred working from first principles .
The blub stage
I knew many languages , but my favorite was the one I used the most .
As I got farther into college and began to learn programming languages in depth , I began discovering the holes that these advanced features filled .
I learned , like I usually do , from the " problem end " .
I knew of the solution but never bothered to really learn it until one day a problem arose and finally the feature became justified .
I began diving into various magical features of my favorite language .
At the time , this was C ++. I was operator overloading .
I was using multiple inheritance .
I was a big fan of templates .
I became quite accustomed to the advanced features of C++ and every other language seemed quite lacking .
They all had features I did n't need , and were missing features I did .
The grass is always greener stage
Here , I knew many languages , but my least favorite was the one I used the most .
It takes a long time of using your " favorite language " and all of its features to be able to see the " beauty " in another language and exactly what you are missing .
When you are locked into that single language , you do n't see how it could be improved .
Eventually , though , I came to realize that other languages had some truly fantastic things to offer .
This is when I learned Lisp , Python , and Ruby .
C++ had so many abusive warts .
It was n't until I saw these problems fixed in other languages that I even knew they could be fixed .
I was so sick of ugly templates and insanely verbose code .
I was so sick of static typing and bizarre template hacks to get around it .
I was so sick of operator overloading creating so much magic it was hard to understand .
I was so sick of symbol names being mangled to pieces .
I was really sick of error messages that lasted pages and pages .
And now , I hate all of them
Slowly , over time , I played around with all of those other " grass is greener " languages .
As I began trying more and more languages , I kept finding things I hated in them .
Over time , I became better at this .
I 've done this enough to realize things I hate about a language before I 've really even dove into it .
It still stands though that the less I know about it , the less I hate it .
C++ is pure frustration .
C is so slow ( to develop in , not to run in ) .
Ruby and Python have some serious greatness but also some serious annoyances .
I 've heard really nice things about D. Maybe I 'll play with that .
News and pictures of Mr. Rogallo ’s work for NASA occasionally popped up in the news media .
In 1954 , Mr. Rogallo prophetically told Ford Times , a monthly publication of the Ford Motor Company , that he could envision men walking to the tops of hills and mountains and soaring away .
In Australia , people began to think the new wing might be just the thing for flying behind boats , while adventurous Americans imagined jumping off hills .
In an e-mail message , Nick Greece , editor of United States Hang Gliding and Paragliding Magazine , said the first person to build a glider using the Rogallo wing was Barry Palmer , who learned about Mr. Rogallo ’s work in Aviation Week magazine in August 1961 , and who two months later near Sacramento made the first flight .
Today about 50,000 people glide annually in the United States , with many paying more than $ 4,000 for gliders .
Francis Melvin Rogallo was born in Sanger , Calif. , on Jan. 27 , 1912 , and caught the flying bug at 7 after a barnstormer flew over the town .
Later , when he tried to join the military as a pilot , he was rejected because he had lost part of his right foot in a childhood accident , The Virginian - Pilot reported in 2003 .
He graduated from Stanford with a degree in mechanical and aeronautical engineering in 1935 .
Although the aeronautics advisory committee showed no interest in Mr. Rogallo ’s ideas , he was told he was welcome to work on them on his own time , his daughter said .
So he and his wife used table fans and cardboard to erect wind tunnels at home .
The result was his invention , the design of which they licensed to a kite maker .
His wife , the former Gertrude Sugden , who taught in a one - room school before they were married , died in 2008 .
Mr. Rogallo is survived by his daughters Marie Rogallo Samuels , known as Bunny , Carol Rogallo Sparks and Frances Rogallo MacEachren ; his son , Robert ; three grandchildren ; and seven great - grandchildren .
From the Courier - Mail :
A man who established a sophisticated network of peepholes and cameras to spy on his flatmates has escaped a jail sentence after police were unable to crack an encryption code on his home computer .
[…]
They found a series of holes drilled in to walls and ceilings throughout the Surfers Paradise apartment with wires leading back to Wyllie ’s bedroom .
Police seized his personal computer , but files were encrypted and a video camera was not plugged in .
[…]
In passing sentence , Judge Devereaux took in to account the 33 days Wyllie had spent in custody after being arrested and ordered that two years ’ probation was sufficient punishment , given that there was no hard evidence proving he had secretly recorded his flatmates .
BERN — With a total of $ 23.3 million , or about 23 percent more than last year , the annual paintings and print sale of the Galerie Kornfeld , held in Bern on June 16 - 17 , was well - timed , coinciding as it did with the Art Basel fair , and produced solid results in nearly all categories .
Kornfeld partner Christine Stauffer said that “ it was a good and healthy sale , with the usual ups and downs . ”
At the main Part One sale on June 17 of 19th - and 20th - century art , 80 percent of 150 lots found buyers .
The highest price attained was $ 1.31 million for Paul Klee ’s watercolor Water Pyramids ( Wasserpyramiden ) , 1924 .
It went to a private Swiss collector against fierce competition by Geneva ’s Jan Krugier Gallery , Wolfgang Wittrock , Düsseldorf , and Helmut H. Rumbler , Frankfurt .
Rumbler later won an example of Francisco de Goya ’s Los Caprichos , with 80 etchings in its first 1799 edition , for a rather low $ 208,000 , against an estimate of about $ 196,000 , while Wittrock secured Emil Nolde ’s Mother with Child , 1913 , for a below - estimate $ 379,000 ( estimate : $ 406,000 ) .
The second - highest price was achieved by Max Beckmann ’s landscape Ostende in Stormy Weather . . . , 1932 ( reworked by the artist in 1945 ) , at $ 1.22 million on a commission bid left with the auctioneer .
The most active and visible buyer at this sale was London ’s Helly Nahmad Gallery , which bought , among other works , nearly all the approximately seven paintings by Marc Chagall ( 1887 -1985 ) on offer , led by his late work The Offering to the Painter ( L’offrande au peintre ) , 1983 , for $ 641,000 , doubling the estimate of $ 312,000 .
Other highlights : a painting of children by Augusto Giacometti ( 1877-1947 ) — Peace , created in 1915 , during World War I — that fell for $ 1.18 million ; a bronze Head of Diego on Pedestal , by his renowned second cousin Alberto Giacometti ( 1901 - 66 ) , which took $ 863,000 ; and the Surrealist Variation on the Theme Wind Bride ( Variation über das Thema Windbraut ) , 1928 , by Max Ernst , which fetched $ 794,000 .
Among the few exceptions to the otherwise strong sale were a handful of works by German Expressionists , including Nolde ’s Girl in the Garden , 1915 , and Otto Müller ’s Three Bathing Girls , circa 1913 , that failed to find buyers .
With nearly all its 192 lots sold — the few remaining works were taken by the Galerie Kornfeld on their own stock — the special sale of Lotar Neumann ’s collection of works by German artist Käthe Kollwitz , held on June 16 , underscored the healthy demand for prints of the early 20th century .
The top lot was her Self portrait en face , ca. 1904 , priced at $ 144,400 .
CHRISTIAN VON FABER CASTELL
The End of Fish
Our oceans have been the victims of a giant Ponzi scheme , waged with Bernie Madoff–like callousness by the world ’s fisheries .
Beginning in the 1950s , as their operations became increasingly industrialized -- with onboard refrigeration , acoustic fish - finders , and , later , GPS -- they first depleted stocks of cod , hake , flounder , sole , and halibut in the Northern Hemisphere .
As those stocks disappeared , the fleets moved southward , to the coasts of developing nations and , ultimately , all the way to the shores of Antarctica , searching for icefishes and rockcods , and , more recently , for small , shrimplike krill .
As the bounty of coastal waters dropped , fisheries moved further offshore , to deeper waters .
And , finally , as the larger fish began to disappear , boats began to catch fish that were smaller and uglier -- fish never before considered fit for human consumption .
Many were renamed so that they could be marketed :
The suspicious slimehead became the delicious orange roughy , while the worrisome Patagonian toothfish became the wholesome Chilean seabass .
Others , like the homely hoki , were cut up so they could be sold sight - unseen as fish sticks and filets in fast - food restaurants and the frozen - food aisle .
The scheme was carried out by nothing less than a fishing - industrial complex -- an alliance of corporate fishing fleets , lobbyists , parliamentary representatives , and fisheries economists .
By hiding behind the romantic image of the small - scale , independent fisherman , they secured political influence and government subsidies far in excess of what would be expected , given their minuscule contribution to the GDP of advanced economies -- in the United States , even less than that of the hair salon industry .
In Japan , for example , huge , vertically integrated conglomerates , such as Taiyo or the better - known Mitsubishi , lobby their friends in the Japanese Fisheries Agency and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to help them gain access to the few remaining plentiful stocks of tuna , like those in the waters surrounding South Pacific countries .
Beginning in the early 1980s , the United States , which had not traditionally been much of a fishing country , began heavily subsidizing U.S. fleets , producing its own fishing - industrial complex , dominated by large processors and retail chains .
Today , governments provide nearly $ 30 billion in subsidies each year -- about one - third of the value of the global catch -- that keep fisheries going , even when they have overexploited their resource base .
As a result , there are between two and four times as many boats as the annual catch requires , and yet , the funds to “ build capacity ” keep coming .
The jig , however , is nearly up .
In 1950 , the newly constituted Food and Agriculture Organization ( FAO ) of the United Nations estimated that , globally , we were catching about 20 million metric tons of fish ( cod , mackerel , tuna , etc. ) and invertebrates ( lobster , squid , clams , etc. ) .
That catch peaked at 90 million tons per year in the late 1980s , and it has been declining ever since .
Much like Madoff ’s infamous operation , which required a constant influx of new investments to generate “ revenue ” for past investors , the global fishing - industrial complex has required a constant influx of new stocks to continue operation .
Instead of restricting its catches so that fish can reproduce and maintain their populations , the industry has simply fished until a stock is depleted and then moved on to new or deeper waters , and to smaller and stranger fish .
And , just as a Ponzi scheme will collapse once the pool of potential investors has been drained , so too will the fishing industry collapse as the oceans are drained of life .
Unfortunately , it is not just the future of the fishing industry that is at stake , but also the continued health of the world ’s largest ecosystem .
While the climate crisis gathers front - page attention on a regular basis , people -- even those who profess great environmental consciousness -- continue to eat fish as if it were a sustainable practice .
But eating a tuna roll at a sushi restaurant should be considered no more environmentally benign than driving a Hummer or harpooning a manatee .
In the past 50 years , we have reduced the populations of large commercial fish , such as bluefin tuna , cod , and other favorites , by a staggering 90 percent .
One study , published in the prestigious journal Science , forecast that , by 2048 , all commercial fish stocks will have “ collapsed , ” meaning that they will be generating 10 percent or less of their peak catches .
Whether or not that particular year , or even decade , is correct , one thing is clear :
Fish are in dire peril , and , if they are , then so are we .
The extent of the fisheries ’
Ponzi scheme eluded government scientists for many years .
They had long studied the health of fish populations , of course , but typically , laboratories would focus only on the species in their nation ’s waters .
And those studying a particular species in one country would communicate only with those studying that same species in another .
Thus , they failed to notice an important pattern : Popular species were sequentially replacing each other in the catches that fisheries were reporting , and , when a species faded , scientific attention shifted to the replacement species .
At any given moment , scientists might acknowledge that one - half or two - thirds of fisheries were being overfished , but , when the stock of a particular fish was used up , it was simply removed from the denominator of the fraction .
For example , the Hudson River sturgeon was n’t counted as an overfished stock once it disappeared from New York waters ; it simply became an anecdote in the historical record .
The baselines just kept shifting , allowing us to continue blithely damaging marine ecosystems .
One day – if it's not happening already – they will teach Trafigura in business schools .
This will be the scenario for aspiring MBAs .
You are in charge of a large but comfortably anonymous trading company based in London and you have a tiresome PR problem .
Three thousand miles away there are 30,000 Africans in one of the poorest countries in the world claiming to have been injured by your company dumping toxic sludge .
You are being hit by one of the biggest lawsuits in history .
Worse , you now have a bunch of journalists on your case .
What to do ?
The business school textbooks will advocate a mix of carrot and stick .
In charge of your carrot you hire Lord ( Tim ) Bell , who once performed a similar role on behalf of Mrs Thatcher .
He will be in charge of attempts to reposition positive public perceptions of the Trafigura brand .
He might , for instance , suggest you become an official sponsor of the British Lions tour of South Africa and an arts prize .
And in charge of your stick you hire Britain 's most notorious firm of libel lawyers , Messrs Carter - Ruck , who like to boast of their reputation for applying chloroform over the noses of troublesome editors .
For a while all goes well , especially on the stick front .
Carter - Ruck spray threatening letters around newsrooms from Oslo to Abidjan .
They launch an action against the BBC .
And they persuade a judge to suppress a confidential but embarrassing document which has fallen into journalists ' hands .
A new term is coined : " super - injunctions " , whereby the existence of court proceedings and court orders are themselves secret .
Nice work , large cheques all round .
But the plan began to unravel rather rapidly on Monday when it transpired that an MP , Paul Farrelly , had tabled a question about the injunction and the awkward document in parliament .
That was bad enough , what with the nuisance of 300 - odd years of precedent affirming the right of the press to report whatever MPs say or do .
There was a tiresomely teasing story on the Guardian front page .
And then there was Twitter .
It took one tweet on Monday evening as I left the office to light the virtual touchpaper .
At five past nine I tapped : " Now Guardian prevented from reporting parliament for unreportable reasons .
Did John Wilkes live in vain ? "
Twitter 's detractors are used to sneering that nothing of value can be said in 140 characters .
My 104 characters did just fine .
By the time I got home , after stopping off for a meal with friends , the Twittersphere had gone into meltdown .
Twitterers had sleuthed down Farrelly 's question , published the relevant links and were now seriously on the case .
By midday on Tuesday " Trafigura " was one of the most searched terms in Europe , helped along by re-tweets by Stephen Fry and his 830,000 - odd followers .
Many tweeters were just registering support or outrage .
Others were beavering away to see if they could find suppressed information on the far reaches of the web .
One or two legal experts uncovered the Parliamentary Papers Act 1840 , wondering if that would help ?
Common #hashtags were quickly developed , making the material easily discoverable .
By lunchtime – an hour before we were due in court – Trafigura threw in the towel .
The textbook stuff – elaborate carrot , expensive stick – had been blown away by a newspaper together with the mass collaboration of total strangers on the web .
Trafigura thought it was buying silence .
A combination of old media – the Guardian – and new – Twitter – turned attempted obscurity into mass notoriety .
So this week 's Trafigura fiasco ought to be taught to aspiring MBAs and would - be journalists .
They might nod in passing to the memory of John Wilkes , the scabrous hack and MP who risked his life to win the right to report parliament .
An 18th - century version of crowd - sourcing played its part in that , too .
Everyone hates captchas .
I know I do .
It sucks but they are a necessary evil .
Most captchas are difficult ( sometimes impossible ) to read and they will consistantly drive visitors from your site .
I ’ve been on sites where the captcha was so hard to decipher that I ’ve never gone back .
During the development of a new site I was forced to create one of these evil entities .
It was surprisingly simple and painless .
The captcha that I outline here is very , very simple and should never be used in production without a fair amount of tweaking .
Having developed my site using php I naturally turned to the GD library .
Firstly I generated a random string to display on the captcha :
// generate a random alphanumeric string of a specific length function gen_random_string ( $ length ) { $ characters = " 0123456789ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWZYZ
" .

Now that I have my string I need to create the image .
Make sure that GD is installed on your php apache server .
The code above will generate a GD captcha image with random coloring and random horizontal and vertical spacing on top of a background image .
Now we just need to output it .
So if I called this file simple - captcha. php I could call it with this html :
Here is what it looks like :
This captcha can be strengthened by using other GD image functions such as imagefilledellipse and imageline to create artifacts in the background .
It also helps to use different fonts and to change the angle of the letters .
More than 800 World Trade Center rescue and recovery workers have died since 9/11 — and cancer has killed at least 270 of those heroes , new data show .
The figures also show that 33 WTC responders committed suicide .
State researchers have tallied 817 deaths of workers and volunteers who toiled at toxic Ground Zero or the Fresh Kills landfill , where rubble was sifted .
“ It ’s still a huge undercount , ” a source told The Post , adding that cases were still being collected .
The state Health Department ’s WTC Responder Fatalities Investigation has so far reviewed death and medical records in 642 cases and found 479 responders who succumbed to illness , including cancers .
Another 149 suffered “ traumatic deaths ” in such incidents as drug overdoses , car crashes , fires and assaults — including 27 who died in the line of duty .
Another 12 died while serving in the military in Iraq and Afghanistan .
The number of deaths documented has soared since last September , when researchers listed 664 fatalities and confirmed 224 , including 94 cancer cases .
The rise is largely due to city agencies and WTC medical programs sharing more records , officials said .
About 50,000 firefighters , cops , EMTs , other workers and volunteers joined in the 9/11 rescue and recovery .
Cancers killing the most WTC workers include those of the stomach , colon , liver and other digestive organs ( 80 ) , lung and throat ( 69 ) , and blood cells , such as leukemia ( 37 ) .
Another recent study found blood cancers hitting responders at ages much younger than normal .
Last month , cancer claimed veteran firefighter John McNamara , 44 , of Engine Co. 234 in Crown Heights , Brooklyn .
He had logged about 500 hours in the smoky WTC pit searching for victims and later helped in New Orleans after Hurricane Katrina .
He left a wife , Jennifer , and a 2 - year - old son , Jack .
“ Guys with cancer are swept under the rug , ” he had told The Post .
McNamara was diagnosed with advanced colon cancer in 2006 at age 41 — about 10 years before colonoscopy tests are recommended .
He urged more screening of firefighters to look for early warnings .
“ How many of the thousands of guys who retired after 9/11 have polyps or tumors they do n’t even know about ? ” he asked .
The 33 suicides did not surprise experts .
Many responders cracked under the stress of health , financial and emotional problems , said Michael Arcari , an ex-NYPD official and director of Faithful Response , a mental health program for 9/11 responders .
“ I believe the number is higher , based not just on what they went through at Ground Zero , but in the aftermath –how it turned their lives and families upside down , ” Arcari said .

As I write , highly civilized human beings are flying overhead , trying to kill me .
They do not feel any enmity against me as an individual , nor I against them .
They are ‘ only doing their duty ’ , as the saying goes .
Most of them , I have no doubt , are kind - hearted law - abiding men who would never dream of committing murder in private life .
On the other hand , if one of them succeeds in blowing me to pieces with a well - placed bomb , he will never sleep any the worse for it .
He is serving his country , which has the power to absolve him from evil .
One cannot see the modern world as it is unless one recognizes the overwhelming strength of patriotism , national loyalty .
In certain circumstances it can break down , at certain levels of civilization it does not exist , but as a positive force there is nothing to set beside it .
Christianity and international Socialism are as weak as straw in comparison with it .
Hitler and Mussolini rose to power in their own countries very largely because they could grasp this fact and their opponents could not .
Also , one must admit that the divisions between nation and nation are founded on real differences of outlook .
Till recently it was thought proper to pretend that all human beings are very much alike , but in fact anyone able to use his eyes knows that the average of human behaviour differs enormously from country to country .
Things that could happen in one country could not happen in another .
Hitler 's June purge , for instance , could not have happened in England .
And , as western peoples go , the English are very highly differentiated .
There is a sort of back - handed admission of this in the dislike which nearly all foreigners feel for our national way of life .
Few Europeans can endure living in England , and even Americans often feel more at home in Europe .
When you come back to England from any foreign country , you have immediately the sensation of breathing a different air .
Even in the first few minutes dozens of small things conspire to give you this feeling .
The beer is bitterer , the coins are heavier , the grass is greener , the advertisements are more blatant .
The crowds in the big towns , with their mild knobby faces , their bad teeth and gentle manners , are different from a European crowd .
Then the vastness of England swallows you up , and you lose for a while your feeling that the whole nation has a single identifiable character .
Are there really such things as nations ?
Are we not forty - six million individuals , all different ?
And the diversity of it , the chaos !
The clatter of clogs in the Lancashire mill towns , the to - and - fro of the lorries on the Great North Road , the queues outside the Labour Exchanges , the rattle of pin-tables in the Soho pubs , the old maids hiking to Holy Communion through the mists of the autumn morning – all these are not only fragments , but characteristic fragments , of the English scene .
How can one make a pattern out of this muddle ?
But talk to foreigners , read foreign books or newspapers , and you are brought back to the same thought .
Yes , there is something distinctive and recognizable in English civilization .
It is a culture as individual as that of Spain .
It is somehow bound up with solid breakfasts and gloomy Sundays , smoky towns and winding roads , green fields and red pillar - boxes .
It has a flavour of its own .
Moreover it is continuous , it stretches into the future and the past , there is something in it that persists , as in a living creature .
What can the England of 1940 have in common with the England of 1840 ?
But then , what have you in common with the child of five whose photograph your mother keeps on the mantelpiece ?
Nothing , except that you happen to be the same person .
And above all , it is your civilization , it is you .
However much you hate it or laugh at it , you will never be happy away from it for any length of time .
The suet puddings and the red pillar - boxes have entered into your soul .
Good or evil , it is yours , you belong to it , and this side the grave you will never get away from the marks that it has given you .
Meanwhile England , together with the rest of the world , is changing .
And like everything else it can change only in certain directions , which up to a point can be foreseen .
That is not to say that the future is fixed , merely that certain alternatives are possible and others not .
A seed may grow or not grow , but at any rate a turnip seed never grows into a parsnip .
It is therefore of the deepest importance to try and determine what England is , before guessing what part England can play in the huge events that are happening .

National characteristics are not easy to pin down , and when pinned down they often turn out to be trivialities or seem to have no connexion with one another .
Spaniards are cruel to animals , Italians can do nothing without making a deafening noise , the Chinese are addicted to gambling .
Obviously such things do n't matter in themselves .
Nevertheless , nothing is causeless , and even the fact that Englishmen have bad teeth can tell something about the realities of English life .
Here are a couple of generalizations about England that would be accepted by almost all observers .
One is that the English are not gifted artistically .
They are not as musical as the Germans or Italians , painting and sculpture have never flourished in England as they have in France .
Another is that , as Europeans go , the English are not intellectual .
They have a horror of abstract thought , they feel no need for any philosophy or systematic ‘ world - view ’ .
Nor is this because they are ‘ practical ’ , as they are so fond of claiming for themselves .
One has only to look at their methods of town planning and water supply , their obstinate clinging to everything that is out of date and a nuisance , a spelling system that defies analysis , and a system of weights and measures that is intelligible only to the compilers of arithmetic books , to see how little they care about mere efficiency .
But they have a certain power of acting without taking thought .
Their world - famed hypocrisy – their double - faced attitude towards the Empire , for instance – is bound up with this .
Also , in moments of supreme crisis the whole nation can suddenly draw together and act upon a species of instinct , really a code of conduct which is understood by almost everyone , though never formulated .
The phrase that Hitler coined for the Germans , ‘ a sleep - walking people ’ , would have been better applied to the English .
Not that there is anything to be proud of in being called a sleep - walker .
But here it is worth noting a minor English trait which is extremely well marked though not often commented on , and that is a love of flowers .
This is one of the first things that one notices when one reaches England from abroad , especially if one is coming from southern Europe .
Does it not contradict the English indifference to the arts ?
Not really , because it is found in people who have no aesthetic feelings whatever .
What it does link up with , however , is another English characteristic which is so much a part of us that we barely notice it , and that is the addiction to hobbies and spare - time occupations , the privateness of English life .
We are a nation of flower - lovers , but also a nation of stamp - collectors , pigeon - fanciers , amateur carpenters , coupon - snippers , darts - players , crossword - puzzle fans .
All the culture that is most truly native centres round things which even when they are communal are not official – the pub , the football match , the back garden , the fireside and the ‘ nice cup of tea ’ .
The liberty of the individual is still believed in , almost as in the nineteenth century .
But this has nothing to do with economic liberty , the right to exploit others for profit .
It is the liberty to have a home of your own , to do what you like in your spare time , to choose your own amusements instead of having them chosen for you from above .
The most hateful of all names in an English ear is Nosey Parker .
It is obvious , of course , that even this purely private liberty is a lost cause .
Like all other modern people , the English are in process of being numbered , labelled , conscripted , ‘ co- ordinated ’ .
But the pull of their impulses is in the other direction , and the kind of regimentation that can be imposed on them will be modified in consequence .
No party rallies , no Youth Movements , no coloured shirts , no Jew - baiting or ‘ spontaneous ’ demonstrations .
No Gestapo either , in all probability .
But in all societies the common people must live to some extent against the existing order .
The genuinely popular culture of England is something that goes on beneath the surface , unofficially and more or less frowned on by the authorities .
One thing one notices if one looks directly at the common people , especially in the big towns , is that they are not puritanical .
They are inveterate gamblers , drink as much beer as their wages will permit , are devoted to bawdy jokes , and use probably the foulest language in the world .
They have to satisfy these tastes in the face of astonishing , hypocritical laws ( licensing laws , lottery acts , etc. etc. ) which are designed to interfere with everybody but in practice allow everything to happen .
Also , the common people are without definite religious belief , and have been so for centuries .
The Anglican Church never had a real hold on them , it was simply a preserve of the landed gentry , and the Nonconformist sects only influenced minorities .
And yet they have retained a deep tinge of Christian feeling , while almost forgetting the name of Christ .
The power - worship which is the new religion of Europe , and which has infected the English intelligentsia , has never touched the common people .
They have never caught up with power politics .
The ‘ realism ’ which is preached in Japanese and Italian newspapers would horrify them .
One can learn a good deal about the spirit of England from the comic coloured postcards that you see in the windows of cheap stationers ’ shops .
These things are a sort of diary upon which the English people have unconsciously recorded themselves .
Their old - fashioned outlook , their graded snobberies , their mixture of bawdiness and hypocrisy , their extreme gentleness , their deeply moral attitude to life , are all mirrored there .
The gentleness of the English civilization is perhaps its most marked characteristic .
You notice it the instant you set foot on English soil .
It is a land where the bus conductors are good - tempered and the policemen carry no revolvers .
In no country inhabited by white men is it easier to shove people off the pavement .
And with this goes something that is always written off by European observers as ‘ decadence ’ or hypocrisy , the English hatred of war and militarism .
It is rooted deep in history , and it is strong in the lower - middle class as well as the working class .
Successive wars have shaken it but not destroyed it .
Well within living memory it was common for ‘ the redcoats ’ to be booed at in the streets and for the landlords of respectable public houses to refuse to allow soldiers on the premises .
In peace time , even when there are two million unemployed , it is difficult to fill the ranks of the tiny standing army , which is officered by the country gentry and a specialized stratum of the middle class , and manned by farm labourers and slum proletarians .
The mass of the people are without military knowledge or tradition , and their attitude towards war is invariably defensive .
No politician could rise to power by promising them conquests or military ‘ glory ’ , no Hymn of Hate has ever made any appeal to them .
In the last war the songs which the soldiers made up and sang of their own accord were not vengeful but humorous and mock - defeatist ( 1 ) .
The only enemy they ever named was the sergeant - major .
In England all the boasting and flag - wagging , the ‘ Rule Britannia ’ stuff , is done by small minorities .
The patriotism of the common people is not vocal or even conscious .
They do not retain among their historical memories the name of a single military victory .
English literature , like other literatures , is full of battle - poems , but it is worth noticing that the ones that have won for themselves a kind of popularity are always a tale of disasters and retreats .
There is no popular poem about Trafalgar or Waterloo , for instance .
Sir John Moore 's army at Corunna , fighting a desperate rearguard action before escaping overseas ( just like Dunkirk ! ) has more appeal than a brilliant victory .
The most stirring battle - poem in English is about a brigade of cavalry which charged in the wrong direction .
And of the last war , the four names which have really engraved themselves on the popular memory are Mons , Ypres , Gallipoli and Passchendaele , every time a disaster .
The names of the great battles that finally broke the German armies are simply unknown to the general public .
The reason why the English anti-militarism disgusts foreign observers is that it ignores the existence of the British Empire .
It looks like sheer hypocrisy .
After all , the English have absorbed a quarter of the earth and held on to it by means of a huge navy .
How dare they then turn round and say that war is wicked ?
It is quite true that the English are hypocritical about their Empire .
In the working class this hypocrisy takes the form of not knowing that the Empire exists .
But their dislike of standing armies is a perfectly sound instinct .
A navy employs comparatively few people , and it is an external weapon which cannot affect home politics directly .
Military dictatorships exist everywhere , but there is no such thing as a naval dictatorship .
What English people of nearly all classes loathe from the bottom of their hearts is the swaggering officer type , the jingle of spurs and the crash of boots .
Decades before Hitler was ever heard of , the word ‘ Prussian ’ had much the same significance in England as ‘ Nazi ’ has today .
So deep does this feeling go that for a hundred years past the officers of the British army , in peace time , have always worn civilian clothes when off duty .
One rapid but fairly sure guide to the social atmosphere of a country is the parade - step of its army .
A military parade is really a kind of ritual dance , something like a ballet , expressing a certain philosophy of life .
The goose - step , for instance , is one of the most horrible sights in the world , far more terrifying than a dive - bomber .
It is simply an affirmation of naked power ; contained in it , quite consciously and intentionally , is the vision of a boot crashing down on a face .
Its ugliness is part of its essence , for what it is saying is ‘ Yes , I am ugly , and you dare n't laugh at me ’ , like the bully who makes faces at his victim .
Why is the goose - step not used in England ?
There are , heaven knows , plenty of army officers who would be only too glad to introduce some such thing .
It is not used because the people in the street would laugh .
Beyond a certain point , military display is only possible in countries where the common people dare not laugh at the army .
The Italians adopted the goose - step at about the time when Italy passed definitely under German control , and , as one would expect , they do it less well than the Germans .
The Vichy government , if it survives , is bound to introduce a stiffer parade - ground discipline into what is left of the French army .
In the British army the drill is rigid and complicated , full of memories of the eighteenth century , but without definite swagger ; the march is merely a formalized walk .
It belongs to a society which is ruled by the sword , no doubt , but a sword which must never be taken out of the scabbard .
And yet the gentleness of English civilization is mixed up with barbarities and anachronisms .
Our criminal law is as out - of - date as the muskets in the Tower .
Over against the Nazi Storm Trooper you have got to set that typically English figure , the hanging judge , some gouty old bully with his mind rooted in the nineteenth century , handing out savage sentences .
In England people are still hanged by the neck and flogged with the cat o’ nine tails .
Both of these punishments are obscene as well as cruel , but there has never been any genuinely popular outcry against them .
People accept them ( and Dartmoor , and Borstal ) almost as they accept the weather .
They are part of ‘ the law ’ , which is assumed to be unalterable .
Here one comes upon an all - important English trait : the respect for constitutionalism and legality , the belief in ‘ the law ’ as something above the State and above the individual , something which is cruel and stupid , of course , but at any rate incorruptible .
It is not that anyone imagines the law to be just .
Everyone knows that there is one law for the rich and another for the poor .
But no one accepts the implications of this , everyone takes it for granted that the law , such as it is , will be respected , and feels a sense of outrage when it is not .
Remarks like ‘ They can't run me in ; I have n't done anything wrong ’ , or ‘ They can't do that ; it 's against the law ’ , are part of the atmosphere of England .
The professed enemies of society have this feeling as strongly as anyone else .
One sees it in prison - books like Wilfred Macartney 's Walls Have Mouths or Jim Phelan 's Jail Journey , in the solemn idiocies that take place at the trials of conscientious objectors , in letters to the papers from eminent Marxist professors , pointing out that this or that is a ‘ miscarriage of British justice ’ .
Everyone believes in his heart that the law can be , ought to be , and , on the whole , will be impartially administered .
The totalitarian idea that there is no such thing as law , there is only power , has never taken root .
Even the intelligentsia have only accepted it in theory .
An illusion can become a half - truth , a mask can alter the expression of a face .
The familiar arguments to the effect that democracy is ‘ just the same as ’ or ‘ just as bad as ’ totalitarianism never take account of this fact .
All such arguments boil down to saying that half a loaf is the same as no bread .
In England such concepts as justice , liberty and objective truth are still believed in .
They may be illusions , but they are very powerful illusions .
The belief in them influences conduct , national life is different because of them .
In proof of which , look about you .
Where are the rubber truncheons , where is the castor oil ?
The sword is still in the scabbard , and while it stays there corruption cannot go beyond a certain point .
The English electoral system , for instance , is an all but open fraud .
In a dozen obvious ways it is gerrymandered in the interest of the moneyed class .
But until some deep change has occurred in the public mind , it cannot become completely corrupt .
You do not arrive at the polling booth to find men with revolvers telling you which way to vote , nor are the votes miscounted , nor is there any direct bribery .
Even hypocrisy is a powerful safeguard .
The hanging judge , that evil old man in scarlet robe and horse - hair wig , whom nothing short of dynamite will ever teach what century he is living in , but who will at any rate interpret the law according to the books and will in no circumstances take a money bribe , is one of the symbolic figures of England .
He is a symbol of the strange mixture of reality and illusion , democracy and privilege , humbug and decency , the subtle network of compromises , by which the nation keeps itself in its familiar shape .
III
I have spoken all the while of ‘ the nation ’ , ‘ England ’ , ‘ Britain ’ , as though forty - five million souls could somehow be treated as a unit .
But is not England notoriously two nations , the rich and the poor ?
Dare one pretend that there is anything in common between people with £ 100,000 a year and people with £ 1 a week ?
And even Welsh and Scottish readers are likely to have been offended because I have used the word ‘ England ’ oftener than ‘ Britain ’ , as though the whole population dwelt in London and the Home Counties and neither north nor west possessed a culture of its own .
One gets a better view of this question if one considers the minor point first .
It is quite true that the so - called races of Britain feel themselves to be very different from one another .
A Scotsman , for instance , does not thank you if you call him an Englishman .
You can see the hesitation we feel on this point by the fact that we call our islands by no less than six different names , England , Britain , Great Britain , the British Isles , the United Kingdom and , in very exalted moments , Albion .
Even the differences between north and south England loom large in our own eyes .
But somehow these differences fade away the moment that any two Britons are confronted by a European .
It is very rare to meet a foreigner , other than an American , who can distinguish between English and Scots or even English and Irish .
To a Frenchman , the Breton and the Auvergnat seem very different beings , and the accent of Marseilles is a stock joke in Paris .
Yet we speak of ‘ France ’ and ‘ the French ’ , recognizing France as an entity , a single civilization , which in fact it is .
So also with ourselves .
Looked at from the outsider even the cockney and the Yorkshireman have a strong family resemblance .
And even the distinction between rich and poor dwindles somewhat when one regards the nation from the outside .
There is no question about the inequality of wealth in England .
It is grosser than in any European country , and you have only to look down the nearest street to see it .
Economically , England is certainly two nations , if not three or four .
But at the same time the vast majority of the people feel themselves to be a single nation and are conscious of resembling one another more than they resemble foreigners .
Patriotism is usually stronger than class - hatred , and always stronger than any kind of internationalism .
Except for a brief moment in 1920 ( the ‘ Hands off Russia ’ movement ) the British working class have never thought or acted internationally .
For two and a half years they watched their comrades in Spain slowly strangled , and never aided them by even a single strike ( 2 ) .
But when their own country ( the country of Lord Nuffield and Mr Montagu Norman ) was in danger , their attitude was very different .
At the moment when it seemed likely that England might be invaded , Anthony Eden appealed over the radio for Local Defence Volunteers .
He got a quarter of a million men in the first twenty - four hours , and another million in the subsequent month .
One has only to compare these figures with , for instance , the number of conscientious objectors to see how vast is the strength of traditional loyalties compared with new ones .
In England patriotism takes different forms in different classes , but it runs like a connecting thread through nearly all of them .
Only the Europeanized intelligentsia are really immune to it .
As a positive emotion it is stronger in the middle class than in the upper class – the cheap public schools , for instance , are more given to patriotic demonstrations than the expensive ones – but the number of definitely treacherous rich men , the Laval - Quisling type , is probably very small .
In the working class patriotism is profound , but it is unconscious .
The working man 's heart does not leap when he sees a Union Jack .
But the famous ‘ insularity ’ and ‘ xenophobia ’ of the English is far stronger in the working class than in the bourgeoisie .
In all countries the poor are more national than the rich , but the English working class are outstanding in their abhorrence of foreign habits .
Even when they are obliged to live abroad for years they refuse either to accustom themselves to foreign food or to learn foreign languages .
Nearly every Englishman of working - class origin considers it effeminate to pronounce a foreign word correctly .
During the war of 1914 - 18 the English working class were in contact with foreigners to an extent that is rarely possible .
The sole result was that they brought back a hatred of all Europeans , except the Germans , whose courage they admired .
In four years on French soil they did not even acquire a liking for wine .
The insularity of the English , their refusal to take foreigners seriously , is a folly that has to be paid for very heavily from time to time .
But it plays its part in the English mystique , and the intellectuals who have tried to break it down have generally done more harm than good .
At bottom it is the same quality in the English character that repels the tourist and keeps out the invader .
Here one comes back to two English characteristics that I pointed out , seemingly at random , at the beginning of the last chapter .
One is the lack of artistic ability .
This is perhaps another way of saying that the English are outside the European culture .
For there is one art in which they have shown plenty of talent , namely literature .
But this is also the only art that cannot cross frontiers .
Literature , especially poetry , and lyric poetry most of all , is a kind of family joke , with little or no value outside its own language - group .
Except for Shakespeare , the best English poets are barely known in Europe , even as names .
The only poets who are widely read are Byron , who is admired for the wrong reasons , and Oscar Wilde , who is pitied as a victim of English hypocrisy .
And linked up with this , though not very obviously , is the lack of philosophical faculty , the absence in nearly all Englishmen of any need for an ordered system of thought or even for the use of logic .
Up to a point , the sense of national unity is a substitute for a ‘ world - view ’ .
Just because patriotism is all but universal and not even the rich are uninfluenced by it , there can be moments when the whole nation suddenly swings together and does the same thing , like a herd of cattle facing a wolf .
There was such a moment , unmistakably , at the time of the disaster in France .
After eight months of vaguely wondering what the war was about , the people suddenly knew what they had got to do : first , to get the army away from Dunkirk , and secondly to prevent invasion .
It was like the awakening of a giant .
Quick !
Danger !
The Philistines be upon thee , Samson !
And then the swift unanimous action – and , then , alas , the prompt relapse into sleep .
In a divided nation that would have been exactly the moment for a big peace movement to arise .
But does this mean that the instinct of the English will always tell them to do the right thing ?
Not at all , merely that it will tell them to do the same thing .
In the 1931 General Election , for instance , we all did the wrong thing in perfect unison .
We were as single - minded as the Gadarene swine .
But I honestly doubt whether we can say that we were shoved down the slope against our will .
It follows that British democracy is less of a fraud than it sometimes appears .
A foreign observer sees only the huge inequality of wealth , the unfair electoral system , the governing - class control over the press , the radio and education , and concludes that democracy is simply a polite name for dictatorship .
But this ignores the considerable agreement that does unfortunately exist between the leaders and the led .
However much one may hate to admit it , it is almost certain that between 1931 and 1940 the National Government represented the will of the mass of the people .
It tolerated slums , unemployment and a cowardly foreign policy .
Yes , but so did public opinion .
It was a stagnant period , and its natural leaders were mediocrities .
In spite of the campaigns of a few thousand left - wingers , it is fairly certain that the bulk of the English people were behind Chamberlain 's foreign policy .
More , it is fairly certain that the same struggle was going on in Chamberlain 's mind as in the minds of ordinary people .
His opponents professed to see in him a dark and wily schemer , plotting to sell England to Hitler , but it is far likelier that he was merely a stupid old man doing his best according to his very dim lights .
It is difficult otherwise to explain the contradictions of his policy , his failure to grasp any of the courses that were open to him .
Like the mass of the people , he did not want to pay the price either of peace or of war .
And public opinion was behind him all the while , in policies that were completely incompatible with one another .
It was behind him when he went to Munich , when he tried to come to an understanding with Russia , when he gave the guarantee to Poland , when he honoured it , and when he prosecuted the war half - heartedly .
Only when the results of his policy became apparent did it turn against him ; which is to say that it turned against its own lethargy of the past seven years .
Thereupon the people picked a leader nearer to their mood , Churchill , who was at any rate able to grasp that wars are not won without fighting .
Later , perhaps , they will pick another leader who can grasp that only Socialist nations can fight effectively .
Do I mean by all this that England is a genuine democracy ?
No , not even a reader of the Daily Telegraph could quite swallow that .
England is the most class - ridden country under the sun .
It is a land of snobbery and privilege , ruled largely by the old and silly .
But in any calculation about it one has got to take into account its emotional unity , the tendency of nearly all its inhabitants to feel alike and act together in moments of supreme crisis .
It is the only great country in Europe that is not obliged to drive hundreds of thousands of its nationals into exile or the concentration camp .
At this moment , after a year of war , newspapers and pamphlets abusing the Government , praising the enemy and clamouring for surrender are being sold on the streets , almost without interference .
And this is less from a respect for freedom of speech than from a simple perception that these things do n't matter .
It is safe to let a paper like Peace News be sold , because it is certain that ninety - five per cent of the population will never want to read it .
The nation is bound together by an invisible chain .
At any normal time the ruling class will rob , mismanage , sabotage , lead us into the muck ; but let popular opinion really make itself heard , let them get a tug from below that they cannot avoid feeling , and it is difficult for them not to respond .
The left - wing writers who denounce the whole of the ruling class as ‘ pro - Fascist ’ are grossly over - simplifying .
Even among the inner clique of politicians who brought us to our present pass , it is doubtful whether there were any conscious traitors .
The corruption that happens in England is seldom of that kind .
Nearly always it is more in the nature of self - deception , of the right hand not knowing what the left hand doeth .
And being unconscious , it is limited .
One sees this at its most obvious in the English press .
Is the English press honest or dishonest ?
At normal times it is deeply dishonest .
All the papers that matter live off their advertisements , and the advertisers exercise an indirect censorship over news .
Yet I do not suppose there is one paper in England that can be straightforwardly bribed with hard cash .
In the France of the Third Republic all but a very few of the newspapers could notoriously be bought over the counter like so many pounds of cheese .
Public life in England has never been openly scandalous .
It has not reached the pitch of disintegration at which humbug can be dropped .
England is not the jewelled isle of Shakespeare 's much - quoted message , nor is it the inferno depicted by Dr Goebbels .
More than either it resembles a family , a rather stuffy Victorian family , with not many black sheep in it but with all its cupboards bursting with skeletons .
It has rich relations who have to be kow - towed to and poor relations who are horribly sat upon , and there is a deep conspiracy of silence about the source of the family income .
It is a family in which the young are generally thwarted and most of the power is in the hands of irresponsible uncles and bedridden aunts .
Still , it is a family .
It has its private language and its common memories , and at the approach of an enemy it closes its ranks .
A family with the wrong members in control – that , perhaps , is as near as one can come to describing England in a phrase .

Probably the battle of Waterloo was won on the playing - fields of Eton , but the opening battles of all subsequent wars have been lost there .
One of the dominant facts in English life during the past three quarters of a century has been the decay of ability in the ruling class .
In the years between 1920 and 1940 it was happening with the speed of a chemical reaction .
Yet at the moment of writing it is still possible to speak of a ruling class .
Like the knife which has had two new blades and three new handles , the upper fringe of English society is still almost what it was in the mid nineteenth century .
After 1832 the old land - owning aristocracy steadily lost power , but instead of disappearing or becoming a fossil they simply intermarried with the merchants , manufacturers and financiers who had replaced them , and soon turned them into accurate copies of themselves .
The wealthy shipowner or cotton - miller set up for himself an alibi as a country gentleman , while his sons learned the right mannerisms at public schools which had been designed for just that purpose .
England was ruled by an aristocracy constantly recruited from parvenus .
And considering what energy the self - made men possessed , and considering that they were buying their way into a class which at any rate had a tradition of public service , one might have expected that able rulers could be produced in some such way .
And yet somehow the ruling class decayed , lost its ability , its daring , finally even its ruthlessness , until a time came when stuffed shirts like Eden or Halifax could stand out as men of exceptional talent .
As for Baldwin , one could not even dignify him with the name of stuffed shirt .
He was simply a hole in the air .
The mishandling of England 's domestic problems during the nineteen - twenties had been bad enough , but British foreign policy between 1931 and 1939 is one of the wonders of the world .
Why ?
What had happened ?
What was it that at every decisive moment made every British statesman do the wrong thing with so unerring an instinct ?
The underlying fact was that the whole position of the moneyed class had long ceased to be justifiable .
There they sat , at the centre of a vast empire and a world - wide financial network , drawing interest and profits and spending them – on what ?
It was fair to say that life within the British Empire was in many ways better than life outside it .
Still , the Empire was underdeveloped , India slept in the Middle Ages , the Dominions lay empty , with foreigners jealously barred out , and even England was full of slums and unemployment .
Only half a million people , the people in the country houses , definitely benefited from the existing system .
Moreover , the tendency of small businesses to merge together into large ones robbed more and more of the moneyed class of their function and turned them into mere owners , their work being done for them by salaried managers and technicians .
For long past there had been in England an entirely functionless class , living on money that was invested they hardly knew where , the ‘ idle rich ’ , the people whose photographs you can look at in the Tatler and the Bystander , always supposing that you want to .
The existence of these people was by any standard unjustifiable .
They were simply parasites , less useful to society than his fleas are to a dog .
By 1920 there were many people who were aware of all this .
By 1930 millions were aware of it .
But the British ruling class obviously could not admit to themselves that their usefulness was at an end .
Had they done that they would have had to abdicate .
For it was not possible for them to turn themselves into mere bandits , like the American millionaires , consciously clinging to unjust privileges and beating down opposition by bribery and tear - gas bombs .
After all , they belonged to a class with a certain tradition , they had been to public schools where the duty of dying for your country , if necessary , is laid down as the first and greatest of the Commandments .
They had to feel themselves true patriots , even while they plundered their countrymen .
Clearly there was only one escape for them – into stupidity .
They could keep society in its existing shape only by being unable to grasp that any improvement was possible .
Difficult though this was , they achieved it , largely by fixing their eyes on the past and refusing to notice the changes that were going on round them .
There is much in England that this explains .
It explains the decay of country life , due to the keeping - up of a sham feudalism which drives the more spirited workers off the land .
It explains the immobility of the public schools , which have barely altered since the eighties of the last century .
It explains the military incompetence which has again and again startled the world .
Since the fifties every war in which England has engaged has started off with a series of disasters , after which the situation has been saved by people comparatively low in the social scale .
The higher commanders , drawn from the aristocracy , could never prepare for modern war , because in order to do so they would have had to admit to themselves that the world was changing .
They have always clung to obsolete methods and weapons , because they inevitably saw each war as a repetition of the last .
Before the Boer War they prepared for the Zulu War , before the 1914 for the Boer War , and before the present war for 1914 .
Even at this moment hundreds of thousands of men in England are being trained with the bayonet , a weapon entirely useless except for opening tins .
It is worth noticing that the navy and , latterly , the air force , have always been more efficient than the regular army .
But the navy is only partially , and the air force hardly at all , within the ruling - class orbit .
It must be admitted that so long as things were peaceful the methods of the British ruling class served them well enough .
Their own people manifestly tolerated them .
However unjustly England might be organized , it was at any rate not torn by class warfare or haunted by secret police .
The Empire was peaceful as no area of comparable size has ever been .
Throughout its vast extent , nearly a quarter of the earth , there were fewer armed men than would be found necessary by a minor Balkan state .
As people to live under , and looking at them merely from a liberal , negative standpoint , the British ruling class had their points .
They were preferable to the truly modern men , the Nazis and Fascists .
But it had long been obvious that they would be helpless against any serious attack from the outside .
They could not struggle against Nazism or Fascism , because they could not understand them .
Neither could they have struggled against Communism , if Communism had been a serious force in western Europe .
To understand Fascism they would have had to study the theory of Socialism , which would have forced them to realize that the economic system by which they lived was unjust , inefficient and out - of - date .
But it was exactly this fact that they had trained themselves never to face .
They dealt with Fascism as the cavalry generals of 1914 dealt with the machine - guns – by ignoring it .
After years of aggression and massacres , they had grasped only one fact , that Hitler and Mussolini were hostile to Communism .
Therefore , it was argued , they must be friendly to the British dividend - drawer .
Hence the truly frightening spectacle of Conservative M.P.s wildly cheering the news that British ships , bringing food to the Spanish Republican government , had been bombed by Italian aeroplanes .
Even when they had begun to grasp that Fascism was dangerous , its essentially revolutionary nature , the huge military effort it was capable of making , the sort of tactics it would use , were quite beyond their comprehension .
At the time of the Spanish Civil War , anyone with as much political knowledge as can be acquired from a sixpenny pamphlet on Socialism knew that , if Franco won , the result would be strategically disastrous for England ; and yet generals and admirals who had given their lives to the study of war were unable to grasp this fact .
This vein of political ignorance runs right through English official life , through Cabinet ministers , ambassadors , consuls , judges , magistrates , policemen .
The policeman who arrests the ‘ red ’ does not understand the theories the ‘ red ’ is preaching ; if he did his own position as bodyguard of the moneyed class might seem less pleasant to him .
There is reason to think that even military espionage is hopelessly hampered by ignorance of the new economic doctrines and the ramifications of the underground parties .
The British ruling class were not altogether wrong in thinking that Fascism was on their side .
It is a fact that any rich man , unless he is a Jew , has less to fear from Fascism than from either Communism or democratic Socialism .
One ought never to forget this , for nearly the whole of German and Italian propaganda is designed to cover it up .
The natural instinct of men like Simon , Hoare , Chamberlain etc. was to come to an agreement with Hitler .
But – and here the peculiar feature of English life that I have spoken of , the deep sense of national solidarity , comes in – they could only do so by breaking up the Empire and selling their own people into semi-slavery .
A truly corrupt class would have done this without hesitation , as in France .
But things had not gone that distance in England .
Politicians who would make cringing speeches about ‘ the duty of loyalty to our conquerors ’ are hardly to be found in English public life .
Tossed to and fro between their incomes and their principles , it was impossible that men like Chamberlain should do anything but make the worst of both worlds .
One thing that has always shown that the English ruling class are morally fairly sound , is that in time of war they are ready enough to get themselves killed .
Several dukes , earls and what nots were killed in the recent campaign in Flanders .
That could not happen if these people were the cynical scoundrels that they are sometimes declared to be .
It is important not to misunderstand their motives , or one cannot predict their actions .
What is to be expected of them is not treachery , or physical cowardice , but stupidity , unconscious sabotage , an infallible instinct for doing the wrong thing .
They are not wicked , or not altogether wicked ; they are merely unteachable .
Only when their money and power are gone will the younger among them begin to grasp what century they are living in .

The stagnation of the Empire in the between - war years affected everyone in England , but it had an especially direct effect upon two important sub-sections of the middle class .
One was the military and imperialist middle class , generally nicknamed the Blimps , and the other the left - wing intelligentsia .
These two seemingly hostile types , symbolic opposites – the half - pay colonel with his bull neck and diminutive brain , like a dinosaur , the highbrow with his domed forehead and stalk - like neck – are mentally linked together and constantly interact upon one another ; in any case they are born to a considerable extent into the same families .
Thirty years ago the Blimp class was already losing its vitality .
The middle - class families celebrated by Kipling , the prolific lowbrow families whose sons officered the army and navy and swarmed over all the waste places of the earth from the Yukon to the Irrawaddy , were dwindling before 1914 .
The thing that had killed them was the telegraph .
In a narrowing world , more and more governed from Whitehall , there was every year less room for individual initiative .
Men like Clive , Nelson , Nicholson , Gordon would find no place for themselves in the modern British Empire .
By 1920 nearly every inch of the colonial empire was in the grip of Whitehall .
Well - meaning , over - civilized men , in dark suits and black felt hats , with neatly rolled umbrellas crooked over the left forearm , were imposing their constipated view of life on Malaya and Nigeria , Mombasa and Mandalay .
The one - time empire builders were reduced to the status of clerks , buried deeper and deeper under mounds of paper and red tape .
In the early twenties one could see , all over the Empire , the older officials , who had known more spacious days , writhing impotently under the changes that were happening .
From that time onwards it has been next door to impossible to induce young men of spirit to take any part in imperial administration .
And what was true of the official world was true also of the commercial .
The great monopoly companies swallowed up hosts of petty traders .
Instead of going out to trade adventurously in the Indies one went to an office stool in Bombay or Singapore .
And life in Bombay or Singapore was actually duller and safer than life in London .
Imperialist sentiment remained strong in the middle class , chiefly owing to family tradition , but the job of administering the Empire had ceased to appeal .
Few able men went east of Suez if there was any way of avoiding it .
But the general weakening of imperialism , and to some extent of the whole British morale , that took place during the nineteen - thirties , was partly the work of the left - wing intelligentsia , itself a kind of growth that had sprouted from the stagnation of the Empire .
It should be noted that there is now no intelligentsia that is not in some sense ‘ left ’ .
Perhaps the last right - wing intellectual was T. E. Lawrence .
Since about 1930 everyone describable as an ‘ intellectual ’ has lived in a state of chronic discontent with the existing order .
Necessarily so , because society as it was constituted had no room for him .
In an Empire that was simply stagnant , neither being developed nor falling to pieces , and in an England ruled by people whose chief asset was their stupidity , to be ‘ clever ’ was to be suspect .
If you had the kind of brain that could understand the poems of T. S. Eliot or the theories of Karl Marx , the higher - ups would see to it that you were kept out of any important job .
The intellectuals could find a function for themselves only in the literary reviews and the left - wing political parties .
The mentality of the English left - wing intelligentsia can be studied in half a dozen weekly and monthly papers .
The immediately striking thing about all these papers is their generally negative , querulous attitude , their complete lack at all times of any constructive suggestion .
There is little in them except the irresponsible carping of people who have never been and never expect to be in a position of power .
Another marked characteristic is the emotional shallowness of people who live in a world of ideas and have little contact with physical reality .
Many intellectuals of the Left were flabbily pacifist up to 1935 , shrieked for war against Germany in the years 1935 - 9 , and then promptly cooled off when the war started .
It is broadly though not precisely true that the people who were most ‘ anti-Fascist ’ during the Spanish Civil War are most defeatist now .
And underlying this is the really important fact about so many of the English intelligentsia – their severance from the common culture of the country .
In intention , at any rate , the English intelligentsia are Europeanized .
They take their cookery from Paris and their opinions from Moscow .
In the general patriotism of the country they form a sort of island of dissident thought .
England is perhaps the only great country whose intellectuals are ashamed of their own nationality .
In left - wing circles it is always felt that there is something slightly disgraceful in being an Englishman and that it is a duty to snigger at every English institution , from horse racing to suet puddings .
It is a strange fact , but it is unquestionably true that almost any English intellectual would feel more ashamed of standing to attention during ‘ God save the King ’ than of stealing from a poor box .
All through the critical years many left - wingers were chipping away at English morale , trying to spread an outlook that was sometimes squashily pacifist , sometimes violently pro-Russian , but always anti-British .
It is questionable how much effect this had , but it certainly had some .
If the English people suffered for several years a real weakening of morale , so that the Fascist nations judged that they were ‘ decadent ’ and that it was safe to plunge into war , the intellectual sabotage from the Left was partly responsible .
Both the New Statesman and the News Chronicle cried out against the Munich settlement , but even they had done something to make it possible .
Ten years of systematic Blimp - baiting affected even the Blimps themselves and made it harder than it had been before to get intelligent young men to enter the armed forces .
Given the stagnation of the Empire , the military middle class must have decayed in any case , but the spread of a shallow Leftism hastened the process .
It is clear that the special position of the English intellectuals during the past ten years , as purely negative creatures , mere anti-Blimps , was a by - product of ruling - class stupidity .
Society could not use them , and they had not got it in them to see that devotion to one 's country implies ‘ for better , for worse ’ .
Both Blimps and highbrows took for granted , as though it were a law of nature , the divorce between patriotism and intelligence .
If you were a patriot you read Blackwood 's Magazine and publicly thanked God that you were ‘ not brainy ’ .
If you were an intellectual you sniggered at the Union Jack and regarded physical courage as barbarous .
It is obvious that this preposterous convention cannot continue .
The Bloomsbury highbrow , with his mechanical snigger , is as out - of - date as the cavalry colonel .
A modern nation cannot afford either of them .
Patriotism and intelligence will have to come together again .
It is the fact that we are fighting a war , and a very peculiar kind of war , that may make this possible .
VI
One of the most important developments in England during the past twenty years has been the upward and downward extension of the middle class .
It has happened on such a scale as to make the old classification of society into capitalists , proletarians and petit bourgeois ( small property - owners ) almost obsolete .
England is a country in which property and financial power are concentrated in very few hands .
Few people in modern England own anything at all , except clothes , furniture and possibly a house .
The peasantry have long since disappeared , the independent shopkeeper is being destroyed , the small businessman is diminishing in numbers .
But at the same time modern industry is so complicated that it cannot get along without great numbers of managers , salesmen , engineers , chemists and technicians of all kinds , drawing fairly large salaries .
And these in turn call into being a professional class of doctors , lawyers , teachers , artists , etc. etc .
The tendency of advanced capitalism has therefore been to enlarge the middle class and not to wipe it out as it once seemed likely to do .
But much more important than this is the spread of middle - class ideas and habits among the working class .
The British working class are now better off in almost all ways than they were thirty years ago .
This is partly due to the efforts of the trade unions , but partly to the mere advance of physical science .
It is not always realized that within rather narrow limits the standard of life of a country can rise without a corresponding rise in real wages .
Up to a point , civilization can lift itself up by its boot - tags .
However unjustly society is organized , certain technical advances are bound to benefit the whole community , because certain kinds of goods are necessarily held in common .
A millionaire cannot , for example , light the streets for himself while darkening them for other people .
Nearly all citizens of civilized countries now enjoy the use of good roads , germ - free water , police protection , free libraries and probably free education of a kind .
Public education in England has been meanly starved of money , but it has nevertheless improved , largely owing to the devoted efforts of the teachers , and the habit of reading has become enormously more widespread .
To an increasing extent the rich and the poor read the same books , and they also see the same films and listen to the same radio programmes .
And the differences in their way of life have been diminished by the mass - production of cheap clothes and improvements in housing .
So far as outward appearance goes , the clothes of rich and poor , especially in the case of women , differ far less than they did thirty or even fifteen years ago .
As to housing , England still has slums which are a blot on civilization , but much building has been done during the past ten years , largely by the local authorities .
The modern council house , with its bathroom and electric light , is smaller than the stockbroker 's villa , but it is recognizably the same kind of house , which the farm labourer 's cottage is not .
A person who has grown up in a council housing estate is likely to be – indeed , visibly is – more middle class in outlook than a person who has grown up in a slum .
The effect of all this is a general softening of manners .
It is enhanced by the fact that modern industrial methods tend always to demand less muscular effort and therefore to leave people with more energy when their day 's work is done .
Many workers in the light industries are less truly manual labourers than is a doctor or a grocer .
In tastes , habits , manners and outlook the working class and the middle class are drawing together .
The unjust distinctions remain , but the real differences diminish .
The old - style ‘ proletarian ’ – collarless , unshaven and with muscles warped by heavy labour – still exists , but he is constantly decreasing in numbers ; he only predominates in the heavy - industry areas of the north of England .
After 1918 there began to appear something that had never existed in England before : people of indeterminate social class .
In 1910 every human being in these islands could be ‘ placed ’ in an instant by his clothes , manners and accent .
That is no longer the case .
Above all , it is not the case in the new townships that have developed as a result of cheap motor cars and the southward shift of industry .
The place to look for the germs of the future England is in light - industry areas and along the arterial roads .
In Slough , Dagenham , Barnet , Letchworth , Hayes – everywhere , indeed , on the outskirts of great towns – the old pattern is gradually changing into something new .
In those vast new wildernesses of glass and brick the sharp distinctions of the older kind of town , with its slums and mansions , or of the country , with its manor - houses and squalid cottages , no longer exist .
There are wide gradations of income , but it is the same kind of life that is being lived at different levels , in labour - saving flats or council houses , along the concrete roads and in the naked democracy of the swimming - pools .
It is a rather restless , cultureless life , centring round tinned food , Picture Post , the radio and the internal combustion engine .
It is a civilization in which children grow up with an intimate knowledge of magnetoes and in complete ignorance of the Bible .
To that civilization belong the people who are most at home in and most definitely of the modern world , the technicians and the higher - paid skilled workers , the airmen and their mechanics , the radio experts , film producers , popular journalists and industrial chemists .
They are the indeterminate stratum at which the older class distinctions are beginning to break down .
This war , unless we are defeated , will wipe out most of the existing class privileges .
There are every day fewer people who wish them to continue .
Nor need we fear that as the pattern changes life in England will lose its peculiar flavour .
The new red cities of Greater London are crude enough , but these things are only the rash that accompanies a change .
In whatever shape England emerges from the war it will be deeply tinged with the characteristics that I have spoken of earlier .
The intellectuals who hope to see it Russianized or Germanized will be disappointed .
The gentleness , the hypocrisy , the thoughtlessness , the reverence for law and the hatred of uniforms will remain , along with the suet puddings and the misty skies .
It needs some very great disaster , such as prolonged subjugation by a foreign enemy , to destroy a national culture .
The Stock Exchange will be pulled down , the horse plough will give way to the tractor , the country houses will be turned into children 's holiday camps , the Eton and Harrow match will be forgotten , but England will still be England , an everlasting animal stretching into the future and the past , and , like all living things , having the power to change out of recognition and yet remain the same .

Dear Mr. Stapledon ,
I would have thanked you for your book before , but I have been very busy and have only just had time to read it .
I do n’t suppose that I have understood more than a small part – all the same I have understood enough to be greatly interested , and elated too , since sometimes it seems to me that you are grasping ideas that I have tried to express , much more fumblingly , in fiction .
But you have gone much further and I can’t help …
Capcom Forgot How To Count Again
by David ' Hades ' Becker [ Tuesday , 29th of September 2009 - 07:45 PM ]
Just announced for for the XBox and PS3 is the " new " Super Street Fighter IV .
Yes they are counting it as a new game , or at least a " follow up " to the hit Street Fighter IV .
It will have new characters , as you will see below in the images and video .
It will have a few more added on features like a 2D mode and new ultra combos , but could n't this have been done via a DLC update to the current game ?
I mean it is just eight new characters and moves .
It could n't be all that difficult .
I just hope this does n't mean that they are going to go back to just re-releasing their recent games with new titles and a few extra features .
Well outside of the Resident Evil Archive games .
But you know what I mean .
I think I 'll quit with Capcom if I see Ultra Super Street Fighter IV Turbo .
Unless the add the sub tag , The Search For More Money On AN Old Title .
Then we'd be cool .
But hey , at least this one will have T .

US President Barack Obama , on his first trip to sub-Saharan Africa since taking office , has said Africa must take charge of its own destiny in the world .
Mr Obama told parliament in Ghana during a one - day stay that good governance was vital for development .
Major challenges awaited Africans in the new century , he said , but vowed that the US would help the continent .
The US president 's trip came at the end of a summit of eight of the world 's most powerful nations , held in Italy .
Ghana was chosen as the destination for the president 's visit because of its strong democratic record .
After his speech , Mr Obama headed to Cape Coast Castle , a seaside fortress converted to the slave trade by the British in the 17th Century .
He was accompanied by his wife , Michelle , a descendant of African slaves , and both of his young daughters .
People crowded into a public area outside the fort to greet Mr Obama , with those unable to get a place in the throng climbing onto nearby roofs and filling balconies just to catch a glimpse of the US leader .
Speaking after a tour of the fort , Mr Obama said the fort should be a source of hope as well as repository of painful memories .
" It reminds us that as bad as history can be , it 's always possible to overcome , " he said .
Africa 's choice Earlier in the day , Mr Obama spoke to members of parliament after a breakfast meeting with Ghanaian President John Atta Mills .
He wore a broad grin as he was greeted at the podium by a series of rousing horn blasts from within the hall .
Development depends upon good governance .
And that is a responsibility that can only be met by Africans
US President Barack Obama
Key excerpts : Obama 's speech
In pictures : Obama in Ghana Obama hope amid dark memories Send us your comments " Congress needs one of them , " Mr Obama joked , before turning to more serious matters .
" I have come here to Ghana for a simple reason , " the US president said : " The 21st Century will be shaped by what happens not just in Rome or Moscow or Washington , but by what happens in Ghana as well . "
Delivering a message that " Africa 's future is up to Africans " , Mr Obama conceded that the legacy of colonialism had helped breed conflict on the continent .
" But the West is not responsible for the destruction of the Zimbabwean economy over the last decade , or wars in which children are enlisted as combatants , " he added .
He praised Ghana 's own progress , governance and economic growth , saying Ghana 's achievements were less dramatic than the liberation struggles of the 20th Century but would ultimately be more significant .
" Development depends upon good governance , " Mr Obama told legislators .
" That is the ingredient which has been missing in far too many places , for far too long .
" And that is a responsibility that can only be met by Africans . "
' Yes you can '
Expanding on his message , Mr Obama said four key areas were critical to the future of Africa and of the entire developing world , citing democracy , opportunity , health and the peaceful resolution of conflict .
ANALYSIS Andrew Harding , BBC News , Accra
The speech has gone down extremely well .
This is a country that has been enormously proud to play host to Mr Obama and referred to him as a brother .
People say endlessly that he is part of the family and they are expecting a great deal of him .
It was a very broad - ranging speech but Mr Obama has an ability because of his heritage , his Kenyan father , to reach out and speak to Africans in a way that I think most foreign leaders would find very difficult .
There are very few barriers for Mr Obama in this conversation that he is trying to initiate with Africans and I think that this speech will have ticked many , many boxes .
This is Mr Obama trying to link Africa into the international community .
He hailed Ghana 's democratic society , calling for strong parliaments , honest police , independent judges and a free press across Africa .
However , there were some blunt words directed at other countries , many of which have been undermined by despotic leaders and corrupt politicians .
" Africa does n't need strongmen , it needs strong institutions , " Mr Obama told his audience .
" No person wants to live in a society where the rule of law gives way to the rule of brutality and bribery .
That is not democracy , that is tyranny . "
He pledged to continue strong US support for public healthcare initiatives in Africa , and called for sensible use of natural resources such as oil in the face of the threat of climate change .
" Africa is not the crude caricature of a continent at war , " Mr Obama added .
" But for far too many Africans , conflict is a part of life , as constant as the sun .
He described wars as a " millstone around Africa 's neck " .
" You have the power to hold your leaders accountable , and to build institutions that serve the people , " Mr Obama said , describing freedom as Africa 's " inheritance " and urging the continent to beat disease , end conflict and bring long - lasting change .
Barack Obama 's speech was welcomed by Ghanaians of all ages
In an echo of his presidential election campaign , he drew his speech to a close with a version of his trademark slogan : " Yes you can , " he told the gathered legislators .
Speaking to the BBC , Kenyan Prime Minister Raila Odinga welcomed the speech .
" We should stop blaming colonialism for our under - development .
We really need to address issues of governance , because I believe it is the mediocrity with which Africa has been governed that is responsible for our backwardness today . "
Mr Obama arrived in the capital late on Friday , fresh from the G8 summit in Italy where heads of state agreed on a $ 20 bn ( £ 12.3 bn ) fund to bolster agriculture - the main source of income for many sub-Saharan Africans .
He left after dark on Saturday , offering a final thanks for his welcome .
" As somebody whose father comes from Africa I am pleased this visit has been particularly meaningful for me , " Mr Obama said .

Darren , from the UK , is a video game " modder . "
And he did his thing on Total War a while ago .
He added Book of Mormon names and places to the game , allowing players to enter the Promised Land and the battles that took place between the Nephites and Lamanites !
Check out this game trailer :
As it is a mod , you will need a copy of Total War with the Barbarian Invasion expansion , along with the mod file provided by Darren , via the Book of Mormon Battles website ( link ) .
On the Book of Mormon Battles page , near the bottom , Darren gives thanks to several who contributed to helping him complete the project .
It looks like there were a bunch of people who helped out .
It 's great to see that so many are open and willing to share their talents with others .
Overall , it looks like a fantastic game !
I really need to get a copy and try it out .
Remember when Lord of the Rings won MMO of the Year in 2008 ?
Okay , I vaguely do , but Turbine has announced an expansion , which only ramps up the awesomeness value .
While it seems the expansion is n’t free like initially thought , Siege of Mirkwood looks like it ’s going to deliver quite nicely .
Let ’s go over some of the new features , shall we ?
Increased level cap to 65 .
That ’s not too surprising .
Lots of expansions up the level cap .
Skirmishes .
Creating and leading your own soldiers into battle in an MMO ?
That could be totally awesome !
Crafting your own Legendary Items .
Let me explain a bit ; these items will grow with you and can be customized quite nicely .
It ’s a feature that , if done right , can lead to an exciting sense of accomplishment .
Turbine ’s also planning on improving their old mechanics , which is definitely a good thing .
Word ’s not yet in whether or not these improvements will be available without the expansion .
All in all , it ’s pretty exciting .
It might be enough to make me buy up a subscription and write a review !
… Maybe .

I want them to eliminate ( or make optional ) those time - wasting , redundant , airtime - eating , 15 - second recorded instructions that you hear every time you leave a message for someone ( or call to retrieve your own ) .
To my delight , the campaign has taken on a life of its own .
It ’s been written up on 28,032 blogs ; I ’ve done a number of radio and podcast interviews ; and the carriers report that “ thousands and thousands ” of complaints have poured in .
As a reminder , here ’s where to direct your complaints ( Sprint already lets you remove the message ) :
* Verizon : Post a complaint here : //bit.ly / FJncH .
* AT&T : Send e-mail to : customerissues@attnews.us .
* T - Mobile : Post a complaint here : //bit.ly/2rKy0u .
So how is the campaign doing ?
Has it had any effect on the carriers ?
Is there any hope of making those ridiculous , infuriating instructions optional ?
Yes .
Here ’s where it stands , carrier by carrier .
* AT&T : “ We are going to make some changes . ”
AT&T supplied an actual e-mail address for reader complaints , and apparently it was flooded .
The huge majority of e-mail notes were emphatic but polite .
( For those of you who sent abusive notes , a tip : that ’s not the way to get things done . )
Anyway , here ’s the big news of the day : it worked .
Mark Siegel , AT&T ’s executive director of media relations , wrote with some very encouraging news :
David :
All the messages we got from customers really made us look again at how we handle voice mail , and we are going to make some changes .
I commend you for raising the issue . —
First , we really appreciate hearing from the thousands of customers who have contacted us . —
As I know you know , any customer with our Visual Voicemail service does not listen to an upfront voicemail message .
Today , our iPhone customers enjoy Visual Voicemail .
In the near future , we will make Visual Voice Mail available on other devices . —
In the meantime , we are actively exploring how to shorten the voicemail message on our other handsets .
( He also reminded us that when you call an AT&T customer , you can always “ hit pound to get around ” the instructions recording .
Problem is , of course , that you ’d need some way to know when you ’re calling an AT&T customer , because the keystroke that bypasses the message is different on each carrier — it ’s * on Verizon , 1 on Sprint , # on T - Mobile and AT&T . )
In any case , this is fantastic news , and it came so fast !
Congratulations to AT&T for sacrificing millions of dollars in revenue in order to make life easier and more efficient for the rest of us .
This , clearly , is a company that really does listen to its customers .
And at least on this issue , it ’s putting its money where its mouth is .
* T - Mobile : “ This issue has our attention ”
T- Mobile has also gotten the message loud and clear ; at last count , there were 38 pages of complaints on the “ Take Back the Beep ” forum the company created for this purpose .
When I asked if the campaign was reaching T - Mobile ’s decision makers , this statement is as far as company would go :
T- Mobile is always looking for ways to improve our customers ’ experience , and this issue has our attention .
We appreciate the feedback we ’ve received from our customers , and these comments are being taken into consideration in our planning .
The wheels of progress turn slowly in cellular companies — we can’t expect instant results — but I take this statement as a good sign .
* Sprint : Change it yourself
Sprint already lets you eliminate those instructions .
It ’s not simple , and it ’s not publicized , but it ’s possible .
If you ’re a Sprint customer , I encourage you to make this change right away :
Access your voicemail box .
Press 3 for personal options .
Press 2 for greetings .
Press 1 , to change your personal greeting .
Press 3 to add or remove the caller instructions .
Follow the prompts to turn instructions on or off .
* Verizon : “ — “
Verizon ’s PR contact , Tom Pica , has n’t responded to my request for a progress report .
He ’s probably still irritated at me .
When ABC News interviewed him about this campaign , he told them that customers can already turn off the instructions .
Which is n’t true .
So that night on Twitter , I said that he was lying .
He called me to let me know that he was n’t lying — he was misquoted .
What he said was that you can turn off * voicemail altogether * if you do n’t like the 15 - second instructions .
Well , O.K. , but …huh ?
Is n’t that like saying , “ My son bites his nails , so let ’s chop off his hands ” ?
In the meantime , Verizon is the only company who ’s been responding to every single reader complaint .
Its customer - service reps are sending out a canned reply , which insists that “ The voice mail instructions are there to assist the many callers who may be unfamiliar with the correct prompts . ”
Oh , give me a break .
You ’d have to search very , very hard to find somebody who has n’t , in the last 40 years , ever heard the concept of speaking at the beep .
The canned response goes on to point out that you can press * to bypass the instructions ( if , again , you know that you ’re calling a Verizon customer , which you ca n’t possibly know ) , and that you can also shut off voicemail altogether ( the baby - with - bathwater approach ) .
I also heard from a manager at Verizon who asked to remain anonymous , but he or she did share this much : “ Your blog about the take back the beep is a major success and thorn in the side of the cell phone company I work for . ”
So that ’s something .
Thanks to everyone who ’s helped to join this campaign .
It looks as though , by focusing our unhappiness and organizing our resistance , we ’re going to wind up creating real change in the world .
And it ’s a great feeling .
Next up : war , disease and global warming .
The Virgin ’s Guide to Viral Marketing
Since its public boom in 1996 , the Internet and social media has mirrored human development in one important manner : weâ€™re now in the middle of the awkward , hormone - ridden age of middle school .
As sites like Digg , Propeller , and Reddit begin to blossom from niche political communities and into girls sought after by acne - ridden social media marketers such as ourselves , we must keep a few things in mind .
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â
Like middle school , there will always be the â€œjockâ€  marketers with epic mustaches always getting laid first and bullying you around .
If you find yourself to be one of these 13 year olds admiring the upper lip fur of sites such as Cracked , College Humor , the Huffington Post , or the Onion as you stare at the social networks beauties from a distance , donâ€™t give up hope .
Like the jocks that ruined your life in middle school , these sites have just figured out the elements of viral marketing at a younger age .
Perhaps their marketing team flipped across some late night Skin - a - Max during their first sleepover . . . but whatever they did worked .
Sites such as this were able to figure out the anatomy of social networks years before the rest of the Internet .
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â
How have these Internet jocks diffused themselves from the rest of the virgins in the schoolyard ?
Itâ€™s simple : they just put themselves into the mindset of a 13 year old .
As the rest of you struggle to reach first base on these sites , these are the 6 simple rules that could help you cop a feel in the world of viral marketing .
Rule 1 : Be Relevant to the Girl .
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Relevancy to the audience is the difference between getting your first dance with Mary Jane Rottencrotch , or your first kiss from Susie Sweetlips .
Every social network has a defined identity in politics , religion , intelligence , and tastes .
If you submit 120 bland blog posts to Reddit with the hope of getting a little action , chances are you are going to end up in bed with Mary Jane Rottencrotch .
And instead of the herps , Mary Jane prides herself in banning your IP address permantly from the site .
Once this happens , all of your friends that wanted a piece of the action on the same IP ( your office ) will suffer the same fate .
The same goes for the rest of the social networks .
If you woo them with content that will impress then you might go home with Susie Sweetlips . . . and once you hit her front , itâ€™s easy to score multiple times .
Building a reputation as a site with outstanding content on any of the social networks will go a long ways in getting you in with the â€˜popularâ€™ front - page crowd .
Rule 2 : Find Your Clique .
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â
Like middle school , thereâ€™s a fine line from being confident and being absolutely annoying .
Reddit and Digg spammers are in many ways similar to the friends that borrowed all your stuff yet never gave any thing in return .
If you think friends on your account list automatically go through votes on your stories , then youâ€ ™re living a lie .
The way to establish relationships with friend on these social networks is to become active in their lives and to entice them to reciprocate .
Simply clicking through the homepage and commenting on a story might give you a little karma . . . but actually delving into the lives of your friends on these sites will work 100 times better .
Friends talk to friends , and other people notice you talking to their friends .
Once you establish yourself as an interesting contributer then others will begin to take interest .
If you think youâ€ ™re going to get a lay from olâ€™ Susie Sweetlips by being the emo -loner in the corner then youâ€ ™re insane .
Be popular .
Stay popular .
Avoid Mary Jane Rottencrotch like the Devil .
Rule 3 : Know when to be the Douchebag .
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Girls like Susie Sweetlips find themselves drawn to the â€œbad boysâ€ at a very young age .
After they discover the daytime filth on MTV and VH1 , their love will always find a strange attraction to the boys that have no fear in breaking the rules .
Your content should follow the same guidelines .
While it helps to write pieces that are informative and useful , it is also just as beneficial to focus on controversial issues at some rather frequently .
For instance , sports blogs such as Deadspin and Kissing Suzie Kolber pride themselves in their NFL and NCAA content ; however , their backbone is the stories that focus on the playerâ€™s moral wrongdoings .
Deadspin was created after ESPN failed to report on Mike â€ œRon Mexicoâ€  Vickâ€™s herpes , and KSK published scantily clad pictures of Peter Kingâ€™s teenage daughter .
While both sites are considered foundations of the sports blogging community , both found their fame in touching issues that were considered taboo at the time .
To this day , you will still find a constructive balance reporting good and controversial news on both sites .
Â
While social communities such as Reddit rarely upvote sports stories , it is interesting to see which of Deadspinâ €™s stories have hit the front page .
The moral of the story : If Susie Sweetlips wants to know the facts , there are the established sites out there that her attention will be drawn into reading .
If she wants a creative , sometimes taboo spin on any of these stories then you are the â€œbad boyâ€ for her .
Rule 4 : Always Look Presentable .
While I was in middle school this meant wearing anything that embellished the words â€ œAbercrombie and Fitchâ€ .
In the world of viral marketing this means having a site that you wouldnâ€™t be ashamed of showing your own mother .
Just like middle school , image is just as important as your personality and the content that has been created as a result of your own thoughts .
Susie Sweetlips would much rather kiss and empty , brainless site with a beautiful WordPress theme than your horrendous Myspace layout .
While you may be blogging about fashion and find the Gucci background quite stylish , it will get you more down votes than a Reddit story praising Glen Beck .
Mary Jane Rottencrotch , on the other hand , has always been attracted to your stylish layout .
Donâ€™t settle for the lesser of the two girls in this scenario .
Susie Sweetlips likes the site with the style and brains .
Rule 5 : Be Mysterious .
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â
One of the greatest secrets to viral marketing : itâ€™s not about you .
While putting your name on every story with viral potential is very tempting , itâ€™s often wise to keep it a secret .
For example , if you were to â€œshoutâ€ 
Susie Sweetlips a dozen roses once a week , she will more than likely be turned off by your desperation and plea for her attention .
Alternatively , sending a shout from a secret admirer often evokes a narcissistic sensation in her not knowing who has sent the flowers .
If you are a company attempting a viral , using a real name could prevent you from launching a different viral down the road .
Rule 6 : Think Outside the Box .
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â
If I havenâ€™t stressed it enough in this article . . .
BE CREATIVE , BE CREATIVE , BE CREATIVE !
While the teenage shouting a dozen weekly roses at Susie Sweetlips is flattering , she will be more impressed by the kid that breaks the normal barriers .
If she likes cats . . . teach Mr. Whiskers how to play the keyboard .
If sheâ€™s a dog lover , train 3 of them to howl at the moon .
While I canâ€™t explain it , keyboard cats and 3 wolves howling at the moon got so much play from Susie Sweetlips that even Wal - Mart is selling shirts their shirts in the store .
Papajohns went viral last week by offering all Camaro owners in America free pizzas in celebration of finding their ownerâ€™s old car .
While this marketing was targeted specifically at Camaro owners , it still hit the front page of every social network because it was original .
If you can find a way to create content that is the first of its kind , then youâ€™re well on your way out of Mary Jane Rottencrotchâ€™s league .
No self - respecting social media user will down vote an idea that is thoroughly planned and perfectly executed .
Conclusion : Never Give Up .
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â
So while we may find ourselves in the Internetâ€™s awkward middle school years , just remember to never give up in your quest to make your idea viral .
While Susie Sweetlips and her 100,000 hits may seem unattainable , if you use your head then one day your time will come .
Eventually youâ€™ll hit your growth spurt and find yourself in the same group as the 10 - year - old Skin - a - Max studs .
But when you get there always remember the 6 lessons that helped you in losing your viral marketing virginity .
Most importantly , never forget the clique of friends that helped you along the way .

Addendum , 2016 : this article was the first public announcement of the restoration of the Dymaxion Car .
Since that time , the Dymaxion Car has been restored .
For more information on the Dymaxion Car , see synchronofile.com .
The Dymaxion Car of R. Buckminster Fuller is being restored by the company Crosthwaite and Gardiner .
Dymaxion Car # 1 was involved in a fatal accident , restored , and later accidentally destroyed in a fire .
Dymaxion Car # 3 was was bought and sold many times ( including being bought and sold by Fuller ) and disappeared in the 1950s .
It may have been sold as scrap during the US - Korean war .
Two of the three Dymaxion Cars are lost forever .
Dymaxion Car # 2 was produced by Fuller , Starling Burgess and the 4D Dymaxion Car factory in Bridgeport , Connecticut in 1933 .
The company that produced the car collapsed in 1934 and Fuller relinquished the vehicle to his employees in lieu of wages .
It was discovered in California in the 1960s , having been abandoned .
Dymaxion Car # 2 was later purchased for the National Automobile Museum in Reno , Nevada USA .
The Museum superficially restored the exterior of Dymaxion Car # 2 .
In addition to being displayed at the National Automobile Museum , it was displayed at the Museum of Science and Industry in Chicago in 1973 and the Whitney Museum in New York in 2008 .
Crosthwaite and Gardiner is now conducting a detailed restoration of the exterior and partial restoration of the interior of Dymaxion Car # 2 .
Trevor Blake of synchronofile.com has been providing essential research material on the Dymaxion Car to Crosthwaite and Gardiner since February 2009 .
C&G researcher Phil King wrote : “ More and more details are slowly coming out from the archives and from people like yourself , but I must say your information has been the most informative and the most prolific so far . [… ]
I know I keep saying it but your help has been fantastic and you have made a difference . ”
synchronofile.com has been granted the great honor of announcing the restoration of the Dymaxion Car – because our readers are now invited to help in the project .
Can you identify the manufacturer for this component ?
These three photographs depict a component of Dymaxion Car # 2 .
In the US they are called ‘ turn signals . ’
In the UK they are called ‘ indicators . ’
It may have been manufactured for a trolley ( UK : tram ) or a bus .
If you can identify the manufacturer for this component please send your answer to Phil King of Crosthwaite and Gardiner at the address below .
Say synchronofile.com sent you – and watch this space for further announcements …

Okay , well ...
I use GIMP for all of my post production , which is free software that works with most operating systems .
For this picture , all I really did was play with the curves until I got the color combination that I liked .
I then added a black radial gradient so that the outermost portions of the photo would be a little darker , and then for the curved edges , I used the rectangle select tool and set it to have rounded corners , and then I simply tilted the image a bit so that it looked as though I scanned it in myself .
I might make a tutorial sometime soon , if I do I 'll let you know .
There are plenty of GIMP tutorials for playing with the curves to achieve a retro / vintage feel .

In the case of these language abstractions you are gaining none of the benefit of learning the JavaScript language .
When a leak in the abstraction occurs ( and it will occur - just as it's bound to occur in any abstraction ) what resources do you have , as a developer , to correct the problem ?
If you 've learned nothing about JavaScript then you stand no chance in trying to repair , or work around , the issue .
In the case of UNIX , you are gaining none of the benefit of learning the PDP - 11 instruction set .
When a bug in the C compiler occurs ( and it will occur - just as it's bound to occur in any compiler ) what resources do you have , as a developer , to correct the problem ?
If you 've learned nothing about PDP - 11 assembler then you stand no chance in trying to repair , or work around , the issue .
Matt Campbell , a long - time fan of my ramblings , pointed out a post from John Resig that reads almost like a response to my ideas about the browser as a deployment target , despite the fact that it was written several years ago .
While Mr. Resig is n't adamantly against " language abstractions " - he notes many of their benefits - his counterpoint is summed up in this paragraph :
This is becoming a popular fallacy in programming language circles ; treating Joel Spolsky 's " Law of Leaky Abstractions " as if it were an actual law .
Let 's examine the metaphor of the " leak " .
In plumbing , a leak is a hole in a pipe where water gets out .
Joel has noticed that every pipe has a hole in it , and therefore all pipes are leaky .
But that 's not quite accurate .
There 's another hole in pipes where water gets out : it 's called the " faucet " , and without that part , the rest of the pipe is pretty useless .
To say that a pipe whose faucet is turned on is " leaky " is somewhat misleading , just as it's misleading to say that an abstraction that propagates errors in its lower levels is misleading .
Joel 's entire original essay is based on a subtle ( and , I suspect , intentional ) misunderstanding of TCP : the error conditions that result from failures in the lower level , unreliable packet delivery mechanism are notin the abstraction , they are very carefully specified and thoroughly documented .
They areof the abstraction .
The abstraction of TCP does not try to pretend that connections are never broken , it just provides a unified idea of a " broken connection " that is clearly specified so you do n't need to understand the five million ways that packet delivery can go wrong .
Put more simply : there are abstractions which do not leak .
The example that Joel provides is one of them : TCP is a comprehensive abstraction .
Then there are abstractions which reallyleak .
Every object - relational mapper that provides a facility where you need to directly execute SQL , for example , is leaking the SQL through the abstraction .
Every web templating framework where you can directly generate strings is leaky : the browser speaks DOM , and if you 're generating strings , then bytes are leaking through the abstraction .
But " language abstractions " — or as those of us who are not hip to the new web lingo call them , " compilers " — are generally accepted to be the kind of thing that work well enough that you can trust them .
I do n't know the specifics of the current crop of javascript - targeting compilers .
Maybe GWT and Pyjamas have issues that would require some knowledge of JavaScript to use them correctly .
A well - written compiler , one that really lived up to the promise of treating the browser as a deployment target , would n't have those kinds of issues though .
Let 's turn the wayback machine to 1969 and cast Mr. Resig 's argument against the contemporary contender for moving up the abstraction stack :
So , for those of you who work on UNIX - like operating systems using that fancy " C " machine - code abstraction : how much PDP - 11 assembler have you written recently ?
“ On the morning of November 22nd , a Friday , it became clear the gap between living and dying was closing .
Realizing that Aldous [ Huxley ] might not survive the day , Laura [ Huxley ’s wife ] sent a telegram to his son , Matthew , urging him to come at once .
At ten in the morning , an almost inaudible Aldous asked for paper and scribbled “ If I go ” and then some directions about his will .
It was his first admission that he might die …
Around noon he asked for a pad of paper and scribbled
LSD - try it
intermuscular
100mm
In a letter circulated to Aldous ’s friends , Laura Huxley described what followed : ‘ You know very well the uneasiness in the medical mind about this drug .
But no ‘ authority ’ , not even an army of authorities , could have stopped me then .
I went into Aldous ’s room with the vial of LSD and prepared a syringe .
The doctor asked me if I wanted him to give the shot - maybe because he saw that my hands were trembling .
His asking me that made me conscious of my hands , and I said , ‘ No , I must do this . ’
An hour later she gave Huxley a second 100 mm .
Then she began to talk , bending close to his ear , whispering , ‘ light and free you let go , darling ; forward and up .
You are going forward and up ; you are going toward the light .
Willingly and consciously you are going , willingly and consciously , and you are doing this beautifully — you are going toward the light — you are going toward a greater love …
You are going toward Maria ’s [ Huxley ’s first wife , who had died many years earlier ] love with my love .
You are going toward a greater love than you have ever known .
You are going toward the best , the greatest love , and it is easy , it is so easy , and you are doing it so beautifully . ’
All struggle ceased .
The breathing became slower and slower and slower until , ‘ like a piece of music just finishing so gently in sempre piu piano , dolcamente , ’ at twenty past five in the afternoon , Aldous Huxley died . ”
Laura Huxley in This Timeless Moment ( 1971 ) as quoted by Jay Stevens in “ ” Storming Heaven : LSD and the American Dream ( 1987 )

The woman was taken to hospital in the nearby town of Zwolen and placed in intensive care , where she was said to be in a serious condition on Saturday .
Police have launched an investigation .
Es ist soweit , die 100ten EMO Girls sind da und zu diesem Anlass gibt es diesmal etwas mehr EMO Girls
WILLOWICK -- Basketball has come to an end at 5 p.m. most nights this summer at Manry and Dudley parks .
That 's when a lock gets clamped over the rims , putting a halt to any baskets and , the city believes , the steady stream of rough language and behavior that accompanies games .
In neighboring Wickliffe , the court at Intihar Park has been out of action all summer , with hoops removed from backboards .
Both cities added the restrictions two years ago when a culture war of sorts erupted between the pickup basketball players and the organized sports that play in the parks and the families that live alongside them .
" Complaints are nonexistent because the hoops are down , " said Wickliffe Recreation Director Tim Stopp .
Stopp said complaints have stopped even at the city 's other parks that still have hoops up , and he thinks the removal of the hoops at Intihar Park is the reason why .
" I think the people playing understand that the hoops can be taken down , " he said .
Dan Salesky , head of Willowick 's youth baseball league , said he never saw the problem as a serious one , but once locks -- which look a bit like the anti-theft brackets that go on car steering wheels -- went up , the large groups congregating in his outfields by the courts went away .
With basketball courts being closed around Cleveland and in Euclid , players migrated over the borders into Lake County and behavior -- most notably loud cursing -- rankled neighbors .
The issue was most heated in Wickliffe , where residents and players overflowed City Council chambers two years ago to make their case .
With most neighbors white and some of the players black , race has hung over the entire issue .
Two years ago , some players questioned if racism was part of the dispute , but the players seen in recent weeks were mainly white .
Both Wickliffe Mayor Thomas Ruffner and Willowick Mayor Richard Bonde said there were some calls to simply close the courts or ban " outsiders " from using them .
Instead , both cities tried compromises to limit basketball when local baseball and soccer leagues were using the same parks .
At Intihar , the court is close to where families sit to watch games and the language bothered families with small children .
In Willowick , closing the courts only on Monday through Thursday nights when there are baseball and softball games eliminated much of the conflict .
Mike Cervella , 17 , played basketball last week in Willowick before the hoops were locked .
He called the city 's summer policy " aggravating . "
" Sometimes I do n't even get off work until after 5 , " Cervella said .
" Just keep things open while the sun is out . "
Anthony Bagliano , shooting hoops with his father , Henry , agreed .
" We have nowhere else to play , " he said .
" You should be able to play until 7 or 8 or until it gets dark . "
But any hard feelings will soon subside , at least until next summer .
With the baseball season over , both cities will be restoring the hoops and ceasing to lock the hoops at night .
Thursday was the last night Willowick 's locks went on and Wickliffe plans to restore the hoops as soon as the Service Department has a chance .
Ed Zivnoska , president of the Wickliffe Baseball League , said there have been no complaints of behavior at Intihar from his players or families this year .
Recreation Director Stopp said that his city had planned to remove the hoops at Jindra Park as well during baseball season , but parents called and complained that an activity was being taken away from their children .
The city left them up and both Stopp and Zivnoska said there have been no issues .

In this review we 're going to take a look at the Crucial M225 128 GB Solid State Drive and the benefits of making the switch from a standard hard disk to Solid - State .
Before we begin , I 'd like to go over a general introduction to Solid State Drives for those individuals unfamiliar with the technology .
Introduction to SSD
Solid - State Drive technology has been around for many years , in fact according to history the first modern type of Solid State Drive was developed by StorageTek back in 1978 .
For almost a decade now the military and aerospace industries have been replacing Hard Disk Drives ( HDD ) with Sold State Drives ( SSD ) as they offer resistance to shock , vibration , high altitude and grater temperature .
Only recently have Solid State Drives been introduced into consumers markets .
Taking advantage of a reduction in power consumption over conventional mechanical HDD , we first started to see them offered in compact portable devices such as Notebook and Netbooks .
Advantages of SSD
Greatly improved read and write speeds
Low power consumption
Low heat dissipation
Silent operation
Faster boot time ( No spin - up required )
Longer life expectancy
Higher reliability ( No moving parts )
Smaller / light weight form factor
Disadvantages of SSD
Cost is still considerably higher per gigabyte than conventional HDD
Storage capacity is a lot lower , but predicted to increase in time
Performance degradation over time ( Dependent on Firmware & Operating System )
As of August 2009 the aforementioned points are applicable to most Solid State Drives , not just the product reviewed in this article .
Now that you have the basics of SSD technology down , lets take a look at what Crucial 's latest SSD product has to offer .
The M225 SSD
Unlike conventional 3.5 - inch Hard Disk Drives , most Solid State Drives conform to an industry standard 2.5 - inch form factor .
As illustrated in this photo you can see there is a considerable size difference between the two .
This has created a common misconception that 2.5 - inch drives are intended for installation in only small portable devices such as a Netbook or Notebook .
This is false .
All you need is a 2.5 " to 3.5 " drive bay mounting bracket .
Unfortunately Crucial does not included a bracket with their drive like other manufactures .
But you may purchase one like the SilverStone 3.5 " to 2.5 " Drive Bay Converter from an online retailer for under ten dollars .
The thin light - weigh aluminum enclosure appears to be quite durable .
Unlike Hard Disk Drives , Solid State Drives are practically impervious to impact damage and do not require vibration dampening or anti-shock enclosures .
Crucial claims that the M225 has a Mean Time Between Failures ( MTBF ) of 1 million hours .
This estimation seems to be somewhat below the standard for MLC drives , but certainly not a deal breaker as one million hours equates to 114 years !
MTBF is a theoretical projected average based on statistical sampling and mathematical models whereas a manufacturer warranty is guarantee against defects .
Either way , Crucial has you covered with a 5 year warranty .
The Crucial M225 has a 64MB cache that is driven by the Elpida SDRAM memory chip shown in this photo .
The Elpida 64MB SDRAM module is marked with S51321CBH - 6DTT-F , but according to Elpida the actual product part number is EDS51321CBH - M-F , which is a 133MHz ( CL3 - 3 - 3 ) mobile RAM component .
This 64MB cache buffer improves performance and removes inability to handle random write patterns ( stuttering ) that effect other drives with less cache memory and different SSD controllers .
Some would argue Crucial has been a little late to the race with their SSD offerings .
Though I do not have a definitive answer as to why it takes them so long , lets not speculate here .
We certainly cannot criticize a company that does proper research & development the first time around .
One thing is for sure , Crucial has made a wise decision by using the Indilinx Barefoot controller in all their M225 Series drives .
Barefoot is widely viewed as one of the best high - performing Solid - State drive SATA controller interfaces on the market to date .
Though most manufactures fail to mention the controller in their technical specification , rest assured you 're getting one of the best when purchasing a Crucial M225 Series SSD .

ext3 will remain the default file - system for Jaunty , and Canonical will consider ext4 as the default for the next release based on user feedback .
There has been extensive discussion about the reliability of applications running on ext4 in the face of sudden system outages .
Applications that use the conventional approach of writing data to a temporary file and renaming it to its final location will have their reliability expectations met in Ubuntu 9.04 beta ; further discussion is ongoing in the kernel community .
For our benchmarking we 've chosen the ext4 file system .
Your performance may vary .
Factors affecting performance include :
The file system used ( e.g. ext2 , ext3 , etx4 , jfs , reiserfs , Btrfs , xfs ) .
Test System
Processor : Intel Core 2 Duo CPU E8400 @ 0.66GHz ( Total Cores : 2 )
Motherboard : ASUSTeK P5Q - PRO
Chipset : Intel 4 Series Chipset + ICH10R
System Memory : 3899MB
OS : Ubuntu 9.04 , Kernel : 2.6.28-15-generic ( x86_64 )
File - System : ext4
As this is our first SSD review , we 've decided to post standalone benchmarks rather than pit the Crucial M225 up against a standard Hard Disk Drive .
Dbench is a filesystem benchmark that generates load patterns similar to those of the commercial Netbench benchmark , but without requiring a lab of Windows load generators to run .
It is now considered a de-facto standard for generating load on the Linux VFS .
Here we simulate the load of 1 client .
Simulating the load of 128 clients .
Iozone tests the speed of sequential I /O to actual files .
Therefore , this measurement factors in the efficiency of your machine 's file system , operating system , C compiler , and C runtime library .
It produces a measurement which is the number of bytes per second that your system can read or write to a file .
Here we simulate a 4GB sequential read .
Simulating a 4GB sequential write .
Simulating a 8 GB sequential read .
Simulating a 8 GB sequential write .
Tiotest is a file system benchmark especially designed to test I/O performance with multiple running threads .
Here we read 32 concurrent I/ O threads , each 256MB in size .
Here we write 32 concurrent I/O threads , each 256MB in size .
Performance Degradation
You may have read about a performance degradation that occurs after prolonged usage of Solid State Drives .
This is associated with block - rewriting and over time , as files are written , moved , deleted , or replaced , many blocks are a left holding what is essentially orphaned or " garbage data " , and their long - term performance degrades because of it .
This garbage data has plagued SSD 's for quite some time and basically stems from the drive not knowing when a file is deleted , only when one is overwritten .
A new SSD command called " TRIM " was designed explicitly to mitigate this problem .
This command from the file system tells the SSD 's controller which logical data blocks have been deleted , so that the controller can reset those memory cells that were used up by those deleted blocks .
Having said that , both the Operating System and drive firmware must have support for in order for this to happen .
Windows 7 has TRIM features that will improve performance in three ways .
It will reduce the amount of data to be deleted , which improves the SSD 's lifespan ; delete garbage data in advance , which speeds up writing of data ; and maximize the amount of unused data , which helps even out the wear and tear on the SSD .
Currently Linux has no support for DSM / TRIM in the mainline kernel .
There are patches to add experimental support for TRIM , but those have yet to be proven on a real drive with real TRIM .
Though automatic - TRIM seems to be a ways off still , there is the option of hdparm with experimental trim / wiper scripts for SSD's .
I personally have not tried this manual wiper script , and would recommend you wait for proper updates from the SSD manufacture .
Another popular SSD manufacture OCZ in conjunction with Indilinx has recently released new firmware ( Version 1.30 ) for their entire line - up of Vertex Series SSD 's which actively reclaims these blocks during idle I /O time .
This garbage collection function is named NAND Launderer and supposedly restores performance to like - new condition , even on a severely " dirtied " drive .
As mentioned earlier , the Crucial M225 has an Indilinx controller as well , however the NAND Launderer algorithm is exclusive to OCZ and not present in Crucial 's firmware at this time , nor is the TRIM function supported .
This should not deter you from purchasing the a M225 SSD as Crucial has stated similar features will be coming in a future firmware release .
I will update this article once this occurs .
Update Oct /18/09 : Crucial has released a firmware update for the M225 which offers ATA8 ACS2 TRIM support , along with a few other fixes .
If your Crucial M225 Solid - State Drive has firmware 1711 you must first revert back to the 1571 firmware prior to updating to the new 1819 version .
Instructions , including the appropriate downloads can be found on the Crucial M225 product page .
Final Remarks
I believe it was January 2008 when we last saw a Crucial branded SSD , from what I recall , it was n't well received and widely reported to under - preform at the expense of your pocket book .
As the M225 Series is a positive step towards restoring faith in Crucial SSD's .
Some would argue Crucial has yet again been in the lurch as their newest Solid - State Drive incorporates technology that other mainstream SSD manufactures have been offering for months now .
This is true , however , the M225 Series matches performance at a much better price point of only $ 2.57 per gigabyte .
The Crucial M225 Series SSD is available in 64GB ( CT64M225 ) , 128GB ( CT128M225 ) , and 256GB ( CT256M225 ) capacities , all competitively priced .
But given the grandeur of Solid - State technology right now , prices are steadily decreasing while storage capacities and performance gains are on the rise with most manufactures .
Solid - State Drives can drastically increase your computers performance and responsiveness for every day operations , perhaps now becoming the biggest gain on performance from a single hardware component .
Despite the lack of a much needed firmware update , rest assured the Crucial M225 128GB SSD is a great product that gives other premium drives a run for their money .
You wo n't be disappointed with it .

TVNL Comment : How is this permitted ?
We have allowed our government to become so powerful they can do things like this without telling us what they are doing .
Is it a nuclear weapon ?
Is it a biological weapon system ?
Is it an experiemt that can accidently lead to our death or the death of the world ?
Is it meant to spy on us ?
This is unacceptable and the people of the world and the nation have to wake up and take back control of our lives !

The other big star at Fox News besides the usual hosts we write about here ( Bill O’Reilly , Glenn Beck ) would be Sean Hannity , who ’s ratings each night make him the # 2 or # 3 cable news host on television .
Last night on his Great American Panel , he featured FNC regular and longtime Democratic strategist Bob Beckel , right - wing regular Erick Erickson of RedState.com …and Playboy cover model and “ singer ” Aubrey O’Day .
The conversation , inevitably , moved to masturbation .
First some background : for those unfamiliar with O’Day , she ’s a former member of P. Diddy ’s female pop group , Danity Kane – she ’s about five steps below Lady Gaga and one step above Heidi Montag .
For those unfamiliar with why she ’s featured on Fox News during prime time , we ’re not too sure .
But despite confused glances from Beckel and Erickson throughout the lengthy segments , O’Day was well spoken and knowledgeable , especially when discussing a recent UN report on sex education guidelines ( yes , somehow two separate stories related to sexual practices of five - year - olds were on cable news yesterday ) .
But the highlight of the back - and - forth took place later in the show , when Beckel and Erickson joked about the “ masturbation of five - year - olds ” and “ Playboy covers ” and O’Day turned the tables on the boys .
“ You boys never wondered what you were doing and wished to be educated about it earlier than you were , are you going to sit up there and tell me that ? ” she asked .
“ I did n’t have a clue about any of this stuff until I was much older , ” said Hannity .
( As much as we ’re surprised to admit this , Hannity ’s comment does pretty much prove O’Day ’s point , right ? )
It is stunt guesting like this that you just do n’t see on the rest of Fox News ( well , maybe rarely on O’Reilly ) .
So for that , it makes the program that much more interesting .
But it is at least a bit jarring seeing ultra-conservative Sean Hannity introducing someone on his “ Great American Panel ” while a fullscreen image of a Playboy cover is shown .
Here ’s the Great American Masturbation Segment :

Ending the War on Sharing Richard Stallman 2010 - 06 - 11 Spanish Translation Arabic Translation ( by Osama Khalid )
When record companies make a fuss about the danger of " piracy " , they 're not talking about violent attacks on shipping .
What they complain about is the sharing of copies of music , an activity in which millions of people participate in a spirit of cooperation .
The term " piracy " is used by record companies to demonize sharing and cooperation by equating them to kidnaping , murder and theft .
Copyright was set up after the printing press made copying a matter of mass production , typically done commercially .
Copyright was acceptable in that technological context because it functioned as an industrial regulation , not restricting readers or ( later ) music listeners .
In the 1890s , record companies began selling mass - produced musical recordings .
These records facilitated the enjoyment of music , and did nothing to interfere with listening to music .
Copyright on these musical recordings was mostly uncontroversial as it only restricted record companies and not music listeners .
Today 's digital technology enables everyone to make and share copies .
Record companies now seek to use copyright law to deny us the use of this technical advance .
The law which was acceptable when it restricted only publishers is now an injustice because it forbids cooperation among citizens .
To stop people from sharing goes against human nature , and the Orwellian propaganda that " sharing is theft " usually falls on deaf ears .
It appears the only way to stop people from sharing is with a harsh War on Sharing .
Thus the record companies , through their legal arms such as the RIAA , sue teenagers for hundreds of thousands of dollars for sharing .
Meanwhile , corporate conspiracies to restrict public access to technology have developed systems of Digital Restrictions Management , designed to handcuff users and make copying impossible .
Examples include iTunes as well as DVDs and Blueray disks .
( See DefectiveByDesign.org for more information . )
Although these conspiracies operate in restraint of trade , governments systematically fail to prosecute them .
Sharing continues despite these measures ; the human impulse to cooperate is strong .
Therefore , the record companies and other publishers demand ever nastier measures to castigate sharers .
The US passed a law in October 2008 to seize computers used for forbidden sharing .
The European Union is considering a directive to cut off Internet service for people who have been accused ( not convicted ) of sharing ; see laquadrature .
net if you want to help oppose it .
New Zealand in 2008 already adopted such a law .
At a recent film conference I heard a proposal to require people to prove their identity to gain access to the Internet ; such monitoring would also help crush dissent and democracy .
China has announced such a policy for Internet cafes ; will the EU be next ?
An MP in the UK proposed to imprison people for ten years for sharing .
This has not been adopted — yet .
Meanwhile , in Mexico , children are being invited to report their own parents , Soviet style , for unauthorized copying .
It seems there is no limit to the cruelty that the copyright industry will propose for its War on Sharing .
The record companies ' main argument for forbidding sharing is that it causes the " loss " of jobs .
This claim turns out to be pure guesswork ( 1 ) .
But even if they were true , they would not justify the War on Sharing .
Should we forbid people to clean their own homes to avoid " loss " of janitorial jobs ?
Forbid people to cook for themselves , or forbid sharing of recipes , to avoid the " loss " of restaurant jobs ?
Such arguments are absurd because the " cure " is more profoundly harmful than the " disease " .
The record companies also claim that sharing music takes money away from musicians .
This is the sort of half - truth that is worse than a lie — except the level of truth in it is much less than half .
Even if we accept their supposition that , if you had not downloaded some music , you would have bought a copy of the same music — usually false , but occasionally true — it is only if the musicians are long - established superstars that they would get any money from your purchase .
The record companies bully musicians at the start of their careers into exploitative contracts that bind them for 5 or 7 albums .
It is almost unheard of for a record published under the scope of these contracts to sell enough copies that the musicians get a cent from sales .
For more details , see this link .
Long - established superstars aside , sharing only reduces the income that record companies use to sue music lovers .
As for the few musicians whose contracts do not exploit them , the long - established superstars , it is no special problem for society or music if they get a little less rich .
There is no justification for the War on Sharing .
We , the public , should put an end to it .
Some argue that the record companies will never succeed in stopping people from sharing , that it can not be done ( 2 ) .
Given the asymmetric strengths of record company lobbyists and music lovers , I mistrust predictions of who will win in this war ; in any case , underestimating the enemy is folly .
We must assume that either side can win and the outcome depends on us .
Besides , even if the record companies never succeed in crushing human cooperation , they cause much misery just by trying , and intend to cause more .
Rather than allow them to pursue the War on Sharing until they admit it is futile , we must stop them as soon as possible .
We must legalize sharing .
Some say the networked society has no more use for record companies .
I do not support that position .
I will never pay for a music download until the day I can do that anonymously , so I want to be able to buy CDs anonymously in a record store .
I do not wish for the elimination of record companies in general , but I will not give up my freedom to keep them going .
The purpose of copyright — on musical recordings , or anything else — is simple : to encourage writing and art .
That 's a desirable goal , but there are limits to what it can justify .
Stopping people from sharing noncommercially is just too much .
If we wish to promote music in the age of computer networks , we must choose methods that fit in with what we want to do with music , and that includes sharing .
Here are several suggestions for what we could do :
Fans of certain kinds of music could organize fan clubs which would support the people who like that music .
We could increase funds for existing government programs that subsidize musical performance .
Artists can fund expensive works through subscription , with the funds to be returned if the work is not made .
Many musicians get more money from selling fan merchandise than from their recordings .
If they take the plunge into merchandise - based funding , they have no reason to restrict copying ; quite the contrary .
We could support musical artists with public funds distributed directly to them in proportion to the cube root of their popularity .
Using the cube root means that if superstar A is 1000 times as popular as skilled artist B , A will get 10 times as much of the tax funds as B .
This way of dividing the money is an efficient way to promote a broad diversity of music .
The law should ensure that record companies cannot confiscate these funds from the artists , since experience shows they will try .
To speak of " compensating " the " rights holder " is a veiled way of proposing to give most of the money to the record companies in the name of the artists .
These funds could come from the general budget , or from a special tax on something vaguely correlated with listening to music , such as blank disks or Internet connectivity .
Either way would do the job .
The Mécénat Global is a partly similar plan .
Support artists with voluntary payments .
This is already working fairly well for some artists , including Radiohead and Nine Inch Nails and Jane Siberry ( sheeba.ca ) , even using inconvenient systems that require the purchaser to have a credit card .
If any music lover could pay easily with digital cash , if each music player had a button you could push to send one euro to the artists that made the piece you listened to , would n't you push it occasionally , perhaps once a week ?
Only the poor and the very stingy would refuse .
You may have other good ideas .
Let 's support musicians , and let 's legalize sharing .

Medtronic has said that consulting arrangements with surgeons are critical to the development of new products .
Company officials also say the $ 800,000 payments were compensation for Dr. Timothy Kuklo ’s work developing products for the company , training doctors and speaking at company events and that they were n’t connected to the study or journal article in any way .
Not connected ?
How was this anything but a " fee for services rendered ? "
Medtronic made payments amounting to $ 800,000 Dr. Kuklo , the former Army surgeon who is accused of falsifying data in a study using Medtronic ’s Infuse bone - graft product , and forging signatures of bogus co-authors on a paper reporting favorable results advantageous to Medtronic .
Furthermore , Medtronic acknowledged that some of the consulting payments occurred during the time that Dr. Kuklo , was shopping his favorable study of Medtronic ’s Infuse bone - graft product to medical journals .
Dr. Kuklo delivered : the paper was published by the Journal of Bone and Joint Surgery .
It was then redacted when the journal was alerted to the fraud .
Medtronic ’s payments to surgeons who use its spine products are under investigation by the Justice Department following accusations by several former employees that the doctors were being induced to use the products — allegations the company denies .

Mythbusters test golf ball - like dimpling on MPG – Click above to watch video after the jump
The Mythbusters must be closet car fans , because the hour - long show on the Discovery Channel seems to be producing more and more experiments involving automobiles than ever before .
Their latest again involves fuel efficiency , this time testing if a dirty car is more fuel efficient than a clean one because of the golf ball - like dimpling effect of the dirt .
Turns out dirt does n't make a difference , but Adam and Jamie went one step further to test if covering a car in actual golf ball - like dimples would improve its fuel efficiency .
According to cable 's most crack scientists , yes , it will .
The show 's team completely covered a last - gen Ford Taurus with modelers clay and figured out that it would achieve about 26 mpg at a constant 65 mph .
They then went about adding over 1,000 dimples to the car 's exterior .
To keep the experiment consistent , all 1,082 dimples removed from the clay exterior were put in a box and set in the back seat so that the car would weigh exactly the same as before dimpling .
The theory is that , like a golf ball , the dimples would reduce the car 's drag through the air , thus allowing it to travel the same distance at the same speed using less fuel .
The result ?
Over 29 mpg .
Follow the jump to watch the whole episode for yourself , though if you 're only interested in watching the dimpled car do it 's thing , skip ahead to about 40 minutes in .

We will all be dead by 2012 , unless we heed the warnings given in the Kolbrin Bible .
So claims Glenn Kimball , an “ author and educator ” from Arizona .
The Kolbrin was maintained , says Kimball , by a series of “ secret societies ” ( he does n’t provide details ) after it was snatched from the 1124 arson at Glastonbury Abbey .
So , no surprises , there are n’t any records of its existence .
I ’ll let him Glenn describe himself : Glenn Kimball [ … ] has successfully completed all course work for a Ph.D. in Communications .
He has been collecting ancient texts since the age of fifteen and is famous for being able to integrate very diverse texts into a contiguous story line [ … ]
Famous , indeed ?
Even if such a word was justified , being able to “ integrate ” diverse texts together into a “ story line ” sounds just a little bit suspect , and reminds me of this book review .
But he ’s not letting the incomplete Ph.D hold him back : Kimball appears to run his own ( mail order ) university , the Kimball College Institute for the Study of Ancient History and Ancient Manuscripts .
The texts for the autumn 2008 semester are as follows : ‘ Wisdom from India ’ , by Glenn Kimball
‘ A Letter from Jesus ’ , by Glenn Kimball
‘ What is Quantum Physics ? ’ , by Glenn Kimball
And there are a lot more where they came from .
( This is a man , remember , whose only academic qualification is that he nearly has a Ph.D in Communications – and even then , he is suspiciously unwilling to name the academic institution that did n’t quite award him the honour . )
Kimball seems very proud of the Kolbrin Bible :
It is the first Judaic / Christian document that binds our scientific understanding of human evolution with creationism and intelligent design …
The Kolbrin also has a special third party account of the Exodus from Egypt at the time of Moses …
It is the only Judaic / Christian document to tell the whole story of human creation …
Suddenly the story of Atlantis and Lumeria and their tales of “ Eden ” and catastrophe … tie into the beginning creation story from the Holy Bible .
So , the bible ties several “ diverse strands ” together .
And how was it you introduced yourself again , Glenn ?
Glenn Kimball … is famous for being able to integrate very diverse texts into a contiguous story line .
Did Kimball write the Kolbrin ?
All the trails of promotion and speculation seem to lead back to Kimball College .
He is the one promoting it the most , praising its beautiful writing in particular .
In fact , there does n’t seem to be any mention of the Kolbrin Bible that does n’t cite its source , eventually , as Kimball or one of his associates .
( Glastonbury Abbey , incidentally , deny that the Kolbrin Bible or anything that resembled it was ever housed there . )
Kimball ’s second - in - command is Marshall Masters , a “ former CNN science producer ” , who has fallen hook , line and sinker for Kimball ’s Bible .
He is a rather sad character .
A serial victim of counterknowledge , he says without a trace of irony that the Destroyer story in the Kolbrin “ correlates to Nostradamus ’s ‘ Bearded Star , ’ Mother Shipton ’s ‘ Fiery Dragon ’ and the ‘ Red Comet ’ warning of the Mayan Calendar 2012 Prophecies ” .
Another part of his website announces , almost pleadingly : “ This is not conspiracy nonsense ! ” Masters keeps repeating on his website that he “ followed the money ” to find evidence to support the theories in the Kolbrin .
But follow the money from anywhere the Kolbrin is cited , and you ’ll find Masters , or Kimball , peddling a book .
Meanwhile , Kimball continues to lavish praise on the Kolbrin Bible : The Kolbrin is one of the newest discoveries and perhaps the most significant in over a thousand years .
The Kolbrin is like “ eye candy ” for those who crave to know more about prophecy and religion .
It may be the most important document ever found …
Hmm .
If Kimball wants to sound like he ’s not promoting his own work , he ’s going to have to try harder .

Ms Tysiac was acting on medical advice when seeking an abortion
A Polish court has awarded $ 11,000 ( 7,400 euros ) in damages to a woman likened to a child killer by a Catholic magazine for wanting an abortion .
The article also compared abortion to the experiments of Nazi war criminals at Auschwitz .
Alicja Tysiac had been warned by doctors when she became pregnant that she could go blind if she had her baby .
But she was denied an abortion - illegal in most cases in Poland - and her eyesight subsequently deteriorated .
The court in Katowice , southern Poland , ruled that the Catholic magazine , Gosc Niedzielny , had drawn clear parallels between Ms Tysiac 's desire to have an abortion and the actions of Nazi war criminals .
The judge said it had shown " contempt , hostility and malice " towards the 38 - year - old woman .
The judge said Catholics have the right to express their disapproval of abortion and even call it murder , but they did not have the right to vilify individuals .
Rights ruling
Ms Tysiac 's sight problems grew worse following the births of each of her three children .
Acting on medical advice , she decided to have an abortion when she became pregnant for a third time eight years ago but her gynaecologist refused to perform the procedure .
Poland has strict abortion regulations but they are allowed when the health of the mother or embryo is threatened .
Two years ago , the European Court of Human Rights ordered Poland to pay Ms Tysiac 25,000 euros ( $ 36,000 ) in compensation .
The Catholic magazine wrote that she had been compensated for wanting to kill her child .
The magazine 's editor - in - chief , Father Marek Gancarczyk , said the ruling was unfair and denied comparing Ms Tysiac to Nazi criminals .
His lawyers said they would use the principle of freedom of speech to appeal against the court 's verdict .
Bill Cosby endorses attack on public education in Detroit
By Tim Tower
5 September 2009
Comedian Bill Cosby visited Detroit last Tuesday to give his vocal support to Emergency Financial Manager Robert Bobb , who is working with the city and the Obama administration to place the burden of the school district budget deficit on the backs of workers and young people .
During a series of media events culminating in a meeting at Henry Ford High School Tuesday evening , Cosby went out of his way to blame parents , teachers and students for the crisis in the local school system where many students fail to complete high school and , of those who do , few are prepared for college .
When presented with some of the real conditions in the local schools , Cosby dismissed them with disdain .
“ What are you going to do about it ? ” he taunted his listeners repeatedly .
Parents , he said , “ Have n’t done much of anything .
You have a child who has gone bad , do something for a change . ”
Tuesday afternoon , when he was campaigning in the streets beside Mr. Bobb , a student confronted Cosby saying , “ We have no music .
We have no art . ”
The comedian shot back with a characteristic curt reply .
“ Get over it ! ” he said .
Cosby contrasted the poor performance of parents with the actions of Bobb .
He called Bobb a “ gunfighter , ” hired by the governor to “ clean out this town . ”
According to Cosby , Detroit parents had not done anything for their children , or for the schools .
Martial violence in the form of the executive power of Robert Bobb would show them how to behave .
The city administration of Mayor Dave Bing , the president of the local teachers ’ union Keith Johnson and the mass media , all joined with the schools ’ financial controller Robert Bobb in welcoming Cosby ’s message because it obscures the responsibility of the Democratic Party for the destruction of the schools .
Fifty schools will close this year , and 2,000 teachers and staff have already been laid off .
Mr. Bobb is demanding pay and benefit cuts from teachers and staff and the elimination of programs such as , music , gym and art , where they still exist .
Working closely with the Obama administration , Bobb is using the layoffs and pay cuts as a club to force through merit pay based on test scores and the replacement of public education with charter schools , which are operated by private companies for profit .
Cosby made no mention of the local rate of unemployment , which stands at close to 30 percent , the highest in the United States .
Nor did he refer to the conditions of widespread poverty that impact every aspect of life in the working class .
The wealthy entertainer expressed no empathy for the many children who come to school without breakfast , or for the majority of students who struggle to learn without access to textbooks they can take home , or for the hundreds of teachers who use their own money to buy basic supplies so that their students have materials to work with .
The bankruptcy of GM and Chrysler were engineered by the Obama administration to free the corporations from obligations to the working class .
The concentrated attack against public education in Detroit , which is now in full swing , extends the logic of Obama ’s pressure on the auto workers onto their children and the schools they attend .
It is a case of exploiting a real crisis of decay and corruption for the purpose of protecting the wealth of the ruling elite through intensified assaults on the working class .
The attempt to blame parents for the problems confronting black youth has become a theme for Cosby .
In a speech on the 50th anniversary of Brown vs. Board of Education in 2004 , Cosby declared : “ People marched and were hit in the face with rocks to get an education , and now you have these knuckleheads walking around . …
The lower economic people are not holding up their end of the deal .
These people are not parenting . ”
( See , “ Bill Cosby blames parents for US society ’s ills ” ) .
These same themes have more recently been taken up by Obama , who in a speech before the NAACP earlier this year declared that social ills as mass unemployment and poverty could not be used as “ excuses , ” insisting that the problems confronting the black population were primarily cultural in character .
( See , “ Obama ’s speech to the NAACP ” ) .
Cosby grew up in Philadelphia and began his meteoric career as a stand - up comic , poking fun at working class youth , who , at the time , were not that different from himself .
His years of success and privilege have taken their toll .
What once had the tone of a jest between equals has become tainted by shades of conceit and more and more takes on the character of jibes of contempt , directed at the “ unclean mass ” on the other side of the tracks .
Today he expresses , more than he may himself realize , not the hope and aspirations of the oppressed youth he grew up with , but , on the contrary , the ideas and attitudes of the ruling elite .
Outside the hall at Henry Ford High School , where the meeting was staged Tuesday evening , students from this years ’ senior class complained bitterly about the abrupt termination of an esteemed counselor who had worked with their class through three years of high school , only to be let go at the beginning of their final year .
They had circulated petitions calling for her reinstatement , but to no avail .
Other students reported that the school ’s award - winning band and chorus had been terminated at the end of last year for lack of funds .
“ I am very disgusted by it , ” commented Kimberly Bishop , the mother of four recent graduates .
“ We had a great band .
They won competitions , and they were moving right along .
But there was not enough money to keep the teachers here .
They were doing very well .
But you are talking about money .
Where is that $ 46 million that came up missing ?
Why are there all those administrators getting six figures ? ”
Her daughter , Darmisha graduated last year .
“ At one point I was in band , at another , I was in choir , ” she said .
“ I was very involved in music .
It was cut directly after I left .
There were a lot of students that participated in band and vocals ; and since it ’s been cut out , they do n’t have anything else to do . ”
The destruction of this award - winning program that enjoyed support in the whole community gives the lie to the administration ’s argument that the cuts are aimed at schools that fail to improve performance .
The argument itself is bankrupt .
The real cause of the crisis is the economic decay in which the students live .
The schools need money and programs , teachers , counselors and extra programs , not less of everything .
A number of teachers and parents walked out of Tuesday ’s meeting with Cosby in disgust .
“ He has no business speaking that way , ” responded Mrs. Bishop to the comedian ’s assertion that the parents had done nothing .
“ I was here every day .
Four of my children graduated here , and not one of them had books to bring home . ”
One of her sons enlisted and went to Iraq so that he would have the money to attend college .
“ I was on pins and needles the whole time he was gone , ” she continued .
“ When he got back , he tried to go to Wayne State .
It broke my heart .
‘ Mom , ’ he told me .
‘ I just ca n’t do it .
I ’m not prepared . ’”
Mrs. Bishop placed responsibility on the administration and its destruction of the school ’s curriculum .
“ There are not enough things to keep the students interested , ” she said .
“ There is no music .
There is no journalism .
There is no debate .
There is one art class for 1,300 kids .
There are just not enough extra curricular activities .
They have gym , but it is not like a real gym class .
Kids just play basketball all the time .
And the girls really do n’t have anything .
They just sit there and watch the boys play . ”
“ There is not enough going on in the school to keep the kids motivated .
That is what really disgusts me about it .
They want to come here to get an education .
But they also want to learn how to cook .
They want to learn how to write .
They want to learn how to play music . ”
“ We need those kind of things put in all of our schools — computers for every child that attends Detroit Public Schools .
They need to put that stimulus money in our schools in front of our kids .
But whatever they get will probably not be used for the kids .
Our children are the ones who are being directly affected by these cuts . ”
The active participation of Keith Johnson , President of Detroit Federation of Teachers Local 231 , who appeared on stage with Cosby and Bobb and danced to the music of a student singing group , was particularly significant .
Johnson has once again solidarized himself with Bobb and the attack on public education in Detroit .
The DFT recently pushed through a 60 - day contract extension for teachers , preventing a strike while tying the hands of teachers and isolating them from city workers facing a similar attack on jobs and living conditions .
The DFT is working closely with Bobb to push through unprecedented concessions , along with the whole right - wing “ reform ” agenda of the Obama administration .
Mr Wallis said : " Despite Cadw having a cleaning regime in place and despite the best efforts of our staff , we are being severely tested .
Even the cleaners are spat upon and having bottles thrown at them .
Bailout Lies Threaten Your Savings
Daniel R. Amerman , CFA , DanielAmerman.com
Overview
There is a headline that has been all over the media ever since September 2008 : “ Bank Bailout Will Soak Taxpayers . ”
As obviously true as this headline appears to be , it is in fact , dangerously misleading .
Indeed , as we will cover in this article , the idea that taxes will pay for the bailout is ludicrous , an insult to both your intelligence – and your net worth .
If the video above does n't load , it can also be seen here
Instead , the real source of the bailout monies will not be the taxes you pay , but the value of your savings .
The value of your checking account , the value of your IRA or Keogh , and the value of all your investments are the true source of payment for Wall Street ’s reckless mistakes .
When we combine the bailout with the trouble the US was already in , the result could be a 95 % reduction in value for all of our savings , retirement and otherwise , as we will illustrate step by step in this article .
There are things you can do .
Actions you can take .
Ways to defend the value of your savings , as we will discuss later .
But before we talk about solutions , first we need to understand why taxes wo n’t pay for the bailout .
Because it is only when we understand the real danger , that we can take effective action to protect ourselves .
Placing Things In Perspective
Let ’s start by placing things in perspective .
This financial crisis has not been happening in isolation .
The United States government was already in an impossible financial situation before this crisis ever hit .
Looking at Social Security and Medicare , when we take a long term perspective , the projected excess of expenditures over taxes is at least $ 59 trillion according to a fairly well known and accepted study that appeared in USA Today .
This is n't the total cost - it 's the present value shortfall after taking out projected taxes at current levels .
Now , there are approximately 111,000,000 households in the United States .
So if we take the total shortfall and we divide it by the number of households , we come up with a shortfall of over half a million dollars per household , and that number is reasonably well accepted these days .
Okay , you ’ve probably seen that number before , or something like it .
Now let ’s very quickly do a few things you probably have n’t seen before .
Step One : Below Poverty Line Households
Our first step is to take the 11 million households that are below the poverty line and subtract them out .
These households are already not really paying the federal government , they 're getting paid by the federal government on a net basis , so we can't realistically expect them to come up with any of the money for Medicare or Social Security .
When we take them out we 're left with something very close to 100 million households .
Divide $ 59 trillion by 100 million households and our shares of the shortfall just jumped to $ 590,000 per household .
Step Two : Retired Households
Step two is , do we expect retiree households to pay for their own retirement ?
Because when we say there 's 100 million households , well , we ’ve got quite a few retiree households already , and that number is going to be growing fast over the next 10 to 15 years as an average of 4 million baby boomers retire each year between 2010 and 2029 .
So if we look out over the decades ahead as the baby boom retires , and we adjust for the rapidly building number of retiree households who will be the beneficiaries of Social Security and Medicare – who will be receiving benefits rather than paying in – then we 're left with an average of about 79 million households .
The 79 million households could be termed on average the number of households in which the primary source of income is someone who is below retirement age and actively working at a job that keeps them above the poverty line .
In other words the people who can realistically make the economic contribution to pay significant taxes .
Divide 59 trillion by 79 million , and we all have to come up with $ 747,000 per household .
We ’ve now spent an additional $ 217,000 per household , compared to the USA Today number , but we ’re not done yet .
Step 3 : Pensions & Investments
Step three is to say there 's a lot more to the expenses of paying for retirement for the baby boom than just Social Security and Medicare .
Legally binding promises for pensions have been made by all levels of state and local government as well as major corporations , which are going to require the cashing out of tremendous amounts of retirement investments .
As well as the cashing out of those tens of millions of IRAs and Keogh accounts .
Someone has to come up with money , or more accurately the real goods and services to do so .
So when we add in the cost of cashing out pensions and retirement accounts , we come up with a total figure per able to pay , non-retired household , including Social Security , Medicare , pensions and cashing out retirement investments , of $ 1,060,000 per household .
( That was a quick derivation of Steps One through Three , much more thorough detail is available through my free mini-course . )
Bailout & Stimulus Cost
Now you might think spending a million dollars per US household in one short article would cover it all , but we ’re still not done here , we ’ve got a bailout and stimulus to pay for .
How much is that going to cost ?
The best answer is that no one knows for sure .
Because the true cost of the bailout is so tightly interwoven with what is going on with the overall economy , as well as with the extremely complex and volatile market of over $ 400 trillion ( still outstanding ) in derivative securities contracts that have been entered into by banks around the world .
Since the governments are guaranteeing the banks , that means they are guaranteeing the hundreds of trillions of dollars in derivatives , and we do n't know what that ’s going to end up costing .
Some people are saying no problem , we ’ll get out of this for $ 1 or $ 2 trillion max , and by and large those are the same financial pundits who would have quite confidently assured you two years ago that a crisis like this was categorically impossible , something only a delusional paranoid would believe could happen .
Speaking not as a financial pundit , but as someone who actually structured derivative securities as an investment banker , who wrote a McGraw - Hill book on the subject in 1995 , and who later forecast the steps in which the current crisis would unfold with uncommon precision - we ’ve been lucky so far .
We ’re holding a tenuous line against a wider derivatives disaster that could make 2008 look like a cakewalk , and that line could crumble at any time .
So the cost will likely be somewhere between $ 1 trillion and global financial collapse , but we do need a guess to work with , and maybe a place to start are the official actions of the United States government .
According to the New York Times the total cost of the bailout including commitments for spending , loans and guarantees is $ 12.2 trillion , mostly in the form of Federal Reserve commitments .
To that total we need to add in the cost of the stimulus package of approximately 8/10 of $ 1 trillion so far .
Add bailout and stimulus , and we get a total for official commitments at this time of approximately 13 trillion dollars .
Take the $ 13 trillion , and divide it by the 79 million households , and we come up with a total of about $ 165,000 per non-retired , able to pay household .
That is a fantastic sum of money and there are good reasons why you never see the government present it in that way , and rarely see the mainstream media do so .
That ’s almost enough money to buy a house in many states !
In fact , according to the National Association of Realtors , the median sale price of an existing home in the first quarter of 2009 was $ 169,000 .
So if we look at the cost to the average household of the bailout package , we could have quite literally bought an average American home with each of our shares of the cost .
When we add the cost of each of our non-existent new houses to the trouble we were already in , we come up with the sum of $ 1,225,000 per non-retired , able to pay household .
Your Personal Reality Check
Now here ’s my question for you .
This is an important question , because the answer could change your standard of living for decades .
At what point did you stop believing that you and your family could pay your share ?
Was this final $ 165,000 the straw that broke the camel ’s back ?
The $ 60,000 ?
The $ 217,000 ?
Or was it that first half million , the very well accepted half million , that passed your personal ability to pay ?
Your answer is vital because once we accept that the average household can’t pay , with not even a remote chance of doing so , then we have to accept that tax increases ca n’t pay .
Meaning these newspaper headlines about taxpayers paying for the bailout are an insult to your intelligence .
So , does this mean the US is bankrupt ?
No .
Long story short , nations that can borrow in their own currency do n’t go bankrupt .
Not when they can create trillions of dollars out of thin air at will , Shazaam ! , much like the Federal Reserve has been doing ever since the crisis hit .
Covering The Gap
So taxes can’t pay , it ’s ludicrous to think they can , and the US does n’t declare bankruptcy , just how do we cover the gap ?
Again , very short version .
Pay in full , but make the dollar worth five cents .
Drops the per household cost for everything from $ 1.2 million down to about $ 60,000 .
Painful , but manageable over a period of 20 - 30 years .
The problem is that this solution also drops your savings to a value of 5 cents on the dollar .
Meaning that the $ 100,000 in savings you have just became effectively worth $ 5,000 .
To cover your entire retirement .
History & Solutions
Historically , a collapse in the value of a currency necessarily forces a major redistribution of wealth , and the segment of the population that is most devastated by this seems to always be the same .
It ’s the retirees , and the people close to retirement .
When we look to Germany , when we look to Argentina , when we look to Russia – it is the pensioners who are impoverished more than any other group .
Unfortunately , history is repeatingitself again .
When we look at the headlines about the destruction of retiree investment values , pension assets and so forth , we 're really just seeing the beginning .
Because the crisis " solution " that is being chosen , which is creating dollars without the ability to pay for those dollars , essentially represents the annihilation of most of the retirement dreams of the baby boom generation , even if that is not yet recognized .
There is not an even cost that is being born by society as a whole , rather some segments are bearing much more of the burden than others .
If your peer group ( particularly Boomers and older ) is headed for disproportionate financial devastation , then happenstance is unlikely to offer a personal way out .
Instead , you must instead take quite deliberate actions to change your personal financial position so that wealth is redistributed to you , rather than away from you .
To get out of step with your generation , and have wealth redistributed to you even as your peer group is being devastated by this extraordinary destruction of wealth , you need to start with an essential and irreplaceable step : education .
You need to gain the knowledge you will need to turn adversity into opportunity .
This will mean looking inflation straight in the eye and saying : “ Inflation , you are likely to play a big role in my personal future , and instead of ignoring you or thoughtlessly flailing away at you – I will study you and your ways .
I will learn the deeply unfair ways in which you redistribute wealth , and the counterintuitive lessons about how some investors will be destroyed by inflation and repeatedly pay taxes for the privilege , even while other investors are claiming real wealth on a tax - free basis .
I will learn to position myself so that you redistribute wealth to me , and the worse the financial devastation you wreak – the more my personal real net worth grows . ”
Sign - up for an innovative , free , solutions - based book that will be delivered in a series of 10 to 15 minute long readings .
Do you know how to Turn Inflation Into Wealth ?
To position yourself so that inflation will redistribute real wealth to you , and the higher the rate of inflation – the more your after - inflation net worth grows ?
Do you know how to achieve these gains on a long - term and tax - advantaged basis ?
Do you know how to potentially triple your after - tax and after - inflation returns through Reversing The Inflation Tax ?
So that instead of paying real taxes on illusionary income , you are paying illusionary taxes on real increases in net worth ?
These are among the many topics covered in the free “ Turning Inflation Into Wealth ” Mini-Course .
Starting simple , this course delivers a series of 10 - 15 minute readings , with each reading building on the knowledge and information contained in previous readings .

Iraqis say agriculture in many ares is harder and harder .
The territory of modern - day Iraq was once known as Mesopotamia -- literally , " the land between the two rivers .
" Its abundant access to the waters of the Tigris and Euphrates significantly contributed to a early flourishing of civilization in today 's Iraq .
But now , three years of drought have dramatically affected Iraq 's supply of drinking water .
Hydropower and agricultural production have also been hurt .
River levels have become so low that a farmer in the southern town of Amara says the water shortage has turned the local fields into a desert .
"
The river water used to be 15 or 16 meters high , " the man says .
" Now [ my fields ] have turned into a playground for children to kick a ball around in .
" As river levels dwindle , squabbling has erupted between Iraq and its neighbors over precious water resources .
Both the Euphrates and the Tigris originate in southeastern Turkey .
The Euphrates runs through Syrian territory before reaching Iraq .
The Tigris flows directly into Iraq before merging with the Euphrates .
Water traditionally could also be drawn from several smaller rivers originating in western Iran .
Iraqi officials acknowledge that the drought , coupled with population growth and the absence of an effective water - pricing policy , is responsible for the current water shortage .
But they also accuse Turkey , Syria , and Iran of unfairly restricting the flow of water with dams and other infrastructure .
The disputes threaten to disrupt the newly warm relations between Iraq and its upstream neighbors , and are complicating efforts to bring stability to the region .
Nimrod Raphaeli , a senior analyst with the Washington - based Middle East Media Research Institute , says the growing need for water in the neighboring countries makes the even distribution of the resource a potential source of conflict .
" This is really one of the most serious problems of the Middle East in the future : the risk of war because of shortage of water , because of drought , because of population growth , " Raphaeli says .
" Turkey -- and to some degree Syria , and to a greater extent Iran -- have reduced the flow of water to Iraq .
As a result , Iraq is not getting enough water .
" Iraq estimates its water needs will grow by 50 percent by 2015 , while the available flow is expected to continue dropping as more dams and diversion tunnels are built or planned under the Turkish Southeastern Anatolia Project ( GAP ) .
Completed in 1993 , Turkey 's Ataturk Dam has reportedly reduced the water flow in the Euphrates by one - fifth .
And according to experts , Turkey 's Aliso Dam , whose construction began on the Tigris River in 2006 , will -- if completed -- deprive Iraq of a third of its arable land .
Syria has its own major dam on the Euphrates , the Tabaqah .
And Iran has constructed a number of dams on rivers feeding into the Tigris .
It has also diverted the Karun River , which used to flow into Iraq 's Shatt Al - Arab waterway , at the confluence of the Tigris and the Euphrates rivers .
Amir Salman , the agriculture director for the southern Basra Province , says local farmers now face increasing difficulties as high levels of salinity make the water unusable for agriculture .
Salman says that not enough water is reaching the area from the Tigris and Euphrates , while Iran 's diversion of the Karun River " has further compounded the crisis .
" The Faw district now has sea water , " Salman adds .
" Farmers have stopped irrigating their crops and no longer breed cattle , as that water is n't good for consumption .
" Iranian Foreign Minister Manuchehr Mottaki said on a visit to Baghdad on August 29 that Iranian and Iraqi officials would soon meet to discuss the water issue .
On September 3 , Iraqi , Turkish , and Syrian ministers held a water meeting in Ankara , but Iraq failed in its bid to get more water from Turkey .
Baghdad says Ankara is not allowing as much water to flow downstream as it says it is .
Iraq has also hinted that Syria is not sending all of the water it should down to Iraq .
The parties , however , agreed to meet again in January 2010 in Baghdad .
They also agreed to establish joint stations to measure water volume , monitor and exchange information about climate and drought , and create joint water education programs .
This is little consolation to Iraq 's increasingly desperate farmers .

Globalization and unfettered capitalism have been swept into the history books along with the open - market theory of the 1920s , the experiments of fascism , communism and the New Deal .
It is time for a new economic and political paradigm .
It is time for a new language to address our reality .
The voices of change , those who speak in powerful and yet unfamiliar words , will cry out Sept. 25 and 26 in Pittsburgh when protesters from around the country gather to defy the heads of state , bankers and finance ministers from the world 's 22 largest economies who are convening for a meeting of the G - 20 .
If we heed these dissident voices we have a future .
If we do not we will commit collective suicide .

Police and Protesters at ' 99 Seattle WTO protest ; flickr image by djbones
The international power elites will go to Pittsburgh to preach the mantra that globalization is inevitable and eternal .
They will discuss a corpse as if it was living .
They will urge us to remain in suspended animation and place our trust in the inept bankers and politicians who orchestrated the crisis .
This is the usual tactic of bankrupt elites clinging to power .
They denigrate and push to the margins the realists �none of whom will be inside their security perimeters �who give words to our disintegration and demand a new , unfamiliar course .
The powerful discredit dissent and protest .
But human history , as Erich Fromm wrote , always begins anew with disobedience .
This disobedience is the first step toward freedom .
It makes possible the recovery of reason .
The longer we speak in the language of global capitalism , the longer we utter platitudes about the free market�even as we funnel hundreds of billions of taxpayer dollars into the accounts of large corporations �the longer we live in a state of collective self - delusion .
Our power elite , who profess to hate government and government involvement in the free market , who claim they are the defenders of competition and individualism , have been stealing hundreds of billions of dollars of our money to nationalize mismanaged corporations and save them from bankruptcy .
We hear angry and confused citizens , their minds warped by hate talk radio and television , condemn socialized medicine although we have become , at least for corporations , the most socialized nation on Earth .
The schizophrenia between what we profess and what we actually embrace has rendered us incapable of confronting reality .
The longer we speak in the old language of markets , capitalism , free trade and globalization the longer the entities that created this collapse will cannibalize the nation .
What are we now ?
What do we believe ?
What economic model explains the irrationality of looting the U.S. Treasury to permit speculators at Goldman Sachs to make obscene profits ?
How can Barack Obama 's chief economic adviser , Lawrence Summers , tout a " jobless recovery " ?
How much longer can we believe the fantasy that global markets will replace nation states and that economics will permit us to create a utopian world where we will all share the same happy goals ?
When will we denounce the lie that globalization fosters democracy , enlightenment , worldwide prosperity and stability ?
When we will we realize that unfettered global trade and corporate profit are the bitter enemies of freedom and the common good ?
Corporations are pushing through legislation in the United States that will force us to buy defective , for - profit health insurance , a plan that will expand corporate monopolies and profits at our expense and leave tens of millions without adequate care .
Corporations are blocking all attempts to move to renewable and sustainable energy to protect the staggering profits of the oil , natural gas and coal industries .
Corporations are plunging us deeper and deeper as a nation into debt to feed the permanent war economy and swell the military budget , which consumes half of all discretionary spending .
Corporations use lobbyists and campaign contributions to maintain arcane tax codes that offer them tax havens and tax evasions .
Corporations are draining the treasury while the working class sheds jobs , sees homes foreclosed and struggles to survive in a new and terrifying global serfdom .
This has been the awful price of complacency .
Protests will begin several days before the summit .
Many of the activities are being coordinated by Pittsburgh 's Thomas Merton Center .
There will be a march Sept. 25 for anyone who , as Jessica Benner of the center 's Antiwar Committee stated , " has lost a job , a home , a loved one to war , lost value to a retirement plan , gotten sick from environmental pollution , or lived without adequate healthcare , water , or food . " " There will be at least three tent cities , in addition to a Music Camp beginning Sept. 18 that will be situated at the South Side Riverfront Park near 18th Street .
Unemployed workers will set up one tent city at the Monumental Baptist Church on Sept. 20 and five days later will march on the Convention Center .
The encampment and the march are being organized by the Bail Out the People Movement .
The Institute for Policy Studies , The Nation magazine , the United Electrical , Radio and Machine Workers of America , Pittsburgh United and other organizations will host events including a panel on corporate globalization featuring former World Bank President Joseph Stiglitz , along with a " People 's Tribunal . "
There will be a religious procession calling for social justice and a concert organized by Students for a Democratic Society .
But expect difficulties .
The Secret Service has so far denied protesters permits while it determines the size of the " security perimeter " it will impose around the world leaders .
Pittsburgh has contracted to bring in an extra 4,000 police officers at an estimated cost of $ 9.5 million .
Activist groups have reported incidents of surveillance and harassment .
The struggle to thwart the voices of citizens will be as fierce as the struggle to amplify the voices of the criminal class that is trashing the world 's economy .
These elites will appear from behind closed doors with their communique 's and resolutions to address us in their specialized jargon of power and expertise .
They will attempt to convince us they have not lost control .
They will make recommitments to free - trade agreements from the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade , or GATT , the World Trade Organization and NAFTA , which have all thrust a knife into the backs of the working class .
They will insist that the world can be managed and understood exclusively through their distorted lens of economics .
But their day is over .
They are the apostles of a dead system .
They maintain power through fraud and force .
Do not expect them to go without a struggle .
But they have nothing left to say to us .
" Those who profess to favour freedom , yet deprecate agitation , are men who want crops without plowing up the ground , " Frederick Douglass wrote .
" They want rain without thunder and lightening .
They want the ocean without the awful roar of its many waters .
This struggle may be a moral one ; or it may be a physical one ; or it may be both moral and physical ; but it must be a struggle .
Power concedes nothing without a demand .
It never did and it never will . "
If you can , go to Pittsburgh .
This is an opportunity to defy the titans of the corporate state and speak in words that describe our reality .
The power elite fear these words .
If these words seep into the population , if they become part of our common vernacular , the elite and the systems they defend will be unmasked .
Our collective self - delusion will be shattered .
These words of defiance expose the lies and crimes the elite use to barrel us toward neofeudalism .
And these words , when they become real , propel men and women to resist .
" The end of something often resembles the beginning , " the philosopher John Ralston Saul wrote in " Voltaire 's Bastards . "
" More often than not our nose - to - the - glass view makes us believe that the end we are living is in fact a new beginning .
This confusion is typical of an old civilization 's self - confidence �limited by circumstances and by an absence of memory �and in many ways resembling the sort often produced by senility .
Our rational need to control understanding and therefore memory has simply accentuated the confusion .
" Nothing seems more permanent than a long - established government about to lose power , nothing more invincible than a grand army on the morning of its annihilation . "
Fare soldi in Borsa : impresa impossibile o alla portata di tutti ?
Alzi la mano chi , almeno una volta nella vita , non sia stato tentato dalla Borsa e dai suoi allettanti meccanismi .
Benché investire in Borsa non sia più considerata un’attività per pochi eletti e alla portata di tutti , gli imprevisti sono sempre davvero dietro l’angolo e un’attività errata o una superficiale contemplazione del margine di rischio possono incidere negativamente sul nostro portafoglio .
Ma qual è il segreto per fare soldi in Borsa in modo semplice e sicuro ?
Innanzitutto , bisogna tener presente che il mercato è fortemente instabile , soggetto a oscillazioni improvvise , in grado di decretare il successo o il deprezzamento di un’azione anche nell ’arco di un paio d’ore .
Quindi , la prima strategia da mettere in pratica è proprio studiare i meccanismi insiti alla Borsa , valutare l’attendibilità di una società o di un titolo quotato , capire come si formano realmente i prezzi di scambio dei titoli e , soprattutto , intuire quale sia il momento giusto per vendere e acquistare azioni .
Troppo difficile ?
Certamente non è proprio semplicissimo ma niente di eccessivamente complicato .
Studiare il mercato per evitare rischi e tracolli finanziari
Prima di tracciare i contorni di un fenomeno in costante ascesa , è bene sottolineare che investire in Borsa non può di certo considerarsi un gioco .
Benché “ prima facie ” possa sembrare che le azioni e i titoli fluttuano all ’interno dei mercati senza osservare regole precise , la realtà delle cose è ben diversa giacché i movimenti di un titolo sono determinati da una serie di valori strettamente connessi tra loro , quali la storia e la solidità dell ’azienda , il momento storico e , non ultimo , il generale quadro politico - economico , giusto per fare qualche esempio .
Una regola da tenere sempre a mente è cercare di non puntare mai più del 5 % del capitale per singola azione : in questo modo , infatti , oltre a diversificare quanto più possibile il portafoglio , avremo la sicurezza di non perdere tutto ciò che abbiamo investito in caso di crolli improvvisi delle nostre azioni .
In secondo luogo , sarebbe opportuno non comprare azioni in senso stretto ma investire in Contracts for Difference , quei particolari strumenti che ti consentono di guadagnare sempre e in modo sicuro anche quando l’azione inizia a perdere valore .
Soprattutto se siamo alle prime armi , investire in CFD può essere davvero molto comodo , soprattutto se si considera che , a differenza degli altri titoli azionari , i contracts for difference non sono soggetti alle fluttuazioni del mercato .
E già questo è un bel vantaggio dal punto di vista economico .
Guadagnare in Borsa con il trading
Il segreto per fare soldi in Borsa , inoltre , potrebbe essere intimamente connesso al trading .
Si tratta di una compravendita veloce , da realizzare nell ’arco di pochi giorni ma anche all ’interno della stessa giornata .
Se non ci fidiamo dei programmi automatizzati e non vogliamo studiare strategie “ stop loss ” specifiche , per fare trading dobbiamo armarci di tanta pazienza e studiare il mercato .
Per evitare truffe e investimenti poco oculati , possiamo fare pratica prima con un portafoglio virtuale per poi passare al trading vero e proprio , investendo i nostri soldi .
Tra le piattaforme più interessanti per il trading troviamo eToro : questo broker , infatti , permette di investire replicando le mosse di quegli utenti che hanno ottenuto ottimi guadagni .
Perché non provare ?
Osama bin Laden 's al - Qaida is under heavy pressure in its strongholds in Pakistan 's remote tribal areas and is finding it difficult to attract recruits or carry out spectacular operations in western countries , according to government and independent experts monitoring the organisation .
Speaking to the Guardian in advance of tomorrow 's eighth anniversary of the 9/11 attacks , western counter - terrorism officials and specialists in the Muslim world said the organisation faced a crisis that was severely affecting its ability to find , inspire and train willing fighters .
Its activity is increasingly dispersed to " affiliates " or " franchises " in Yemen and North Africa , but the links of local or regional jihadi groups to the centre are tenuous ; they enjoy little popular support and successes have been limited .
Lethal strikes by CIA drones – including two this week alone – have combined with the monitoring and disruption of electronic communications , suspicion and low morale to take their toll on al - Qaida 's Pakistani " core " , in the jargon of western intelligence agencies .
Interrogation documents seen by the Guardian show that European Muslim volunteers faced a chaotic reception , a low level of training , poor conditions and eventual disillusionment after arriving in Waziristan last year .
" Core " al - Qaida is now reduced to a senior leadership of six to eight men , including Bin Laden and his Egyptian deputy , Ayman al - Zawahiri , according to most informed estimates .
Several other Egyptians , a Libyan and a Mauritanian occupy the other top positions .
In all , there are perhaps 200 operatives who count .
The most significant recent development is evidence that al - Qaida 's alliance with the Taliban in Pakistan and Afghanistan is fraying , boosting the prospect of acquiring intelligence that will lead to Bin Laden 's capture or death .
Despite an intensive US - led manhunt , there has not been a credible lead on the Saudi - born al - Qaida leader in years .
Bin Laden 's nickname among some CIA hunters is " Elvis " because there have been so many false sightings of him .
" Al - Qaida has become a liability for the Taliban , " said Mustafa Alani , a terrorism expert at the Gulf research centre in Dubai who visited Waziristan in July .
" There is a good possibility that the Pakistanis or the Americans will be able to get good intelligence on the ground and kill Bin Laden . "
Intelligence agencies are watching closely to see if Bin Laden issues a message marking tomorrow 's 9/11 anniversary , as he has in the past , or leaves it to Zawahiri .
Last week one Islamist website promised a " Ramadan gift " from the al - Qaida leader but removed the posting without explanation .
Amid a mood of cautious optimism , some experts talk of a " tipping point " in the fight against al - Qaida .
Others argue that only Bin Laden 's death will bring significant change .
But most agree that the failure to carry out spectacular mass attacks in the west since the 2005 London bombings has weakened the group 's " brand appeal " and power to recruit .
" In order to stay relevant al - Qaida have to prove themselves capable and they have n't been able to do that , " said Norwegian scholar Brynjar Lia .
Popular sympathy , which drained away because of sectarian killings in Iraq , has dwindled further this year .
In Saudi Arabia , according to a recent intelligence report , 60 - 70 % of information about al - Qaida suspects now comes from relatives , friends and neighbours , not from security agencies or surveillance .
Another weakness is in the so - called " war of ideas " .
This week imprisoned leaders of the Libyan Islamic Fighting Group began publishing a " revision " of their previous understanding of jihad .
" The text in itself is probably not a landmark work of Islamic jurisprudence , but it is important because it adds to … a corpus of treatises by former militants challenging al - Qaida on theological grounds , " Thomas Hegghammer of Harvard University said on the Jihadica website .
" Of course , no one text is going to change the world , but put together , these treatises will constrain al - Qaida 's recruitment pool somewhat . "
Despite a largely positive balance sheet , no one claims the fight against al - Qaida is over or that " victory " can be declared .
Robert Mueller , the director of the FBI , said in an interview with USA Today this week : " Yes , they retain the capability of striking overseas .
They are still lethal . "
Intelligence experts say the trends are favourable but point to the IRA maxim that " you only need to get lucky once " .
Jonathan Evans , the head of MI5 , warned this year that Somalia could become a safe haven for al - Qaida in the way Afghanistan was in 2001 .
Analysts speak of worries that al - Qaida activity in North Africa and the Sahel could spread to northern Nigeria and affect the UK .
" You have n't lost all those people who were susceptible to the al - Qaida message , ideology or recruitment , " said Richard Barrett , co-ordinator of the UN's al - Qaida and Taliban Monitoring Team .
" The [ al - Qaida leadership ] are really under pressure now but could regroup .
The conditions remain there , the social factors are all still in place . "
' You 've got blood on your hands ' :
Father of dead soldier refuses to shake Blair 's hand after memorial to Britain 's fallen heroes
A father ’s grief and anger boiled over yesterday when he came face to face with the man he blames for his son ’s death .
Tony Blair offered his hand to Peter Brierley during a reception following a service at St Paul ’s to commemorate the dead of the Iraq war .
‘ Do n’t you dare , ’ roared Mr Brierley .
‘ You have my son ’s blood on your hands . ’
David Cameron chats to Cherie Blair as Tony Blair looks on during the reception at London Guildhall where he was snubbed by Peter Brierley
Anger : Peter Brierley said Mr Blair had ' blood on his hands ' .
Mr Brierley 's son , Shaun , was killed on duty in Iraq
Three of the former Prime Minister ’s bodyguards sprang into action , ushering away a visibly shocked Mr Blair , who had earlier been criticised during the service by the Archbishop of Canterbury .
But 59 - year - old Mr Brierley , whose son Shaun died in the run-up to Iraq , was not finished .
Blair 's signature adorns a programme he signed for an Iraq veteran during the reception at London Guildhall
He told the Daily Mail : ‘ As far as I am concerned that man is a war criminal .
I ca n’t bear to be in the same room as him .
I cannot believe he ’s been allowed to come to this reception .
‘ I sat through that service listening to people preaching to me about tolerance but I do n’t think anyone should be forced to tolerate being in the same room as him .
‘ He has made £ 14 million on the back of taking us to war and they are now talking about making him president of the EU .
‘ But I believe he ’s got the blood of my son – and all of the other men and women who died in that war – on his hands . ’
During the St Paul ’s service Dr Rowan Williams had criticised ‘ policy makers ’ for failing to consider the cost of the Iraq conflict at a ceremony to commemorate the end of British operations .
He used his address to the Queen , the Prince of Wales , leading politicians and 2,000 servicemen and their families to remind them that the conflict remained highly controversial .
He said : ‘ Many people of my generation and younger grew up doubting whether we should ever see another straightforward international conflict , fought by a standing army with conventional weapons .
‘ We had begun to forget the realities of cost .
And when such a conflict appeared on the horizon , there were those among both policy makers and commentators who were able to talk about it without really measuring the price , the cost of justice .

Tribute : Jackson Pardoel , 10 , and his mother Kellie arrive at the ceremony .
Jackson is wearing his father 's medal .
Flight Lieutenant Paul Pardoel was killed in 2005 in Iraq when his Hercules was shot down by enemy fire
The conflict in Iraq will , for a long time yet , exercise the historians , the moralists , the international experts .
India Pardoel , six , also wears her father 's medals
‘ In a world as complicated as ours has become , it would be a very rash person who would feel able to say without hesitation , this was absolutely the right or the wrong thing to do , the right or the wrong place to be .
‘ Reflecting on the years of the Iraq campaign , we cannot say that no mistakes were ever made ( when has that ever been the case ? )
But we can be grateful for the courage and honesty shown in facing them . ’
Mr Blair looked ahead , stony - faced , as Dr Williams went on to suggest that if those in power were to take any lesson from the build - up to the Iraq war , it was the importance of avoiding exaggerated rhetoric .
‘ Perhaps we have learned something , if only that there is a time to keep silence , a time to let go of the satisfyingly overblown language that is so tempting to human beings when war is in the air . ’
Some 179 British soldiers and military personnel died between the start of the conflict , known as Operation Telic in March 2003 and the withdrawal of British troops in April this year .
Mr Blair and his wife Cherie had joined several hundred Iraq veterans and their families for yesterday ’s Guildhall reception after the service .
Also there were Prince Charles , the Duchess of Cornwall , Prince William and Princess Anne , who all received a warm welcome .
Mr Blair had appeared in good spirits thanks to the queue of soldiers who had been lining up to have their picture taken with him .
He raised eyebrows by autographing the orders of service offered to him by several of the guests before turning to Mr Brierley , from Batley , West Yorkshire , who said he ‘ could n’t help but let rip ’ .
Lance Corporal Shaun Brierley , a member of the 1st ( UK ) Armoured Division Signals Regiment , was one of the first to die shortly before the start of hostilities in March 2003 .
The 28 - year - old career soldier , who was married with a four - year - old son , was transferring troops from Kuwait towards the front line when his Land Rover , which had infra-red plates fitted over a headlight , crashed .
His father , a member of the Stop The War Coalition , subsequently went to the House of Lords seeking an independent inquiry into the war , arguing that his son ’s death was the result of a ‘ rushed job ’ .
Yesterday he added : ‘ Six years may have gone by but the pain is always there .
Every time I see footage of a coffin coming off a plane , it brings it all flooding back and reminds me of what happened to Shaun .
‘ Accidents can happen anywhere , I understand that .
Shaun was a soldier to his very marrow and knew the risks .
‘ But there were so many fundamental problems with the operation and had they been addressed , this accident would not have happened .
‘ The truth is that we went to war on the lies of Blair and his weapons of mass destruction .
‘ He sent our fine men and women to fight without proper transport , kit or arms .
And as a result of that decision , I have lost my son .
‘ No other parent should have to go through what we have gone through and he needs to know that . ’

A target for poachers
An undercover investigation has found that up to two gorillas are killed and sold as bushmeat each week in Kouilou , a region of the Republic of Congo .
The apes ' body parts are then taken downriver and passed on to traders who sell them in big -city markets .
Conducted by the conservation group Endangered Species International , the investigation helps expose the extent of gorilla poaching in the country .
It fears hundreds more gorillas may be taken each year outside the region .
The group began its investigation by going undercover , talking to sellers and traders at food markets in Pointe Noire , the second largest city in the Republic of Congo .
Over the course of a year , investigators visited the markets twice a month , recording the amount of bushmeat for sale .
" Gorilla meat is sold pre-cut and smoked for about $ 6 per ' hand - sized ' piece .
Actual gorilla hands are also available , " says Mr Pierre Fidenci , president of Endangered Species International ( ESI ) .
The gorilla meat goes to the nearest , biggest and most profitable place
Mr Pierre Fidenci , president of Endangered Species International " Over time we got the confidence of the sellers and traders .
They gave us the origin of the gorilla meat and it all comes from a single region . "
The team then undertook an expedition to travel to the source of this meat , a forested area called Kouilou , which lies along the Kouilou River around 100 to 130 km from Pointe Noire .
Using the same boats that ferry the gorilla meat downriver to the city , the investigators travelled upstream , taking photographs and recording interviews with villagers which revealed the extent of the gorilla poaching .
The investigators also undertook field surveys to ascertain the size of the population of wild western lowland gorillas living in the region .
" According to interviews and field surveys , we think we may have about 200 gorillas left in the area , " says Mr Fidenci .
" But we estimate that 4 % of the population is being killed each month , or 50 % in a year .
It is a lot . "
The poachers particularly target adult gorillas of reproductive age which carry the most meat .
A poached gorilla made ready for transportation
With such heavy hunting , the researchers believe gorillas could disappear from the region within a decade .
" During our mission we observed killing of gorillas in the wild .
In less than one week and a half in one particular area we had two adult gorillas killed for their meat , " Mr Fidenci says .
All the meat appears to be consumed in Pointe Noire rather than being exported .
" The gorilla meat goes to the nearest , biggest and most profitable place , " says Mr Fidenci .
" Our study has disclosed the horrific scale of the endangered species market in the Republic of Congo , especially endangered gorillas sold as meat . "
Overall , ESI estimates that at least 300 gorillas are sold to markets each year in the country .
Vulnerable Western lowland gorillas ( Gorilla gorilla gorilla ) are one of two subspecies of Western gorilla , the other being the Cross River gorilla ( Gorilla gorilla diehli ) .
Western lowland gorillas are considered to be critically endangered , as their population has fallen by more than 80 % in three generations .
Between 100,000 and 125,000 western lowland gorillas are thought to survive across their entire geographic range which spans several countries .
But the dense and remote forest habitat in which they live often makes it difficult to reliably estimate the population size .
This adult gorilla 's hand was amputated , likely to be sold as a superstitious charm Mr Fidenci hopes to go back to Kouilou to find out more about the remaining gorillas living there and to find a way to conserve them .
" We intend to stop the killing in the area by providing alternative income to locals and working with hunters not against them .
We hope to conduct conservation awareness with educational programs with other NGOs and to create a gorilla nature reserve . "
" We need to tackle the problem where it starts , right there where people and gorillas live . "
Currently , little is done in the country to prevent the poaching of bushmeat , Mr Fidenci says .
" Enforcement does not exist .
Even though there are existing laws which protect endangered wildlife against such activities . "

The DECC document adds households could even have their power to some appliances turned off remotely to help the national grid if there is too much demand .
It says : " In terms of potentially intrusive non-physical behaviour unrelated to data , smart metering potentially offers scope for remote intervention such as dynamic demand management , which is designed to assist management of the network and thus security of supply .
This could involve direct supplier or distribution company interface with equipment , such as refrigerators , within a property , overriding the control of the householder . "
Our global community is growing all the time .
The Earth is now home to 6.7 billion people , and the question is looming : Just how many of us can the planet support ?
LEVANTE JANOS / ISTOCKPHOTO
In many discussions about the environment , population growth is the last thing anyone wants to talk about .
For one thing , family size is a subject that quickly becomes very personal .
And when you consider that one of the most important decisions that people make is whether to have children — and if so , when , how many and with whom — it ’s no surprise that even theoretical discussions about population concerns and family planning can turn into awkward conversations .
Nonetheless , global population growth is an issue that begs to be discussed .
After all , population size is directly tied to many other issues that affect everyone on the planet — access to clean air and water , wealth and poverty , and global supplies of food and energy .
So let ’s start with a simple question .
How many of us are there ?
By the Numbers
As I ’m writing this , the population clock on the U.S. Census Bureau Web page estimates world population as 6,724,401,912 .
What do you want to bet that ’s off by at least one or two people ?
But you get the idea the clock is meant to convey : World population is growing rapidly and continuously , and 6.7 billion is a good estimate of where we are today .
Another population counter on this page puts the U.S. population at about 305 million .

Trying to predict future population growth requires a little more guesswork .
For a good discussion of this issue , check out this recent article from the nonprofit Worldwatch Institute .
It notes that most demographers expect that by 2050 world population will be between 8 billion and 11 billion people .
However , as the author points out , these estimates assume a slowdown in birth rates that may not materialize .
Here ’s a graphic showing different population projections based on high and low estimates of growth .
And that leads us to a more difficult question :
What do these different possibilities mean for the planet ?
How many people is too many ?
A Global Issue
There ’s a lot of debate about how many people the Earth can reasonably sustain , but you do n’t have to look far to find evidence that we ’re already experiencing a few problems .
Here are a handful of articles linking population growth to the loss of forests and biodiversity , and increases in the greenhouse gas emissions that are causing climate change .
Population growth also puts a strain on water resources and food supplies .

In fact , weed may decrease the chances of schizophrenia .

Roomalaiskatolisten pappien harjoittama lasten ja nuorten hyväksikäyttö on noussut otsikoihin Italiassa .
Kymmenet uhrit ovat kertoneet raa 'at tarinansa ensi kertaa .
Kymmenen viime vuoden aikana julkisuuteen on noussut 73 alaikäisten lasten hyväksikäyttötapausta , kertoo uutistoimisto AP .
Uhreja tapauksissa oli kaikkiaan 235 .
Hyväksikäyttö jatkui vuosikymmeniä
Uhrit asuivat usein köyhien , vammaisten ja huumeriippuvaisten lasten ja nuorten katolisissa oppilaitoksissa .
Hyväksikäyttöä on kirjattu tapahtuneen muun muassa pappien makuuhuoneissa , kylpyhuoneissa ja jopa ehtoollisen aikana .
Esimerkiksi veronalaisen Antonio Provolo - oppilaitoksen 67 entistä oppilasta on allekirjoittanut asiakirjan , jossa koulun pappeja ja munkkeja syytetään seksuaalisesta hyväksikäytöstä , pedofiliasta ja väkivallasta 1950 - luvulta 1980 - luvulle .
Lapsia pakotettiin osallistumaan prostituutioon ja satanistisiin rituaaleihin .
Uhreja lahjottiin makeisilla ja limonadilla sekä kultaisilla ristikaulakoruilla .
Koulun entinen oppilas Alessandro Vantini kertoi uutistoimisto AP: lle , kuinka hänet toistuvasti raiskattiin lapsena .
Koska hän oli kuuro , hänen oli erityisen vaikea rikkoa munkkien vaatimaa vaikenemisen sääntöä .
Vantini kärsi masennuksesta 30 - vuotiaaksi asti .
Yhdysvallat ja Irlanti etunenässä
Italian tapaukset ovat tulleet julkisuuteen sen jälkeen kun Yhdysvaltain ja Irlannin katolisten kirkkojen skandaalit ovat vähitellen paljastuneet 1990 - ja 2000 - luvuilla .
Molemmissa maissa käydään oikeutta sadoista paljastuneista hyväksikäyttötapauksista .
Yhdysvalloissa on noin 44 700 katolista pappia - heistä neljäätuhatta on syytetty hyväksikäytöstä .
Yhdysvalloissa kirkko on maksanut yli kahden miljardin euron edestä korvauksia uhreille , Irlannissa puolestaan yli miljardin .
Italiassa paljastuneiden tapausten määrä on vain murto - osa verrattuna anglikaanisiin maihin .
Italiassa kirkko on maksanut uhreille korvauksia 15 000 eurosta 150 000 euroon uhria kohden .
Kirkon salaiset kansiot aukeavat
Katolisen kirkon arvostus on erittäin voimakasta Italiassa , ja hyväksikäytöistä puhuminen oli tabu vuosikymmenien ajan .
Tapausten tulo julkisuuteen osoittaa , kuinka kirkonmiesten koskemattomuus on alkanut murentua .
Ainakin yksi italialaismunkki on tunnustanut syyllisyytensä hyväksikäyttöön .
Myös Antonio Provolo - oppilaitos on myöntänyt , että hyväksikäyttöä on voinut tapahtua .
- Joitakin tapauksia on voinut olla , mätiä omenoita saattaa aina olla joukossa , koulun edustaja Carlo de Gresti sanoi AP:lle .
Vatikaanin syyttäjän Charles Sciclunan mukaan tietoisuus ongelmasta on kasvanut Yhdysvalloissa paljastuneiden tapausten jälkeen .
Sciclunan mukaan hyväksikäyttöä on tapahtunut katolisissa instituutioissa vuosikymmenten ajan .
- Sitä on tapahtunut aina .
Tästä on tärkeä puhua , koska muuten kirkko ei voi tarjota apua ja tukea niille , jotka sitä tarvitsevat - niin uhreille kuin syyllisille , Scicluna sanoi .

After having called myself an Agnostic Atheist for quite a while now , I ’ve come to the conclusion that the most difficult part about doing so is “ coming out of the closet . ”
I ’d love to sit here and say it has been easy and everyone has been really acceptant and understanding , but reality would have to disagree with you .
There are a lot of people that are well aware of my Atheism and there are a lot of ( important ) people that do not .
This would include my parents , one of my brothers , and well … most of my family .
I do n’t really intend on telling any of them anytime soon , but surely it will get out eventually .
And the thought of that scares the living hell out of me .
I am the type of person that does n’t care what someone thinks about me , but when it comes to family ?
I just ca n’t cope when someone I love ( usually family ) does n’t approve of my actions , beliefs , and shows disappointment or worry towards me .
I can honestly say that I am worried of how my parents would react if they were aware that I do not believe in god .
I mean , we ’re not really the church - going type of family , but we surely express the fact that there is a god , Jesus is cool , and that prayer is important .
That right there is enough for me to be afraid of what they would think of me had I “ come out of the closet . ”
And the thing that really sucks is that there really is n’t a “ good ” way of going about telling someone , and if there is –I sure as hell am not aware of it .
I mean the only way I can see it happening is the basic “ well … I ’ve got some bad news ”
And then they get all worried and start tripping and your like “ well , after a lot of thought and reflection I ’ve come to the conclusion that there is no god . ”
And then they ’re like “ oh shit !
curse you !
I do n’t want you to burn in hell !! ”
And well , thats the end of it .
Now does n’t THAT sound like a bag of cookies ?
I suppose I ’m being irrational .
Not every person I ’ve actually told has reacted like that .
There ’s the people that subtly tell you that they think you are a moron and have no reason to not believe .
I almost would rather have someone be worried about me than think I ’m an idiot .
Cause if I was an idiot , I would never have put such deep thought into something so serious .
I suppose that is the way I look at it .
So to conclude : coming out of the closet sucks … and I ’m not looking forward to it .
I wish more people were more acceptant of peoples religious decisions , but they are n’t .
So–Americans are idiots .
Thats the way I see it .
Why is a place that is based and formed off of the concept of “ freedom of religion ” going to be so damn judgmental on religious concepts .
It ’s shit like this why we will never have a non-Christian President .
64 - bit computing used to be the province of scientists and engineers , but now this generational shift in computing gives all users the tools to apply the power of 64 - bit to speed up everything from everyday applications to the most demanding scientific computations .
Although Mac OS X is already 64 - bit capable in many ways , Snow Leopard takes the next big step by rewriting nearly all system applications in 64 - bit code¹ and by enabling the Mac to address massive amounts of memory .
Now Mac OS
X is faster , more secure , and completely ready for the future .
The 64 - bit transition .
The entire computing industry is moving from 32 - bit to 64 - bit technology , and it ’s easy to see why .
Today ’s Mac computers can hold up to 32 GB of physical memory , but the 32 - bit applications that run on them can address only 4GB of RAM at a time .
64 - bit computing shatters that barrier by enabling applications to address a theoretical 16 billion gigabytes of memory , or 16 exabytes .
It can also enable computers to crunch twice the data per clock cycle , which can dramatically speed up numeric calculations and other tasks .
Earlier versions of Mac OS X have offered a range of 64 - bit capabilities .
Now Snow Leopard takes the next step in the transition from 32 - bit to 64 - bit .
Built - in applications are now 64 - bit .
Nearly all system applications — including the Finder , Mail , Safari , iCal , and iChat — are now built with 64 - bit code .
So not only are they able to take full advantage of all the memory in your Mac , but the move to 64 - bit applications also boosts overall performance .
Together with other refinements and improvements in Snow Leopard , this means that just about everything you do — from launching applications like QuickTime to running JavaScript in Safari to opening image files — will feel faster and more responsive .
Ready for the future .
The 64 - bit support in Snow Leopard makes Mac OS X completely ready for whatever computing enhancements might arrive in the future .
For example , Snow Leopard is ready to support up to 16 terabytes of RAM — about 500 times more than today ’s Mac computers can accommodate .
That may sound like more RAM than you ’ll ever need , but who can predict the requirements of high - performance computers in the future ?
Mac OS X Snow Leopard comes prepared for anything .

Social networking website , myYearbook , recently ran a survey of over 10,000 U.S. teens aged 13 - 17 to see if they could ascertain the real reasons behind their seeming avoidance of Twitter .
What they found was interesting .
Not only did Twitter have a higher percentage of teens than Facebook ( 11 % vs. 9 % ) , but they also visited the website more often than 25 - 44 year olds ( 5.2 times per month vs. 5 times per month ) .
" To be sure , the truthiness of the headline " Teens Don't Tweet " is persuasive , " writes Geoff Cook , cofounder and CEO of myYearbook in a recent guest post on TechCrunch .
" It really does feel true , and on one level it is : the vast majority of teens do n't tweet .
Of course , the vast majority of the adult population does n't tweet either . "
The survey found that Twitter does n't engage teens as much as social hubs like Facebook and MySpace .
In fact , many signed up for the service and never used it again .
Why ?
Because , explains Cook , they are already satisfying their need to keep their status up - to - date , follow celebrities / bands and stay in touch with others via the likes of Facebook and MySpace .
" Most teens do n't use Twitter because it does n't enable them to do anything they can't already do elsewhere , which is the same reason most adults do n't use Twitter , " writes Cook .
" It has nothing to do with any teen - specific concerns like texting plans or safety .
It comes down to something more simple : delivering value beyond Facebook and MySpace -- a competitive moat that Facebook is bridging one move at a time , from the Everyone button to the acquisition of FriendFeed to the centrality of the stream itself . "
The future of teens on Twitter does n't look too bright .
When asked if they would eventually get a Twitter account , 83 % said no and 63 % believe it 's a passing fad .
The number one reason for not being on Twitter was " it 's lame " , followed by " my friends do n't use it " and " I do n't understand it " .

After seeing how many nukes would it take to obliterate humanity instantly , I wanted some good news .
Like , how many solar panels would it take to power the entire world ?
The entire surface of Africa , maybe ?
Actually , it 's surprisingly less .

Just 496,905 square kilometers .
That 's really nothing compared to the total world area : Less than the surface of Spain ( 504,030 square kilometers ) covered with solar panels , distributed across deserts and areas with almost 24/ 7 sun , all year around .
What is Extraordinary Life & What is Education ?
Krishnamurti said that :
We must understand all that is life ;
The conflicts :
The constant battle between groups , races and nations , the subtle , hidden things of the mind - the envies , the ambitions , the passions , the fears , fulfillments and anxieties .
The extraordinary :
All life is extraordinary , the earth and all the animals and plants on it and everything else , all are extraordinary .
If people do not understand that whole process of life , then they will miss that whole point of life .
They will not understand how extraordinary life is and will not live it to their upmost potential , and instead will decay , deteriorate , and whither away .
If people understand the battles in themselves and be free of them , their world will transform ; they will no longer suffer in conflicts within , and they will have right relationship and passion for all lives ; between two people , all humans , all animals and the earth .
If education does not help people to understand life then it is meaningless , because in order to live a good life it is necessary to know what life is all about , and it is necessary to have intelligence ; the capacity to think freely without fear , without having to conform , in order to discover what is true .
MILLIONS OF glasses of Irish stout will be raised across the world today to toast the 250th anniversary of the country ’s most famous export , Guinness .
To celebrate company founder Arthur Guinness ’s decision to sign a 9,000 year lease on a brewery at St James ’s Gate in Dublin on this day in 1759 , the current custodians of Ireland ’s best know brand , Diageo , have organised events in Europe , Asia and Africa .
Thousands are expected to attend an invite only party at the Guinness Storehouse in Dublin , where Tom Jones , Kasabian and Estelle are to perform .
The event , which will be streamed live to thousands of pubs via Sky television , is to be hosted by Boyzone frontman Ronan Keating and English TV presenter Cat Deeley .
A number of other acts will perform at four venues across the city .
The Kooks and Richard Hawley are to play at The Academy , David Gray and The Enemy take to the stage at Whelan ’s , Calvin Harris and Jamie Cullum are to perform at Tripod , while Razorlight and Sugababes play at Vicar St .
A host of other artists will perform at events in 28 smaller pubs around Dublin , while , at the same time , reggae star Sean Paul will play in Lagos , Nigeria , and the Black Eyed Peas will headline a show in Kuala Lumpur , Malaysia .
The Hon Desmond Guinness – the great , great , great , great grandson of Arthur – said he would be enjoying a low key event at the site of the first Guinness brewery in Leixlip , Co Kildare .
The company has dubbed this Arthur ’s Day and has requested that those taking part in the celebrations raise their glasses at 17.59 today to mark the signing of the St James ’s Gate lease in 1759 .
Diageo has pledged to give € 2.5 million this year to social entrepreneurs from the Arthur Guinness Fund , while An Post has printed a commemorative stamp in honour of Arthur , just as it did in 1959 .

White House Adviser Van Jones Resigns Amid Controversy Over Past Activism

White House environmental adviser Van Jones resigned late Saturday after a simmering controversy over his past statements and activism erupted into calls for his ouster from Republican leaders on Friday .
White House spokesman Robert Gibbs on Sunday explained the resignation on ABC's " This Week with George Stephanopoulos , " saying , " Van Jones decided was that the agenda of this president was bigger than any one individual . "
The president does not endorse Jones 's past statements and actions , " but he thanks him for his service , " Gibbs said .
A White House official , who spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss a personnel matter , said Jones 's past was not studied as intensively as other advisers because of his relatively low rank .
Jones 's position did not require Senate confirmation , so he avoided the kind of vetting Cabinet officials were subjected to .
In addition , as an adviser to the Council on Environmental Quality , rather than to Obama directly , his past was not reviewed to the same degree as the more senior " assistants to the president " and other top advisers inside the West Wing .
The result was the revelation of a controversial past that , administration officials acknowledge , caught the White House off guard .
" He was not as thoroughly vetted as other administration officials , " the official said .
" It 's fair to say there were unknowns . "
The announcement that Jones was stepping down came minutes after midnight Sunday morning .
" On the eve of historic fights for health care and clean energy , opponents of reform have mounted a vicious smear campaign against me , " Jones said .
" They are using lies and distortions to distract and divide . "
He continued : " I have been inundated with calls -- from across the political spectrum -- urging me to ' stay and fight . '
But I came here to fight for others , not for myself .
I cannot in good conscience ask my colleagues to expend precious time and energy defending or explaining my past .
We need all hands on deck , fighting for the future . "
Jones , who joined the administration in March as special adviser for green jobs at the CEQ , had issued two public apologies in recent days , one for signing a petition in 2004 from the group 911 Truth.org that questioned whether Bush administration officials " may indeed have deliberately allowed 9/11 to happen , perhaps as a pretext for war " and the other for using a crude term to describe Republicans in a speech he gave before joining the administration .
His one - time involvement with the Bay Area radical group Standing Together to Organize a Revolutionary Movement ( STORM ) , which had Marxist roots , had also become an issue .
And on Saturday his advocacy on behalf of death - row inmate Mumia Abu - Jamal , who was convicted of shooting a Philadelphia police officer in 1981 , threatened to develop into a fresh point of controversy .
Fox News Channel host Glenn Beck launched the drive against Jones and all but declared war on him after a group Jones founded in 2005 , ColorofChange.org , led an advertising boycott against Beck 's show to protest his claim that Obama is a racist .
Rep. Mike Pence ( R - Ind . ) called on Jones to resign Friday , saying in a statement , " His extremist views and coarse rhetoric have no place in this administration or the public debate . "
Senator Christopher S. Bond ( R - Mo. ) urged Congress to investigate Jones 's " fitness " for the position , writing in an open letter , " Can the American people trust a senior White House official that is so cavalier in his association with such radical and repugnant sentiments ? "
On Saturday , Sen. John Cornyn ( R - Texas ) , chairman of the National Republican Senatorial Committee , wrote on his Twitter account , " Van Jones has to go . "
Jones 's resignation was foreshadowed Friday when Gibbs gave only tepid support for him when pressed , saying that Jones " continues to work for the administration . "
He declined to state that the adviser enjoyed the full support of President Obama , instead referring questions to the environmental council where he worked .
Jones , a towering figure in the environmental movement , had worked for the White House Council on Environmental Quality since March .
He was a civil - rights activist in California before turning his focus to environmental and energy issues , and he won wide praise before joining the Obama administration for articulating a broad vision of a green economy Democrats could embrace .
White House adviser David Axelrod , on NBC's " Meet the Press , " said Sunday he had not spoken with the president about Jones .
" The political environment is rough , and so these things get magnified .
But the bottom line is that he showed his commitment to the cause of creating green jobs in this country by removing himself as an issue , and I think that took a great deal of commitment on his part , " he said .
On FOX News Sunday , Sen. Lamar Alexander ( R - Tenn . ) and former House Speaker Newt Gingrich declined to criticize Jones directly , though Alexander did question why the Obama administration had appointed so many issue czars .
" I do n't think he's the issue , " Alexander said .
" I think the czars are the issue . "
Former Vermont governor Howard Dean rallied to Jones ' defense , saying he had signed the controversial 9 - 11 " Truther " petition by mistake .
" I think he was brought down .
It 's too bad , " Dean said .
" I think it 's a loss for the country . "

Homeopathic remedies often contain few or no active ingredients People with conditions such as HIV , TB and malaria should not rely on homeopathic treatments , the World Health Organization has warned .
It was responding to calls from young researchers who fear the promotion of homeopathy in the developing world could put people 's lives at risk .
The group Voice of Young Science Network has written to health ministers to set out the WHO view .
However practitioners said there were areas where homeopathy could help .
There is no objective evidence that homeopathy has any effect on these infections
Dr Nick Beeching , Royal Liverpool University Hospital
In a letter to the WHO in June , the medics from the UK and Africa said : " We are calling on the WHO to condemn the promotion of homeopathy for treating TB , infant diarrhoea , influenza , malaria and HIV .
" Homeopathy does not protect people from , or treat , these diseases .
" Those of us working with the most rural and impoverished people of the world already struggle to deliver the medical help that is needed .
" When homeopathy stands in place of effective treatment , lives are lost . "
Dr Robert Hagan is a researcher in biomolecular science at the University of St Andrews and a member of Voice of Young Science Network , which is part of the charity Sense About Science campaigning for " evidence - based " care .
He said : " We need governments around the world to recognise the dangers of promoting homeopathy for life - threatening illnesses .
" We hope that by raising awareness of the WHO 's position on homeopathy we will be supporting those people who are taking a stand against these potentially disastrous practices . "
' No evidence ' Dr Mario Raviglione , director of the Stop TB department at the WHO , said : " Our evidence - based WHO TB treatment / management guidelines , as well as the International Standards of Tuberculosis Care do not recommend use of homeopathy . "
This is just another poorly wrapped attempt to discredit homeopathy
Paula Ross , Society of Homeopaths
The doctors had also complained that homeopathy was being promoted as a treatment for diarrhoea in children .
But a spokesman for the WHO department of child and adolescent health and development said : " We have found no evidence to date that homeopathy would bring any benefit .
" Homeopathy does not focus on the treatment and prevention of dehydration - in total contradiction with the scientific basis and our recommendations for the management of diarrhoea . "
Dr Nick Beeching , a specialist in infectious diseases at the Royal Liverpool University Hospital , said : " Infections such as malaria , HIV and tuberculosis all have a high mortality rate but can usually be controlled or cured by a variety of proven treatments , for which there is ample experience and scientific trial data .
" There is no objective evidence that homeopathy has any effect on these infections , and I think it is irresponsible for a healthcare worker to promote the use of homeopathy in place of proven treatment for any life - threatening illness . "
Homework However Paula Ross , chief executive of the Society of Homeopaths , said it was right to raise concerns about promotion of homeopathy as a cure for TB , malaria or HIV and Aids .
But she added : " This is just another poorly wrapped attempt to discredit homeopathy by Sense About Science .
" The irony is that in their efforts to promote evidence in medicine , they have failed to do their own homework .
" There is a strong and growing evidence base for homeopathy and most notably , this also includes childhood diarrhoea . "
The UK's Faculty of Homeopathy added that there was also evidence homeopathy could help people with seasonal flu .
Dr Sara Eames , president of the faculty , said people should not be deprived of effective conventional medicines for serious disease .
But she added : " Millions die each year as those affected have no access to these drugs .
" It therefore seems reasonable to consider what beneficial role homeopathy could play .
What is needed is further research and investment into homeopathy . "

BBC News , in Central Perk , London
Five years after Ross , Rachel , Monica , Chandler , Phoebe and Joey stopped entertaining millions worldwide with their tangled love lives and flawless complexions , the sitcom and its devoted fans remain the best of friends .
In 1994 , Friends opened in a New York coffee shop where five twenty - somethings were hanging out , when Rachel burst in wearing a wedding dress , having jilted her fiance and seeking the support of her childhood friend Monica .
Familiar place , different faces
While the characters ' apartments would become hugely familiar settings during 10 hit seasons of Friends , it was the coffee shop , Central Perk , where all six gathered each week , that would become the show 's defining location .
" It 's the heart of it , " says David Brownlie - Marshall , at the front of a queue of excited fans for the opening of a replica Central Perk in Broadwick Street , central London .
The venue , open for just two weeks to mark the 15th anniversary of the show 's start , expects to welcome about 900 visitors a day - but with a limit of 50 at one time for space reasons .
It serves only coffee , free with a voucher downloaded online , and available in five varieties faithful to the original Central Perk menu board .
But the 150 or so people who make their way through Central Perk 's doors in the first hour of opening are not there for refreshments .
CENTRAL PERK CLASSIC SCENES
After more than a season of ' will they , wo n't they ? ' , and some difficulty unlocking the doors , Ross and Rachel share their first kiss After Ross starts , the friends join in humming The Odd Couple theme ; Ross 's attempt at an encore is quickly silenced by Chandler Phoebe splits from a boyfriend with a quick word and a hug , as Chandler records " the worst break - up in the history of the world " with Janice A flashbacks episode shows a bar due to become " some kinda coffee place " , where Ross and Phoebe share a clinch on the pool table Friends ' final scene sees them deciding to get a coffee before Chandler and Monica leave the city for their new home ; " Where ? " quips Chandler " I do n't even like coffee , " says 22 - year - old Katie Walker , from Surrey , giving her free drink away to her friend .
" I was big fan of the TV show and it 's just a nice novelty thing to do .
It looks pretty authentic , " she adds .
The most desirable seat in the place is the iconic orange sofa , which was perpetually free to be sat in by the main characters .
But in the replica Central Perk there is no possibility of getting comfortable there , due to the constant disruption of people wanting their photographs taken on it .
" I just had a moment when we were sitting on the sofa and I thought , ' We 're in Friends , ' " says Mr Brownlie - Marshall , a 25 - year - old press officer from London .
" I felt like I was in it - everybody was sitting around on the stools .
It 's really quite surreal . "
" I think it 's recreated it really , really well , " says his friend , Claire Chin-Sue .
" It 's good to see all the memorabilia , especially the Geller Cup - I love that episode . "
Fans cannot wait to be " in " Friends
There are other props displayed alongside the disgustingly ugly trophy contested by Ross and Monica as children .
There is the equally ugly bridesmaid dress Rachel was forced to wear to her ex-fiance 's wedding , the turkey that two characters manage to get on their heads , and " The List " Ross composed to help him choose between Rachel and Julie .
" It 's brought back all the memories , " says Miss Chin - Sue , a 28 - year - old editor from London .
" We are sad that it ended , to be honest .
Everyone watched it ; all my friends watched it .
We all watched Friends together as friends . "
' Emotional attachment ' Tracey Evans , 39 , and Sophie Atkinson , 31 , are incorporating a Central Perk visit into their London honeymoon .
" At university we used to get the videos out and watch all the episodes back - to - back with a few glasses of wine generally , " says Miss Atkinson .
Gone but not forgotten Miss Walker says : " The only other show is Sex and the City , I went to some of those locations in New York , but I would n't for any other shows . "
" It kind of had a different cultural significance , " Miss Atkinson adds .
" Everyone went out and got the Rachel haircut ; it kind of set fashions and trends .
" I did n't get the highlights , but I did have the choppy thing going on , " she admits .
" It 's sad , is n't it ? "
While other sitcoms during Friends ' lifetime also won critical acclaim and vast global audiences , fans ' relationship to Friends seems unusually personal and affectionate .
Dr Brett Mills , senior lecturer at the University of East Anglia and author of books on television sitcom , considers Friends the key sitcom of its era .
It is distinguished , he says , by successfully engaging viewers ' emotions as well as making them laugh .
" The first cliffhanger we were given was , will Ross and Rachel get together ?
So the programme says to you from the outset , this is a romantic comedy , " Dr Mills says .
" You feel as an audience an emotional attachment to the characters - I feel like I have lived through the relationship of Ross and Rachel for 10 years . "
CENTRAL PERK TRIVIA
It was reportedly based on a coffee shop at Brandeis University , Massachusetts , where the show 's creators studied Insomnia Cafe was among other titles considered for the show ( with contenders including Friends Like Us , Six of Us and Across the Hall ) Manhattan 's West Village is the setting of the coffee house and main apartment building , although filming was in Los Angeles
The artwork in Central Perk changed every three episodes The Central Perk set was dismantled once to make way for a Caesar 's Palace set seen in episodes based in Las Vegas
The pre-credits sequence after Ross and Rachel kiss for the first time in the doorway of Central Perk typifies the show 's skilful juggling act .
Rachel describes the kiss in the minutest detail to a rapt Monica and Phoebe ; " They started on my waist .
And then they slid up , and then they were in my hair , " she says , recalling Ross 's hand movements , to gasps from her friends .
The show then cuts to the three men eating pizza : " Then I kissed her , " says Ross ; " Tongue ? " queries Joey ; " Yeah , " says Ross ; " Cool . "
Dr Mills says : " Men and women watch it together and they might be watching for completely different reasons , but it 's managed to straddle those two sides . "
Paul McNeilage , a 22 - year - old graphic designer visiting the replica Central Perk , talks of feeling " part of the Friends family " .
" We followed them each week ; not only did you identify with the characters , you are looking forward to seeing them the next week . "
" People felt like they belonged to the show , " he adds .
" That must be one of the reasons why the majority of people coming here will be here .
" A lot of Londoners have n't had the occasion of going to California and going to the set .
It 's a way of belonging to the whole thing . "

I came out of the closet when I was 14 , but rarely have I held another man 's hand in public .
I 'm a pragmatist .
The feeling of cosy belonging might be delightful in theory , but as a gay person , it 's not that simple – it necessitates a constant risk assessment of one 's surroundings .
Which may explain why my hands are sweating .
I 'm standing outside The George and Dragon , a gay pub on east London 's Hackney Road , waiting to meet a man who has agreed to walk hand in hand with me .
You might think that these days people would barely notice .
But things have changed .
We 're in the midst of a new wave of anti-gay hate crimes : since April there has been a 14 % rise nationwide in attacks on gay people .
There were four homophobic murders in London last year ; last week Ian Baynham died a fortnight after being attacked in Trafalgar Square .
In summer mobs of youths besieged gay bars in east London .
And , just a few metres from where I 'm standing , a 21 - year - old man was left paralysed last year after a gang stabbed him repeatedly .
Gay people are getting scared .
I 'm scared .
The man I 'm meeting is Dave Atkins , the mercifully tall and broad founder of A Day in Hand , an organisation dedicated to encouraging gay people to hold hands in public .
" You have to go out and do it , " he booms .
" It 's the only way things will change . "
He grabs my hand .
We pass an elderly woman who stares straight ahead .
Next come a couple in their 30s with two young children .
They seem incomprehensibly absorbed in what their toddler is doing .
A man saunters by .
He clocks our clasped hands before looking away .
Was that a hostile look ?
" Let 's go up here , " I say , leading Dave into the Boundary estate where those mobs are rumoured to have come from .
We pass a group of youths .
They appear to find their iPhones more compelling than the sight of two interlocked homosexuals .
At Whitechapel market a pair of bargain hunters glance first at us , down at our hands , and back to the two - for - ones .
Then something shocking happens .
We turn into a quiet side street .
Dave and I are engrossed in our conversation .
Suddenly I jolt with the realisation that I have forgotten we are holding hands .
" That 's the Holy Grail , " says Dave , " being so comfortable you do n't even think about it . "
We head into the West End and provoke nothing more than a cursory glance .
Our final destination is Trafalgar Square .
Last month , Ian Baynham , 62 , was kicked to death here .
There 's a din coming from somewhere – a man is on the first ridge of Nelson 's column preaching the message of the ' Good Book ' .
" Let 's climb up next to him ! " I cry .
The sight of a preacher on Nelson 's column with two gay men holding hands next to him is starting to draw crowds .
A lesbian couple spot us , scramble up and join our silent show of defiance .
" The Lord will save you , " says the preacher .
He did n't save Ian Baynham , I think .
" I 'm genuinely surprised , " I tell Dave afterwards as we say our goodbyes .
" I was expecting at least some nasty comments . "
" You see ? " he replies , beaming .
But I know that today I was lucky ; that at night things could have been different .
CINCINNATI 
Two days after the execution of a convicted rapist - murderer was halted when technicians were unable to inject him with lethal drugs , a federal judge ordered Thursday that the inmate be deposed for a federal lawsuit challenging the constitutionality of Ohio ’s lethal injection procedure .
The deposition for the inmate , Romell Broom , is set for Monday , a day before he is scheduled to be executed .
His lawyers said they planned to file appeals in state and federal courts on Friday seeking to cancel or at least postpone his execution .
One of his lawyers , Adele Shank , said the appeals would present three arguments that executing Mr. Broom on Tuesday would constitute cruel and unusual punishment .
They will contend that seven days is not enough time to recover from the physical and emotional trauma of the failed execution attempt , that Ohio ’s lethal injection system in its current form is critically flawed and that lethal injection , in general , is cruel and unusual punishment .
The execution of Mr. Broom , 53 , was postponed Tuesday after technicians tried and failed for more than two hours to maintain an IV connection in order to inject him with lethal drugs .
EMERGING : FEW BIKE PATHS , BIG POSSIBILITIES

“ The riverfront is gradually becoming cool , but the bike infrastructure is n’t quite there .

A fisherman casts his net at the the Okapi reserve at Epulu in the Ituri forest near the borders with Sudan and Uganda .
In addition to the okapis , the wildlife reserve is also home to many other interesting or endangered animals , such as the forest elephant , and at least 13 species of anthropoid primates .
Nomadic Mbuti pygmies and indigenous Bantu farmers also live within the reserve
This shader officially starts Geeks3D ’s shader library .
The Shader Library is the place for all shaders I use in GeeXLab demos .
Most of these shaders can be easily used in other softwares like Blender Game Engine for example .
This night vision shader is based on this algorithm with some modifications .
I added a simple luminance analysis in order to amplify parts with low luminance .
You can download the demo to see the shader in real time :
[ download#95#image ]
Unzip the demo somewhere and run Night_Vision_Demo.exe .
That ’s all .
You need Python 2.6.3 ( 2.6.2 is also ok ) to run the demo .
If you do n’t have yet Python , get the Windows installer HERE .
This demo uses GeeXLab .
The source code of the night vision filter can be found in the PostFX_Night_Vision_Lib.xml file .
The main source code ( that is loaded first ) is Night_Vision_Demo.xml .

Before testing on ATI Radeon , the shader contained this line :
float lum = dot( vec4( 0.30 , 0.59 , 0.11 , 0.0 ) , c ) ;
where c is a vec3 .
NVIDIA GLSL compiler ( based on Cg ) accepts this instruction .
But Radeon GLSL compiler is strict and does n't accept this line because it can't compile :
float lum = dot ( vec4 , vec3 ) ;
Little conclusion : always test your shaders on ATI and NVIDIA boards ...

The Denver shuttle bus driver at the center of a federal terrorism investigation has begun to cooperate with the authorities , admitting that he had perhaps unwittingly crossed paths in Pakistan with extremists allied with Al Qaeda , according to government officials briefed on the case .
The officials did not indicate whether the admissions of the man , Najibullah Zazi , made during three days of intense questioning by F.B.I. agents in Denver , clarified whether he had directly engaged in terrorist activity .
And it is not known whether his account could mean he will be charged with any wrongdoing .
But Mr. Zazi ’s discussions with the authorities did seem to shed light on the suspicions that led federal and New York counterterrorism officials to begin intensive inquiries and to raid apartments in a suburb of Denver and in Queens , New York , believing he was the central figure in some kind of nascent , if still murky , terrorist activity .
Mr. Zazi ’s statements to government officials suggest a somewhat different narrative than the one he presented in interviews with reporters this week when he denied being affiliated with Al Qaeda and said he had no idea why the government would suspect him of wrongdoing .
Indeed , there are now some indications that Mr. Zazi underwent training in explosives and bomb - making while overseas .

The plane had clearance but did not declare its explosive cargo
A United Arab Emirates transport plane has been detained at an Indian airport after customs officials found arms , ammunition and explosives in its cargo .
The plane , bound for Hanyang in China , landed in Calcutta for refuelling .
An Indian defence ministry spokesman said nine crew members had been detained and were being asked why they failed to declare the plane 's cargo .
Indian authorities say they were intrigued that weapons were being flown to China , which normally exports arms .
" The plane had necessary clearance but it had nowhere mentioned that it was carrying a consignment of weapons , " said Wing Commander Mahesh Upasani , spokesman of the ministry of defence in Calcutta .
The Indian air force has since cancelled the clearance it granted the plane because it had failed to properly declare its cargo .
The plane is being kept in a special bay at the airport .
Officials at Calcutta airport are sensitive about such undeclared cargo after a Russian plane dropped a huge consignment of weapons over West Bengal 's Purulia district in December 1995 , then landed at Calcutta before flying on to Thailand .
On its way back through India , the plane was forced to land at Mumbai and its crew were arrested along with a British arms dealer .

What would your world be like if you could n't log on to Facebook or your favorite celebrity or news websites ?
As a college student in the U.S. , you may feel stressed about your heavy workload , competition getting into classes ( or getting into school at all ) , fighting for internships and graduating into a weak economy , but when it comes to freedom of speech and the ability to log on to TMZ during class , you 're pretty lucky .
Here are 25 shocking facts about Chinese censorship and how students in that country do n't have the freedom to surf the net the way you do .
Surveillance
Chinese Internet users are monitored by the government , especially in Internet cafes .
Learn more about surveillance here .
The Internet Police : The Internet Police reportedly employs 30,000 agents who investigate individuals who post information online that may be offensive to Chinese government and officials .
This kind of information may include rumors or state secrets , as well as material that brings down Chinese morale and its reputation , according to CNN .
All keystrokes are recorded : Even in Internet cafes , all chats , online games and e-mails are recorded by the government , making it impossible to fly under the radar or send any truly private messages .
The Internet Detective : The Chinese government uses a special kind of spy software called the Internet Detective that records sites you visit , e-mails , games , message board activity and identity card numbers .
The government says that it uses this spyware to make it easier to catch criminals who use Internet cafes .
Great Firewall vs. Golden Shield :
The official name for the online censorship idea is the Golden Shield Project , which began in 1998 .
Critics of the project refer it to the Great Firewall of China .
China has more web surfers than America : China 's population is of course larger than the population of the U.S. , but Americans once dominated the virtual world .
That means that the Internet Police patrol 253 million web surfers .
Jurisdiction and Punishment
If you 're caught violating the laws of Chinese censorship and appropriate online behavior , you may have to go to jail .
Find out how journalists , web surfers and even U.S. companies become entangled in the Chinese censorship movement .
Offending China online warrants jail time :
If you are caught and convicted of offending China and the government , you may be sent to jail .
Yahoo !
indirectly aided in the arrest of a Chinese journalist : In April 2007 , the World Organization for Human Rights sued Yahoo ! for " willingly " supplying the Chinese government with the personal information and e-mail addresses for a Chinese journalist and " cyber dissident . "
The government used that information to arrest both individuals , and Yahoo ! was widely criticized for their cooperation in the event , even by the U.S. Congress .
Even U.S. companies have to comply with China 's rules : U.S. Internet companies like Yahoo ! and Google make their services available all over the world , but in China , those services are restricted .
Just recently , the Chinese government restricted access to Google altogether " after a government representative accused [ Google ] of spreading pornography , " reports PC World .
Fines are issued as punishment :
If an individual is found guilty of publishing offensive content on the web , such as " defaming " the government , they could be forced to pay a fine of up to $ 1800 .

The Scorpion , being a very poor swimmer , asked the Frog to carry him on his back across the river .
" Well now , Mr. Scorpion !
How do I know that if I try to help you , you wo n’t try to kill me ? " asked the frog hesitantly .
" Because , " the scorpion replied , " If I try to kill you , then I would die too , for you see I cannot swim ! "
" Alright then ... how do I know you wo n't just wait till we get to the other side and THEN kill me ? " said the frog .
" Because you see , once you 've taken me to the other side of this river , I will be so grateful for your help , that it would hardly be fair to reward you with death , now would it " said the scorpion .
So the frog agreed to take the scorpion across the river .
The scorpion crawled onto the frog 's back , his sharp claws prickling into the frog 's soft hide , and the frog slid into the river .
The muddy water swirled around them , but the frog stayed near the surface so the scorpion would not drown .
He kicked strongly through the first half of the stream , his flippers paddling wildly against the current .
Halfway across the river , the frog suddenly felt a sharp sting in his back and , out of the corner of his eye , saw the scorpion remove his stinger from the frog 's back .
A deadening numbness began to creep into his limbs .
" You fool ! " croaked the frog , " Now we shall both die !
Why on earth did you do that ? "
The scorpion shrugged , " I could not help myself .
It is my nature . "
Then they both sank into the muddy waters of the swiftly flowing river .
Regardless of what they say , regardless of regulations and laws , this is how health insurance companies have to behave .
Because this is what they are , this is what they do .
What we call care , is inherently for them " medical loss ratio . "
At the end of the day , despite public option and exchanges , despite regulation and laws , if you keep the health insurance companies in equation , it is all about adverse selection .
But I thought we had a deal : Mandates to assure your profits , some regulation to provide fairness .
Insurers mount attack against health reform
After working for months behind the scenes to help shape health care reform , the insurance industry is now sharply attacking the emerging plan with a report that maintains Senate legislation would increase the cost of a typical policy by hundreds , or even thousands , of dollars a year .
Late Sunday , the industry trade group America 's Health Insurance Plans sent its member companies a new accounting firm study that projects the legislation would add $ 1,700 a year to the cost of family coverage in 2013 , when most of the major provisions in the bill would be in effect .
" It 's a health insurance company hatchet job , plain and simple , " said [ Baucus ] spokesman , Scott Mulhauser .
White House health care spokeswoman Linda Douglass concurred .
" This is an insurance industry analysis that is designed to reach a conclusion which benefits the industry , and does not represent what the bill does , " she said .
The Baucus plan faces a final committee vote on Tuesday .
It got a boost last week when the Congressional Budget Office estimated it would cover 94 percent of eligible Americans while reducing the federal deficit .
But the [ AHIP ] analysis attempted to get at a different issue — costs for privately insured individuals .
It concluded that a combination of factors in the bill — and decisions by lawmakers as they amended it — would raise costs .
The chief reason , said the report , is a decision by lawmakers to weaken proposed penalties for failing to get health insurance .
The bill would require insurers to take all applicants , doing away with denials for pre-existing health problems .
In return , all Americans would be required to carry coverage , either through an employer or a government program , or by buying it themselves .
But the CBO estimated that even with new federal subsidies , some 17 million Americans would still be unable to afford health insurance .
Faced with that affordability problem , senators opted to ease the fines for going without coverage from the levels Baucus originally proposed .
The industry says that will only let people postpone getting coverage until they get sick .
Other factors leading to higher costs include a new tax on high - cost health insurance plans , cuts in Medicare payments to hospitals and doctors , and a series of new taxes on insurers and other health care industries , the report said .
" Health reform could have a significant impact on the cost of private health insurance coverage , " it concluded .
Insurers played a major role in defeating then - President Bill Clinton 's health care plan in the 1990s .
Sunday , the industry stopped short of signaling all - out opposition .
" We will continue to work with policymakers in support of workable bipartisan reform , " Ignagni said in her memo .
Actually AHIP is right about one thing .
Costs will go up for sure if there is not a strong public option AND that is actually open to everybody through strong exchange AND that this goes into effect right away .
And so far we are not seeing a majority of Dems supporting anything like that .
Cost will go up and we wo n't actually have anything close to 100 % access until we shift to BOTH nationwide everybody - in nobody - out public insurance pool ( aka : single payer ) combined with a move to medical care being provided by a national network of community - based , private , not - for - profit , multispecialty , doctor - managed group practice model ( e.g. , Mayo Clinic , Cleveland Clinic , Permanente , Geisinger Health System , Marshfield Clinic , Scott and White Clinic , Billings Clinic , Denver Health , Group Health of Puget Sound , etc. ) .
But that is the reform we are not allowed to have .
This year .
2 . But new regulation will prevent adverse selection , right ?
Discrimination by Insurers Likely Even With Reform , Experts Say Economic Pressure Could Give Rise to New Biases Against Prior Conditions
Any health - care overhaul that Congress and President Obama enact is likely to have as its centerpiece a fundamental reform :
Insurers would not be allowed to reject individuals or charge them higher premiums based on their medical history .
But simply banning medical discrimination would not necessarily remove it from the equation , economists and health - care analysts say .
If insurers are prohibited from openly rejecting people with preexisting conditions , they could try to cherry - pick through more subtle means .
For example , offering free health club memberships tends to attract people who can use the equipment .
Being uncooperative on insurance claims can chase away the chronically ill .
And to avoid patients with costly , complicated medical conditions , health plans could include in their networks relatively few doctors who specialize in treating those conditions .
By itself , a ban on discrimination would not eliminate the economic pressure to discriminate .
" It would probably increase the incentive for cherry - picking , " Pauly said .
" I 'm strongly motivated to try to avoid you if I 'm not allowed to charge you extra . "
Unless lawmakers tackle the problem effectively , a reformed health - care system could continue to reward insurers for avoiding rather than treating illness .
It also could perpetuate existing economic penalties for health plans that do a better job of covering the sickest patients .
They tend to attract costlier members , which can force them to raise premiums , fueling a cycle that can make it harder for the severely ill to get affordable coverage .
" In a competitive market , a good - guy insurer is a patsy , " Pollitz said .
" The race is to the bottom . "
At a more nuts - and - bolts level , AHIP has been trying to shape the legislation in ways that could help insurers attract the healthy and avoid the sick , though it has given other reasons for advancing those positions .
In a recent letter to Baucus , AHIP President Karen Ignagni said benefit packages " should give consumers flexible options to meet diverse needs . "
There are myriad ways health plans can attract healthier members , from the messages they advertise to the overall level of coverage they provide and the smallest enticements they add to their benefits packages .
Ads for private health plans serving senior citizens on Medicare seldom feature people who are sick , said Tricia Neuman , who has studied the ads for the Kaiser Family Foundation .
Many of the plans have offered benefits such as health club memberships , help buying eyeglasses , and preventive dental care , which may be more likely to sway healthy seniors than seniors who have severe and complex medical needs .
Some private Medicare plans have offered relatively inexpensive enticements while requiring members to pay more out of pocket than they would under conventional Medicare for major expenses , said the Medicare Rights Center 's Precht .
In 2008 , a quarter of the private Medicare plans charged members more out of pocket for Part B medications , which include chemotherapy drugs for cancer patients , according to a March study for the AARP Public Policy Institute .
3 . But the " exchange " will solve all problem , right ?
Not if it is designed to fail
... more important than ever to make sure that we get another part of health reform right : the exchanges , where it is envisioned that small businesses and people without employer - sponsored insurance could shop for policies of their own .
Back in the 1990s , I was the founding chairman of Texas ’ state - run purchasing alliance — an exchange , essentially — which ultimately failed .
There are lessons to be learned from that experience , as well as the similar failures of other states to create useful exchanges .
The Texas Insurance Purchasing Alliance , created by the Texas Legislature in 1993 , was meant to help small businesses , which often cannot afford coverage for their employees .
Initially , the alliance worked exactly as planned .
Sixty - three percent of the businesses that participated were able to offer their employees health coverage for the first time .
The alliance offered small businesses a low - cost , nonprofit option : our administrative arrangements did away with the high marketing costs that insurers pass on to small businesses .
And we did n’t charge higher rates to firms with older or less healthy workers .
This in turn led other insurers , outside the alliance , to lower their prices .
We did all this not by creating a government bureaucracy , but by relying on the private sector .
Nevertheless , six years after the program got off the ground , it folded .
Many factors contributed to our failure .
Some elements of the program , like the restriction it put on the size of eligible companies ( only employers with 50 or fewer employees could join ) , proved unpopular .
Most important , though , our exchange failed not because it was n’t needed , and not because the concept was n’t sound , but because it never attained a large enough market share to exert significant clout in the Texas insurance market .
Private insurance companies , which could offer small - business policies both inside and outside the exchange , cherry - picked relentlessly , signing up all the small businesses with generally healthy employees and offloading the bad risks — companies with older or sicker employees — onto the exchange .
For the insurance companies , this made business sense .
But as a result , our exchange was overwhelmed with people who had high health care costs , and too few healthy people to share the risk .
The premiums we offered rose significantly .
Insurance on the exchange was no longer a bargain , and employers began backing away .
Insurance companies , too , began leaving the alliance .
Texas was n’t the only state to see its insurance exchange fail .
Florida and North Carolina were also unsuccessful .
And California , which had the first exchange ( established in 1992 ) and the largest market , shut its doors in 2006 .
All these state exchanges failed for the same reason : cherry - picking by insurers outside the exchange .
If Congress now creates new exchanges , as seems increasingly likely , it must prevent this phenomenon by setting two national rules :
Insurers have to accept everyone and have to charge everyone the same rates regardless of health status .
Such rules would force insurers to spread risk .
But enforcement would also be difficult .
Every aspect of health insurance — from the rules for underwriting and setting premiums to the marketing of policies — would need to be monitored stringently to prevent companies from steering all bad risks to the exchanges .
It is all about adverse selection .
Among the stupidest comments made by the MSM / SCLM was an NPR reporter dismissing worries about adverse selection as being nonsense since of course part of the reform package was regulation that would prevent that .
Back in the real world we know from " Medicare Advantage " nationally , and from attempts at state - based regulation , that this remains what insurance companies do .
It is what they are .
4. The Non-Existing Condition
Valerie Scaglione 's story is almost comical : Monthly premiums for Blue Cross coverage for them and their three daughters have soared over the years to almost $ 2,000 , Scaglione says .
She estimates that in the past six years , the family has spent more than $ 140,000 on premiums and co-payments .
Yet when she tried to switch from the family 's expensive individual insurance to a Blue Shield group plan that 's more affordable , she said , she and her oldest daughter were denied coverage .
She said neither of them has the medical conditions that were listed as reasons for being denied - bronchitis and a skin ailment .
Consumer advocates consider their story emblematic in many ways of complaints that plague the entire health insurance industry .
" We 've seen people denied for things as minor as heartburn , " said Anthony Wright , executive director of Health Access California , a statewide health advocacy coalition .
" It gets to the point where living is a pre-existing condition . "
Mrs. Scaglione 's health insurance coverage costs three times as much as the family 's MORTGAGE .
And she can't get out of it and into a group plan , because Blue Shield flat - out invented reasons to deny the coverage .
She has demanded to see the medical records that show her daughter having bronchitis and her having a skin condition called rosacea , but the health insurer refused the request .
As the debate continues , the Scagliones remain among California 's 3 million consumers in the pricey individual insurance market .
" I wonder how many other families are like ours , " Scaglione said .
" What 's the option , to be uninsured ?
This forces me to stay with our same plan .
Premiums will go up and up and up .
What , do we not feed the kids ?
It gets to the point of being absurd . "
Blue Shield of California can be reached at ( 866 ) 256-7703 .
You might want to ask them what health care ailments they think you have of which you 're unaware .
5 . You baby is too fat to get insurance Sigh ... just today 's latest headline case of , if you might get sick or might be sick , then of course you can't get insurance coverage .
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Needless to say , the health insurance companies are the scorpion .
All the rest of us -- individuals , families , small business , large business , local , state and national government , the economy , and current reform that bails - out the health insurance companies with mandates -- we are all the frog .
I fear that the public option and exchange that we are going to get are not enough to avoid the fatal sting of ever rising costs and continued lack of actual coverage and access that will drown us all .
That is why , even while fighting for the strongest and most open version of public option and exchange possible in 2009 , we must remember that whatever we get , this is only the first battle .
In order to achieve universal access and cost control , we need to remember that the this is a long - term fight .
Single payer national health insurance , along with other changes in the health professions training pipeline to increase primary care and limit some specialization , and the actual payment system to incentivize and preferentially promote the multispecialty integrated care model , remains not a pipe - dream but in fact the only realistic goal .

Vermont este un stat al Statelor Unite ale Americii localizat în zona nord - estică a SUA , tradițional cunoscută sub numele de New England .

Google 's decision not to buy Skype from eBay suggests that it is -- for now , at least -- more committed to maintaining its relationships with mobile carriers than it is to disrupting them .
This has important implications for Google Voice , Google 's would - be Skype - killer .
Namely , it suggests that Google will be content for Google Voice to remain a call - forwarding service that chews up cellphone minutes ( and boosts or maintains your cellphone bill ) rather than a VoIP service that circumvents your wireless carrier .
Google negotiated with eBay to buy Skype last month , but walked away from the deal , the New York Times reported yesterday .
Why ?
In part , because Google worried that owning Skype " might alienate wireless carriers , " which Google is trying to get to sell phones based on its Android operating system , the Times ' Brad Stone and Claire Cain Miller wrote .
So what does that say about Google Voice ?
Perhaps that Google is still hesitant to make it more disruptive to carriers -- and therefore is still hesitant to make it more valuable to consumers .
For instance , it seems unlikely that Google will open up Google Voice in the near future as a free - for - all Internet phone service that operates over mobile data networks , offering free , unlimited calling .
Instead , it seems Google Voice will continue for to be mostly a service designed to forward calls from one Google Voice number to all your existing phones -- including your cellphone .
The latter uses up your mobile calling minutes , so it wo n't threaten the current carrier business models .
Even Google 's dialer app for Android and BlackBerry phones uses your phone 's voice channel , instead of routing free calls over the Internet .
This means that calls still cost minutes , which cost money .
So while carriers are upset that Google Voice is designed to be your primary point of contact , and that it enables free SMS and voicemail features , they at least can't say that Google Voice is costing them any serious money yet .
And if Google actually cares about its relationships to sell Android phones , it looks like Google wo n't dare change that soon .
Buying Skype , meanwhile , would have immediately set Google into a different direction -- one that is more disruptive to carriers .
This could have easily have put Android lower on their list of priorities -- or , worse for Google , persuaded carriers not to use it at all .
Skype has been all about disrupting carriers from the beginning , offering free Internet calls and long distance calls that are much cheaper than telcos offer .
Skype 's mobile software , for example , encourages people to use their mobile data plans to skirt their voice minutes , which still represent the majority of carriers ' revenue .
( Unlike Google Voice . )
And , for obvious reasons , carriers are still very defensive about this .
AT&T , for instance , has required Apple to prevent iPhone apps from running VoIP calls over its cellular network .
As a result , Skype 's iPhone app only works over wi-fi -- a substantial limitation .
Earlier this year , MocoNews reported that U.K. carriers were " furious " with Nokia 's plans to ship phones with pre-installed copies of Skype .
So it 's still a stigma .
Longer - term , of course , things could change .
If Android becomes a huge hit that carriers have to carry it no matter what , Google will have more leverage and may shift its priorities , pushing the gas on Google Voice .
If it flops , same story .
And perhaps the plan is to wait a little longer and then kill Skype by itself , more cheaply than buying it .
But for now , it seems that Google 's priority is keeping carriers close , rather than pushing them away .
I ’m very excited to announce to everyone that the latest and greatest version of WordPress , version 2.8 “ Baker , ” is immediately available for download .
2.8 represents a nice fit and finish release for WordPress with improvements to themes , widgets , taxonomies , and overall speed .
We also fixed over 790 bugs .
This release is named in honor of noted trumpeter and vocalist Chet Baker .
Here ’s a quick video overview of everything in the new release :
The first thing you ’ll notice is that visually 2.8 feels a lot like 2.7 , just with some minor tweaks here and there .
However once you ’ll dig in you ’ll begin to appreciate the changes .
Major New Improvements
First and foremost , 2.8 is way faster to use .
We ’ve changed the way WordPress does style and scripting .
The core and plugin updaters in previous versions of WordPress have been such a success we decided to bring the same to themes .
You can now browse the entire theme directory and install a theme with one click from the comfort of your WordPress dashboard .
If you make edits or tweaks to themes or plugins from your dashboard , you ’ll appreciate the new CodePress editor which gives syntax highlighting to the previously - plain editor .
Also there is now contextual documentation for the functions in the file you ’re editing linked right below the editor .
If you were ever frustrated with widgets before , this release should be your savior .
We ’ve completely redesigned the widgets interface ( which we did n’t have time to in 2.7 ) to allow you to do things like edit widgets on the fly , have multiple copies of the same widget , drag and drop widgets between sidebars , and save inactive widgets so you do n’t lose all their settings .
Developers now have access to a much cleaner and robust API for creating widgets as well .
Finally you should explore the new Screen Options on every page .
It ’s the tab in the top right .
Now , for example , if you have a wide monitor you could set up your dashboard to have four columns of widgets instead of the two it has by default .
On other pages you can change how many items show per page .
And Even More
You can read the full list of over 180 new features , changes , upgrades , and improvements on the Codex .
The list is exhausting !
The Future
We ’re already thinking hard about the next versions , 2.9 and 3.0 .

The just - announced Nikon Coolpix S1000 pj digicam / pico projector has been blowin ' up the Interwebs this morning , and we have the video to prove it .
First of all , there is a hands - on provided by What Digital Camera over in the UK , and aside from the projector they 've uncovered a pretty straight forward digital shooter : 12 megapixel , 5 x optical zoom , pretty standard dimensions , and a 2.7 - inch LCD .
However , the projector itself seems to do the job quite admirably .
Sure , it 's not an extensive demo , but the image looks clear and crisp .
The reviewer deems it " a very , very clever party trick . "
And if the straight ahead tech demo does n't get you in the mood to snap pictures and project them onto something , advertisers have offered us two visions of the future : take your pick from a spirited get together choc full o' photogenic American actors , or a somewhat subdued , more elegant affair in the presence of photogenic French actors .
All that fun ( and more ) is to be had after the break .
Football fans are being recruited to join protests against Muslims .
How worried should the authorities be ?
The rise of the English Defence League , whose protests against Islamism have sparked violent city centre clashes , has been chaotic but rapid .
Three months ago , no one had heard of the EDL .
But the organisation has risen to prominence in a spate of civil unrest in which far - right activists , football hooligans and known racists have fought running battles with Asian youths .
The leadership insists they are not racist and just want to " peacefully protest against militant Islam " .
Yet at EDL events , skinheads have raised Nazi salutes and other EDL supporters have chanted racist slogans such as " I hate Pakis more than you " .
One protest in Luton in May ended with scores of people attacking Asian businesses , smashing cars and threatening passersby .
Insiders have talked of plans to enlist football fans to march for the cause on the basis that " you need an army for a war " .
With the organisation 's confidence growing and plans for rallies in Leeds , Manchester and tomorrow in Trafalgar Square , concerned police chiefs and government ministers are asking what the English Defence League is , and what it wants .
It appears to have a hardcore of fewer than 200 in " divisions " in Bristol , Birmingham , Leeds and Luton .
But those ranks are swelled by rightwing groups including gangs related to football clubs .
Last night close to 500 had said they were considering attending the protest in London .
Its roots are modest , according to its self - proclaimed leader , a 28 - year - old carpenter from Luton who goes by the pseudonym Tommy Robinson .
He said the germ of the EDL was evident growing up in the Bedfordshire town .
" Everyone mixes until the age of 13 or 14 and then it stops and there are Asian dinner tables at school , " he said .
" I do n't know what it is .
Maybe their parents do n't want them to mix . "
Those separate tables are magnified in Luton today where a large part of the Muslim population lives in a network of streets around the main mosque in Bury Park .
The town has had an unhappy connection with Islamist terrorism ever since four suicide bombers set off from there to attack London 's transport system and kill 52 people on 7 July 2005 .
Before that , there were tensions when a radical Muslim group protested in the town centre after the invasion of Afghanistan in 2001 .
Those feelings reached boiling point this March , when a small group of Muslim antiwar protesters held up placards at the homecoming of the 2nd Battalion Royal Anglian Regiment which read " Butchers of Basra " and " Anglian soldiers go to hell " .
" The group that protested against the soldiers had been in the town centre since 2001 , " said Robinson .
" In 2004 we held our own protest when we held a banner up saying ' Ban the Luton Taliban ' .
" We were groups of friends and family , people who had gone to school with each other .
We decided they could not be in the town centre again . "
Only a handful of Muslim protesters disrupted the Anglians ' homecoming parade , and they were drawn from an small extremist group that had already been ostracised by the mainstream Muslim community .
However , it was enough for Robinson and others to set up a group called United People of Luton , and look across the country for support .
" We realised we did n't just want them off the streets of Luton , we wanted them off the streets of Britain , " said Robinson .
Using Facebook , they forged links with a Birmingham - based group called British Citizens Against Muslim Extremists and quickly realised there was potential for a national organisation .
" When we saw Birmingham 's demonstration they were using the same slogans as us : ' We want our country back ' , ' Terrorists off the streets ' , ' Extremists out ' , ' Rule Britannia ' .
From there the EDL was set up . "
Chief superintendent Mark Turner , of Bedfordshire police , said the group 's aims were " really quite ill - defined " .
That stems from the different interests that have rallied to a cause , which itself was named after the Welsh Defence League , set up by Jeff Marsh , a former football hooligan and convicted criminal .
The movement has been so fragmented that Robinson set up a website to drum up interest in March , while Chris Renton , listed as an " activist " on the BNP 's leaked membership list , set up another EDL site .
Paul Ray , another far - right activist from Dunstable , near Luton , broadcast video polemics on YouTube .
Ray 's broadcasts on his Spirit of St George internet channel include his claim that a " very , very high proportion of the Muslim population is an Islamic extremist " and his description of Luton 's Muslim community as " an al - Qaida enclave " .
According to Robinson , none of these activities were co-ordinated .
By Ray 's own account published on his Lionheart blog on the eve of the 8 August clashes in Birmingham : " The English Defence League that was originally built over many months and eventually set up by myself and others , was hijacked over the last couple of weeks leading up to tomorrow by a bunch of ' pirates ' led by Chris Renton . "
Around the same time , Trevor Kelway , a Portsmouth - based EDL supporter , became a spokesman for the organisation .
In statements and phone interviews , Kelway pushed the line that the EDL was a peaceful , non-racist organisation , even promising that the last Birmingham protest would be " a great day out for all concerned " .
When the day arrived EDL supporters were involved in running battles and police made 90 arrests .
Sharon Rowe , assistant chief constable of West Midlands , said the force had tried " everything they could " to liaise with the EDL before the demonstration but had been largely ignored .
" If the EDL come back to this city I 've got more of an evidence case and intelligence to therefore arrest them a lot earlier , to prevent a breach of the peace . "
Fringe groups are rife in the world of the EDL , many of them have been established for far longer , and their beliefs often appear contradictory .
Davy Cooling , 26 , a driver from Luton who helps run the EDL , admits to attending BNP events when he was younger , although he said he is not a member of the party .
" A few years ago I attended two or three meetings of the BNP in Luton , but I do not agree with their policy of banning black and other ethnic minoirity groups from membership .
It does n't matter what religion or race you are .
Everyone is welcome to the EDL . "
What does unite the group is a willingness to fight , said Robinson .
" We feel that only people with that mentality will go [ to demonstrate ] , " he said .
" That 's why it 's all lads .
Your upper class people wo n't stand there and get attacked , through fear .
" I am from the mentality that I am not going to back down .
It started with what they did to the soldiers , but after that it has been about the two - sided treatment our community get compared to what the Muslim community get from the police and the council .
The police hit us with batons and come at them with kid gloves . "
This is not a version of events recognised by Bedfordshire police 's Mark Turner : " We 've had a series of marches where we have seen damage to property , we have seen people being assaulted , we have seen the odd racist attack – and that quite simply can't be tolerated . "
Robinson said the group has recruited football supporters from clubs including Chelsea , QPR , Wolverhampton Wanderers , Aston Villa , Swansea and Cardiff .
But its lack of coherence has attracted the interest of those keen to harness the EDL 's growing support .
They include Alan Lake , a London - based far - right activist who has advised Swedish nationalists on " countering jihad " and is advising the EDL in an attempt to broaden support with football fans and marshal events more carefully .
" We are catching a baby at the start of gestation , " said Lake , who is considering funding the EDL .
" We have a problem with numbers .
We have an army of bloggers [ in the far - right ] but that 's not going to get things done .
" Football fans are a potential source of support .
They are a hoi polloi that gets off their backsides and travels to a city and they are available before and after matches . "
Observers from anti-fascist groups draw parallels between the EDL anger at Islamists and an earlier generation of football hooligans who supported loyalist paramilitary groups .
" In the 1980s and 1990s these hooligan groups perceived the threat to English masculinity was coming from the IRA 's mainland bombing campaign , " said Nick Lowles from Searchlight .
" They associated themselves with the loyalist movement and the chant ' no surrender to the IRA ' was popular at football grounds around the country .
Now many see what they term ' Islamist extremism ' as the biggest threat . "
Lowles said that while many of the hooligans involved were nationalists and racists , only a handful would associate themselves with fascist , far - right policies .
" While it is not a fascist organisation , there are a handful of organised fascists in key positions
We are concerned that as the EDL grows it will attract more extremists and fascists . "
Lowles warned that the threat posed by the EDL should not be underestimated .
" We saw the effects of hooligan incursions into Oldham and Bradford in 2001 and we must ensure that small groups of racists cannot whip up and incite this sort of trouble again .
" The authorities have a responsibility to local communities to protect them from violence .
We have witnessed enough of the EDL to know that they want to whip up trouble wherever possible .
They must nip this problem in the bud . "

A guest post from Daniel Luban :
I have no desire to bore the reader with endless discussion of the Amalek controversy , so I will just weigh in with one final comment on the controversy and Jeffrey Goldbergâ€™s response to it .
First , Andrew Sullivanâ€™s post on the controversy is worth reading , and reiterates the same basic point that both Zakaria and I made : how would Goldberg read the Amalek statement if it had come from Ahmadinejad ?
An annoyed Goldberg responds that Netanyahu himself never used the Amalek analogy ; rather , it was an anonymous Netanyahu advisor who mentioned it to Goldberg .
This response is unconvincing .
While it is true that Netanyahuâ€™s advisor was the one who uttered the now - notorious words â€ œthink Amalek , â€ the advisor made this statement in response to Goldbergâ€™s request to â€œgauge for me the depth of Mr. Netanyahuâ€™s anxiety about Iran.â€ 
That is to say , the advisor was not stating his own opinions about the Iranian threat ; rather , he was indicating that Netanyahu himself sees Iran as the new Amalek .
It is , of course , perfectly possible that the advisor mischaracterized his bossâ€™s views , but Goldberg gave no indication in his original op - ed that he sees it this way .
Rather , he deliberately sought to play up the Amalek analogy and made it the centerpiece of his intellectual profile of Netanyahu .
( Note his title : â€ œIsraelâ€™s Fears , Amalekâ€™s Arsenalâ€ . )
Goldberg has clearly become frustrated that the Amalek debate has slipped out of his control and ultimately backfired .
His op - ed deployed the Amalek reference to convince American audiences that , far from being a shallow opportunist or unthinking warmonger , Netanyahu is in fact a serious statesman whose belligerence toward Iran is deeply rooted in Jewish history , the Bible , the Inquisition , the Holocaust , and so on .
Readers are meant to come away with the impression ( although it is never quite stated explicitly ) that they should put aside their skepticism of the new Israeli government and trust its hawkish inclinations on the Iranian issue .
As it turns out , his op - ed seems to have had the opposite effect .
Rather than reassuring American Jews about Netanyahuâ€™s seriousness of purpose , all the talk of Amalek has simply reinforced their impression that Netanyahu is a dangerous zealot who should not be dictating U.S. policy towards Iran .
It is only now that Goldberg steps in to do damage control â€ ” claiming at first that there is nothing at all troubling about the Amalek analogy , next that there may be troubling aspects of the analogy but that these were completely unintended by those who used it , before finally falling back on the position that Netanyahu never espoused the analogy at all .
He covers this retreat with familiar claims of expert knowledge , maintaining that anyone who draws attention to the commonsensical implications of the analogy is simply â€œmisreadingâ€  or â€œmisunderstandingâ€  it , no doubt due to their lack of nuanced understanding of the rabbinic Jewish tradition .
( Strangely , he does not demand that Western pundits refrain from commenting on the pronouncements of Iranâ€™s ayatollahs unless they have a thorough grounding in Islamic law and a few years of seminary at Qom under their belts . )
In any case , the basic message throughout seems to be â€œdefer to Netanyahuâ€ .
If the Amalek analogy increases our confidence in the prime minister , then we should focus on it ; if it decreases our confidence , we should ignore it and pretend that it was never brought up .
Amid a rebirth of conservative activism that could help Republicans win elections next year , some party insiders now fear that extreme rhetoric and conspiracy theories coming from the angry reaches of the conservative base are undermining the GOP ’s broader credibility and casting it as the party of the paranoid .
Such insiders point to theories running rampant on the Internet , such as the idea that Barack Obama was born in Kenya and is thus ineligible to be president , or that he is a communist , or that his allies want to set up Nazi - like detention camps for political opponents .
Those theories , the insiders say , have stoked the GOP base and have created a “ purist ” climate in which a figure such as Rep. Joe Wilson ( R - S.C. ) is lionized for his “ You lie ! ” outburst last week when Obama addressed Congress .
They are “ wild accusations and the paranoid delusions coming from the fever swamps , ” said David Frum , a conservative author and speechwriter for President George W. Bush who is among the more vocal critics of the party base and of the conservative talk show hosts helping to fan the unrest .
“ Like all conservatives , I am concerned about this administration ’s accumulation of economic power , ” Frum said .
“ Still , you have to be aware that there ’s a line where legitimate concerns begin to collapse into paranoid fantasy . ”

Frum and other establishment Republicans have spoken out in recent days against the influence of what they view as their party ’s fringe elements .
Some are pressuring the Republican National Committee and other mainstream GOP groups to cut ties with WorldNetDaily.com , which reports some of the allegations .
Its articles are cited by websites and pundits on the right .
More than any other group , critics say , WorldNetDaily sets the conservative fringe agenda .
Critics charge that the RNC has paid WorldNetDaily for access to its mailing list , estimated to number in the hundreds of thousands , and that the RNC is therefore subsidizing the website ’s anti-Obama writings .
RNC spokeswoman Gail Gitcho did not respond to questions on the matter .

The site was started in the 1990s by longtime conservative journalist Joseph Farah , who also co-founded the Western Center for Journalism .
( The center was one of the outlets that reported what they claimed was evidence that the death of Vincent Foster -- White House deputy counsel -- was not really a suicide . )
Other prominent conservative outlets that have disseminated conspiracy theories include Newsmax.com and Human Events , a periodical .
Insiders ’ criticisms have been dismissed by some conservative leaders , who argue that the party needs an energized base -- even if it ’s extreme -- to gain in future elections .
Some analysts think that conservatives ’ summer revolt against Obama ’s healthcare agenda helped erode public approval of Democratic leadership enough that the GOP could pick up as many as 30 House seats next year .
Leaders in both the establishment and the base think that the tension could define the upcoming battle over the party ’s 2012 presidential nominee .

“ There ’s a war going on , a pretty big one , ” said Dan Riehl , a Virginia conservative whose popular blog , Riehl World View , has criticized those challenging the base .
“ Many of us distrust the elite Republican establishment . ”
Michael Goldfarb , a spokesman for John McCain ’s GOP presidential candidacy last year , likened the conservative fringe to liberal activists during the Bush years .
The antiwar group Code Pink drew headlines , for example , when a protester with fake blood on her hands accosted then - Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice -- but Democrats still won elections later .
“ Do we look crackpot ?
Yes , ” Goldfarb said .
“ But that ’s how the left looked to me in 2004 , and in 2006 they took back Congress .
Then they started marginalizing the lunatics . ”
In one symbolic development , organizers of next year ’s Conservative Political Action Conference -- the country ’s biggest annual meeting of activists on the right -- said last week that they had rejected a request to schedule a panel on whether Obama was a native - born U.S. citizen .
Advertisement
“ It would fill a room , ” said event director Lisa De Pasquale .
“ But so would a two - headed monkey .
There really are so many more important issues , and it ’s only a three - day conference . ”
CPAC officials said WorldNetDaily ’s Farah asked the group to hold the panel .
The CPAC decision came after Washington GOP strategist Jon Henke began a campaign against WorldNetDaily , which has published numerous articles giving credence to the birthplace issue and other allegations against the Obama administration .
WorldNetDaily is also soliciting signatures and e-mail addresses for a petition calling on “ any and all controlling legal authorities in this matter ” to examine Obama ’s birth certificate .
Advertisement
One WorldNetDaily article , which Henke called “ hideously embarrassing ” to conservatives , said that a Democratic proposal to create civilian emergency centers at military installations “ appears designed to create the type of detention center that those concerned about use of the military in domestic affairs fear could be used as concentration camps for political dissidents , such as occurred in Nazi Germany . ”
Henke said , “ There is a substantial discomfort among the people who want to make intellectual arguments and want to have a substantive role in the debate . ”
He compared the Obama birth theorists to those who said Obama ’s healthcare overhaul would create “ death panels . ”
“ ‘ Death panels ’ is not a substantive contribution to the discussion .
It ’s a cartoon , ” he said .
Farah mocked Henke and other critics in a column this month , saying they were doing liberals ’ bidding .
Advertisement
“ Am I scared ?
No , folks .
I ’m not , ” Farah wrote .
“ I did n’t found WorldNetDaily to be esteemed by my colleagues .
. . .
I did n’t found it because I wanted to be part of the ‘ conservative ’ movement .
I founded it because there was a crying need for an independent brand of journalism beholden only to the truth . ”
WorldNetDaily takes credit for being the first to raise questions about Van Jones , Obama ’s “ green jobs ” advisor who resigned after Fox News talk show host Glenn Beck and others hammered him for his self - described communist beliefs and support for the idea that the U.S. government had a role in the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks .
Republican critics of the conservative fringe point with concern to a largely party - line vote in which many GOP senators opposed Obama regulatory nominee Cass Sunstein -- even though Sunstein ’s views on regulatory issues are considered favorable to industry .
In recent weeks , commentators such as Beck have portrayed Sunstein , a Harvard law professor , as a radical , citing , for example , his past speeches and articles advocating animal rights as evidence that he opposed gun rights .
More mainstream groups such as the National Rifle Assn. and the American Conservative Union joined the opposition against Sunstein .
Advertisement
Citing the base ’s demand for ideological purity , Frum said : “ I believe Republican senators cast votes [ on Sunstein ] that they really did n’t want to cast . ”
One leading conservative Republican senator , Jim DeMint of South Carolina , said in an interview over the weekend that he decided to oppose Sunstein after hundreds of calls from constituents demanding a “ no ” vote due to Sunstein ’s “ extreme views . ”
Asked to say which of Sunstein ’s views he considered extreme , DeMint could not answer .
A DeMint spokesman later said , echoing the arguments of Beck and others , that his boss objected to the fact that Sunstein had once called for a ban on hunting and to his past statements on the legal rights of animals .

The Stag ’s Head , located in what was formerly known as CB Six , will be hosting the River Horse Brewing Company this Wednesday evening ( 8/12 ) .
It will not only be a great opportunity to wet your palate with free tastings of River Horse ’s Hop Hazard , Double Wit , and ESB selections , but you will also have a chance to speak wit the man who brewed them .
River Horse ’s Brew Master is scheduled to be on hand from 6:00 PM to 8:00 PM .
From what I can tell the Stag ’s Head tries to run similar tastings every Wednesday evening , but I am told it is quite rare that one of the brewers is actually in attendance .
On July 22nd the pub featured the Ommegang Brewery ; I wish I knew about that one earlier !
If you are free and in the area , then I recommend you head over and support the event .
It would be great to see more events like this one in the Big Apple .
This Punk will be there , and hopes to see you there as well .

Johnny Long 's presentation at DefCon 17 discusses his career as a professional hacker , life at the top , and the recent decision to abandon it all and start HackersForCharity .
He shows us small videos of the work and difference Hackers for Charity is making in Uganda .
In the end , he also shares a couple of hacks he 's been using in Uganda to make life more fun :)
Overall , it 's a very interesting talk and shows us all a very different approach to life - stop thinking about just ourselves and instead try to live for a higher purpose , where we can make a difference in this world .
I totally agree with Johnny that we need to find something in life which gives us satisfaction and makes us feel complete as humans .
I would request everyone to support Hackers for Charity by visiting their site and signing up .

I think that Einstein 's Special Relativity should correct an invariability of a light velocity , because if the measurement of space and time change from km and s to km ' and s' , then light velocity will also change from c - 300,000 km /s to c'=300,000 km ' /s ' .

Is there data that indicates that the time delay is proportional to distance in a simple relationship ?
Is the time delay different when looking in different directions but the same approximate distance away ?
Teasing out these variables might be helpful .

In his youth , there were two things that regularly competed for Giovanni Amelino - Camelia ’s attention : his favorite soccer team , Napoli , and " anything that came close to being scientific . "
And since Napoli was struggling in the Italian soccer league in the summer of 1978 , Amelino - Camelia found himself watching a series of programs on special relativity instead of soccer .
" That was really the point of no return for me , " he remembers .
" Although I was 13 - years old , nothing could have happened after that to keep me away from fundamental physics , " he says .
" It was lucky for me that those television shows were broadcast in a year when Napoli did very poorly !
" Lucky for him , and , in many ways , lucky for us , because almost 30 years later Amelino - Camelia , at La Sapienza University in Rome , Italy , is dedicated to pursuing answers to foundational questions .
Armed with a $ 65,000 grant from FQXi , he is currently making a run at redefining the way physicists attack perhaps the most vexing and elusive puzzle of all , the problem of quantum gravity .
Many lament that experimental tests of quantum gravity lie way beyond reach .
However , Amelino - Camelia believes that cosmic rays may already be revealing clues about the frothiness of the fabric of the universe , and he is using these hints to probe the quantum nature of spacetime — one step at a time .
Physicists have been struggling to find an overarching theory that unites quantum mechanics with gravity for decades .
Amelino - Camelia , by contrast , is taking a different approach .
He is n’t searching for a single , all - encompassing , such as promised by — which suggests that elementary particles are made of tiny , vibrating strings — or the more recent — which posits that at the smallest scales spacetime is a woven fabric of quantum threads .
Rather , he explains , he is searching for That does n’t mean that Amelino - Camelia thinks that searches for a theory of everything should be abandoned .
In fact , the majority of the simple models exploring portions of the quantum gravity problem that he works on were inspired by results obtained in the development of loop quantum gravity .
"
Even assuming my concerns are correct — and only time will tell — research looking for a full solution of the quantum gravity problem would be very valuable because it provides guidance for the development of meaningful theories ofeverything , " says Amelino - Camelia .
" But if all we did was research on the more ambitious theory - of - everything level , then inevitably we would be wasting some opportunities for valuable insight within the reach of theeverything approach .
" Okay , we now have a decent understanding of what Amelino - Camelia islooking for .
But what exactly is he looking for ?
The simplest example of a theory ofeverything is one that can describe a " quantum spacetime . "
Both general relativity and quantum mechanics are formulated using the intuitive concept of a classical spacetime , he explains .
But many arguments — including some based on theory - of - everything studies — suggest the correct microscopic description of spacetime should be based on a nonclassical geometry , that is , on a quantum spacetime .
The concept gels well with a theory that Amelino - Camelia introduced in 2000 , which he dubs " . "
While Einstein ’s special relativity tells us that there is a maximum speed limit for light , Amelino - Camelia ’s doubly special relativity posits that there is also alength — the Planck length — below which space cannot contract .
Spacetime , in this picture , is not continuous but can be thought of as a froth , made up of roiling pieces , or Planck - scale grains , that are just one hundred billion billionth the size of an atomic nucleus .
This grainy spacetime is said to beInstead of trying to fit this notion of a quantum spacetime straight into a larger quantum - gravity model , Amelino - Camelia argues that it will be fruitful to first fully examine its implications .
Taking smaller bites out of the quantum gravity puzzle , in this way , gives physicists manageable chunks that they can chew on more easily .
Crucially , this opens up the possibility of examining each portion thoroughly and subjecting each portion to experimental scrutiny , explains Amelino - Camelia .
Some aspects of the puzzle can be tested using today ’s technology , while others will hopefully be testable in the coming years , as new technologies are developed .
For example , different types of quantum spacetime could affect particles in slightly different ways .
In most scenarios , these tiny effects would be tough to detect .
But one place where the effects might show up is in the behavior of some high - energy particles , called cosmic rays , and bursts of high - energy radiation , known as gamma rays .
Cosmic rays and gamma rays travel huge distances across the universe , and over the course of their long journey the tiny effects of spacetime quantization would have had a chance to accumulate to an observable level , Amelino - Camelia explains .
Cosmic rays have already helped to rule out some of the simplest quantum pictures of spacetime .
Those models predicted that the maximum possible energy of cosmic rays , known as the GZK cutoff , would be significantly higher than currently thought .
However , data recently gathered by the Pierre Auger cosmic - ray observatory does not support this .
" In order to get to the level of probing more promising pictures , we still have some way to go , " says Amelino - Camelia .
" Although it is something we will realistically start doing within a few years .
" In addition , some quantum - spacetime models predict a particular relationship between the speed of photons in gamma rays and their energy .
There have already been tantalizing hints of these effects .
In 2007 , for instance , the MAGIC gamma-ray telescope collaboration based on La Palma in the Canary Islands announced that they had measured a 4 - minute time difference between the arrival of high and low - energy gamma rays released at the same time in a flare from the Markarian 501 galaxy , some half a billion light years away ( Physics Letters B , 668 , 253-257 , 2008 ) .
Standard theories suggest that the photons should have arrived simultaneously .
Along with Lee Smolin at the Perimeter Institute in Waterloo , Ontario , Amelino - Camelia has begun analyzing new gamma-ray data from NASA ’s Fermi Telescope , launched in June 2008 ( see image above right ) .
The new data show similar delays in the arrival times of photons , which they believe will help physicists discriminate between these models .
In this way , theories ofeverything are falsifiable — giving them the edge over more ambitious theory - of - everything candidates .
John Stachel , a physicist at Boston University , Massachusetts , admires this drive to produce a falsifiable theory .
" Amelino - Camelia grew impatient with the exclusively theoretical nature of most work on quantum gravity , " he says .
" The smallness of most predicted effects threatened to make the field more an area of speculative scholasticism than a part of science .
" But it ’s not just about being able to scrutinize the theory using experiments and observations .
Ultimately for Amelino - Camelia , offer a greater sense of wonder than an all - encompassingever could .
" I do not see so much beauty in the picture of having a theory of everything , " he says .
" It seems to me it is much more appealing to find partial answers , answers that close the door on a few open issues but actually open the door on many more puzzling issues . "

First , there were beavers .
Then otters and muskrats .
And now - as if the Martinez Public Works Department needed more cute , furry mammals paddling around Alhambra Creek - there are mink .
Ten months after the city spent $ 500,000 to shore up the eroding creek bank , a condition many blamed on the beavers and their obsessive handiwork , a mother mink and four babies were spotted this week cavorting near the beaver 's primary dam , just north of the Escobar Street bridge in downtown Martinez .
The silky , razor - toothed critters have apparently taken up residence in the pond created by the beavers ' dam , along with a variety of other aquatic wildlife .
" I was pretty blown away , " said Doug Bell , a wildlife biologist with the East Bay Regional Park District , who viewed video and still photographs of the frolicking creatures and confirmed that they are , indeed , mink .
" They appear to be taking advantage of the habitat created by the beavers .
Is n't that fantastic ? "
Mink are native to the area but are highly unusual .
They 're more often spotted in the delta or the Sierra Nevada , but their population could be rising because of the decreasing popularity of mink coats , Bell said .
Maureen Flannery , collections manager for the ornithology and mammalogy department at the California Academy of Sciences , also confirmed that the animals in question are Neovison vison , a.k.a.
American mink .
The babies probably were born in April or May and will stay with their mother until fall , when they will head out to claim their own territories , she said .
" It 's definitely a sign the local ecosystem is healthy and doing well , " she said .
" And it 's nice people can now view them in the wild . "
Meanwhile , the city of Martinez , which at one point wanted to trap and kill the beavers , is taking a cautious approach to the town 's explosion of wildlife .
" We 'll have to monitor the situation , " said Don Salts , the city 's deputy public works director .
" But mink ?
That 's news to me . "
Dan Murphy , owner of Bertola 's restaurant adjacent to the beavers ' dam , was also taking a wait - and - see attitude .
Liability concerns over the restaurant 's weakening foundation were one reason the city decided to shore up the creek bank last fall .
" I do n't really care , " Murphy said .
" Although I guess the creek 's becoming more and more of a habitat , which is pretty cool . "
The mink are a happy addition to Martinez 's growing menagerie , said vice mayor Mike Menesini .
" Martinez is a very welcoming city , and obviously we have room for everyone , " he said .
" Although it 'll be interesting to see how this mixed community gets along . "
So far , the mink , beavers , muskrats , otters and turtles have adopted an attitude of mutual indifference .
The crayfish are n't so lucky - they 're often dinner for their carnivorous creek - mates .
The mink were first observed by Cheryl Reynolds and Heidi Perryman , members of a group of beaver advocates called Worth a Dam .
Reynolds , who formerly ran the wildlife hospital at the Lindsay Wildlife Museum , was spending a quiet moment by the creek Wednesday evening when she saw " four little squirming things " splash in front of her .
" They make this chirping sound .
It was really crazy , " she said .
" I knew they were mink because of the little white patch under their chin . "
It 's no surprise the mink have moved in with the beavers .
The dams slow down the creek , making it easier for mink to scoop up crayfish , ducklings and other morsels , including , perhaps , baby beavers .
The adult beaver pair that moved into Alhambra Creek in early 2007 had a litter of four kits in May , but the kits have not been seen in some time , Perryman said .
Still , the natural cycle has been a joy to watch , Reynolds said .
" It 's amazing to see how much that creek has changed since the beavers moved in , " she said .
" There 's always people over there now .
It 's a great natural education . "

A dam good time -- Today is Beaver Fest in downtown Martinez , a celebration of three years of beavers in Alhambra Creek .
The festival will include bagpipe music to celebrate the return of beavers to Scotland , where they have been nearly extinct for 400 years .
There also will be live bluegrass and jazz bands , tours of the beaver dams and arts projects .
--
The festival runs 12:30 - 6:30 p.m. at Alhambra and Marina Vista avenues .

European telecommunications ministers could decide tonight whether to endorse a net neutrality clause in the long - awaited Telecoms Package .
The meeting , scheduled for 9:30 pm , will discuss whether to endorse Amendment 138 , which guarantees network users than no - one can interfere with their access to and enjoyment of the internet without a court order , otherwise known as the net neutrality principle .
The US Federal Communications Commissioner endorsed the principle last week , saying he would consult on making net neutrality a rule , along with five other principles to keep the internet as free and open as possible .
Responding to the FCC 's statement , Malcolm Hutty , spokesman for UK and European internet service providers ( ISPs ) , said , " British and European ISPs will be watching American regulatory developments with interest .
The market structure , competition regime and the telecoms regulatory framework are all quite different in Europe from the US , so the American debate on network neutrality does n't translate directly across the Atlantic . "
Amendment 138 is a bone of contention .
Without it , ISPs will be free to limit access and internet bandwidth speeds , filter and delete messages , and otherwise vary the user 's experience of access the internet without recourse to the courts .
Those who argue against the amendment say it is needed to stop illegal transfers of copyright material and other cybercriminality .
Proponents , who mostly agree that illegal filesharing should be stopped , argue that without it , consumers and smaller communications services providers will have no power to enforce contracts with larger network operators , thus entrenching their market dominance .
The one - day format has come under much flak recently , but it 'll get a huge shot at redemption over the next couple of weeks with the Champions Trophy , which , under a new format , will feature the best teams and the best teams only .
All eight teams , barring a weakened West Indian outfit , have a shot at the title , but if recent form - over the last few years and in the country where the tournament is being held - is any indication , the winners will be one of Australia , South Africa or India .
They are the three top teams in the ICC ratings , with only one point separating them - Australia and South Africa are on 127 , with India on 126 .
However , the gap between the third - and fourth - ranked teams is 17 points , with Pakistan on 109 .
The stats of teams since the last Champions Trophy - which finished on November 5 , 2006 - back the rankings completely .
Australia , South Africa and India are the only teams to win more games than they 've lost against the top eight teams .
India have a win-loss ratio of 1.40 , and the next best is New Zealand , with 0.88 , which indicates just how big the gulf has been between the top three and the rest during this period .
During this period India have won 11 out of 17 series ( including multilateral tournaments ) , of which six have been on the trot , the latest being the Compaq Cup in Sri Lanka .
Australia have won six out of 12 , but one of those was the 2007 World Cup .
South Africa have won seven out of 10 , including five out of five at home .
Top eight ODI teams against each other in ODIs since last Champions Trophy Team ODIs W/ L = ratio Bat ave RPO Bowl ave RPO Australia 70 43 / 23 = 1.86 37.12 5.33 27.76 4.97 South Africa 46 28 / 16 = 1.75 35.37 5.31 29.10 4.93 India 78 42/ 30 = 1.40 33.87 5.38 33.69 5.41 New Zealand 55 22 / 25 = 0.88 31.00 5.20 34.53 5.15 Pakistan 44 20 / 23 = 0.86 30.97 4.99 34.15 5.31 Sri Lanka 60 25 / 31 = 0.80 28.98 4.96 28.58 4.94 England 62 25 / 34 = 0.73 28.74 5.00 31.40 5.19 West Indies 49 11 / 34 = 0.32 27.09 4.99 36.91 5.34
Not only have these three teams been the best everywhere in the last three years , they 're also the top three in South Africa since the beginning of this decade ( against the top eight sides ) .
The home team have been by far the most dominant , which makes them - notwithstanding their ability to somehow lose key games - the favourites for the trophy .
Australia have an excellent record here as well , thanks largely to their 2003 World Cup success , but India 's stats in South Africa are considerably worse than their record elsewhere - in 14 matches , they 've only won five , four of which came during their glorious run to the final in the 2003 World Cup .
India 's numbers in South Africa are n't great , but five other teams have done much worse .
Pakistan , for example , have a 20 % success -rate , the same as West Indies , while New Zealand and Sri Lanka are n't much better .
Teams in South Africa in ODIs among the top eight teams since 2000 Team ODIs W/L = ratio Bat ave RPO Bowl ave RPO South Africa 87 58 / 21 = 2.76 37.14 5.21 28.04 4.83 Australia 27 17 / 9 = 1.88 34.45 5.32 29.19 5.08 India 14 5 / 9 = 0.55 24.82 4.66 35.93 5.11 England 14 3 / 9 = 0.33 27.77 4.59 27.22 4.67 Sri Lanka 17 4 / 12 = 0.33 25.53 4.52 39.73 5.27 New Zealand 19 3 / 14 = 0.21 27.52 4.70 37.07 4.94 West Indies 13 2/ 10 = 0.20 28.43 4.86 44.35 5.27 Pakistan 13 2/ 10 = 0.20 23.98 4.72 38.20 5.61
The individual batting stats of players in South Africa offer some interesting insights too .
For one , it explains - partially at least - why Rahul Dravid was brought back into the Indian team .
He leads the averages chart among batsmen who'll be playing in the tournament - in 17 innings ( against the top eight teams only ) he has notched up nine half - centuries .
Ricky Ponting and Jacques Kallis , the mainstays for Australia and South Africa , are next on the list .
Only three other batsmen average more than 40 .
On the other hand , there are several big names who 'll be looking to improve their stats .
Sachin Tendulkar , for instance , averages less than 32 , with five 50 - plus scores in 26 innings .
Sanath Jayasuriya and Mohammad Yousuf have n't done much better .
Sri Lanka 's other big batting stars have struggled too - Kumar Sangakkara averages 28.85 , while Mahela Jayawardene has embarrassing numbers : in 20 innings he has scored a total of 280 runs .
In fact , the last time Sri Lanka toured South Africa was for the 2003 World Cup , a tournament in which Jayawardene had a shocker .
His last eight innings in the country ( against the top teams ) read thus : 9 , 3 , 1 , 9 , 1 , 0 , 0 , 5 .
That explains why Sri Lanka 's record in South Africa is so poor .

Among the bowlers , most of the wicket - takers have been the fast men .
Brett Lee leads the way with an excellent haul of 41 wickets in just 19 games , with three four - wicket hauls and a five - for .
Shane Bond and Makhaya Ntini have been among the wickets as well .
The spinners have reasonable economy - rates , but apart from Muttiah Muralitharan , they have n't had a lot of wicket - taking success .

But when they die and stand before God , they learn that good works can't save ... only Jesus can .
Tim , the Sys Admin , took a moment from flitting back and forth between email , IM , and the ticket queue , in order to assess the state of his network using a screen full of graphs and a highly tuned monitoring system .
No aberrant event could occur in the infrastructure without his knowing .
Almost as a premonition , he flipped to the virtual terminal that held his email , just as his iPhone chirped an alert .
It was a security warning .
One of the users had attempted to log into a machine to which they did n’t have access .
Tim checked the username , and was n’t surprised .
Bill was continually being a user who caused trouble .
He installed software on his PC , even after Tim had locked it down .
He was one of those users who tried to solve their own problems and , in Tim ’s opinion , caused more trouble than they were worth .
So why would Bill have been trying to log into the authentication server itself ?
He should know better than that .
Tim reached for the phone to find out .
Bill apologized , and tried to explain himself by pointing to an email that he had sent to Tim last week , talking about his login time limits .
Bill said that he was only trying to alter the settings on his account so that he could work on the weekend , but Tim suspected that he was trying to get administrative rights on his computer again .
Immediately , Tim suspended Bill ’s account .
Now , Bill only had local access , and Tim laid out , in no uncertain terms , what would happen if he caught Bill trying his boundaries again .
Bill remembered back to the time he had been suspended from remote access for six months .
He apologized again , and then hung up the phone .
Like Tim , we SysAdmins tend to get to the stage where we defend our networks aggressively against the slightest provocation or threat .
This is n’t a good thing to do , for a number of reasons .
It is n’t healthy on a personal level ; it can have a counter reaction from those we offend that can cause collateral damage to the infrastructure and to other staff members ;
We lose our reputation as helpful people .
We can , and must , respond in a more adaptive way .
The underlying problem is that system administrators have egos .
Usually , we have big egos .
We play God with the infrastructures that we run , and we are used to being treated as such .
When we create a mandate , it goes .
When we make a change , it is unquestioned .
We say jump , the servers say “ how high ” .
We ’re egotistical because we ’re the final say in almost every way that counts .
Sysadmins are n’t the only profession that is stricken with this particular issue .
Surgeons , lawyers , politicians , and online columnists are all frequently seen as egotistical , and although the latter ’s reputation may be blamed on their editors , there ’s a kernel of truth to the accusation .
Whenever a person is placed in a position of power and given the final say on a matter , the opportunity arises for ego to assert itself .
For the past few weeks , I ’ve been working on an upgrade for my company ’s telephone infrastructure .
We ’ve got a couple of offices , and I ’d like to unite them using Voice over IP .
The upgrade will involve improving the wiring infrastructure of each office .
I was pretty excited to get the chance to improve the physical infrastructure , since it had been necessary for a while .
Although it was going to be expensive , it was a step forward .
While I was reviewing my options , one of my users had the nerve to bring a perfectly acceptable option to me that would cut our costs by nearly an order of magnitude .
Yes , their solution would work , but it was their solution , not mine .
Mine was better … because it was mine .
What did I say ?
Well , for a few minutes , I did n’t say anything .
I wanted to upgrade the network .
I wanted to run new lines .
I did n’t want to use their solution , even if it was better .
Especially if it was better .
My ego got the best of me ;
At least for a while .
After a few minutes , I was able to step back from the situation and look at their idea logically .
It was acceptable , both from a technical and a financial point of view .
Although it would n’t result in the physical infrastructure being upgraded , I could n’t ignore the massive savings and the fact that it would solve the problem at hand .
From a purely logical point of view , their solution was better .
So what did I do ?
I told them so .
Though it still hurt to do it , I told them that it was better , and I meant it .
The only way that this was possible was that I realized that the well being of the company was more important than my ego being satisfied by solving the problem .
It ’s hard to avoid being controlled by one ’s ego , and it takes practice .
It is worth it because well - being of the company is your real goal , and it can best be served by doing whatever is right .
Remember that whoever is presenting an opposing idea is n’t your enemy .
They want the same thing that you do , or at least , you should treat their request as if that ’s the case .
Ken Block is back at his old tricks .
However this go round , the Gymkhana master and internet sensation teams up with long - time friend and pro skateboarder Rob Dyrdek to provide us with a little more humor .
Dyrdek plays the role of “ Mini Me ” pushing a go - cart fitted with a custom mold to match Ken ’s Subaru Impreza WRX STI , wrapped in identical graphics and sporting a carbon copy Alpinestars driving suit .
This is a very funny video that while not nearly as captivating or mind - blowing as the Gymkhana Practice video or the Gymkhana 2 Project infomercial , is still pretty entertaining .
It ’s a trip to watch Dyrdek darting around in his go cart inches away from Block ’s full - size Subaru WRX STI and amazing that he was n’t decimated in process ( although he does come pretty close ! )
In any case , this is a nice hold - over until Gymkhana 3 drops .
Check out the video after the jump .

Sunday , January 9 , 2005 at 10:40 a.m. I had the first stroke .
A ‘ minor ’ one .
But when your eyes start to roll to the back of your head and you feel the world slowly start slipping away from you and you ca n’t stop it , you do n’t worry too much about major OR minor .
You just wonder how your ’re gonna get from the computer to the couch without passing out and falling down .
I knew what the deal was .
Trust me , somehow you know .
And if you are like me and do n’t have insurance when the shit hits the fan , you have quite a dilemma on your hands .
I went to sleep for a while , I believe I sort of passed out .
When I came to my son was looking at me like I had grown another eyeball or something .
I told him I was okay and I laid there , trying to come up with a PLAN .
Because right away you know you need to do something , but options can be limited in these situations .
( Especially when you do n’t have insurance . )
But then things started to settle down and I thought there was a chance that things were gonna be okay ( although talking , walking , using my hands , little things like that were a little on the iffy side ) .
I think it was about 2:20 when I had the next one .
Then sometime around 4:00 p.m. , the third .
At 5:20 p.m. number 4 hit , and my kid called his older sister .
( He was only 9 at the time . )
I did n’t want anyone to come here , and I did n’t want to leave the house .
Because of the insurance thing , I did n’t want to do anything but lay there .
And that was my plan , to either wait ‘em out or , well , die .
I could n’t see where there was anything else that I could do .
But my son disobeyed me and he called his older sister and told her something was wrong .
When he gave me the phone and I tried to talk to her and I just could not get the words out , she did n’t even wait to say goodbye .
She got in the Missy Mobile and headed in my direction ( just EXACTLY the thing I did n’t want to happen ) .
See , right after a stroke it ’s really hard to talk , walk , think , cope .
Well , by this time I was on number 4 , working on number 5 , and my brain was like scrambled eggs .
And all I could think about was trying to keep her from getting in the car and heading over .
That was what we now refer to as a major FAIL .
She was on the road before the phone was back on the whatever it is you put your phone back on when you hang up .
So Carrie gets here and she tells me it was either ‘ get in the car ’ or she ’d call an ambulance .
One of the things in life that I NEVER want to experience is riding to the hospital in the aback of an ambulance .
That is one EXPENSIVE ride .
A weekend rental for a limo probably does n’t cost as much as a fifteen minute ride in an ambulance .
( $ 600.00 was the cost for the ride for my son when he had an anxiety attack . )
So anyway , she made me haul butt off the couch and I ’ll be damned , here comes number 5 .
I had wanted to get dressed but now I got 2 kids and my grandson FREAKING OUT and I gotta figure out a way to get myself into a pair of jeans .
It took a while but I made it .
So we ’re driving down Dodge Street and all of a sudden I hear my Grandma Catherine in the background and she remindes me that I ’ve got a pair of my older , raggedy undies on .
Hell , no one was supposed to know .
And it was Sunday .
And I did n’t plan on going out .
** sigh **
So , I make here stop at Walgreen ’s so that I could buy some new ones .
And it suddenly struck me , this WAS the dreaded ‘ make sure you ’ve got on your good undies on because you never know when you might XXXXXX and have to go to the hospital ’ that I ’d heard about when I was a kid .
In a way , that was the worst part of the whole experience because I always laughed when my Mom or Grandparent said that shit .
In fact , it was the stereotypical joke when I was a kid .
Trust me , people really did say those things .
And now I KNOW why .
So we get to Walgreens , Carrie goes in , gets the new undies ( not much of aselection I must say ) , and off we go again .
She let me pick the hospital ( kind of her do n’t you think ? ) and I chose the University of Nebraska Medical Center .
That is where I would got for treatment for anything
They have the best doctors in the world there .
Anyway , we get to the hospital and Carrie goes and gets started on checking me in and I do the Thorazine Shuffle to the rest room so that I can put on my pretty new undies .
Afterwards , I walk up to the window in the Emergency Room and the admissions clerk asked me something and BOOM !
number 6 . She tried to ask me a question and I just freaked her out .
I must have been doing the old eyeball roll , but whatever it was , she hops out of her chair and takes off .
All of a sudden I ’ve got all these people trying to get me back into a bed in the ER .
( By this time they ’d completely forgot about asking me questions , thank God .
I did n’t have the answers by that time anyway . )
Long story short , I had two or more minor strokes , numbers 7 and 8 .
I remember the strokes , but I did n’t have a clock .
So I do n’t know exactly when they occurred .
There may have been more , I ’m not sure .
All I remembered was being extremely grateful that I ’d just shaved my legs the day before .
Did you know that the let people in the ER when you ’re busy trying to croak ?
Here I was , my head trying to explode like a cartoon thermometer , and I got all these people back there by this time .
My daughter and son , my grandson , my brother and his girlfriend , and my friend Molly ( I went to Notre Dame Academy with Molly .
We were two of the SIX IMMORALS .
It was a Catholic boarding school and we smoked and cussed and drove those nuns crazy , especially Sr. Ruth .
By the time we were done with her , she went into the Poor Clares .
And that is the God ’s truth ! )
Any way , here I am not even able to keep my own shit together and I got all these crying people around me that I have to reassure .
Finally at 2:00 a.m. the first major stroke hits .
And they think everything is over .
And they haul me up to get an MRI .
Little did any of us know but as they were hauling me out of the MRI , I had another stroke .
Another big one .
On the other side of my brain .
For the next three days I was a practically a vegetable .
They had me on Aggrenox and that was fifty million times worse than the strokes .
I could n’t stand light , smell , touch , light , sound , anything .
I was in agony .
Absolute agony and I REALLY wanted to die by that time .
And I kept telling those doctors I could n’t take that medicine , but they would n’t listen to me .
Not for three damn days .
I had the best doctor in the world for what ailed me .
But the doctor , a WONDERFUL man named Pierre Fayed , kept bringing all these med students in .
And they kept whanging me on the knees and on the elbows , and dragging that little mallet across the bottom of my feet , and across my hands , and waving their fingers in front of my eyes , and then they ’d all go out in the hall and whisper and turn around and look at me , whisper some more , and come back in and start whanging me all over again .
This went on from Monday to Wednesday and then the doctor decided to send me back up for a MRI .
Thank goodness he did .
That ’s when they found the other blood clot .
No one could understand why I had the stroke symptoms on the same side of my body as the side of the brain I had my ( first major ) stroke on .
Those crazy people would have whanged me to death with that little rubber mallet if they had n’t sent me back upstairs .
I was sooooo glad they found the other clot .
They finally quit whanging me with that damn little mallet .
In the hospital Sunday through Thursday ( if you do n’t have insurance the hospital gets your ass out of there FAST ) .
Five days in the hospital .
Two series of MRIs .
All the Meds ( good and bad ) .
And no insurance .
I worked .
But I worked for a law firm and they did n’t want to pay the high cost of health insurance premiums .
It was a small firm anyway .
Probably could n’t afford it anyway .
But this is why someday my son and I will be homeless .
Because I still owe thousands .
And as of today , my net worth is , let me see now , $ 10.00 .
That ’s every penny I have until Thursday .
And it ’s not because I do n’t ’ work .
I work somewhere else now .
And thanks to Wall Street and all of Obama ’s bestest buddies ( Hi Larry , Hi Hank ) , my hours have been cut down to what amounts to part time because I work for a company that makes and pours foam .
We cut it at the facility I work at .
Foam for bedding and furniture .
Foam for packing .
Foam has hundreds of uses ( who ’d have thunk it ? ) .
But right now , no one is buying bedding .
No one is buying furniture .
No one is buying expensive gadgets that get packed in foam packaging .
I get up at 4:00 a.m. to get to work by 6:30 a.m.
( I have to allow myself an hour every morning to catch up on what happened over night . )
And I ’m usually heading home by noon , or 1:00 p.m. if I ’m lucky .
I have insurance now .
I pay ( pro-rated ) approximately $ 378.00 per month for my son and myself .
United Healthcare gets their cut RIGHT OFF THE TOP .
So around the holidays , when I have about 40 hours for two weeks work , I get a check that looks like most kids ’ allowance .
So , you can understand why , when I called old Benny ’s office in Washington D.C. and told them I had gotten the flyer telling us to give him a call I told the poor guy who answered the phone ( he was soooo happy when I mentioned that flyer ) that I would never vote for that lying fraud again .
I told him I was n’t that stupid , I know where Benny gets his political contributions from .
And I even know now much .
And how I will volunteer to do every damn thing I can to see that he never gets re-elected .

Stranded Lulu is airlifted home by cable car
The farmer warned Lulu and her pals that the path from the pasture was too steep - but it went in one ear and out the udder .
So the three silly moos had to travel by cable - car to get home again before it was time for milking .
Lulu and the others did n't cowculate how steep the pathway they ambled down near the historic German castle of Neuschwanstein in Bavaria was .
Whatever you do , do n't moooooove !
Stranded Lulu is airlifted home by a cable car
By the time they got to the bottom for some scenic cud-chewing in a juicy , virgin pasture , there was no way back up .
The path was too difficult and they were in no mood for mountaineering .
Help came in the form of the local mountain rescue who hitched the hapless heifers one by one to the local cable - car used by hikers for a free ride home .
For the mountain rescuers , it was all in day 's work .
' It happens quite a lot , ' said one , ' but usually we end up airlifting the cows back home via helicopter .
' It just so happened this trio ended up stuck near the cable car station so we were able to use the cable car .
They were quite cool about it .'

Nels Quevli , the Mason City , Iowa author of the oddly - titled What Should be Done with the Bodies of the Dead ( 1936 ) , does indeed have a point that rises above his oddly - titled , laugh - imminent pamphlet ..
It is a little laborious getting there , and the 71 - year old ex-pharmacist and “ science writer ” with “ fifty years ” of studying death really could ’ve used a little editing in his 47 - page exegesis , but a five - minute scan gets you past the grueling set - up to what the man is really worried about : being buried alive .
This is a great and grand old issue in the history of medicine , and it turns out that what Mr. Quevli was asking for was old - fashion simple : this was to put the newly “ dead ” into a Dead House1 for three days or more at 85 degrees to wait and see if the body began to putrefy , purification being ( in 1936 ) still about the only infallible indicator that death had occurred ( scaling beyond the family of mortises ( morti ? ) including pallor , livor , algor and finally rigor ) .
The body was still being tended to some degree while in the death house , though nothing is said of water ; and after three days or so without hydration a person is going to be in very rough shape anyway particularly if they were traumatized to begin with .
But this solution for Quevli was much better than the alternative of being sent to autopsy while alive or being buried while still shallowly breathing .
The determination of the occurrence of death was a major medical feature of the 19th century , the French in particular waging a fight for how this to be so .
Briefly put , for centuries even before Pliny death was described as the absence of an audible heart — the crux of the sentence being the word “ audible ” , so that the end of life was dependent upon being a physician ’s / person ’s capacity to hear the heart beating .
This might be very problematic if the person listening for that heartbeat had faulty hearing from defect or age , as the listener would place his / her ear on the chest of the patient to determine if the heart was functioning or not .
The stethoscope was n’t invented until 1816 by Rene Laennec -- who produced a monaural device much like a primitive hearing horn made of solid wood — which was a vast improvement over no stethoscope at all , by again was very crude compared to early 20th century devices .
It was much more preferred by most doctors ( though there were contingents who distrusted the instrument and would n’t use it and still others who thought it an insult to their person insinuating defective hearing capacity ) compared to the ancient hairy - ear - on - chest method .
It was also , in a small way , a kind of auditory x-ray .
It was also more elegant than other methods , the following examples referenced from Jan Bondeson ’s delightful Buried Alive , the Terrifying History of Our Most Primal Fear ( Norton , 2001 ) :
-- Christian Friedrich Nasse ’s Thanatometer was a long thermometer that was inserted into the stomach , supposedly measuring a core body temperature that would determine if life was possible ( and published in 1841 ) ;
-- The ( Englishman’s ) Barnett scalding death cure , which recommended burning the skin of the arm to see if it blistered ( no blister / no life ) ;
-- the German Middeldorph invented a heart flag , a needle device that would be thrust into the heart , which if functioning would trigger something or other that would cause a flag to be released at the top of the needle ( a very Victorian and visual one , this ) ;
-- Christian August Struwe ’s interesting Lebenspruefer ( 1805 ) was an electrical device that delivered a dual shock to the eye and lip , the logic here being that if the person was still alive that there would be a resulting twitch ;
-- the nameless tobacco enema , which blew smoke …( delivered in the beginning by breath through a tube and improved later to replacing the lips with a bellows , this secondary improvement by Antoine Louis2 and furthered by Dr. P.J.B.
Previnaire ’s much more powerful anal tobacco furnace .
[ Now there ’s three words I ’ve never strung together before ] . )
-- Leon Collongues believed that he could hear the capillary functions of a possibly - dead person ’s fingers if placed in his ear ;
-- Jules Antoine Josat3 invented a nipple - pincher ( " pince - mamelon " ) life - rejuvenation device , operating on the assumption that a deeply sedated person could not resist a strong pinch of the nipple and would have to wake up if alive .
Perhaps the most spectacularly extension of the nipple - pincher was the tongue - pulling idea of Dr. J.-V. Laborde4 ( 1830 - 1903 ) , a research physician with wide credentials , who reasoned that a continued regimen of advanced and strenuous pulling of a patient ’s tongue would over time bring them back to life if alive .
This is what leads us to the point of this post : Laborde established a mortuary , and in this mortuary , where the dead were waiting to die , he employed a man whose job it was to pull the tongues of these bodies .
In the misty picture of all of this that is painted in my mind ’s eye , the fellow working his way from body to body pulling their tongues with a heavy pincer seems far worse than nipple squeezing or even being an anal smoke blower , though to choose between the three in a twisted Purgatorial mandate would be hard to so .
Although the nipple pincher was n’t replaced by anything mechanical , the smoke blower was ( by a powerful bellows ) , and so was our friend the tongue puller , who after complaining of the boredom of his task was pushed aside by an electrical device .
I am loathe to report that I cannot find a picture of the machine .
Notes :
1 . This was not an uncommon practice .
for example Munich and Frankfurt had their Leichenhaus in which the dead were allowed to putrefy , as did Vienna its Zentralfriedhof .
2. Antoine Louis .
From the Bondeson book , page 156 : " Antoine Louis had also proposed another method of testing life , or at least stimulating the vital spark in the apparently dead person : with a powerful bellows , he administered an enema of tobacco smoke .
One of the pipes of this remarkable apparatus was thrust into the anus of the apparently dead person ; the other was connected , by way of a powerful bellows , to a large furnace full of tobacco ( reference 5 ) .
Such enemas of tobacco smoke were thought to be very beneficial and were used to try to revive not only people presumed dead but also drowned or unconscious individuals .
In 1784 , the Belgian physician P.J.B. Previnaire was given a prize by the Academy of Sciences in Brussels for a book on apparent death , which described and depicted an improved bellows for enemas of tobacco smoke , which he called Der Doppelblaser ( reference 6 ) .
These enemas were regularly used well into the nineteenth century , particularly in Holland ; modern science has discerned no physiological rationale for their use , except the pain and indignity of having a blunt instrument violently thrust up one 's rear passage must have had some restorative effect ( reference 7 ) . "
3. Josat . From Weird Universe.net
I found the following , quoting Death and Sudden Death , by Paul Brouardel and F.L. Benham :
“ Josat invented a pair of forceps with claws , with which he proposed to pinch the nipples of persons whose death has to be ascertained .
Josat obtained the first prize of the Academy , but Briquet , repeating the same tests on the hysterical subjects under his care , proved that they did not react under Josat 's forceps any more than the dead . ”
4. M. Laborde won a 2500 franc prize for his innovation in 1894 ( as reported by the Revue scientifique .
He sounded like an interesting man : according to the British Medical Journal ( in reporting his death 25 April1903 ) upon his own death in that year Laborde : “ as a freethinker had a civil ceremony ; as an hygienist was cremated ; as a member of the Societe Mutuelle d’Autopsie willed his body to be dissected ; as an anthropologist willed his brain to be preserved at the Anthropological Museum … ”
Some of Laborde 's works include Le traitement physiologique de la Mort .
And Les tractions rythmées de la langue , moyen rationnel ... de ranimer la fonction respiratoire et la vie ...
Avec ... dessins , etc And : La traitement physiologique de la mort ( Paris , 1894 ) And : La signe automatique de la mort reelle ( Paris , 1900 ) .
And “ Les Tractions Rhythmees de la Langue ” , VIII , pp. 76 ff , ed. 2 , Paris , 1897 , and VIII , 2d part , pp. 406-510 .
And commented upon in some number , for example : Le Traitement physiologique de la mort par les tractions rythmées de la langue .
Le tracteur lingual automatique Laborde , by Alix Hache .
The new study shows that having people use the Internet can actually change their brain function .
The experiment involved 24 adults , between 55 and 78 years old .
Half had scant experience on the 'net .
The other , web - savvy half served as a control group .
Participants underwent fMRI scans of their brains while searching the Internet , before and after a two - week Internet training period , when the participants searched the Internet for an hour a day for seven days total .
When the naive group was scanned again while using the web , areas of the brain involved in decision making and working memory ( things you quickly hold in your head , like a new telephone number you 're about to dial ) showed more activity .

Technology correspondent , BBC News
Information about the unrest is leaking out via sites such as Drop.io
The Chinese government has made good use of its control over the nation 's technological infrastructure to stop the spread of information about events in Urumqi .
It is well known that China has a sophisticated system that watches where Chinese people go online and monitors what they say .
The control has been extended to search sites , with many people reporting that no results were returned when they typed " Urumqi " into local search engines .
It is thought Chinese news sites relied on the official Xinhua news service for updates about events in Urumqi .
Many disabled the chance to comment on stories to prevent negative posts about the lack of news .
Shirong Chen , China editor on the BBC's World Service , said the official news was appearing faster than during other times of crisis .
" What 's also noticeable is that the official news agency , Xinhua , has learned from the Lhasa riot in terms of media management , " he said .
" To be more credible , it released video footage a few hours after the event , not two weeks . "
Within Urumqi many citizens reported that net access was non-existent , as authorities tried to limit the amount of information emanating from the province itself .
Social block
The Chinese government also moved to block access to Twitter as well as home - grown alternatives Fanfou and Youku .
The Herdict site brings together reports about inaccessible services around the world and , following the Chinese clampdown , it logged almost 150 reports that Twitter was down in China .
Given that it 's a game of cat and mouse they could bring to bear a lot of cats if they had to
Prof Jonathan Zittrain
" It really looks like the Chinese government is trying to close every way to information , " said Clothilde Le Coz , head of the internet desk at Reporters Without Borders .
" Lots of information are actually filtered about the riots .
" Videos were apparently posted first on Chinese video sites , then republished on YouTube .
" But those Chinese websites are blocked and the internet is not accessible in Urumqi , " she said .
But , said Ms Le Coz , information about the situation in Urumqi was getting out to the wider world .
Sites such as drop .
io were acting as rally points for some of the material emerging from the province .
The site pointed people to feeds of videos on YouTube , news items on Twitter , as well as other microblogging services such as Jiwai.de and zuosa.com .
Harvard professor Jonathan Zittrain , an expert on net censorship and filtering , said the shortcomings of the official Chinese filtering system were exposed during times of crisis .
" It is sophisticated but pretty much passive , " he said .
Rumour mill
The sheer amount of ways that information can travel , including if people simply talk to each other or pass around data , means that it is hard to stop all information getting out .
Too much control of information could be counter - productive too .
" There could be way more rumours floating around in the absence of hard facts .
" It does seem that the old strategies are getting leakier and leakier as social media are taking off , " he said .
It was clear , said Prof Zittrain , that Chinese people were very good at working around the restrictions .
Many , he said , used euphemisms to debate supposedly banned subjects .
Authorities have been trying to keep a lid on events in Urumqi
This was also partly because humans were doing the monitoring and censoring .
" If you just see people going after the stuff that explicitly crosses the line , it could let a lot of other stuff through , " he said .
At the same time the growing use of blogs , social media , and video sites meant more and more people were equipped with the skills to spread information .
Technology was helping too ; for example improved translation tools now makes it easier than ever to read sites not written in Chinese .
" You have people using social media as part of their daily lives , not just at times of crisis , " he said .
" It 's not like people have to get up to speed with it or be an activist to do it . "
This , he said , might make people in the Chinese government nervous , as they see the old ways of controlling information breaking down .
It could , he speculated , drive the government to take more aggressive measures and impose harsher sentences for those that visit banned sites or write about forbidden subjects .
" If you try to go to a blocked site in China it 's like a parking ticket type of wrong , " he said .
The Chinese government could start encouraging its supporters to swamp social media sites with the official line to drown any dissent , he said .
It could also go further in its monitoring of the net , mobiles and other ways of communicating .
" If they want to put a lot of effort into it they could make some progress , " said Prof Zittrain .
" Given that it 's a game of cat and mouse they could bring to bear a lot of cats if they had to . "

After an Egyptian Army , commanded by British officers , is destroyed in a battle in the Sudan in the 1880s , the British government is in a quandary .
It does not want to commit a British military force to a foreign war , but they have a commitment to protect the Egyptians in Khartoum .
They decide to ask General Charles " Chinese " Gordon ( Charlton Heston ) , something of a folk hero in the Sudan , as he had cleared the area of the slave trade , to arrange for the evacuation .
Gordon agrees , but also decides to defend the city against the forces of Mohammed Ahmed el Mahdi ( Sir Laurence Olivier ) , " The Expected One " , and tries to force the British to commit troops .

Microsoft sympathizes with people pushing what it calls the " Die IE6 , Die " campaign , but argued today that it simply can't put a stake in the old browser 's heart .
" Friends do n't let friends use IE6 , " said Amy Bazdukas , Microsoft 's general manager for Internet Explorer ( IE ) .
That sentiment , however , only applies to some people using Windows and the eight - year - old browser -- mainly consumers .
" It 's certainly part of our approach to consumers to get them to upgrade to IE8 , " Bazdukas said .
But while she agreed that consumers should ditch IE6 , and understood the motivation behind the growing chorus of Web sites calling for an end to the browser , Bazdukas said Microsoft could n't give the same advice to businesses .
" With our business customers , it 's more complex , " she argued .
" For them , deploying a browser is very like much like deploying an operating system across multiple desktops .
So it 's not a surprise that IE6 is still being used . "
Not that Microsoft 's entirely happy with that .
" IE6 use is higher than we like , " Bazdukas admitted .
" Most of that is from the business installations , that 's where we see most of the trailing installations of IE6 . "
According to the most recent data from California - based Web metrics company Net Applications , 27.2 % of all Internet users are still running IE6 , making it the most popular version of IE .
By comparison , IE7 accounted for 23.1 % of all browsers in action last month , while the newest edition , IE8 , had a usage share of 12.5 % .
In other words , IE6 accounts for approximately 40 % of all instances of Internet Explorer worldwide , beating both IE7 ( 34 % ) and IE8 ( 19 % ) in " IE market share . "
Bazdukas also attributed some of IE6's popularity to Windows ' high piracy rates in countries like China and India .
" There 's a reluctance [ among people using counterfeit Windows ] to use Automatic Updates , " she said , calling out China in particular .
" Rather than download updates , often the solution to problems is to re-image the machine using the pirated , pre-XP SP2 counterfeit .
That also helps to drive the persistence of IE6 . "
" I think Microsoft would like to have people upgrade from IE6 , " said Ray Valdes , an analyst with Gartner .
" But the situation is , it 's surprisingly difficult to get enterprises to upgrade .
Many companies have old software that depends on IE6 , and that software is not upgradable because they have no budget or the developer is not around anymore , or the in - house developer left . "
Like Bazdukas , Valdes thinks IE6 is ancient history .
" I 've recommended to clients for the last two years that they get off IE6 , " Valdes said .
" Almost anywhere else is a better place to be . "
Bazdukas reiterated what several other Microsoft managers have recently said , that the company is committed to supporting IE6 until April 8 , 2014 , which is when all support for Windows XP , the operating system IE6 is tied to , will end .
That practice of supporting a browser for 10 years -- the same length of time as the version of Windows it debuted with -- wo n't change , Bazdukas said when asked whether Microsoft would consider separating browser and OS support .
" We wo n't ask our enterprise customers to shift lifecycles [ like that ] because the OS and the browser , in their deployment , are so closely linked , " said Bazdukas .
" It would put a burden on our customers if the browser was not aligned with how they want to manage their desktops . "
Microsoft really does n't have a choice , echoed Valdes , because of decisions it made nearly a decade ago .
" IE6 's popularity is an unintended consequence of Microsoft having 95 % of the browser market in 2001 , " he said .
" Now it 's just an albatross around their neck . "
According to Bedecks , Microsoft has no plans to divorce IE8 from its long - term support , which will play out on the same schedule as Windows 7 .
That means IE8 will be supported until at least 2019 .
" IE8 still ships with Windows 7 , even though it can be turned off , " Bazdukas said , referring to the so - called " kill switch " that Microsoft added to Windows 7 that lets users disable the browser .
" And even in the European Union , we will ship IE8 with Windows 7 . "
Late last month , Microsoft reversed course and said it would ship IE8 as part of Windows 7 to customers in the EU , but would add a " ballot screen " to the new OS that prompts users to select their preferred browser from a list that is to include IE , Mozilla 's Firefox , Google 's Chrome , Apple 's Safari and Opera Software 's Opera .
It 's unlikely that the problem of getting people to drop IE6 will pop up again when Microsoft 's newer browsers , IE7 and IE8 , reach the same place in their life cycles , said Valdes .
According to Gartner , relatively few enterprises bothered to upgrade to IE7 since that browser was tied to Windows Vista , the 2007 OS that most businesses shunned .
And Microsoft 's increased attention to Web standards in IE8 -- compared to IE6 , anyway , which ignored numerous standards -- means it will be easier down the road for companies to upgrade from the application .
" People learned their lesson with IE6 , " Valdes said .
" They 're gun -shy about hitching their wagon to a non-compliant browser . "
Users and Web developers have been aggressively demanding that IE6 die for months , but the movement has picked up momentum as large sites , including Facebook , Google 's YouTube and Digg , either urged their customers to upgrade or said they would stop supporting the browser .
Meanwhile , an " IE6 Must Die " petition on Twitter has collected nearly 13,000 signatures .
Two weeks ago , a California site builder added its voice to the movement , leading nearly 40 Web sites that represent 30 million monthly visitors to ask users to leave the old browser behind .
Bazdukas 's comments about IE6 were in line with those of other Microsoft executives recently .
Last week , for example , Dean Hachamovitch , also a general manager in the IE group , said " Dropping support for IE6 is not an option . "
Like Bazdukas , Hachamovitch cited enterprise use as the reason .

" Hello all !
Believe me , you are not the only ones to notice the population shifts between the servers .
We have access to the same metrics and more . =)
Consolidating servers is a very complex process , involving game code , virtual goods , hardware , player accounts and achievements , economies , unique resources , server first claims and more ; a veritable laundry list of " what - ifs " as well as a number of legal and procedural hoops to jump through .
We cannot provide any definitive solutions until all issues have been addressed internally so that any action we announce can be carried out , and carried out well .
The free Character Transfer service was the first step of this process , instituted to allow existing players to move to more heavily populated servers , and a great many of us have done so .
For more on the free Chracter Transfer Service : http://forums.station.sony.com/swg/...topic_id=941533
Since the FCS was instituted , SOE has been closely monitoring populations and working on internal strategies to address the remaining population issues .
Your concerns are valid , and they are our concerns as well .
We ’ve been working on this for some time , and thank you for bearing with us .
An announcement will be made as soon as we have all of our checklists and processes complete … but no sooner .
All the best ,
Well if you read the O boards you will ntice allot of talk about the game shutting down .
Im not here to say the game is doomed or its not doomed I am here to give some insight on who to watch for news .
So lets start with the 2 people to watch for and see what they post !
Rich Schmelterrschmelter@soe.sony.com Director , Global Community RelationsLinda " Brasse " Carlsonlmcarlson@soe.sony.com Senior Community ManagerSony Online EntertainmentTel. 858-790-3611 ~ Fax .
858-577-3200
I think Rich Schmelter makes the decisions here and then its enforced by Brasse !
One of the latest things that was posted by Brasse was server merges http://forums.station.sony.com/swg/posts/list.m?start=225&topic_id=986099
An quote from SOE BrasseThis got many thinking that there is about one year left in SWG !
SWG should be able to last through TOR and a few years after words if not longer .
Some really big deciding factors though players will have to conider with SOE .
What needs to be considered here are a few things for starters for the game to end .
SOE denies for starters any expansion that is in the making currently .
For the most part that is true they atleast though have one expansion done and completed if not 2 !
The first expansion that was near completion was when the NGE hit for that summer .
This expansion would have opened up Tanaab that is allready in the TRE files .
The second expansion is also completed although never confirmed as a SOE project .
That is City
In the SkiesHere is what to actually look for if this game is going to stick around .
There is rumor out there that SOE is rather upset with Lucas Arts for giving Bioware TOR and yes it is confirmed SOE did put a bid on this one !
If the rumor is correct there is a lawsuit against Lucas Arts over all this the agreement was that SOE was going to host all of SOE 's mmo needs this is key if SWG will survive .
The reason that is is its SOE 's move on what is done next and close to time of release they do for TOR .
So here is what I think will take place !
We will see a GCW update around next year with something else added in with it .
This will take place right before Beta starts off with TOR .
We should also see consolidation of the servers I would say before the end of the year .
Days before the release or near the time of TOR release date we will see one of these expansion come out for SWG .
The wait for the GCW update is being done for a reason and that reason is hype was its redone and released SOE wants to get the most bang for the buck with a steady line of a new expansion new content and a good GCW war !
SWG and TOR will basically feed off of one another .
If all lines up and SOE is in this game things will progress like this in the near future .
If SOE has still a bad taste in there mouth with Lucas Arts we will not see to much movement and the GCW update will be pushed out sooner then later and no expansions .
This is just my opionon no actual facts .
Im just taking this from past SOE experinces and making my own assumption on it .
The 2 names I layed out here will be the ones who make the final decision on what happens and there is also one more player the lead producer and its not the lead DEV for SOE !
This gu is from Lucas Arts and he makes the main calls to the 2 main SOE employees I mentioned !
[ Editor ’s note :
This post is excerpted from this week ’s forthcoming NORML weekly media advisory .
To have NORML ’s media advisories delivered straight to your in - box , sign up for NORML ’s free e-zine here . ]
State Republican lawmaker Tommy Benton ( 31st House District ) favors “ caning ” minor marijuana offenders and “ executing ” those who sell the drug , according to a recent correspondence sent by the representative to a constituent .
In a July 29 , 2009 e-mail ( which was voluntarily forwarded to the NORML office ) , Rep. Benton wrote : “ Thanks for the email .
We will have to agree to disagree on this and whether or not money is wasted ( by mandating the state to prosecute minor marijuana offenders ) .
I am opposed to the legalization of marijuana .
I think we should go to caning for people caught using and maybe execute dealers .
[ emphasis NORML’s ]
That would solve the problem as well .
That is what they do in Singapore and they do n’t have a drug problem . ”
Caning is a form of corporal punishment consisting of up to 24 violent lashes with a long rattan cane that has been soaked in water .
The procedure inflicts intense pain and deep , bloody lacerations that can take several months to heal .
Rep .
Benton followed up his remarks in a separate e-mail on August 11 ( also forwarded to NORML ) in which he threatened to turn over the names of citizens who disagreed with his political viewpoints to local law enforcement .
He wrote : “ You and your cronies want it ( marijuana ) legalized so you can get a hit anytime without having to worry about getting arrested .
I have forwarded your email to the Lowndes County sheriffs [ sic ] office so that they can be on the lookout for you .
[ emphasis NORML’s ]
Consider this my last correspondence on the the [ sic ] subject to you or anyone else who shares your similar “ conservative views ’ . ”
Benton was elected to the Georgia House of Representatives in 2005 .
UPDATE from Russ Belville , NORML Outreach Coordinator – Please Don’t Threaten Rep. Benton !
Just Vote Him Out of Office .
Since we began covering the story of Georgia Rep. Tommy “ Caning for Potheads ” Benton on July 29 , the story has spread like wildfire .
We issued an official press release today and featured the story here and the NORML front page just yesterday and already the story has been covered from the libertarian / right Reason blog to the liberal / left TalkLeft blog .
However , I am deeply disturbed at some of the nearly 250 comments the story has gotten at the NORML Blog .
There are threats of assassinating , shooting , caning , and kicking the ass of Rep. Benton , as well as comparisons to Adolf Hitler .
Some have even threatened his wife , children , and family dog and published Rep.
Benton ’s home telephone number ( which I ’ve scrubbed ) .
Stop it !
Rise above the level of people like Rep. Benton .
Violence and threats of violence not only solve nothing and hurt our movement , but they may be actionable criminal acts .
I understand the feelings of anger and desire for vengeance .
For far too long our people have been intimidated , harassed , threatened , assaulted , imprisoned , and killed for our interaction with a plant .
Far too many homes have been burst into by armor - clad assault - weapon - armed police .
Our people have had our careers shattered , education thwarted , children taken , healthcare denied , civil rights abrogated , dogs murdered , property stolen and destroyed , and voting rights erased in this “ Land of the Free ” because we liked to use the hemp plant in the same way this country ’s Founders did .
Believe me , I report stories and read heartbreaking personal emails like this every day .
I considered deleting these comments but have not ( though my superiors may overrule me ) because I do think they tap into the strong current of “ we ’re mad as hell and we ’re not going to take this anymore ” that runs through the cannabis community .
Plus I am a strong advocate of free speech on our forums .
But realize that this kind of reaction only empowers Rep. Benton within his community of hateful anti-pot zealots .
“ See , ” he ’ll crow to fellow prohibitionists , “ smoking pot turns you into a raving violent psycho ! ”
We ’re better than that .
Cannabis is supposed to be the peaceful plant .
Do not sink to this man ’s level .
Fighting fire with fire only burns down everyone ’s house and an eye for an eye makes the whole world blind .
Fight this man with peace , education , and voting for his opponents in the primary or general election .

The leaders of the G20 summit gather around the meeting table at the Pittsburgh Convention Centre on Friday .
( ( Jim Bourg / Reuters ) )
World leaders at the two - day trade summit in Pittsburgh on Friday found consensus on thorny trade issues and announced the G20 will supplant the G8 for governing economic issues .
" We designated the G20 to be the premier forum for our international economic co-operation , " a draft statement from the leaders at a two - day G20 summit in Pittsburgh reads .
For more than three decades , the Group of Eight major developed countries — the U.S. , Japan , Germany , France , U.K. , Canada , Italy and Russia — had served as the board of directors for major global economic decisions .
But now the responsibilities of economic co-ordination are being transferred to the G20 , which includes major emerging economies such as China , Brazil and India .
" The old system of international economic co-operation is over , " British Prime Minister Gordon Brown said .
" The new system , as of today , has begun . "
Broad consensus reached
The leaders also declared major progress in their co-ordinated efforts and " forceful response " to prevent global financial collapse but cautioned that their work was far from over .
" Financial markets have come back to life , and we stopped the crisis from spreading further to the developing world , " U.S. President Barack Obama said , speaking as the summit in Pittsburgh ended .
" Still , " he said , " we know there 's much further to go . "
In the draft version of the group 's communique , leaders agreed to formulate objectives that each country will pursue in such areas as bringing down trade imbalances or budget deficits .
Deficits and trade imbalances are believed to have played a prominent role in plunging the global economy into a downward spiral .

( ( Chris Wattie / Reuters ) )
A process will be put in place to have each nation 's objectives reviewed by their peers but tellingly , does not include penalties for countries failing to reach their goals .
Tackling trade imbalances was one of many issues under discussion .
The thorny issue of bank compensation was also included in the draft communique .
The group agreed to work toward ensuring bank bonuses are linked to long - term sustainable growth , not short - term profits .
The final document papered over differences by avoiding language for specific caps , something that France had pushed for but that America had opposed .
A U.S. push for stronger requirements for bank capital — the cushion that banks hold against loan losses — was included , but with many of the specifics over how the capital would be determined left to be set at later meetings
" Our objectives were to encourage full implementation of domestic stimulus measures , to urge completion of measures to fix the financial system , and to urge all nations to resist the temptation of protectionism , " Prime Minister Stephen Harper said Friday .
" We are pleased to see Canada ’s voice in contribution reflected in the leaders ' declaration . "
Beyond specific policy announcements , the G20's new prominence as the major body of international trade issues was front and centre on Friday .
" I think it 's a confirmation of the international reality , " former prime minister Paul Martin , who was finance minister in 1999 when the G20 was formed following the Asian financial crisis , told CBC News from Montreal .
" [ The G20 ] will be better able to tackle issues of global gridlock because all the protagonists are at the table .
" How can you talk about climate change if India and China are not at the table ?
How can you talk about trade imbalances if China is not at the [ G8 ] table ? " he asked .
Canada next G20 host
On Friday , South Korean President Myung - bak Lee and Harper announced that the two countries will co-host the next summit when the G20 meets in June 2010 .

( ( Sean Kilpatrick / Canadian Press ) )
Canada is already scheduled to host a G8 summit in Huntsville , Ont. , at that time , but on Friday , the two leaders said a separate G20 summit will happen simultaneously .
" We will hold distinctive summits but they will be proximate , " Harper said at a press conference on Friday .
The details of where the summit will take place have yet to be worked out , Harper said , but Canada and South Korea will act as co-host and co-chair .
" We have to be very clear that we are not replacing the G8 with the G20 , " Harper said .
Next to the United Nations , the G8 has historically been the dominant body for discussions on peace and security issues , as well as international development .
" We we believe those discussions should continue , " Harper said , but the G20 will now take the lead on economic matters .
HONG KONG ( Reuters ) - Kai-fu Lee , Google Inc ’s former China chief who quit the search giant this week , said on Sunday he will launch his own business next week to fund Chinese technology start - ups .
Lee Kai-fu holds a talk at the University of Hong Kong September 14 , 2006 .
REUTERS / Bobby Yip
Lee , described by Chinese media as the face of Google in China , said on his Twitter page ( twitter.com / kaifulee ) that he will launch a venture business platform , via which young Chinese can get " angel funding " to grow their enterprises .
An Angel fund is a popular kind of venture capital usually offered to a start - up in exchange for convertible debt or an equity stake .
Many technology giants such as Google and Apple Inc were initially supported by various angel funds .
Lee ’s Twitter account is verified by Twitter.com , the mini- blogging service provider .
On his Twitter page , Lee , who joined Google from Microsoft in 2005 , also noted he will hold a press conference on Monday to formally announce the launch of his own business .
Hong Kong ’s South China Morning
Post reported on Saturday , citing an unnamed person familiar with Lee ’s plan , that Lee was expected to establish an investment firm with about 800 million yuan ( $ 117.1 million ) in funds to help technology start - ups grow in mainland China .
Lee ’s departure comes at a time when Google is inching forward in its battle with Baidu in the world ’s largest Internet market by users , while fighting Beijing regulators who want Google to censor its searches .
" I firmly agreed with the head offices of Google that we needed great patience to make the best products ( in China ) from the very beginning , " the influential industry media China Computer World ( CCW ) reported on its Chinese - language website , citing a letter from Taiwan - born Lee. ( www.ccw.com.cn)
“ ( We ) should not attempt to hasten the pace or have a speculative attitude on the hope that we can make a quick success by offering products that can immediately earn money , ” CCW reported , quoting Lee ’s letter in response to his resignation from Google .
Several industry watchers , including CNReviews , reported at the weekend that Lee next week will launch a firm called Innovation Works ( www.innovation-works.com) to fund and help young Chinese start - ups in particular in three sectors -- Internet , Mobile and Information Technology .
Lee , who have written several books about education and career path , thereby earning his reputation as “ a mentor for all Chinese students , ” will also publish a new book called “ Making A World of Difference : The Kai - Fu Lee Story ” soon in China , according to Lee ’s notes on his Twitter page .

Editor 's note : Tony Newman is the director of media relations at the Drug Policy Alliance Network .
Tony Newman says cigarettes kill more people than drugs that are illegal .
NEW YORK ( CNN ) --
Cigarettes kill ; 400,000 people die prematurely every year from smoking .
When we analyze the harm from drugs , there is no doubt that cigarettes are the worst .
They kill more people than cocaine , heroin , methamphetamine and all other illegal drugs combined .
More than 800,000 people are arrested every year for marijuana , the vast majority for possession , yet all the data from studies that compare the two substances show that cigarettes are more harmful to an individual 's health .
If we make these other drugs illegal , should n't we outlaw the leading killer ?
Considering how we deal with less harmful drugs , making cigarettes illegal seems logical .
Over the past decade , we have seen , in states from California to New York , increasing restrictions on when and where people can smoke -- and even momentum toward tobacco prohibition .
Smoking is banned in bars and restaurants and on some university campuses .
People can now be fired from their jobs because they can't give up smoking .
We have seen parents denied adoption rights if they smoke .
In some cities , it is nearly impossible to smoke anywhere besides your own home .
The Drug Policy Alliance sponsored a Zogby Poll in 2006 , and we were shocked to find that 45 percent of those polled supported making cigarettes illegal within the next 10 years .
Among 18 - to 29 - year - olds , it 's more than 50 percent .
But with all of the good intentions in the world , outlawing cigarettes would be just as disastrous as the prohibition on other drugs .
After all , people would still smoke , just as they still use other drugs that are prohibited , from marijuana to cocaine .
But now , in addition to the harm of smoking , we would find a whole range of " collateral consequences " that come along with prohibition .
A huge number of people who smoke would continue to do so , but now they would be considered criminals .
We would have parents promising their kids that they will stop smoking but still sneaking a smoke .
We would have smokers hiding their habit and smoking in alleys and dark corners , afraid of being caught using the illegal substance .
We would have cops using precious time and resources to hassle and arrest cigarette smokers .
Our prison overcrowding crisis would rise to an unprecedented level with " addicts " and casual cigarette smokers alike getting locked up .
We would have a black market , with outlaws taking the place of delis and supermarkets and stepping in to meet the demand and provide the desired drug .
Instead of buying your cigarettes in a legally sanctioned place , you would have to hit the streets to pick up your fix .
The cigarette trade would provide big revenue to " drug dealers , " just as illegal drugs do today .
There would be shootouts in the streets and killings over the right to sell the prohibited tobacco plant .
We have tried prohibiting cigarettes in some state prisons , like in California , and we have seen that smoking continues , with cigarettes traded illicitly .
There is a violent black market that fills the void and leads to unnecessary deaths over access and the inflated profits .
Luckily , no one is proposing making cigarettes illegal .
On the contrary , our public health campaign around cigarettes has been a model of success compared with our results with other prohibited drugs .
By placing high taxes on cigarettes , restricting locations where one can smoke and banning certain kinds of advertising , we have seen a significant decline in the number of people who smoke .
Instead of giving teens " reefer madness " - style propaganda , we have treated young people with respect and given them honest education about the harm of cigarettes , and we have been rewarded with fewer young people smoking today than ever before .
Although we should celebrate our success and continue to encourage people to cut back or give up smoking , let 's not get carried away and think that prohibition would eliminate smoking .
We need to realize that drugs , from cigarettes to marijuana to alcohol , will always be consumed , whether they are legal or illegal .
Although drugs have health consequences and dangers , making them illegal -- and keeping them illegal -- will only bring additional death and suffering .
Do n't just take my word for it .
Take it from the news anchor who was called the most trusted man in America , Walter Cronkite .
Here is what he said about prohibition and our war on drugs : " I covered the Vietnam War .
I remember the lies that were told , the lives that were lost -- and the shock when , 20 years after the war ended , former Defense Secretary Robert S. McNamara admitted he knew it was a mistake all along .
...
" And I can not help but wonder how many more lives , and how much more money , will be wasted before another Robert McNamara admits what is plain for all to see :
The war on drugs is a failure . "
The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Tony Newman .

Wave , which combines e-mail , instant messaging and wiki - style editing will go on public trial today .
The search giant hopes the tool , described as " how e-mail would look if it were invented today " , will transform how people communicate online .
It will be open to 100,000 invitees from 1600BST , each of whom can nominate five further people to " join the Wave " .
The tool is also open source , meaning third party developers can use the code to build new applications .
The developer behind Wave described it as " a communication and collaboration tool " .
" It struck us that e-mail is still the main communication tool on the web , which seemed remarkable given that it is 20 - year - old technology , " said Lars Rasmussen , who , alongside his brother Jens , was the brains behind Google Maps .
In designing Wave , the brothers took as a starting point the idea of " a conversation sitting in a cloud " .
" We found we could build a flexible tool with a surprising amount of functionality , " Mr Rasmussen told BBC News .
Google
Wave combines IM , e-mail and social networking features Such functions includes real - time typing .
This means people can see a comment being written character by character and can formulate their answer to a question before a fellow ' Waver ' has even finished asking it .
Mr Rasmussen acknowledges that this feature could be annoying , but thinks it is also a great time - saver .
For those unsure whether they want all their Wave friends to see exactly what they are writing , when they are writing it , the developers are working on a draft mode which will allow the real - time aspect to be switched off .
Unlike traditional instant messenger ( IM ) conversations continue even once everyone has logged out .
This means that those invited to a Wave conversation but not currently online , can read the message strand in full at a later date .
Sharing photos
More radical is the inclusion of wiki - style editing tools .
All messages can be edited at any point by members of the conversation and a Playback facility allows everyone to see exactly who has edited what and at what time .
I have been accused of being pathologically optimistic about it but I can't see why people would n't want it
Lars Rasmussen
Read more about Wave in Rory Cellan - Jone 's blog Google , a famously collaborative firm , now writes all its design documents in Wave .
Wave also makes it very easy to share photos , which can simply be dragged from the desktop onto the Wave platform .
" If you are planning a trip .
you can talk about it and plan it in Wave and then share all the photos at the end , " said product manager Stephanie Hannon .
Google
Wave runs in most browsers , with the notable exception of Microsoft 's Internet Explorer ( IE ) .
Users of IE will have to download a plug - in , known as Chrome Frame to use the application .
Microsoft does not recommend installing this plug - in , claiming it compromises security .
As IE is still the dominant browser , its incompatibility with Wave could affect take - up of the platform .
Google insists the failure of Wave in IE is not an excuse to promote its own browser , Chrome .
It said the developers worked " very hard " at trying to make it work in IE .
Much of the code for Wave is written in HTML 5 , the next - generation of web language .
Initial users can invite five other people to join Wave
In a nod to social - networking site Facebook , there are already a host of applications for Wave , including Sudoku and Chess .
" We are now trying to persuade someone to build a crossword puzzle , " said Mr Rasmussen .
He acknowledges that the success of the platform will depend on how many people are willing to join .
" Without other people adopting Wave it will never take off , " he said .
" I have been accused of being pathologically optimistic about it but I can't see why people would n't want it , " he said .
His enthusiasm seems to be being borne out to a certain degree .
Since Wave was announced at a Google developers ' conference in May , one million people have registered interested .
Wave will have a full consumer launch early next year .

( CNN ) --
It 's a community of crude green metal sheds , baking hot during the day and lacking clean running water .
Residents say thieves can slice through the thin walls with their knives .
A man packs up his belongings after being evicted from Borei Keila to Tuol Sambo .
Locals call it " the AIDS colony . "
The Cambodian government set up the community on a site known as Tuol Sambo , on the outskirts of the capital , Phnom Penh .
It began relocating families affected by HIV and AIDS from the neighborhood of Borei Keila last month , and last week removed 20 more families .
The move sparked outrage among human rights groups , which said the conditions in Tuol Sambo do not meet standards for even emergency housing , and that the isolation would further stigmatize those affected by HIV .
" By bundling people living with HIV together into second - rate housing , far from medical facilities , support services and jobs , the government has created a de facto AIDS colony , " said Shiba Phurailatpam of the Asia - Pacific Network of People Living With HIV .
Human Rights
Watch released a letter Tuesday that was signed by more than 100 global HIV / AIDS and social justice organizations and sent the day before to Cambodian Prime Minister Samdech Hun Sen and Health Minister Mam Bunheng .
" We are deeply disturbed by the Cambodian authorities ' creation of a de facto AIDS colony at Tuol Sambo , " the letter said .
" Tuol Sambo is far away from the jobs , medical facilities and support services that had been available to Borei Keila residents in the city . "
The letter said HIV - affected families are being moved to unsafe housing while , just a short distance from " the AIDS colony , " nonprofit agencies are helping build brick houses for other homeless families -- ones without HIV .
The letter acknowledged the international recognition the Cambodian government has received for treating and supporting people living with HIV .
But it called the Tuol Sambo relocations " discriminatory " and " life - threatening " to people whose immune systems are compromised .
The evictions took place despite repeated appeals to the government , including from the United Nations , the human rights activists said .
" We have reason to fear that relocations of HIV - affected families are continuing even as we sign this letter , " they said .
Reports compiled by the United Nations show that HIV is declining in Cambodia .
In 2008 , an estimated 67,200 adults and 3,800 children were living with HIV .
A resurgence of an epidemic exists , however , according to UNAIDS .
The agency reported a risk of second - wave HIV infections among high - risk populations , such as female sex workers , their clients and their partners .
The HIV / AIDS families relocated by the Cambodian government worked mostly as day laborers , motorcycle taxi drivers , seamstresses and cleaners , the human rights groups said .
They said most of those relocated have little prospect of finding work in Tuol Sambo .
Government officials told The Phnom Penh Post that they knew about the problems at Tuol Sambo and that steps were being taken to improve conditions .
" We are trying to find clean water for them , " Phnom Penh 's Deputy Governor Mann Chhoeun told the English - language newspaper .
" They will also no longer face problems getting medicine , because we have given one house to [ Center of ]
Hope , which has improved the health of the village . "
A mission of an area hospital , The Center of Hope provides free medical care for the poor .
But Gerlinda Lucas , the deputy director of grant management , told the Post that the center had no plans to open a permanent clinic at Tuol Sambo , though it will continue weekly mobile clinic service .
Meanwhile , the relocated families expressed relief that they were leaving a neighborhood where landlords refused to rent to them .
But they worried about their safety after thieves cut through the metal walls of one resident 's home .
" I do not feel safe here because our houses are not strong , " Chheang Toma told the Post .
And then , there was the added fear of starting anew in an unfamiliar community .

It ’s been confirmed by producer Yoshinori Ono that Capcom will release Super Street Fighter IV as an enhanced edition to the successful next - gen fighter sequel .
With eight additional fighters joining the fray .
Newcomer Juri , T. Hawke and Dee Jay have been unveiled as three of the eight , with the game also bringing improved online features and balance tweaks to all existing fighters .
The standalone disc - based title is currently slated to hit Xbox 360 and Playstation 3 in Spring 2010 .
So no enhanced stocking - stuffers this year .
No PC version was mentioned but do n’t count it out down the road as the original Street Fighter IV announcement lacked any mention of PC and look how that turned out .

Apple is moving quickly to patch holes and repair incompatibilities within Mac OS X 10.6 Snow Leopard , having already providing some developers with betas of the first maintenance and security update planned for the new operating system .
Three people familiar with the matter say the Mac maker issued the first external builds of Mac OS X 10.6.1 to a select group of developers on Monday , September 1st .
The move comes just four days after Mac OS X 10.6 Snow Leopard hit retail shelves .
Those receiving the first builds are part of smaller , more exclusive seeding programs run by the Cupertino - based company .
They traditionally operate on an invitation - only basis , unlike the Apple Developer Connection open all developers willing to pay membership fees .
Still , ADC members have historically received equivalent pre-release software builds within a week or two of those people belonging to the more exclusive programs , meaning ADC members could see their first taste of Mac OS X 10.6.1 as early as this weekend .
Thus far , little is reportedly known about Apple 's agenda for Mac OS X 10.6.1 , as documentation for the release is limited .
Some of the most common problems encountered by users of Mac OS X 10.6 Snow Leopard are believed to be out of the company 's hands , involving third - party printer drivers and application incompatibilities .
TOKYO ( MarketWatch ) -- Rare earths may not be on most investors ' radars , but they are certainly in almost any high - tech item they use -- and in the world of rare earths , China is king .
The U.S. Geological Survey recognizes 17 different rare earths , materials with science - fictionesque names like lanthanum and gadolinium .
They are used in everything : glass polishing and ceramics , automotive catalytic converters , computer monitors , lighting , televisions and pharmaceuticals .
“ ' China is the Saudi Arabia of rare elements ... [ and ] like oil , rare elements will flow to the highest bidder . ' ” — Mark Williams , Boston University
" We are addicted to rare earths as much as we are addicted to oil , " said Byron King , editor of Energy & Scarcity Investors , published by Agora Financial LLC .
Yet " none of these elements are famous like gold or silver .
None gets shipped in giant ore freighters like iron , aluminum or copper . "
" Without these elements , much of the modern economy will just plain shut down , " he said .
And yet , King said , " the only people who really study these elements are master 's - and PhD - level chemists and solid - state physicists ... and national leaders in places like China . "
In fact , China has all but cornered the market .
The rare - earths space is like a Monopoly game , in which Beijing owns Boardwalk , Park Place , and well , pretty much all the properties , while the West owns St. James Place .
" China is the Saudi Arabia of rare elements , " said Mark Williams , a risk management expert and finance professor at Boston University .
And " like oil , rare elements will flow to the highest bidder . "
China accounts for about 97 % of global rare - earth production -- 139,000 metric tons of material in 2008 -- and it also consumes about 60 % of the world 's rare earths , according to Sean Brodrick , a natural - resources analyst at UncommonWisdomDaily.com .
Meanwhile , the U.S. , which is also a major buyer of rare earths , mined no rare - earth elements last year , USGS said .
" China is consuming more of its own rare earths all the time , so it 's exporting less , " Brodrick said .
That fact could pose a significant problem for the world market , given that rare earths are used in so many products and gadgets .
Without these elements , " you can say goodbye to much of modernity , " said King .
" There will be no more television screens , computer hard drives , fiber - optic cables , digital cameras and most medical imaging devices .
You can say farewell to space launches and the satellites ... and the world 's system for refining petroleum will break down too . "
Technology play
Indeed , rare earths are also critical in the cutting - edge technologies promised to create a new green economy and save the planet from a climate - change apocalypse .
" Really , if there are limited rare - earth supplies in world markets , then there will be a very limited ' green ' future , " King said .
" There will be a limited future , period . "
The electric motor in Toyota 's TM , - 1.34 % ( 7203 ) market - leading Prius hybrid , for example , requires 10 to 15 kilograms of lanthanum for the battery , according to William Gamble , president of Emerging Market Strategies in Rhode Island .
The Prius ' battery also uses 1 kilogram of neodymium , the key component in the alloy for permanent magnets , he said .
In fact , neodymium is the only element that can create strong permanent magnets , although engineers have tried to find a substitute , King said .
And it 's a little - known fact , he added , that strong magnets " are critical to the guidance systems of every missile in the U.S. defense inventory . "
Meanwhile , lanthanum , the most commonly used rare earth , has been a key substance for petroleum refining over many decades , so even " non-green " cars depend on the rare earths .
" China 's dominance of rare - earth output gives that nation an overwhelming advantage in developing many forms of technology , both now and in the future , " King said .
Holding back
With such a stranglehold on the market , China is doing whatever it can to keep other nations from encroaching .
" Recent statements suggest [ China is ] going to limit outside exports , as well as shut down the polluting in - country mines , " said Brent Cook , author of investment letter Exploration Insights .
" They are centralizing supply . "
" Just as Rio Tinto ( RIO ) and [ Turkey 's ]
Eti Mine can effectively stymie any competitor production by controlling the borate market , China can and , I believe , will do the same to emerging producers , " said Cook , who is also a geologist .
Brodrick said China has a " 1 - 2 - 3 plan " to " dominate the world 's rare - earths market for decades to come , and with it , the energy technology for the 21st century . "
The first step involves limiting exports .
This year 's export quota is poised to be the smallest yet , and plans for further restrictions are in the works , he said .
Secondly , Beijing also appears to be forcing manufacturers that use rare earths to move to China .
" Companies that want rare earths from China can get them .
They just have to move their production facilities to China " because of those reported export restrictions , Brodrick said .
And third , he said , China has made moves to buy up other rare - earth resources around the world .
He points to the case of two Australian companies , Lynas Corp. ( LYC ) and Arafura Resources ( ARU ) , which plan to open mines in the next couple of years that would have a combined production equal to a quarter of the annual global output of rare - earth metals .
When the credit markets collapsed last year , both companies lost their financing .
Sensing opportunity , China stepped in , with government - owned miners providing the money needed to finish construction of the two companies ' mines and ore - processing factories , he said .
In exchange , the Chinese companies received 51.7 % of Lynas and 25 % of Arafura .

Beijing 's strategy is a long - term one : King said that while China 's rare - earth output may hold up for a few more years , it 'll almost certainly fall after that .
" The Chinese know this , " he said , and so when the global markets see news about China limiting exports of rare earths , " it 's both to preserve the ores and assets and to create a draw to pull new industry into China . "
Market 's loss is China 's gain
And China 's grasp on the market will be hard to break .
China gained its monopoly on rare earths because it was able to " undercut everyone else 's price over the past decade , " according to Emerging Market Strategies ' Gamble .
The Chinese rare - earth sector also gained a leg up by swallowing some serious environmental consequences .
" Many rare - earth elements are very toxic , " said Marcus Hudson , president of commodity - hedging advisory firm Hudson & Associates .
" With China 's lax rules on environmental safety , there is an environmental nightmare waiting to happen . "
Yet despite such price and regulatory advantages , smaller exploration companies in other nations are starting to make progress on new rare - earth projects that could chip away at Chinese dominance .
" What has to happen to take control out of Chinese hands is obviously new mines outside of China , " said Cook .
" There are a number of junior exploration companies right now working on that . "
As examples , Cook cites Canadian firms Rare Element Resources Ltd. ( RES ) , Avalon Rare Metals Inc. ( AVL ) and Quest Uranium Corp. ( QUC ) .
" So there really is no shortage in rare elements , and in fact , there are enough deposits out there to easily fill demand , but at a price , " he said .
At least until now , rare - earth production was not very economical , but if prices stay high , we will see many new mines outside of China , he said .
But , he added , the " problem is that China controls the price and could put any new producer out of business by dropping prices . "
Strategic ethnocentrism
Howard W. French has written a fascinating and disturbing review essay in the latest New York Review of Books .
It is an assessment of three recent books on the cataclysmic war that has been taking place in Central Africa , and here ’s the passage that reached out and grabbed me :
The protracted and inconclusive conflict that followed has become what Gérard Prunier , in the title of his sprawling book , calls “ Africa ’s World War , ” a catastrophic decade of violence that has led to a staggering 5.4 million deaths , far more than any war anywhere since World War II .
It also has resulted in one of the largest — and least followed — UN interventions in the world , involving nearly 20,000 UN soldiers from over forty countries .
I was aware of this conflict , of course , but as I read French ’s essay , I realized that I knew very little about its origins , evolution , or the prospects for ending it .
I ’m a full - time professional in the field of international relations and security studies , and I teach an undergraduate course on “ the origins of modern wars ” here at Harvard .
I go to seminars on various international relations topics almost every week .
And yet I knew next - to - nothing about the greatest international bloodletting of my lifetime .
Readers of this blog know that I ’m usually wary about outsiders meddling in situations they do n’t understand and that do n’t involve vital interests , but that ’s no excuse for being ignorant about a cataclysm of this magnitude .
I could offer up various reasons for this lapse —
I ’ve never studied African politics , the conflict has n’t been high on the U.S. foreign policy agenda , Western media have n’t given a lot of play , I ’ve been working on other topics , etc. — but frankly , none of those reasons are very convincing .
Mea culpa .
I suspect I ’m not alone in my ignorance either , and French ’s essay suggests that U.S. officials who were engaged in this conflict ( including current U.N. Ambassador Susan Rice ) did n’t have a firm grasp of what was going on either .
There ’s probably some “ strategic ethnocentrism ” going on here too : Western elites pay a lot more attention when people like them are being killed in large numbers , and look the other way when the victims are impoverished Africans .
As for me , I have some reading to do , starting with the three books discussed in French ’s essay ( Gerard Prunier , Africa ’s World War ; René Lemarchand , The Dynamics of Violence in Central Africa , and Thomas Turner , The Congo Wars . )
And it ’s time to make some changes to my course syllabus , too .

Sarah Brown has joined the campaign to defend the NHS Gordon and Sarah Brown have joined a Twitter campaign to defend the NHS , which is under fire in the US .
The prime minister posted a message on the welovetheNHS page after critics of Barack Obama 's health reforms dubbed it " Orwellian " and " evil " .
Mr Brown said the service " often makes the difference " , and added " thanks for always being there " .
Meanwhile , a Tory MEP who told US TV he " would n't wish " the NHS on anyone , has been rebuked by the party .
Conservative officials said Daniel Hannan had done the NHS a " disservice " by giving Americans " such a negative and partial view " .
The Twitter campaign has attracted more than a million followers and thousands of messages of support - including tweets from Sarah Brown , who wrote welovetheNHS " more than words can say " , Health Secretary Andy Burnham and former deputy prime minister John Prescott .
Rationing On Wednesday evening a message was posted on it from the Downing Street Twitter feed , saying : " PM : NHS often makes the difference between pain and comfort , despair and hope , life and death .
Thanks for always being there " .
Many of the tweets in support of the NHS are from members of the public saying they owe their families ' or their own lives to its care .
Professor Stephen Hawking has also hit back at claims in American newspaper that NHS rationing would mean he " would n't have a chance in the UK " , saying on a visit to Washington to collect an award : " I would n't be here today if it were not for the NHS " .
The NHS has been held up by opponents of Barack Obama 's health reforms as an example of an overly bureaucratic " socialized " system which rations care and denies treatment to the elderly .
Mr Obama 's critics claim he would set up " death panels " , a reference to the UK's National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence , which decides which drugs receive funding .
Republican former vice - presidential candidate Sarah Palin said such a system was " downright evil " .
I find it incredible that a free people living in a country dedicated and founded in the cause of independence and freedom can seriously be thinking about adopting such a system
Daniel Hannan , Conservative MEP
Bloggers debate British healthcare Tory MEP Daniel Hannan , who has long campaigned for the NHS to be dismantled and replaced with a system of " personal health accounts " , has joined in the criticism on US television , where he described it in April as a " 60 - year mistake " .
Speaking on Fox News on Friday , Mr Hannan continued his criticism .
" The most striking thing about it is that you are very often just sent back to the queue , " he told the Glenn Beck programme and spoke of elderly patients " left starving in wards " .
He described the NHS as a product of wartime planning , like rationing , and added : " I find it incredible that a free people living in a country dedicated and founded in the cause of independence and freedom can seriously be thinking about adopting such a system in peacetime and massively expanding the role of the state when there 's no need . "
Cameron vow Mr Hannan gained worldwide fame on YouTube earlier this year with a strongly - worded attack on Gordon Brown in the European Parliament , which earned him a strong grassroots following among Conservative members and a high - profile speaking slot at the party 's spring conference .
The party leadership has taken a dim view of his latest media appearances - but it has stopped short of formally disciplining him .
I support the NHS 100 % and the Conservative Party supports the NHS 100 %
David Cameron , Conservative leader Shadow health secretary Andrew Lansley said : " There are millions of people who are grateful for the care they have received from the NHS .
" It does them and the NHS a disservice for Daniel Hannan to give Americans such a negative and partial view .
" That we can access healthcare free at point of use , based on need , is something others envy .
Our task is to ensure that the quality of care is consistently excellent .
" And the service is efficient and responsive to patients .
Choice , competition and information , focused on outcomes , will deliver this " .
Tory leader David Cameron , who has pledged to protect the health service from public spending cuts , also sought to distance himself from Mr Hannan 's comments when he was tackled about them on a walkabout in his constituency .
He told BBC News : " I support the NHS 100 % and the Conservative Party supports the NHS 100 % .
" We are the party that gives the biggest amount of support to the NHS .
It is incredibly important to my family .
It is incredibly important to this country . "
He vowed to " nurture the NHS " if he came to power , " and improve it and make sure it is there for everyone in this country " .
Writing on his Daily Telegraph blog , Mr Hannan said he was a strong supporter of Mr Cameron , but disagreed with him on health .
" I am not the Conservative Party 's healthcare spokesman .
I 'm fond of ( shadow health secretary ) Andrew Lansley , and I strongly support David Cameron as party leader .
On this issue , though , I disagree with both of them . "

The government of the Bulgarian prime minister Boyko Borisov won the parliamentary elections in July with a sweeping majority on a promise to ease the recession and bear down on levels of corruption that prompted the European Union to freeze $ 1.56 billion in aid funding .
This is what the journalist Joe Parkinson writes in a short article in the " Wall street Journal " today .
According to the newspaper , the lack of funds aggravated the economic pain for the EU 's newest and poorest member , where real - estate and steel - industry booms propelled by a wave of foreign capital have been replaced by shuttered factories , sending budget deficits higher .
According to Joe Parkinson , the new deputy prime minister and minister of finance , a former World Bank economist Simeon Dyankov with his first actions has managed to save $ 450 mn after the government froze government wages and pensions , mothballed costly state investment projects .
The result is an 81 % reduction in Bulgaria 's budget deficit to $ 76.5 million in August from $ 412 million in July .
Amid those measures , the government has earned accolades from Western economists and drawn the highest approval ratings at home since the fall of communism two decades ago .
Recent Gallup polls put the government 's approval at 64 % .
" Wall street Journal " also quotes the chairman of industry group the Confederation of Bulgarian Employers and Industrialists Ivo Prokopiev by saying : " The crisis has given the new government a unique mandate - every single unpopular decision could be explained -- and the public are more likely to support the policy . "
The rest of the article is dedicated to minister Dyankov , his biography and his first steps as a minister of finance .
In the meantime , the newspaper quotes economic analysts who create extremely high expectations for the new government and its fiscal policy .
For example , the emerging markets analyst at RCM Capital Markets Nigel Rendell says : " Just a few months ago Bulgaria was a problem child ...
It was one of the region 's worst offenders but it seems to have turned around and given everyone a lesson " .
" The election clearly showed that people are fed up with corruption and bad governance , but once good things start happening then you get some positive spillover -- and we 're determined to make the most of that " , added Neil Shearing , an economist at London - based Capital Economics .

The American fast - food giant McDonald 's has lost an eight - year legal battle to prevent a Malaysian restaurant calling itself McCurry .
McDonald 's argued that the use of the " Mc " prefix infringed its trademark .
But the Federal Court in Kuala Lumpur ruled that there was no evidence to show McCurry was trying to pass itself off as part of the McDonald 's empire .
The owner of McCurry insists its " Mc " prefix is an abbreviation for Malaysian Chicken Curry .
Long process
McDonald's , which has more than 180 outlets in Malaysia , first sued the McCurry restaurant in 2001 .
McDonald 's has more than 180 outlets in Malaysia
A High Court ruled in favour of the international chain in 2006 , but then McCurry took the case to the Court of Appeal , which overturned the ruling .
McDonald 's then went down its final legal avenue , taking the case to the Federal Court .
But chief judge Arifin Zakaria said on Tuesday that the three - member panel had unanimously dismissed the application .
" We feel great that this eight - year legal battle is finally over , " McCurry owner P Suppiah told reporters .
" We can now go ahead with whatever we plan to do such as opening new branches , " he said .
McCurry opened for business in Kuala Lumpur in 1999 , and serves Indian dishes , including fish head curry and breads including tandoori naan .
Lawyers for McDonald 's told the Associated Press news agency that the company accepted the judgement .
A US academic billed as David Cameron 's new intellectual guru takes a Darwinian approach to economics and says it is wrong for the rich to pay higher taxes to help the less well - off .
Nassim Nicholas Taleb , a professor of risk engineering at New York University , attacked Barack Obama for increasing his tax bill as part of a series of anti-recessionary measures .
The remarks by Taleb , the conservative author of the book Black Swan , were made during an appearance with Cameron at the Royal Society for the Encouragement of Arts , Manufactures and Commerce ( RSA ) on Tuesday .
Labour attacked Cameron , who says Taleb 's work confirms his own prejudices , because the " eccentric " academic says economic crashes are a good thing .
In some of his most provocative remarks at his appearance with Cameron , the Lebanese - American academic criticised Obama for increasing his taxes as he harked back to Darwin 's theory of evolution .
" I happen to do OK .
I am paying more taxes , " Taleb said .
" How can you have evolution if those who do the right thing have to finance those who did the wrong thing ?
If you are making money in 2009 – that means you have a robust business in the cycle – you are paying more taxes .
If you are losing money in 2009 you get a bigger tax break .
It is the opposite of everything I believe in . "
Taleb has become a conservative folk hero following the success of his book , which examines the phenomena of " Black Swans " or " low - probability , high - impact events " that can have a major impact on the world .
Cameron praised Taleb and said his book had confirmed his own prejudices .
" I very much enjoyed Black Swan .
I am trying to come to terms with Black Swan thinking and what it might mean for politics …
The danger with reading somebody 's book is that it just confirms some of your prejudices and that is why you like it , " the Tory leader said .
But Taleb has beliefs which are outside the political mainstream in Britain .
These include :
• Economic crashes are a good thing .
" I like crashes .
I just like the world to be robust with them .
The world is not robust .
In 2000 Silicon Valley was very robust . "
• Debt is nearly always dangerous .
" Christianity early on did not like debt .
Islam banned debt .
It is not without reason .
The Romans had problems with debt .
A lot of wars were caused by debt .
So debt was not necessarily a good thing .
You say in moderation .
But we do n't know what moderation is . "
• Climate change may not be man-made .
" I 'm a hyper - conservative ecologically .
I do n't want to mess with Mother Nature , OK .
Even I do n't believe that carbon thing is necessarily anthropogenic [ man made ] , right .
I just do n't want to mess with Mother Nature .
I do n't understand Mother Nature .
It is much more intelligent than us .
It has been around for longer than anything else . "
Cameron made clear he disagrees with Taleb on this .
Taleb yesterday criticised the British press for the reporting of his remarks , saying they may have become " lost in translation " .
His views on economic crashes had been distorted , he said .
" I said that free markets generate fads , crashes , massive movements .
Attempts to control the cycle proved futile – what we need is citizens to become robust to them , to be immune to their impact .
My point is that we cannot predict Black Swans , but we know their impact and can be prepared for them .
Again taken backwards : ' Taleb loves crashes ' .
This is incompetent journalism in its most insidious form . "

When Mr MacAskill announced on August 20 that Megrahi would be freed on compassionate grounds he was relying on a report from Dr Andrew Fraser , the director of health and care with the Scottish Prison Service , which said that the prisoner ’s health had “ declined significantly over the last week [ 26 July to August 3 ] ” .
That was an apparent reference to the report by the three cancer experts submitted on July 30 .

There is a small country in southeast Asia known as Burma .
I knew little or nothing about Burma two years ago .
This is my story .
In the summer of 2007 , a good friend traveled to Burma with his brother Bill and Bill ’s wife , Pam .
( Burma ’s military junta , the State Peace & Development Council , renamed Burma as Myanmar several years ago in an attempt to rid itself of bad karma .
It likewise changed the name of country ’s largest city , Rangoon , to Yangon . )
They went simply to discover an Asia untainted by golden arches , Coke , and other Western vestiges .
When I say Steve was a good friend , I mean he was the kind of guy you ’d see every few months and have a meaningful conversation as if you ’d just seen each other yesterday , and then not speak again for several months .
You hug Steve , you do n’t shake his hand .
Steve , Bill , and Pam were great intrepid travelers who’d book the front end of their trip , as well as an exit strategy , but leave the middle relatively open to chance and possibility .
Despite the fact that Burma had been under the heavy hand of an oppressive military regime since 1962 , this was a trip ripe with possibilities .
Following a brief Japanese occupation , Burma gained its independence after World War II .
Burma was liberated by the British , who had previously colonized the country .
Burma enjoyed a brief window of independence from 1947 to 1962 , when the government was overthrown by the military , which has remained in power ever since .
In 1990 , Nobel Laureate Aung San Suu Kyi was elected Prime Minister by a landslide .
Her victory was never recognized by the junta and she has been under house arrest or imprisoned for most of the time since her election .
She is currently in Rangoon ’s Insein Prison and on August 11 was sentenced to an addition eighteen months because of “ a violation of the terms of her house arrest ” after an uninvited guest trespassed on her property in May .
Steve , Bill , and Pam explored the cities and villages of Burma .
They traveled upriver , as far as it was safe to go .
Westerners are welcome , more or less , but both access and information are limited .
Locals were mostly unwilling to speak freely .
Internet cafes smelled of paranoia .
Limited two years ago , Web access is almost nonexistent today .
When it comes to freedom of either the press or the Internet , Burma is at the bottom of the list .
On the final day of their trip , the trio visited the 2500 - year - old Shwedagon Pagoda in Rangoon .
The group spent the entire day there , as many do .
It is an immense golden pagoda with some of the country ’s oldest and most cherished Buddhas and other relics .
There are many quiet areas for peaceful meditation , and numerous monks and nuns walk the grounds .
It was here Steve met U Agga Nya Na. Agga , a young Buddhist monk , spent more than two hours talking with our friends about life in Burma under the military junta .
Agga shared his story at great risk , as the military comes down hard on anyone who speaks out against it .
At this time , the government was raising the prices of food staples , and its Orwellian oppression was making it nearly impossible for an already impoverished nation to get by .
Following their heartfelt exchange , Steve offered his card to Agga and told him to contact him if there was ever anything he could do .
The following day , Steve left for Wisconsin .
In September 2007 thousands of people marched in peaceful protest in Burma ’s streets , reacting to a 500 % hike in fuel costs enacted by the military to cover salary raises .
Remarkably , tens of thousands of monks also marched in what has become known as “ The Saffron Revolution ” because of strikingly colorful images of monks ’ robes flowing down Rangoon streets .
The monks sent a powerful message to the world by “ turning over the alms bowls . ”
With this single gesture , the monks firmly conveyed that the situation was so dire , and the military ’s actions so unthinkable , that they were being cut off from the possibility of good karma .
Burma ’s population is more than 90 % Buddhist and monks are held in the highest regard .
Giving alms to the monks , even by military personnel , is one of the most common and significant karmic deeds in which one engages .
Overturning their alms bowlswas a devastating signal as well as the one and only activist activity in which monks are allowed to engage .
The military responded by beating , killing , and imprisoning thousands of monks .
Monasteries were raided .
Monks and nuns who did n’t flee were taken away and often not heard from again .
Many remain missing and imprisoned today .
Many others fled the country , sometimes resurfacing in Thailand refugee camps along the border .
Agga ran to one of these camps .
Several months after they met , Steve received a call from Agga , who was distraught and explained in broken English that he needed help .
His monastery had been raided and everyone was gone .
He was on the run and in danger of being killed .
Mind you , he and Steve had only spoken that one day for two hours several months prior to the Saffron Revolution .
Steve was in Mexico on a family vacation when he got the call asking for help from a soul with whom he connected from the other side of the world .
What would you do ?
Over the following days Steve arranged to transfer money to a safe resource in Burma or Thailand to help Agga get to Mae Sot , one of the refugee camps along the Thai - Burma border .
The refugee camps have been there for many years .
Around the time of the first student - led protests in 1988 there was a large migration toward the border .
Burmese citizens are not allowed to leave the country and are not welcome in Thailand .
However , tens of thousands of refugees fill each of the camps .
Some have lived in refugee camps their whole lives .
Conditions are grim , as one might imagine .
The monks had to travel at night , in disguise , and cover several hundred miles on foot .
Steve made arrangements to return to Burma .
He also kept a bunch of us up to date on this stuff via email .
There was a bit of coverage on CNN and the BBC regarding the protests , but Burma had been off my radar for a while .
To be honest , Steve ’s emails did not resonate with me much , just as this story may not with you .
That would come later .
Steve and Bill traveled to the Thai - Burma border and reunited with Agga at Mae Sot .
They discussed plans to bring Agga to the U.S. and kept us updated .
Months later , I heard that several monks were being relocated to somewhere in the upstate New York ’s Mohawk Valley , where I live .
Now I started to pay attention .
It turns out that 3500 Burmese refugees have moved to the Utica area during the last three or four years .
There are also Burmese communities in Buffalo , Ft. Wayne , Atlanta , Austin , San Francisco , Portland ( Oregon ) , and several other cities .
Four monks have arrived in Utica over the past year , and one of those monks happened to be Agga .
Three weeks after Agga ’s January arrival , Steve came to our house for a new kind of reunion .
Since that fateful weekend , my family has become very close with the Burmese Buddhist monks .
We see one another and share meals together often .
I have been reading a lot about Burma and Aung San Suu Kyi , and have become quite engaged .
When worlds collide gently and meaningfully like this , it ’s easy to go with the flow , so to speak .
Because the BCS factory in Italy produces 3 brands of walk - behind tractors on the same assembly line : BCS , Ferrari , and Pasquali ( BCS purchased these other 2 companies in the 1990s … and no , this is NOT the automotive “ Ferrari ! ” ) .
Historically , they had different paint - lines for each tractor and implement line ( Blue for BCS , Green for Ferrari , and Yellow for Pasquali ) … but sometime in 2017 , they decided to optimize efficiency by painting all the tractors and implements “ neutral ” colors and just letting the plastic shrouds and decals delineate what brand tractor it would be .
Hence , black BCS tractors started appearing in the USA in early 2018 .
( Since there were still lots of “ blue ” BCS tractors and implements in the supply - chain “ pipeline ” , some blue equipment will still be supplied in the coming months . )
Beginning in late 2017 , the BCS factory started a new “ paint scheme ” for their tractors and implements :
The tractors are just painted BLACK , and the BCS - branded implements are painted SILVER .
So , on the tractors , the only " blue " parts are now the plastic “ beauty ” shrouds for the handlebars .
We are now offering a “ regional ” delivery service for tractor & implement orders within a 400 - road - mile radius of our location in Owenton KY .
Earth Tools ’ owner ’s Father - in - law Charlie will be doing the deliveries .
Charges for this service will be a bit more than for shipping by truck freight ( call for a quote to your specific location ) , but delivery will be with a pickup truck ( and trailer , if needed ) that can get to most any location – unlike a semi-truck .
Also , scheduling of the delivery will be more flexible , to better meet your needs .
More “ perks ” of this service are that the equipment will be FULLY assembled , and Charlie will show you basic operation of the tractor .
Minimum merchandise order for this service : $ 6000 .

WHAT A WALK - BEHIND TRACTOR IS :
A Walk - behind tractor ( also called walking tractor , two - wheel tractor or hand tractor ) is essentially a single - axle / 2 wheeled version of a 4 - wheel farm tractor , capable of operating many different implements with a single power source .
Walk - behind tractors are used worldwide for small - scale agricultural , horticultural , industrial , landscaping and home use .
Unlike the psuedo - professional equipment of the same physical size produced for the U.S. Market such as DR ® and Troy - Bilt® , European 2 - wheel tractors are built to standards of quality and durability expected of agricultural equipment …
Just like a 4 - wheel farm tractor , these rugged two - wheel machines are designed to give thousands of hours of service life with their All - Gear Drive and Automotive - style clutch .
Of the 30 or so companies manufacturing 2 - wheel tractors in Europe , BCS is by far the largest .
Founded in 1942 near Milan , Italy , BCS sells their equipment in 80 countries and has over 500 dealers in North America .
Grillo , from Cesena , Italy , has also been manufacturing walk - behind tractors for over 60 years .
Grillo and BCS have worked together in the past , but they currently operate as competitors …
Earth Tools has chosen to represent both the BCS and Grillo brand walk - behind tractors , in order to give our customers a more complete tractor selection .

On May 15 - 17 , 2009 in Dallas , Texas twenty - four thinkers , activists , and donors gathered to discuss the immediate need for full equality for lesbian , gay , bisexual transgender people in the United States .
Collectively they prepared The Dallas Principles .
The following eight guiding principles underlie our call to action .
In order to achieve full civil rights now , we avow :
1. Full civil rights for lesbian , gay , bisexual and transgender individuals must be enacted now .
Delay and excuses are no longer acceptable .
2.We will not leave any part of our community behind .
3.Separate is never equal .
4.Religious beliefs are not a basis upon which to affirm or deny civil rights .
5 . The establishment and guardianship of full civil rights is a non-partisan issue .
6.Individual involvement and grassroots action are paramount to success and must be encouraged .
7.Success is measured by the civil rights we all achieve , not by words , access or money raised .
8. Those who seek our support are expected to commit to these principles .
Preamble :
President Obama and Congress pledged to lead America in a new direction that included civil rights for lesbian , gay , bisexual and transgender Americans .
We now sit at a great moment in our history that inspires the nation to return to its highest ideals and greatest promise .
We face a historic opportunity to obtain our full civil rights ; this is the moment for change .
No delay .
No excuses .
Nearly forty years ago , a diverse group of lesbian , gay , bisexual , and transgender people stood up to injustice at the Stonewall Inn in New York City .
In doing so , they submitted themselves to bodily harm and criminal prosecution .
Their demand was simple -- equal protection under the law .
Still today , full civil rights has eluded the same community that rioted forty years ago .
Instead , untold sums of resources have been spent to divide our nation and turn our lives into a political football .
At several junctures in American history , the stars have aligned to deliver the promise of equal protection under the law to those previously denied .
At this unique time in history , our nation must once again exercise the great tradition of making its people equal .
Justice has too long been delayed .
A clear path toward full civil equality for the LGBT community is overdue and must come now .
Using fear and misunderstanding to justify discrimination is no longer acceptable in this nation .
Those content with the way things are will be judged harshly by history .
Those who do not actively advance these ideals or offer excuses will be judged just as harshly .
Those who attempt to divide our community or to delay and deny action on civil equality , waiting for the right moment to arrive , will be held accountable .
We reject the idea that honoring the founding principles of our country is controversial .
We believe in the inherent human dignity of all people .
No longer will we submit our children , our family , our friends and ourselves as a political tool for any Party or ideology .
A new day has arrived .
No Delay .
No excuses .
Learn more and take action at Dallas Principles .
To pen a living as a Hollywood screenwriter has always required fortitude and patience .
Given the ratio between number of writers and available work , the odds of success are long .
Now it looks like the odds have become a whole lot longer .
Thanks to a recession - driven downturn forcing studios to make fewer movies and TV shows , coupled with a screenwriters strike last year that ground production to a halt , the wordsmiths of Hollywood have seen jobs and income evaporate .
That ’s the bleak take - away from the annual financial report of the Writers Guild of America , West , the union that represents about 8,000 movie and TV screenwriters .
It has been the worst year for writers since at least 2003 , with total earnings well below levels of five years ago .
According to the WGA , only 4,163 writers reported earnings last year , down 10 % from a year earlier , with the total earnings declining 18 % to $ 801.4 million .

Not surprisingly , with a strike that paralyzed the television industry , TV writers took a big hit .
Employment in 2008 declined 11 % and total earnings dropped 3 % to $ 437.5 million .
“ For the second half of the year , we found that while WGA series rebounded , the companies responded to the economic downturn by reducing the size of TV series staffs , ” the report said .
Even harder hit were movie writers , who saw employment drop 14 % and total income plunge 30 % to $ 361 million .
The guild blamed the sharp downturn on “ pre-strike stockpiling ” and a decision by the studios to release fewer movies in response to the weakening economy .
Although the WGA said declines in union dues were offset by improved collections and higher residuals from reuse of TV shows overseas , the guild ended the fiscal year with a $ 5.1 - million deficit because of “ investment losses caused by the struggling economy . ”

Hollywood ’s actors also have been buffeted by similar circumstances .
The Screen Actors Guild and American Federation of Television and Radio Artists both experienced deficits in the last fiscal year largely because of a decline in investment income .
The actors unions , however , do not release earnings reports similar to the writers guild’s .
The weak job market has deepened anxiety among the writers guild ’s members , who are getting ready to elect a new leader .
The heated election pits writer - producer John Wells , a former guild president , against the guild ’s secretary - treasurer , Elias Davis , who has the backing of outgoing President Patric M. Verrone .
Although members are divided over which candidate to support , they agree on one thing : Times are hard .

The erosion of scripted prime - time shows on broadcast networks , a result of the popularity of reality TV and NBC ’s shift of Jay Leno to prime time , has left writers with fewer job opportunities .
Cable television is expanding , but the pay often is lower and many shows are n’t covered by union contracts .
Writers are having a difficult time getting bumps in their fees .
And studios are hiring feature writers for shorter periods of time and paying for one draft of a script instead of two .
“ There is a sense in the community , whether it ’s among agents , writers or even producers , that things have really tightened up -- and not in a good way , ” said former board member Craig Mazin , a Wells backer and co-publisher of the widely followed screenwriting blog “ The Artful Writer . ”

Davis is on the same page .
“ John and I certainly agree that these are tough times , ” he wrote in a recent statement to guild members .
“ Every writer I know is feeling more than a little uncertain about the future of our business world and our place in it . ”

BOSTON ( Reuters ) - The Massachusetts Senate voted on Tuesday to allow the governor to name an interim U.S. Senate replacement for the late Edward Kennedy and fill a key 60th seat for the Democrats during the healthcare battle .

The heavily Democratic state Senate passed the bill 24 to 16 , following approval by the state House of Representatives last week .
The bill will go back to both chambers on Wednesday for a final vote and then requires a signature from Governor Deval Patrick , a Democrat who backs the legislation .
Patrick is likely to name a temporary replacement for Kennedy within days and is certain to pick a Democrat .
That will return the party to the 60 votes it needs in the U.S. Senate to override Republican procedural hurdles , giving President Barack Obama a boost as he tries to get healthcare reform and other contentious legislation passed this year .
“ All votes are crucial and the absence of that vote from Massachusetts would hurt those who are pushing for some form of health reform , ” said Paul Watanabe , a political science professor at the University of Massachusetts in Boston .
“ Certainly all the indications are that President Obama had pushed for this , ” he added .
Kennedy , who died in August from brain cancer , was a liberal champion in the U.S. Senate for nearly five decades .
He made healthcare reform his signature issue as he carried on the legacy of his family ’s storied political dynasty .
Without an interim replacement , Kennedy ’s seat would have lain vacant until a January 19 special election of a permanent senator to serve through 2012 , hurting Obama ’s plan to pass an overhaul this year of the $ 2.5 trillion healthcare system .
“ I ’m very , very pleased with the number of senators that endorsed this and saw the value and the need for this , ” state Senator Thomas Kennedy , who is not related to the late Edward Kennedy , said after the vote .
A separate resolution approved along with Tuesday ’s bill “ strongly discourages ” a temporary appointee to the Senate from running in the January 19 , 2010 , election .
KENNEDY ’S WISH
U.S. Senator John Kerry of Massachusetts said the state legislators have given the state ’s congressional delegation the strongest possible hand for the short term .
“ This is what Ted Kennedy wanted , what Governor Patrick and I wanted , and I firmly believe it ’s what people in Massachusetts want because big votes on everything from health care to climate change are being taken now , not in five months , ” Kerry said in a statement .
Kennedy had urged the state to name an interim senator upon his death , but the issue has divided Massachusetts Democrats .
The bill passed on Tuesday would reverse legislation the party pushed through in 2004 when it wanted to prevent a Republican governor from naming a replacement for Democratic Senator John Kerry if he won the White House .
The Massachusetts Republican Party called Tuesday ’s vote “ a stunning example of Democrat hypocrisy ” .
Among names circulating for the interim appointee are former presidential candidate and ex-Massachusetts Governor Michael Dukakis and Paul Kirk , a close friend of the Kennedy family and a former chairman of the Democratic National Committee .
Patrick may also ask Kennedy ’s widow , Victoria , if she would like the interim seat , though she is reportedly not keen .
Democratic contenders for the elected U.S. Senate seat so far include state Attorney General Martha Coakley , private equity investor Stephen Pagliuca and U.S. Representative Mike Capuano .
No Republicans have yet come forward for the primary .
Bankrolling and arming Al - Qaeda offshoot part of 2007 White House directive to destabilize Iranian government
Paul Joseph Watson
Prison Planet.com
Monday , October 19 , 2009
The U.S. government effectively attacked Iran yesterday after its proxy terror group Jundullah launched a suicide bomb attack against the Iranian Revolutionary Guard at their headquarters in Pishin , near the border with Pakistan .
Leaders of the Al - Qaeda affiliated Sunni terrorist group Jundullah have claimed responsibility for a suicide bombing in Iran that killed over 40 people yesterday .
The group is funded and trained by the CIA and is being used to destabilize the government of Iran , according to reports out of the London Telegraph and ABC News .
In the aftermath of the attack , which killed at least five commanders of the Iranian Revolutionary Guard along with scores of others , media reports have swung between Iranian accusations of US and British involvement and blanket denials on behalf of the U.S. State Department .
However , the fact that Jundullah , who have since claimed responsibility for the attack and named the bomber as Abdol Vahed Mohammadi Saravani , are openly financed and run by the CIA and Mossad is not up for debate , it has been widely reported for years .
“ President George W Bush has given the CIA approval to launch covert “ black ” operations to achieve regime change in Iran , intelligence sources have revealed .
Mr Bush has signed an official document endorsing CIA plans for a propaganda and disinformation campaign intended to destabilize , and eventually topple , the theocratic rule of the mullahs , ” reported the London Telegraph in May 2007 .
A d v e r t i s e m e n t
Part of that destabilization campaign involved the the CIA “ Giving arms - length support , supplying money and weapons , to an Iranian militant group , Jundullah , which has conducted raids into Iran from bases in Pakistan , ” stated the report .
Jundullah is a Sunni Al - Qaeda offshoot organization that was formerly headed by alleged 9/11 mastermind Khalid Sheikh Mohammed .
The fact that it is being directly supported by the U.S. government under both Bush and now Obama destroys the whole legitimacy of the “ war on terror ” in an instant .
The group has been blamed for a number of bombings inside Iran aimed at destabilizing Ahmadinejad ’s government and is also active in Pakistan , having been fingered for its involvement in attacks on police stations and car bombings at the Pakistan - US Cultural Center in 2004 .
The group also produces propaganda tapes and literature for al - Qaeda ’s media wing , As - Sahab , which is in turn closely affiliated with the military - industrial complex front IntelCenter , the group that makes available Al - Qaeda videos to the western media .
( ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW )
In May 2008 , ABC News reported on how Pakistan was threatening to turn over six members of Jundullah to Iran after they were taken into custody by Pakistani authorities .
“ U.S. officials tell ABC News U.S. intelligence officers frequently meet and advise Jundullah leaders , and current and former intelligence officers are working to prevent the men from being sent to Iran , ” reported ABC news , highlighting again the close relationship between the terror group and the CIA .
In July 2009 , a Jundullah member admitted before a court in Zahedan Iran that the group was a proxy for the U.S. and Israel .
Abdolhamid Rigi , a senior member of the group and the brother of the group ’s leader Abdolmalek Rigi , who was one of the six members of the organization extradited by Pakistan , told the court that Jundullah was being trained and financed by “ the US and Zionists ” .
He also said that the group had been ordered by America and Israel to step up their attacks in Iran .
Jundullah is not the only anti-Iranian terror group that US government has been accused of funding in an attempt to pressure the Iranian government .
Multiple credible individuals including US intelligence whistleblowers and former military personnel have asserted that the U.S. is conducting covert military operations inside Iran using guerilla groups to carry out attacks on Iranian Revolution Guard units .
It is widely suspected that the well known right - wing terrorist organization known as Mujahedeen-e Khalq ( MEK ) , once run by Saddam Hussein ’s dreaded intelligence services , is now working exclusively for the CIA ’s Directorate of Operations and carrying out remote bombings in Iran .
After a bombing inside Iran in March 2007 , the London Telegraph also reported on how a high ranking CIA official has blown the whistle on the fact that America is secretly funding terrorist groups in Iran in an attempt to pile pressure on the Islamic regime to give up its nuclear program .
A story entitled , US funds terror groups to sow chaos in Iran , reveals how funding for the attacks carried out by the terrorist groups “ comes directly from the CIA ’s classified budget , ” a fact that is now “ no great secret ” , according to a former high - ranking CIA official in Washington who spoke anonymously to The Sunday Telegraph .
Former US state department counter - terrorism agent Fred Burton backed the claim , telling the newspaper , “ The latest attacks inside Iran fall in line with US efforts to supply and train Iran ’s ethnic minorities to destabilise the Iranian regime . ”
John Pike , the head of the influential Global Security think tank in Washington , said : “ The activities of the ethnic groups have hotted up over the last two years and it would be a scandal if that was not at least in part the result of CIA activity . ”
The timing of the bombing that targeted Iranian Revolutionary Guard members yesterday was clearly orchestrated to coincide with talks between representatives from Iran , Russia , France , the U.S. and the International Atomic Energy Agency in Vienna today concerning Iran ’s nuclear intentions .

Nick Clegg raised his game today .
This was , by a considerable distance , the best and most effective speech he has given as Liberal Democrat leader .
But , even more important , he raised his party 's sights .
It was just bad luck that he chose to speak at exactly the same time that Barack Obama came to the rostrum at the United Nations in New York .
The most striking line of his speech came towards the end .
" Imagine , " said Clegg , " a Liberal Democrat cabinet . "
What a thought , indeed – and Clegg only got away with saying it by making a little joke about the odd heated meeting .
But the thought of a Liberal Democrat cabinet is not hard because it is so difficult to imagine particular Liberal Democrat MPs as ministers – though lots of sketchwriters will have fun with that one .
What was really striking was the political audacity of this leap of the imagination .
Not since David Steel 's famous call to his party to " prepare for government " has a leader of the third party tried harder to face his party with the thought of power than Clegg did in Bournemouth today .
This was a serious , ambitious speech .
It started with a big , grown - up theme – Afghanistan – and a threat that withdrawal may be on the cards before long .
Not an Iraq Mk II election - winner for the Liberal Democrats , perhaps , but definitely a clearer alternative policy – do it properly or do not do it at all – than the Conservatives will dare to outline in Manchester next month .
The bigger domestic theme – lifting the party 's eyes to the possibility of power , and even of election victory – came next .
" Let me tell you why I want to be prime minister , " said Clegg .
To many , this will seem foolhardy , almost juvenile .
But if the Liberal Democrats are ever to be more than just a party on the parliamentary margins , while bigger parties decide who actually does the ruling , then Clegg has to imagine himself leading the country and Liberal Democrats have to imagine themselves running it .
There was a nice tight coherence to the main political argument of the speech .
His syllogism went something like this : everyone wants change …
Labour is incapable of change …
The Tories offer an illusion of change … Only the Liberal Democrats can offer real change .
" We carry the torch of progress now , " was a good line – aimed directly at Guardian readers , one sensed .
To rouse a party for a general election battle in difficult times is a tough ask for a party leader who has only been in the Commons for four years .
I thought Clegg did it well .
There was a new confidence and maturity in this speech that was n't there when he first spoke to a conference as party leader in Bournemouth last year .
There were nice touches too – reminiscent , above all , ( though the comparison will doubtless be unwelcome ) of Tony Blair 's self - deprecating style on such occasions .
I liked the deft remark about his critic Evan Harris , and the confidence with which Clegg praised Vince Cable .
Not every party leader – you know who I mean here – has the grace or generosity of spirit to give credible heartfelt praise to a colleague .
But Clegg meant it .
Before Clegg spoke , the BBC showed an interesting preview of the speech by Charles Kennedy , his predecessor but one .
Kennedy has n't been Clegg 's most loyal supporter this week .
But he made several interesting points in his short film .
A Liberal Democrat leader , Kennedy observed , has to play by different rules from the other party leaders .
He has to live a little dangerously , take a few risks , attract some attention .
This year , said Kennedy , Clegg has done that .
He has found not just his feet and his voice as leader , but also his issues .
He took risks , as when he called for the Speaker to quit .
Clegg has done that this week , too – though not in a way that Kennedy necessarily approved .
He led from the front , telling his party that it was time for an end to shopping - list manifestos and time to start talking tough about cuts .
Clegg did it again in his conference speech .
It certainly took risks .
But it did two big things and did them well .
It insisted that the Liberal Democrats are not just another variation on the same centrist party theme .
And it said to the electorate that there are three choices in the general election of 2010 .
Clegg put it this way .
There was exhausted Labour .
There were the fake Tories .
And there is real change in the form of the Liberal Democrats .
Of course , it 's a bit of a stretch to believe that the election is really a three - party race yet .
But that 's what the leader 's speech at a Liberal Democrat conference has to do .
It has to make not just the party , but the country believe the improbable .
Clegg gave it his best shot .
In so doing , he came of age as a leading politician .
IT admins across the globe are letting out a collective groan after servers and PCs running McAfee VirusScan were brought down when the anti-virus program attacked their core system files .
In some cases , this caused the machines to display the dreaded blue screen of death .
Details are still coming in , but forums here and here show that it 's affecting McAfee customers in Germany , Italy , and elsewhere .
A UK - based Reg reader , who asked to remain anonymous because he was not authorized by his employer to speak to the press , said the glitch simultaneously leveled half of a customer 's 140 machines after they updated to the latest virus signature file .
" Literally half of the machines were down with this McAfee anti-virus message IDing valid programs as having this trojan , " the IT consultant said .
" Literally half the office switched off their PCs and were just twiddling their thumbs . "
When the consultant returned to his office he was relieved that his own laptop , which also uses VirusScan , was working normally .
Then , suddenly , when it installed the latest McAfee DAT file , his computer was also smitten .
The anti-virus program identified winvnc.exe and several other legitimate files as malware and attempted to quarantine them .
With several core system files out of commission , the machine was rendered an expensive paperweight .
A McAfee representative in the US did n't immediately respond to phone calls seeking comment .
Friday is a holiday for many US employees in observance of Saturday 's Independence Day .
Based on anecdotes , the glitch appears to be caused when older VirusScan engines install DAT 5664 , which McAfee seems to have pushed out in the past 24 hours .
Affected systems then begin identifying a wide variety of legitimate - and frequently crucial - system files as malware .
Files belonging to Microsoft Internet Explorer , drivers for Compaq computers , and even the McAfee - associated McScript.exe were being identified as a trojan called PWS !
hv.aq , according to the posts and interviews .
We 're still trying to determine how widespread this false - positive glitch is being felt and whether people have found any reliable fixes .
If you have insight , please leave a comment below . ®

' Sometimes on this trip it seemed like everything we were looking at was new '
The jungle crater of Mount Bosavi in Papua New Guinea teems with so much life that it took just 30 seconds for the scientists from the BBC Natural History Unit to discover a completely new species , and even then they almost squashed it .
Dr George McGavin and his team of biologists stepped from a helicopter on to the mist - shrouded rim of the Papua New Guinea volcano and spotted a frog hitherto unknown to science .
It was the kind of find that takes a lifetime for most biologists and was a taste of surprises to come once they had descended into the lost world of the extinct volcano .
" It was mind - blowing , " said McGavin .
" Allen Allison , a specialist in amphibians from the Bishop Museum in Hawaii , said , ' I think that 's one over there by your foot . '
I nearly trod on it . "
By the time the biologists had reemerged from the crater , 16 more frogs , including one with fangs , had been catalogued for the first time .
They saw vegetation laden with so much slimy green frogspawn it seemed to be " dripping with life " , never - before - seen giant rats , a tree - dwelling marsupial that looked like a bear and several strange new fish .
It was an adventure that could have been scripted by Arthur Conan Doyle , whose novel The Lost World chronicled the discovery of long - lost species including dinosaurs on an Amazonian plateau .
Equally strange , but this time true , the jungle within the 1,000 - metre high crater walls of Bosavi revealed stick insects the length of a human forearm , butterflies the size of a paperback book , a tree kangaroo and a fat - lipped tentacled fish that looked like it had swallowed an octopus .
An extremely hairy caterpillar is now awaiting cataloguing in Oxford , where the team has the enviable task of assigning names to its finds .
" We might name it Healeyi after Denis Healey 's eyebrows , " joked McGavin .
The most exciting discovery came soon after the team climbed into the crater , when they came across a giant but friendly vegetarian rat , which may turn out to be the largest in the world .
" This rat was incredibly tame , " said McGavin , the head scientist of the BBC Natural History Unit .
" It just sat next to me nibbling on a piece of leaf .
It wo n't have seen a human before .
The crater of Mount Bosavi really is the lost world . "
The Bosavi silky cuscus , a marsupial that lives up trees and feeds on fruits and leaves , climbed on to the shoulder of Steve Backshall , a climber and naturalist .
" I can't begin to describe how it feels to have an animal in my hands that in all probability has never before been seen by science , " he said .
" Most biologists would consider it a great achievement to name one new species but at some points on this trip it seemed like everything we were looking at was new .
The end of every day was like a massive party .
It was very special . "
Working with the help of local trackers , the team descended into the volcano in January .
" We spent a fortnight in the crater , " said Steve Greenwood , the producer who managed the expedition .
" On the first day Steve Backshall found a Doria 's tree kangaroo , coming close to camp .
These are extremely rare creatures .
He concentrated on searching for creatures in and around the steep rainforest streams and found several species of frog never seen by science before . "
The jungle was so remote the expedition team had to organise the planting of fields of sweet potato and spinach in the jungle six months in advance to provide food .
Weeks were spent seeking permissions to cross land owned by local clans in which long discussions in smoky huts had to be translated into the local language , Kasua , which is spoken by fewer than 1,000 people .

Although it ’s easy to think otherwise , the structure of the modern global economy is not terribly old , arguably dating back to the collapse of the gold standard in 1971 , or the post - World War II “ Bretton Woods ” conference in 1944 .
Earlier versions of what we would nonetheless still call “ capitalism ” had very different degrees ( and kinds ) of government intervention , roles for labor and capital , even rules about currencies .
Add to that the mention more extreme variants such as socialism and communism , corporatism ( fascism ) , and the sundry experiments in anarchism , and you have quite a menagerie of all - but - extinct economic models .
The social and economic structures underpinning the modern world are constantly evolving , and there will very likely soon come a point–probably in the next generation or so , if history is a guide –that we no longer see the socioeconomic world as belonging to the same “ species ” as back at the beginning of the 21st century .
Instead , we ’ll probably see a period of experimentation with diverse economic forms ; indeed , the mid-21st century could well be a truly exciting time for wonkery .
Speaking as a social futurist , not an economist , the three emerging conditions that ride high on my list of potential breaking points for the modern economy are as follows :
Brittle Strength :
The current global economy seems to exaggerate booms and busts , and the ongoing consolidation of corporate actors into “ too big to fail ” entities means that when busts happen–and they do –the system tends towards failure rather than “ soft landing . ”
It ’s getting harder and harder for governments to step in and serve as safety nets to prevent total collapse ; the current economic downturn may well be the last one the system can stand .
Griefer Economics : Information is power , especially when it comes to finance , and the increasing use of ultra -fast computers to manipulate markets ( and drive out “ weaker ” competitors ) is moving us into a world where market position is n’t determined by having the best offering , but by having the best tool .
Rules are gamed , opponents are beaten before they even know they ’re playing , and it all feels very much like living on a PvP online game server where the referees have all gone home .
Robots Stole My Job !:
Think you ca n’t be replaced by a machine ?
Think again .
Robots are becoming more dextrous , able to do a growing number of tasks requiring precision and strength , and computer systems are becoming smarter , able to tackle jobs needing pattern - matching and creative skills .
Humans are still cheaper , for now , but this puts downward pressure on wages–and the old rule that new technology opens up entirely new fields of human labor wo n’t hold true forever .
Smarter , more capable machines will snap up those jobs , too .
All exaggerations , to be sure , but indicative of where trends seem to be heading .
All are issues that could , over the next decade , explode in a way that pushes us to try innovative economic and social models .
So what might those new models look like ?
Here are some examples , each a counter to a particular issue :
Resilience Economics :
The closest of the three to the current model , Resilience Economics employs a mix of regulations and norms ( i.e. , non-regulated but expected behavior ) to shift standard business processes away from a focus on efficiency towards a focus on flexibility .
I previously explored this concept a bit in this post at my main blog .
Pro : Weathers economic cycles well .
Con : Less profitable than current model when current model is working well .
Unbelievable , she 's caught on tape saying " I agree with you " to a Birther .
Jean Schmidt , caught on tape as a BIRTHER !
This needs to go out far and wide .
This needs to hit every cable news outfit .
A sitting Congressperson comes out and admits openly to buying into the Birther nonsense .
We need to get this to the DCCC .
It would be unthinkable for a sitting Congress Person who is caught on tape admitting to belief in the nutburger Birther conspiracy theories to noit have an opponenent in 2010 .
We must find a candidate in the 2nd Congressional District of Ohio .
This simply cannot be allowed to stand .
OTTAWA , Sept. 17 ( UPI ) -- Health Canada apologized Thursday for sending body bags along with H1N1 flu prevention and vaccine kits to some native communities .
" We regret the alarm that this incident has caused , " Health Canada said a statement issued Thursday afternoon .
" It is important to remember that our nurses are focused entirely on providing primary healthcare services under often - trying circumstances . "

However , the apology only mentioned the body bags sent to the Wasagamack First Nation , the Canadian Broadcasting Corp. reported .
The bags also were included in a shipment of hand sanitizers and face masks to the God 's River First Nation tribe .
Jim Wolfe , director of First Nations and Inuit Health for Manitoba , issued his own apology to all tribes in Canada and shouldered the responsibility for upsetting tribal members .
" Given the unknown events that we may facing in the fall , we asked our nursing stations to stock up for three to four months .
And unfortunately in this case we overestimated our requirements and that unfortunately caused the alarm we are seeing now , " Wolfe said .
Some native leaders called for his resignation .
Chiefs of numerous bands throughout the province had issued statements Wednesday denouncing the response by Health Canada this week , the Toronto Star reported from Ottawa .
" To me this is an ominous sign that the government is predicting a grim outcome , " said Chief David McDougall of St. Theresa First Nation .
But Canada 's chief public health officer , Dr. David Butler - Jones , told the Star the body bags were " totally unnecessary . "
The Health Ministry also came under fire this year when it became public there was reluctance to send alcohol - based hand sanitizer to reservations where alcohol is banned over fear Indians would drink it .

Explanation : Our magnificent Milky Way Galaxy sprawls across this ambitious all - sky panorama .
In fact , at 800 million pixels the full resolution mosaic strives to show all the stars the eye can see in planet Earth 's night sky .
Part of ESO 's Gigagalaxy Zoom Project , the mosaicked images were recorded over several months of 2008 and 2009 at exceptional astronomical sites ; the Atacama Desert in the southern hemisphere and the Canary Islands in the northern hemisphere .
Also capturing bright planets and even a comet , the individual frames were stitched together and mapped into a single , flat , apparently seamless 360 by 180 degree view .
The final result is oriented so the plane of our galaxy runs horizontally through the middle with the bulging Galactic Center at image center .
Below and right of center are the Milky Way 's satellite galaxies , the Magellanic Clouds .
Variety reports that 20th Century Fox will develop a retelling of the story of Moses , from his near death as an infant to his adoption into the Egyptian royal family , his defiance of the Pharaoh and deliverance of the Hebrews from enslavement .
The script will be written by Adam Cooper and Bill Collage , who recently completed a scripted retelling of Herman Melville ’s Moby Dick for director Timur Bekmambetov at Universal .
Moby Dick was pitched as a 300 - like reimagining of the Melville story as a visually stunning action piece , and the story of Moses is conceived similarly .
The trade adds that the goal is to give a Braveheart feel to a story most famously captured in Cecil B. DeMille ’s 1956 film The Ten Commandments .
Peter Chernin will produce with Dylan Clark .
Teacher forces student to smoke 42 cigs as punishment
A Malaysian student , who was caught with a cigarette and a lighter in his locker , was forced to smoke 42 cigarettes for two hours as punishment by his English teacher .
16 - year - old Mohd Alif Arifin was sent home after the harrowing incident which left him unable to eat for five days .
According to the New Straits Times , Arifin suffered swollen lips and was left continuously coughing after smoking four cigarettes at a time .
The female teacher was said to be shocked when she found her model pupil had a cigarette and a lighter in his cubbyhole and wanted to show her displease .
Arifin said he did n’t know those items were in his closet , but his denials were not heeded .
Although the school later apologized to the boy ’s family , the torturous penalty joins a growing list of oddballs from the world of Malaysian education .
The government lets schools whip boys with a salted rattan cane for smoking , vandalism and other misdemeanors .

Fed ’s Strategy Reduces U.S. Bailout Pledges to $ 11.6 Trillion

Over at The Mudflats , akmuckraker posted an interesting tidbit that one of her dedicated readers researched – Sarah Palin is one of only 3 U.S. Governors to resign mid-term since 1900 .
The other 2 ? Jim McGreevy and Eliot Spitzer .
For those keeping score at home , Jim McGreevy was the Governor of New Jersey from 2002 - 2004 before he resigned after having a homosexual affair with the man he had appointed homeland security adviser .
Eliot Spitzer served as Governor of New York for just over a year before resigning in 2008 in the wake of his involvement in a high - priced prostitution ring .
Looks to me like Sarah Palin is in good company .
NEW YORK ( CNNMoney.com ) --
Stocks surged Monday , recharging their recent advance after a one - week break , as a pair of multi-billion dollar merger announcements gave investors a reason to get back into equities .
The Dow Jones industrial average ( INDU ) gained 124 points , or 1.3 % .
The S&P 500 ( SPX ) index rallied 19 points , or 1.8 % .
The Nasdaq composite ( COMP ) rose 40 points , or 1.9 % .
Last week , the S&P 500 fell more than 2 % , in its biggest one - week selloff in nearly 3 months .
The declines occurred as investors mulled weaker - than - expected housing reports and an as-expected Federal Reserve decision to hold interest rates steady .
But over the last 7 months , investors have mostly used the dips as an opportunity to get back into stocks at lower levels , something that happened Monday , too .
" The two big mergers really hammer home the point that the credit market is improving , " said Ryan Detrick , senior technical strategist at Schaeffer 's Investment Research .
He said merger news and the recent series of initial public offerings that have come to market go a long way to counter worries that the stock advance is out of pace with the still - sluggish economy .
" These are bullish signs , " he said .
Since bottoming at a 12 - year low March 9 , the S&P 500 has gained 57 % and the Dow has gained 49.5 % , as of Monday 's close .
After hitting a six - year low , the Nasdaq has gained 68 % .
Stock gains were broad - based Monday , with 28 of 30 Dow components rising , led by Boeing ( BA , Fortune 500 ) , 3M ( MMM , Fortune 500 ) , Caterpillar ( CAT , Fortune 500 ) , Chevron ( CVX , Fortune 500 ) , Hewlett - Packard ( HPQ , Fortune 500 ) , Johnson & Johnson ( JNJ , Fortune 500 ) and Travelers Companies ( TRV , Fortune 500 ) .
The only stocks that did n't gain were IBM ( IBM , Fortune 500 ) and Kraft Foods ( KFT , Fortune 500 ) .
Tuesday preview : Tuesday brings readings on consumer confidence from the Conference Board and the 20 - city home price index from Case - Shiller .
Tuesday is also the one - year anniversary of the Dow 's biggest one - day point loss of all time .
On that day , the average plummeted 777.68 points , and the broad market knocked out $ 1.2 trillion in value .
The plunge occurred after the House of Representatives rejected the government 's then $ 700 billion bank bailout plan as a number of banks around the globe teetered on the brink of collapse .
Deal news : Abbott Laboratories ( ABT , Fortune 500 ) is buying the drug unit of its development partner , Belgian pharmaceutical company Solvay , for about $ 6.6 million in cash .
Abbot shares rose 2.6 % .
Xerox ( XRX , Fortune 500 ) is buying Affiliated Computer Services ( ACS , Fortune 500 ) for $ 6.4 billion in cash and stock .
Shares of Xerox lost 14.5 % , while shares of Affiliated , an outsourcing firm , gained 14 % .
Private equity firm American Securities said it is buying GenTek ( GETI ) for $ 411 million in cash .
GenTek makes specialty chemicals and engine parts .
Johnson & Johnson ( JNJ , Fortune 500 ) bought an 18 % stake in biotech firm Crucell for $ 444 million as part of a deal to develop a flu vaccine .
Often , deal news lifts the broad market as it is seen as a sign of corporate confidence .
World markets : Global markets were mixed .
In Europe , London 's FTSE 100 , France 's CAC 40 and Germany 's DAX all gained .
Asian markets ended lower , with the Japanese Nikkei losing 2.5 % .
Currency and commodities :
The dollar rose versus the euro and fell versus the yen .
The greenback has repeatedly hit one - year lows against a basket of currencies over the last few weeks .
U.S. light crude oil for October delivery rose 82 cents to settle at $ 66.84 a barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange .
COMEX gold for December delivery rose $ 2.50 to settle at $ 994.10 an ounce .
Gold closed at a record high of $ 1,020.20 two weeks ago .
Gas prices dropped below $ 2.50 a gallon for the first time since late July on rising supplies and diminishing demand .
Bonds :
Treasury prices rose , lowering the yield on the benchmark 10 - year note to 3.28 % from 3.32 % late Friday .
Treasury prices and yields move in opposite directions .
Trading volume was light because of the Jewish holiday of Yom Kippur .
Market breadth was positive .
On the New York Stock Exchange , winners topped losers four to one on volume of 978 million shares .
On the Nasdaq , advancers topped decliners three to one on volume of 1.93 billion shares .
Although it more or less sank without trace at the time of its 1997 release , The Big Lebowski has arguably become the Coen brothers ' most popular film , inspiring legions of devoted fans to imitate the shambolic charm of Jeff Bridges 's stoner sleuth the Dude .
Now this unlikely dream team may be reunited for a fresh mission - a remake of the John Wayne western , True Grit .
According to Variety , Bridges is in talks to star in the project .
The Coens will reportedly look to the original novel by Charles Portis , rather than the 1969 film that won Wayne an Oscar .
The story follows US Marshal Rooster Cogburn as he tracks an outlaw killer on behalf of his victim 's 14 - year - old daughter .
The novel depicts the action from the girl 's point of view rather than the lawman's , which would seem to have more potential for Coen - esque humour than a conventionally heroic approach .
The Coens ' latest film , A Serious Man , premieres tomorrow at Toronto film festival and is set in 1960s Minnesota against a Jewish academic backdrop similar to the circumstances in which the brothers grew up .
They had previously announced an adaptation of the Michael Chabon novel , The Yiddish Policemen 's Union , as their next film .
The brothers are known for juggling several projects at various stages of development .
Bridges is currently on impressive form , with central roles in the acclaimed absurdist war movie The Men Who Stare at Goats and the forthcoming sequel Tron Legacy .
The Dude remains the role for which he is best known , however .
He has appeared at Big Lebowski - themed festivals and published a book of his own photographs from the production of the film .
Ever wonder how Antiques Roadshow really works ?
How they pick who gets on TV ?
Whether the people on the show have fun ?
Whether the appraisers really know what they ’re talking about ?
As longtime fans , we ’d always been curious about Roadshow .
So when we were offered backstage passes for the show ’s August 2009 taping in San Jose , and free rein to wander the set and talk to whomever we wanted , we jumped at the chance !
A total of 3,200 pairs of free tickets were issued for the 2009 San Jose Antiques Roadshow taping on August 15th ( almost 30,000 applied ) .
And during the course of the day some 75 appraisers evaluated almost 12,000 items .
About 90 segments were filmed , of which only about half would later appear on - air .
Below is our in - depth coverage .
Contributors to this report included Collectors Weekly staff members Ben Marks , Jessica Lewis , Maribeth Keane , and Dave Margulius .
Thanks to the entire WGBH crew including Erika Denn and executive producer Marsha Bemko for giving us unfettered access to the set , both the day of and day before the event !
Also , do n’t miss our interviews with Antiques Roadshow Executive Producer Marsha Bemko and with Roadshow Appraisers Riley Humler , Daile Kaplan , Wes Cowan , Reyne Haines , Rudy Franchi , and Christie Romero .
Friday : We Survey The Scene
By the time we arrive a little after 1 PM , Exhibit Hall 1 has been divided into long , wide rows for the crowds that will descend in less than 24 hours .
Guests ( ticket holders ) are instructed to bring their items to Antiques Roadshow during one of 10 different time slots throughout the day .
Roadshow is not only the number - one program on PBS , with a weekly audience of 10 - million viewers , it ’s also an exercise in logistics and crowd control .
The goal is to prevent a crush of humanity first thing in the morning .
Erika Denn from WGBH shows us around .
We walk over to Exhibit Hall 2 , where each guest will get a ticket for one of 25 collecting categories like Books & Manuscripts , Clocks & Watches , Collectibles and Jewelry .
Paintings & Drawings ,
Denn tells us , is typically the most popular category .
We also get a look at the director ’s truck , a high - def studio on wheels that ’s been rolled right into the convention center so the show ’s two directors can capture and organize the input of the numerous cameras that will be shooting .
Next to the truck is a backstage area for the production crew , a rolling library of reference books to aid the appraisers , and a “ Green Room , ” where guests whose items have been selected for taping get make - up applied .
Some 90 segments will be taped on Saturday , creating content for three episodes .
Only about half of them will actually appear on TV .
In the center of Hall 3 , false walls have been set up to create a brilliantly lit circular set .
This is the Roadshow we ’ve all seen on television , where the appraisers work , sitting at tables around the perimeter .
The dimensions of the set are deliberately tight so the activity captured on film feels bustling , but not so cramped that guests can’t move through the set at a steady pace .
It works because of the volunteers , 110 of them in all , who are on hand to guide guests to the right appraiser and keep the lines orderly .
As we walk around the set , a crew member places several high - intensity lamps on each table , one in front of each chair .
Illuminating whatever a guest has brought in for appraisal is extremely important , but these lamps have an added feature — very low profiles so they wo n’t be in the way in case one of the show ’s producers decides to stop by with a camera for what ’s called an “ over - the - shoulder ” shot of an appraiser in action .
At the center of the open - ceilinged set , the show ’s main cameras stand nobly like thoroughbred racehorses in the paddock .
They ’ll be operated by people like WGBH ’s Bob Martin — he shot the first episode in 1997 and has been with the show for about a decade .
There ’s no hysteria , no one ’s freaking out and yelling last - minute instructions to harried production assistants .
These people are pros .
They know just what to do to make sure all the show ’s cameras , including the one with the 87 - 1 zoom that ’s used for Roadshow close - up shots , are working perfectly .
The cameras sit in the middle of the set shooting out , so when one interview has concluded , the camera crew has only to turn its attention to the right or left to film the next segment , which will be waiting and ready to go .
The interview stations are where guests go to have a chat on camera with an appraiser .
Only then will they learn what the appraiser believes their treasure is worth .
Here ’s the tough fact about that moment of truth : “ We break a lot of hearts , ” says WGBH ’s Erika Denn .
But given the high expectations that most guests bring with them to a taping , preventing disappointment is probably impossible .
Who decides what goes on TV ?
After getting a ticket for a specific category from a screener in Exhibit Hall 2 , guests wait in another line to meet an appraiser .
If that appraiser feels an item is worthy of taping , they must get a fellow appraiser to corroborate the initial assessment .
Having secured a colleague ’s backing , the appraiser must then flag down a roving producer to make their case .
In some respects the appraisers are competing with each other for air time .
They , too , are looking for exposure .
What many viewers may not appreciate is that appraisers on Antiques Roadshow are not paid for their time and trouble , not even transportation or hotel expenses .
Participating in the Roadshow represents an investment for the appraisers , so the only way to recoup that investment is to get the publicity that comes with being seen by 10 - million people on TV .
However , if the number of bear hugs and warm handshakes we saw between appraisers is any indication , you get the sense there ’s more collegiality on display than competition .
Meeting Marsha Bemko
Next we sit down for a chat with executive producer Marsha Bemko , who ’s been with Antiques Roadshow since 1999 .
The author of Antiques Roadshow Behind the Scenes , due out in December of 2009 , Bemko is as passionate about Roadshow as the appraisers are about their areas of expertise .
Naturally Bemko gets excited about the big - ticket items that the show happens upon — for example , the half - dozen six - figure items that were appraised earlier this year in Palm Springs .
But for Bemko , Antiques Roadshow is not just a celebration of stuff .
The best objects and guests are the ones that “ tell a story , ” as she puts it , whether it ’s about a family ’s history or a nation ’s .
“ We ’re smart reality television ” she says .
“ If you watched a whole show and did n’t learn something , you must have had the audio turned off . ”
A journalist by training ( she was a producer for six years on Frontline ) , Bemko is a stickler for getting it right ( “ every sentence is fact - checked , ” she says proudly , “ we have a responsibility ” ) .
Her radar goes off , for example , when she hears an appraiser describe an attribute of an object with the word “ always ” rather than “ usually ” ( when it comes to antiques and vintage objects , “ always ” is rarely the most accurate choice of words ) .
She also appears to love being surrounded by experts who really know their stuff .
“ The furniture appraisers can decide what they want to feature from across the room , ” she says .
Experience is the key .
“ There are no shortcuts to developing your eye , ” says Bemko .
“ You have to look at a lot of objects . ”
And boy , do the Roadshow appraisers look at objects .
In fact , a lot of them have been doing it their whole lives .
“ Many of our appraisers are the children of dealers and collectors .
They are people who have learned how to make a living at their passions . ”
In the end , though , for Bemko , events like San Jose are mostly about the guest .
Of her multiple goals for Saturday , “ informing the guest ” is the first .
In the course of teaching a guest about the history of that chipped piece of Vaseline glass ( what gives it its color , who made it , who used it , when this type of glass was popular , etc. ) , she also wants to be respectful of and sensitive to her guests ’ high expectations , which she ’s well aware her show cannot help but create .
“ You can feel the hope our guests bring with them .
It ’s palpable .
The look in their eye , it ’s sweet .
It ’s a vulnerable moment for them . ”
Treating a guest like that with respect so that they feel like they have gained something , even if their family heirloom is not as valuable as they had hoped , just so happens to be the definition of great TV .
Meeting the appraisers
Antiques Roadshow appraisers typically arrive the day before the event , so we got to shoot the breeze with a few on Friday afternoon .
Ken Farmer , owner of Virginia - based auction house KFAuctions , talked about the value of appearing on Antiques Roadshow ( he ’s been on board from season one ) .
“ It took about four or five years for it to kick in for me , ” he says of the early days .
Then people started consigning objects to him and buying , partly based on his reputation as a Roadshow appraiser .
“ It gives you that PBS stamp of approval , ” he says .
“ Everyone here is squeaky clean in their business dealings . ”
But Farmer adds that the Roadshow ’s sense of community with other appraisers is just as important to him .
“ I ’ve made some very good friendships here , ” he says , “ like the kind you make when you are in college . ”
Plus , if you ’re stumped about the provenance of a piece a guest has brought in , he says , another appraiser can often provide the answer .
“ If you ca n’t figure it out with all the minds in this room , I do n’t know how you will ever figure it out . ”
Tomorrow Farmer will be appraising Furniture , but sometimes they put him in Folk Art .
“ Everything goes to Folk Art , ” he laughs .
When he works at the Folk Art table , he sees things that are n’t folk art at all , but did n’t necessarily have another easily defined category .
Mike Gutierrez of Heritage Auction Galleries also arrives Friday .
He tells us that earlier this season in Palm Springs , he got to interview the son of the president of the Rickenbacker guitar company .
Rickenbacker became famous in the early 1960s when John Lennon of the Beatles made it his guitar of choice .
Gutierrez appraised a copy of a Meet the Beatles album that had been signed by all four Beatles in 1965 , when the band was in Los Angeles for a performance at the Hollywood Bowl .
The son had gone with his father to meet the band and deliver a Rickenbacker bass to Paul McCartney .
Gutierrez appraised that signed album at $ 130,000 to $ 150,000 .
Would he find anything as amazing tomorrow ?
Like us , he ’d have to wait to find out ( hint : see photo at right ) .
Kathleen Bailey of Issaquah , Washington is the last appraiser we speak with on Friday .
She ’s been with the show almost from the beginning , and like Bemko , she ’s extremely fond of the guests .
“ Our hearts are with the people who are not necessarily collectors , ” she says .
“ It brings us back to the feeling we all had when we started to collect . ”
Bailey has seen more than her share of Tiffany , Steuben , and Lalique , and she ’s done well in her appraisal and estate - sale business .
But for her , being around these objects , like being on the Roadshow , is more than dollars and cents .
“ It ’s a passion for the appraisers , too , ” she says .
“ It is n’t just a living . ”
Saturday : Its Showtime !
The crowds have arrived , and the experience begins before the Collectors Weekly team even sets foot in the convention center .
At 10 am , in the parking lot , Ben is handed a free parking ticket by a man who was in the 8 am Roadshow group and is already on his way home .
Although his item was n’t as valuable as he thought , he ’s still in a generous mood .
Waiting in line to pay for parking , Jessica is surrounded by people holding their items close .
She can sense their anticipation .
One woman is gushing on her phone about how much she loves the show and how she went through all her stuff before deciding to bring a framed set of Woodstock tickets ( this weekend is the 40th anniversary of the festival ) .
“ Maybe they ’ll be worth something , or maybe they ’re fake , ” she says into her cell , “ but at least I ’ll know ! ”
On the street , people are unloading SUVs , vans , and pickup trucks .
Some are muscling furniture and other large items onto dollies , others are carrying boxes of all sizes and descriptions .
It ’s a pilgrimage of possessions .
In a few short hours , the owners of these unsigned paintings , antique lamps , and obscure decorative objects will know a little bit more about their things .
At the press table , we meet volunteer Lyn Johnson from KTEH , the San Jose public TV station .
She ’ll be our guide , and help us navigate the various lines , and also help us get the antique and vintage items we brought with us appraised .
Getting sorted
Our first stop is to “ get sorted , ” which means getting a ticket to a specific appraiser table .
The first person to screen our items is Ramona Hillier - O’Hara .
Jessica holds up an Elks Club fob .
“ Jewelry , ” says Hillier - O’Hara , handing Jessica a bookmark - shaped card .
Ben has a Pogo animation cel .
“ Cel , that ’s Collectibles , ” she says , producing another card .
Dave is lugging a heavy cardboard box filled with glass slides used at movie houses .
Hillier - O’Hara pauses , but only for a second .
“ Okay , I ’m going to send you to Collectibles , too . ”
Inside Exhibit Hall 3 , which had been virtually silent the day before , the din is a presence all its own .
Around the circular set , people are standing in line ( many have brought camping chairs ) clutching their items .
Some have rewrapped their pieces after sorting , but most have readied their pieces for the appraiser .
Inside the set , the energy is exhilarating .
The appraisers are laughing , fiercely examining items , calling out to one another : “ Hey , you gotta take a look at this ! ”
The excitement is contagious and we quickly become wrapped up in the psychology of television , people with dreams , and family secrets being revealed .
The Jewelry table
Johnson leads us to Jewelry to see what we can learn about the Elks piece .
As we wait , an appraiser named Barry Weber is talking to a colleague about a guest ’s item .
The conversation is mostly about what the guest may already know about the item , and whether they should pitch it to go on camera .
As Bemko told us the day before , the show ’s dual goals include informing a guest about his or her item , as well as documenting the guest during what she called a “ vulnerable ” moment .
If the guest knows too much , it does n’t make for great TV .
Weber knows this , and they want to be sure not to waste anyone ’s time with a pitch that might get shot down .
Now it ’s Jessica ’s turn .
She ’s directed to Adam Patrick of A La Vieille Russie , Inc .
The table he shares with Weber and three other jewelry appraisers is strewn with calculators , the occasional laptop , magnifying lights , and iPhones — the tools of the modern high - end antiques trade .
There ’s also a book , World Hallmarks , Volume One .
Patrick holds the Elks piece under a jeweler ’s loupe as Jessica looks on .
He starts to speak but then excuses himself to consult with a colleague , who is also in the middle of an appraisal .
Is this the corroboration we ’ve been hearing so much about ?
Is Jessica going to get on TV ?
Returning to his seat , Patrick gets down to business .
“ We see these from time to time , ” he says nonchalantly .
“ They ’re fairly common . ”
The only way to get something like this would have been to be a fraternal member of the Elk’s .
This is a nice one , he adds , so it was probably given to someone fairly high up in the organization .
It ’s an elk ’s tooth , set in 14 k yellow gold ( they ’re often made in silver ) .
Yes , that ’s a blue sapphire and yes , that ’s a small diamond in the elk ’s eye .
When is it from ?
Jessica asks .
Early 20th century , he replies .
And then , without prompting , he appraises its value at “ $ 750 to $ 800 . ” Next !
Patrick thanks us and we thank him , but it ’s pretty clear that Jessica will not be going on television .
On to the Collectibles table .
The Collectibles table
We look across the room , and Wow !
There ’s Rudy Franchi , the movie poster and ephemera guy .
And next to him , in the white ponytail and brilliantly colored shirt is , Gary Sohmers , who gets all the great pop culture stuff .
Dave unpacks his loot and places it before Franchi .
He knew they were glass movie theatre slides when he picked up the whole box a few years ago at an antique show for 80 bucks .
They ’re neat old color slides from San Francisco theatres , the kind they ’d put up on the screen in the 1920 ’s to introduce the main event , coming attractions , ads , or local news item .
In person , Franchi looks just like he does on TV .
He ’s a little gruff , but in a kind , grandfatherly sort of way .
He starts picking through the slides , disinterested at first , and then something seems to click .
Dave ’s hopes rise .
“ Well , these are old movie theatre slides , ” Franchi says .
“ Nice colors , but some are just title slides .
The most valuable ones are the coming attraction slides .
Got any of those ? ”
There are probably 200 slides in the box , so Dave ca n’t remember .
But Franchi keeps looking until finds a few nice ones .
“ Some of these will be worth $ 5 , some $ 15 , some $ 18 . ” Franchi says that slides depicting movie scenes usually go for $ 20 to $ 50 , and that he once sold one for $ 1,000 .
He tells
Dave that he had a big set once , but it took his auction house six years to sell them all because they had to do the research on each ( what movie they were from , time period , etc. ) and individually catalog them .
“ You ’ve got a couple hundred here , ” he says , “ so you ’re looking at around $ 2,500 for the set .
But you ’ve got to sell them one by one on eBay , which takes time . ”
Now Dave reveals that we ’re from Collectors Weekly .
Franchi recalls trading emails with Dave several months ago .
“ I really like your site , ” he says , “ a lot of great information there . ”
In fact , Franchi ’s site already has a link to us , along with a very complimentary description .
Good to finally meet him in person !
Now it ’s Ben ’s turn .
Johnson directs him and his framed Pogo animation cel to Gary Sohmers .
Ben explains that his wife bought it for him as a gift in the 1970s , but that she cut the registration holes that were on the sides to make the piece fit in the frame .
Sohmers groans .
“ You should smack her , ” he says , and then realizing the political incorrectness of his statement quickly adds “ in a good way .
You ’re never supposed to alter the original product . ”
Ben says he ’d guessed that , and asks what the holes were for .
Sohmers launches into a detailed description of Walt Kelly , the creator of Pogo , and multi-cel animation techniques .
The holes , Sohmers says , were there to make sure the cels lined up the same way each time they were shot by a camera .
Ben ’s cel depicts Porky Pine sitting in what Sohmers imagines must have been a log or small boat ( the characters lived in a swamp ) .
The boat is not on Ben ’s cel — it was painted on a different cel , hence the phrase multi-cel animation .
The registration holes allowed the animators to , say , change the expressions on Porky Pine ’s face without having to repaint the boat over and over again .
The piece is from 1967 or 1968 , Sohmers concludes .
It ’s worth about $ 100 to $ 150 as is .
If it had not been cut , he adds , it would be worth anywhere from $ 300 to $ 500 .
Victorious in his summation , Sohmers proclaims to the crowd that has assembled around us , “ The King of Pop might be dead , but I ’m the King of Pop Culture ! ”
Meeting The Kenos
Our own appraisals complete , we cross the set , past the cameras shooting interviews , to the Furniture section , where Leigh and Leslie Keno , the famous appraiser twins , are holding court .
Collecting geek that he is , Dave read the Kenos ’ book ( Hidden Treasures , Searching for Masterpieces of American Furniture ) almost in one sitting .
He makes a beeline to the brothers , who look as suave and sophisticated in person as they do on TV .
He ca n’t tell them apart , but we soon figure out that Leslie is the one wearing glasses today and Leigh is n’t .
Anyway , Leigh is the one who seems to want to talk .
What does he like best about Antiques Roadshow ?
“ It ’s the people ” he says .
“ I ’m just hugging people all day , hearing their stories , I learn so much . ”
But what if a Duncan
Phyfe piece does n’t walk in the door , Dave asks him , or you do n’t get something from a famous Newport or Philadelphia shop ?
Is that a letdown ?
“ Not at all , ” says Leigh .
“ I love to see anything 18th century , Chippendale , Queen Anne , or even early painted furniture . ”
Leigh also keeps an eye on the folk art coming in , he says , having headed the Folk Art department at Christies .
Finally , Dave asks Leigh why his voice is so hoarse .
“ I was racing all day yesterday at Laguna Seca , ” Leigh says .
“ A Ferrari 512 BBLM . ”
Dave , scribbling all of this down , leaves out one of the Bs on his notepad .
Leigh notices and corrects him .
“ No , BBLM , ” he says .
“ You ’ve gotta get that right .
It makes a difference to the car guys . ”
It turns out Leigh himself is a vintage car guy .
His Ferrari is a 1980 .
“ It ’s like driving an artifact , ” he says .
“ It ’s a 12 - cylinder .
I ’m trying to preserve it while making it go really fast . ”
Leigh has been racing vintage cars for about 15 years , but it sounds like he and Leslie grew up around vintage vehicles .
They also judge the Prewar and Postwar Preservation categories at the Concours d’Elegance each year in Pebble Beach , California .
Great - Grampa ’s Five - Figure “ Find ”
Next Leigh introduces
Dave to a woman everyone ’s buzzing about .
Her 15 - year - old granddaughter , Kayla , is being taped for a segment on a box of Alaskan Eskimo ivory items they ’ve brought in .
We ’re told they were appraised in the mid-five figures ( you ’ll have to wait until the show airs for the final price ) , and the woman is beaming .
Maureen Brown is her name .
She was born in San Francisco ( “ of the Hallinans of San Francisco , ” she says ) and now lives in San Jose .
Her great - grandfather was on a “ schooner ship ” that sailed through the South Pacific and came back with the carvings .
Anthony Slayter - Ralph , the fine art specialist who did the appraisal , walks up to congratulate her .
“ Ivory that age just glows ” he tells Dave .
Eskimo jewelry from that era is stunning for its artistic quality , he adds , but it was always functional .
Intriguingly , three of the ivory pieces are not Alaskan .
Slayter - Ralph thinks great - grandfather must have picked them up in the Marquesas Islands .
One is a pendant with a bound slave figure .
He ’s not sure what its function was , but he thinks that “ if they were going to do a raid or do battle , they ’d put it on to send out power . ”
What will happen to the ivory figures ?
“ We ’ll keep them , ” says Brown .
“ They ’ve been in the family for many years . ”
But granddaughter Kayla is clearly thinking about the money .
“ I had no idea , ” she says .
“ I thought they were just little ivory tusks ! ”
Meanwhile , Leslie Keno is chatting with Jessica , Maribeth , and Ben in front of an Avery & Co. jockey scale , which , as it ’s name suggests , was used to weigh horse jockeys .
The walnut and original leather - upholstered piece dates from about 1895 , and a few moments earlier Leslie had taped a segment on it with the owner , who said he paid $ 1,500 for it .
“ I call this the chair of life or death , ” says Leslie , “ because back then , if you were overweight you would n’t get a job and you could n’t put food on the table for your family . ”
Leslie says jockeys would purge before being weighed so they ’d be under the required weight , and that he ’d never seen one before .
“ It ’s incredible that it has the weights surviving with it . ”
Leslie put its value at between $ 10,000 and $ 15,000 .
Leslie had been able to spend about an hour studying up on the piece before going on camera .
But as we talk about the weights , he realizes he may not have explained things completely during the shoot .
“ I think I need to explain counterbalance more clearly on the tape , ” he says , looking around for a producer .
“ I need to talk to the crew . ”
And then he disappears .
The Folk Art and Vintage Glass Tables
Now we ’re on to Folk Art , where we meet Mike Flanigan of J.M. Flanigan American Antiques and Allan Katz of Allan Katz Americana .
Have they seen anything interesting today ?
“ We got a nice over - the - shoulder on an 1813 watercolor , ” says Flanigan .
It was by Reverend Young , adds Katz , a “ really cool marriage certificate from Columbus Country , Pennsylvania .
It had been in this woman ’s family forever .
She said they could never read it because it was in German . ”
Or so the family thought .
“ But when we looked , it was actually all in English .
Strange and wonderful . ”
Over in Glass , appraiser Kathleen Bailey is in her element , giving appraisals one right after the other , no more than one or two minutes for each .
In one exchange with a guest who has brought in three glass boxes ( one large , two small ) , Bailey takes the time to give some personalized purchasing advice .
“ You ’re doing much better when you buy small , ” she smiles , “ so stay with the small . ”
Next comes a woman with a beautiful kerosene lamp .
It does n’t have a shade and has been delicately painted with light pinks and greens .
She places it on the table and , in an almost apologetic tone , explains that it has been altered .
“ It ’s okay , ” Bailey assures her .
“ Everyone wires them now so that they can use them . ”
Bailey says the lamp would have had a clear glass ball as a shade .
The woman seems to care much more about this practical information than the lamp ’s value .
We must , too , because we do n’t even bother to write the price down .
What ’s Waiting in Line ?
Having thoroughly surveyed the scene on the main set , we head back out to where the bulk of folks are waiting in line for their turn .
En Route , Ben stops in his tracks at a framed print by one of his favorite 1960s poster artists , Victor Moscoso .
Unlike the Avalon Ballroom posters that Moscoso is so famous for , this piece is wide ( perhaps four feet ) and narrow ( maybe only 12 inches tall ) .
It ’s in a frame , but the back of the matte has been cut to reveal the artist ’s signature on the back , along with his P.O. Box in Woodacre , California .
A guest named Bill , who owns the piece , tells Ben that Moscoso created it for use in a San Francisco cable car in 1969 .
That ’s where a guy he knows got it , and it came into Bill ’s possession via a complicated trade that involved a Triumph motorcycle .
It ’s a long story , but Ben remains focused on the piece , drinking in every detail on its black - and - white surface as he tells Bill how lucky he is to own such a unique piece by one of the so - called big - five artists of the 1960s San Francisco music scene .
“ You know more about it than they did , ” says Bill , who ’s clearly disappointed with the $ 2,000 to $ 3,000 appraisal he had received .
As we continue on our way , though , Ben confides that $ 2,000 to $ 3,000 sounds about right to him , too — in this case , our Collectors Weekly amateur has served as an unofficial corroborator for the Roadshow appraiser !
We also talk with a man who ’s just been through the Painting line .
He ’s holding his piece as a friend runs up .
“ So ?
What did they say ? ”
The friend is very excited .
“ They said it ’s a really nice reproduction , ” laughs the man .
Out in the main line , we pass a young couple , Claire and Josh , who are wheeling an early 1900s slot machine .
They know nothing about the machine , but have a pretty good story about where it came from .
“ My grandfather knew this cop , ” Claire says , “ who knew this guy , who knew this other guy who ’d been keeping this machine illegally for decades .
I think he paid him $ 50 for it .
It still works . ”
Claire remembers playing with it as a kid .
She honestly does n’t care what it ’s worth — she just wants to know its story .
Elsewhere , people are carrying bronze sculptures , rifles , and swords .
One person has brought in an upright piano .
Over here is a couple with a hatbox .
The woman says her mom sent her two hats to see what they ’re worth .
They ’re beautiful hats , probably from the 1920s , with feathers and “ I. Magnin & Co. ” labels .
Three other people catch our eye .
There ’s Adam , who bought his cast - iron lawn jockey at a flea market for $ 50 .
He ’s read they were originally given as gifts to people who supported the Underground Railroad .
He ’s here mostly to find out if that story is true .
Susan is nearby .
She has a child ’s record player called the Bing Crosby Junior Juke .
It plays 78s and lights up .
She ’d like to know what it ’s worth .
Then there ’s Carmine , who ’s brought in a Vinaccia mandolin that his father bought in Naples , Italy 101 years ago .
He shows us a photo of his dad as a younger man playing the instrument .
Is he here to gets its value , to learn the history of this lovely instrument , or both ?
The answer is both , as well as to share his own story of this storied instrument with someone who will truly appreciate it .
And that someone , in about one hour ’s time , is going to be one of the endlessly patient appraisers at Antiques Roadshow .
Epilogue : It ’s All True !
So that ’s it .
If you ’ve watched Antiques Roadshow for years , and wondered what it would be like to be there in person , its pretty exciting , but no huge surprises .
The appraisers are super friendly , and really do know their stuff and care about getting it right .
The people who ’ve brought in family treasures are having fun , filling in mysteries , smiling if they ’ve got a bonanza but okay even if they do n’t .
The show crew is a well - oiled machine , working hard to put on a class act .
And the items — wow , great stuff !
Next time Antiques Roadshow comes to your town , try to get a ticket and go .
It ’s a great way to spend a day !
How the financial markets work explained in a way that anyone can understand .

The true story of Christ , according to the Jehovah 's witnesses .
Believe , or perish !
Scientists today produced a detailed map of how climate change is expected to affect every part of the UK over the next century .
Experts from the Met Office used sophisticated computer models to build up a picture of how temperature and rainfall are likely to change across 600 different locations .
Announcing the results , the environment secretary , Hilary Benn , said global warming will affect " every aspect of our daily lives " .
The scientists say summer rainfall in south - east England could decrease by one - fifth by the 2050s .
Average mean temperatures were likely to rise by more than 2C across the UK .
If carbon emissions continue to rise , there is a 10 % chance that temperatures in the south - east could rise by 8C or more by the 2080s .
The results are aimed at industries and organisations that need to make long - term investment decisions that could be influenced by a changing climate .
They come as scientists urge politicians to focus on adapting to inevitable climate change alongside efforts to reduce greenhouse gas emissions .
The new predictions follow a similar exercise in 2002 , that produced maps of likely changes across Britain for the 2020s , 2050s and 2080s .
They showed the UK faced drier , warmer summers and wetter , milder winters .
Experts say the new results are more powerful , because they present the relative probabilities of a range of possible outcomes .
They cover three different possible futures , in which carbon emissions are low , medium or high .
Which path the world economy follows will depend heavily on how ambitious the global climate deal to be negotiated in Copenhagen in December turns out to be .
To produce the new predictions , the scientists ran 300 versions of their sophisticated climate computer model , and pooled the results to see which outcomes were most likely .
The results cannot be used to predict specific weather on future dates , but they indicate broad trends .
Andy Brown , climate change and environmental performance manager with Anglian Water , said the results would help the company plan key infrastructure such as reservoirs .
" The increased resolution and probabilities will help to give us more focus .
The decisions wo n't be based purely on climate change projections , but they are a factor . "
The breakdown into small regions , just 25 km across , will help too .
" Rainfall can be very localised so it will help us make plans to deal with events . "
Ahead of the publication of the results , green campaigners called for stronger action on emissions to avoid the damaging impacts the UK will face from climate change .
Friends of the Earth executive director Andy Atkins said : " This valuable new research will highlight the damaging impact that climate change will have around the UK and show the need for urgent action to cut emissions .
The UK government must take tougher action on climate change , and show real leadership by example ahead of crucial climate negotiations in Copenhagen in December . "
In Zul ' Drak the area called " Voltarus " in the western area of the zone has the big floating building with Drakuru inside it .
At the very end of the chain you end up MCing his zombie blight things and fighting him with them .
There are little areas to the sides of the four elite monsters , each containing three mobs called " blight geist .
"
If you attack the mobs while the event is going on , you are subject to a 1200 / tick dot which is all over the floor where the mobs spawn .
However , when the event is not in process , the damage does NOT occur , and the geists instantly respawn .
They 're level 74 - 75 and give full EXP per kill , and are subject to EXP gains due to Bind To Account gear .
At level 78 , I was gaining 1800 - 1950 exp per kill rested , with an instant respawn rate .
On an elemental shaman , I had zero down time and literally no time to even loot the corpses due to the ridiculous respawn rate ( although there is decent loot on each mob .
Greens , 15 - 25s per mob , drakkari offerings , cloth etc ) Here 's a picture of the EXP gains I had during the session :
We need to be close to other people as surely as we need food and water .
But while it 's relatively easy to get ourselves a good meal , it is difficult for many of us to create and maintain intimacy with others , particularly with a romantic partner .
There are many variables that affect the quality of our relationships with others ; it 's difficult to pin it on one thing or another .
But in this article , based on a symposium held at the 2000 American Psychological Association convention in Washington , D.C. , four mental health professionals discuss their ideas about how we sabotage our intimate relationships -- and what we can do to fix them .
Choose to Lose ?
Many factors influence the level of intimacy we enjoy in our relationships .
The various decisions we make , and our behavior toward one another , are what foster closeness or drives us apart .
These decisions are all under our control , although we are influenced by old patterns that we must work to change .
The first decision we make about a relationship is the partner we choose .
Whom we fall in love with determines the level of intimacy in our relationships , according to Ayala Malach Pines , Ph.D. , who heads the behavioral sciences in program at Ben-Gurion University in Israel .
We often choose partners who remind us of significant people from our -- often our parents -- and we set out to recreate the patterns of our childhood .
Let 's look at an example :
Tara met
Abe at a party .
She was instantly attracted to the tall , lean man with a faraway look in his eyes .
Abe , who had been standing alone , was delighted when Tara approached him with her open smile and outstretched hand .
She was not only beautiful , but she struck him as warm and nurturing as well .
The conversation between them flowed instantly .
It felt comfortable and easy .
Eventually , they fell in love , and after a year , they were married .
At first things were wonderful .
They had the kind of closeness Tara had always dreamed about with her father .
Though she was sure he loved her , she never felt she had her father completely to herself .
Even when he held her on his lap , he had a faraway look .
But with Abe things were different .
He was there with her completely .
The intimacy between them also felt terrific to Abe .
It was not the kind of suffocating closeness he always dreaded -- the kind of intrusive closeness he experienced as a child with his mother , who used to enter his room uninvited and arrange his personal belongings with no regard to his privacy .
But Tara was different .
She did not intrude .
But occasionally , Abe would come home from work tired and annoyed .
All he wanted was a drink and to sit with the paper until he could calm down and relax .
Seeing him that way , Tara would become concerned .
" What is going on ? " she would ask anxiously .
" Nothing , " he would answer .
Sure that there was something very wrong , and assuming that it must be something about her or their , Tara would insist that he tell her .
She reminded him of his mother , and he responded the way he did with his mother : by withdrawing .
To Tara , this felt similar to the way her father behaved .
She responded in the same way she did when her father withdrew : by clinging .
The struggle between them continued and became more and more intense over time , with Tara demanding more intimacy and Abe demanding more space .
Recreating the Family
Like Abe and Tara , people choose partners who help them recreate their childhood struggles .
Tara fell in love with a man with " a faraway look in his eyes , " and subsequently had to struggle for greater intimacy .
Abe fell in love with a woman who was " warm and nurturing , " then spent a lot of energy struggling for more space .
Tara 's unresolved intimacy issues complement Abe's .
For example , one partner ( often the woman ) will fight to break down defenses and create more intimacy while the other ( often the man ) will withdraw and create distance .
So the " dance of intimacy " follows :
If the woman gets too close , the man pulls back .
If he moves too far away , she pursues , and so on .
To achieve greater intimacy , the partners must overcome the that compels them to take their respective parts in that dance .
In the example , Tara needs to control her abandonment anxiety and not pursue
Abe when he withdraws , and Abe needs to control his engulfment anxiety when Tara pursues him and not withdraw .
Working to overcome these anxieties is an opportunity to resolve childhood issues and can be a major healing experience for both partners .
: The Road Back
If a couple can't overcome their anxieties and achieve a balance , however , and an inability to achieve intimacy will linger .
This can create a vulnerability to affairs , says Shirley P. Glass , Ph.D. , a clinical psychologist in private practice in Baltimore .
Either partner may feel from trying to get his or her emotional intimacy needs met in the relationship .
A pursuing woman , who wonders if her needs will ever be met , may withdraw out of hopelessness .
Yet her partner may think that the relationship has improved because the complaining has stopped .
Meanwhile , she could be supplementing her unmet intimacy needs through an extramarital relationship that could ultimately lead to separation or .
Once an affair has occurred , it only serves to erode intimacy further .
Intimacy requires honesty , and self - disclosure .
The that accompanies an affair makes this impossible .
In addition , if the affair partner becomes the confidante for problems in the marriage , it can be threatening to the marriage because it creates a bond of between the affair partners that goes beyond .
For trust to be rebuilt and intimacy reestablished , the walls of deception created by the affair need to be broken down .
The spouse needs to be back on the " inside " of the partnership and the extramarital partner on the " outside . "
The involved spouse must stop all personal exchanges with the affair partner and disclose to the marital partner any unavoidable encounters with the affair partner , without prompting .
Unfaithful partners can only regain credibility by being completely honest .
People report that they recover from their partner having a sexual relationship with another person before they recover from being deceived .
But if both partners can be totally honest , and if communication in the partnership improves , there is a good chance that the marriage can survive the infidelity and the relationship can become strong again .
Overcoming Fear of Intimacy
It is our fear of intimacy that inspires these ingenious ways of avoiding it .
This raises the question :
How can we overcome our fear of intimacy ?
We can start by breaking down our defenses .
We all bring defenses to relationships , and , unfortunately , it is often these defenses that spell trouble .
We develop our defenses and negative beliefs in childhood .
They are what we utilized to protect ourselves against emotional pain and , later , against anxiety about death .
A core defense that often leads to the downfall of a partnership is " the bond , " according to Lisa Firestone , Ph.D. , adjunct faculty at the University of California Santa Barbara Graduate School of , and Joyce Catlett , M.A. , co-author of Fear of Intimacy , published recently by the American Psychological Association .
The fantasy bond is an illusion of a connection to another person .
It develops first with the mother or primary parent figure , and people often try to recreate it in their adult relationships .
People use various techniques to reestablish this primary relationship .
They may first select a partner who fits their model , someone they can relate to in the way they related to their parent or other family member .
They can distort their partner and perceive them as being more like this significant person than they are .
Third , if all else fails , they tend to provoke their partner ' into the behavior they seek .
All of these mechanisms curtail their ability to relate and make it less likely that people will be successful in achieving true intimacy in their relationships .
A secondary defense that helps preserve the fantasy bond is , according to Firestone and Catlett , " the voice . "
All people tend to carry on some form of internal dialogue within themselves as though another person were talking to them : reprimanding them , denouncing them , divulging negative information about others , and so on .
In intimate relationships , both individuals may be listening to the dictates of their respective voices .
Unfortunately , these only create more defensiveness .
Both partners may use rationalizations promoted by " the voice " to ward off loving responses from the other and justify their distancing behavior .
Speak Up , Therapeutically
A technique developed by Robert Firestone , Ph.D. , and used to reverse this process and allow greater intimacy is voice therapy .
Voice therapy brings these internalized negative thoughts to consciousness .
The goal of voice therapy with couples is to help each individual identify the " voice attacks " that are creating conflict and distance in the relationship .
In identifying specific self - criticisms as well as judgmental , hostile thoughts about the other , each partner is able to relate more openly .
Here is an example of someone using voice therapy .
Sheryl is in a four - year relationship and was starting to have problems .
She and her partner Mark came to therapy for help , and they progressed through these four steps of voice therapy over the course of treatment .
Following is a glimpse into Sheryl 's process .
Formulate the problem each individual perceives is limiting his or her satisfaction within the relationship .
Sheryl :
The feeling I have is that I 've always liked Mark , but lately I feel like I can't stand it when he 's nice to me .
I feel like I have a mean streak .
Therapist :
In response to his liking you .
Sheryl : Yes .
Verbalize self - critical thoughts and negative perceptions of the other in the form of the voice , and let go of the feelings associated with them .
Therapist :
What are you telling yourself about the relationship ?
Sheryl :
It 's like , ' Do n't show him anything , do n't show him you like him . '
I tell myself , ' Just do n't show it , you 're such a sucker if you show it . '
When he 's vulnerable I just want to squash him .
And it 's for no reason except for he 's being sweet .
Develop insight into the origins of the voice and make connections between past experience and present conflicts .
Sheryl : I 've seen myself be like my mother millions of times .
In previous relationships I 've acted so much like her , I did n't even know it .
I saw her as being a really critical person , she was very critical of my father .
And she would be mean to him .
Sometimes I act like that myself .
Alter behaviors and communications in a direction that counteracts the dictates of the voice .
Therapist :
So the hope is for you to hang in there and to tolerate the anxiety of giving up these defenses and the fantasized connection you have with your mother .
If you do sweat it out then you 'll be able to have more in your life .
It takes a lot of courage to go through that process but it 's really worth it .
Sheryl : I feel like it would make me sad , too , because I would feel a lot .
When I have that other point of view , I feel big and mean .
And when I just let things be , and do n't act in ways to push Mark away , I feel like a soft , sweet person .
After trying voice therapy , Sheryl reported that she felt closer to Mark .
She noticed a shift in her feelings , both in accepting his caring about her and genuinely caring about him .
In therapy sessions , both partners reveal negative thoughts and attitudes toward himself or herself and each other .
In this way , they share each other 's individual .
In tracing back the source of their self - attacks and cynical views to early family interactions , they gain perspective on each other 's problems and feel more compassion for their mates as well as themselves .
Changing old patterns often brings up anxiety , so part of the treatment is to learn to tolerate the anxiety and work through it , so the partners can maintain the and ultimately increase intimacy .
Homework
For couples who are not in therapy , there are many ways to change destructive patterns that prevent intimacy .
Partners could become aware of the times when they attack themselves or think negatively about their partner .
They could record their self - critical thoughts and hostile attitudes in a journal ; they could reveal the contents of their destructive thoughts to a trusted friend or to their mate .
They could assess how close to reality these thoughts are ( usually not very ) .
Each could set for what he or she wants out of the relationship and then keep track of how closely his or her actions match these goals .
Another good idea for couples is to make an active effort to move away from isolated couple interaction and toward an extended circle of family and friends .
This often affords a better perspective and provides a potential background for understanding and breaking destructive , habitual patterns of relating .
Partners need to admit to themselves and their partner if they have become distant , and that their actions are no longer loving or respectful .
By reawakening their feeling for one another , they can achieve a higher level of intimacy .
We always have choices to make about intimacy -- from the partners we choose to the way we interact with them each day .
Recognizing our patterns , tolerating our anxieties , and working together on our relationships will help us overcome our fear of intimacy .
Learning how best to communicate with each other and treat one another will help us enjoy loving , lasting relationships .
The View
People have conflicting views and beliefs about relationships .
Here are a few common ones :
1. Relationships are important and central in affecting a person 's life .
2. Relationships are generally unstable .
Young people marrying for the first time face a 40 % to 50 % chance of divorce .
3 . There is a good deal of dishonesty in relationships .
People are duplicitous in many ways : sexually , emotionally , etc .
4. Relationships are often based on emotional hunger and desperation .
People mistake longing and desperation for love .
5 . Few long - term relationships are based on high - level choices .
Often people " take what they can get . "
6. Choices can be made for negative as well as positive reasons .
For example , people have a tendency to select mates who are similar to a parent , which can be good or bad .
7. People confuse sex with love .
During the early phase of a relationship , and pleasure in sex are often mistaken for love .
8 . People feel they are failures unless they succeed in finding mates .
The Ideal and Not So Ideal
Interactions in an ideal and healthy relationship :
1. Nondefensiveness and openness
2. Honesty and integrity
3. Respect for the other 's boundaries , priorities and goals , separate from self
4. Physical affection and responsive sexuality
5. Understanding -- lack of distortion of the other
6. Noncontrolling , nonmanipulative and nonthreatening behavior
( Source : Fear of Intimacy , 1999 )
Interactions in an unhealthy relationship :
1. Angry and negative reactions to feedback ; being closed to new experiences
2. Deception and duplicity
3. Overstepping boundaries -- other seen only in relation to self
4. Lack of affection , inadequate or impersonal , routine sexuality
5. Misunderstanding -- distortion of the other
6. Manipulations of dominance and submission

The tech press is full of people who want to tell you how completely awesome life is going to be when everything moves to " the cloud " – that is , when all your important storage , processing and other needs are handled by vast , professionally managed data - centres .
Here 's something you wo n't see mentioned , though : the main attraction of the cloud to investors and entrepreneurs is the idea of making money from you , on a recurring , perpetual basis , for something you currently get for a flat rate or for free without having to give up the money or privacy that cloud companies hope to leverage into fortunes .
Since the rise of the commercial , civilian internet , investors have dreamed of a return to the high - profitability monopoly telecoms world that the hyper - competitive net annihilated .
Investors loved its pay - per- minute model , a model that charged extra for every single " service , " including trivialities such as Caller ID – remember when you had to pay extra to find out who was calling you ?
Imagine if your ISP tried to charge you for seeing the " FROM " line on your emails before you opened them !
Minitel , AOL , MSN — these all shared the model , and had an iPhone - like monopoly over who could provide services on their networks , and what those service - providers would have to pay to supply these services to you , the user .
But with the rise of the net – the public internet , on which anyone could create a new service , protocol or application – there was always someone ready to eat into this profitable little conspiracy .
The first online services charged you for every email you sent or received .
The next generation kicked their asses by offering email flat - rate .
Bit by bit , the competition killed the meter running on your network session , the meter that turned over every time you clicked the mouse .
Cloud services can reverse that , at least in part .
Rather than buying a hard - drive once and paying nothing – apart from the electricity bill – to run it , you can buy cloud storage and pay for those sectors every month .
Rather than buying a high - powered CPU and computing on that , you can move your computing needs to the cloud and pay for every cycle you eat .
Now , this makes sense for some limited applications .
If you 're supplying a service to the public , having a cloud 's worth of on - demand storage and hosting is great news .
Many companies , such as Twitter , have found that it 's more cost - effective to buy barrel - loads of storage , bandwidth and computation from distant hosting companies than it would be to buy their own servers and racks at a data - centre .
And if you 're doing supercomputing applications , then tapping into the high - performance computing grid run by the world 's physics centres is a good trick .
But for the average punter , cloud computing is – to say the least – oversold .
Network access remains slower , more expensive , and less reliable than hard drives and CPUs .
Your access to the net grows more and more fraught each day , as entertainment companies , spyware creeps , botnet crooks , snooping coppers and shameless bosses arrogate to themselves the right to spy on , tamper with or terminate your access to the net .
Alas , this situation is n't likely to change any time soon .
Going into the hard - drive business or the computer business is n't cheap by any means – even with a " cloud " of Chinese manufacturers who'll build to your spec – but it 's vastly cheaper than it is to start an ISP .
Running a wire into the cellar of every house in an entire nation is a big job , and that 's why you 're lucky if your local market sports two or three competing ISPs , and why you can buy 30 kinds of hard drive on Amazon .
It 's inconceivable to me that network access will ever overtake CPU or hard - drive for cost , reliability and performance .
Today , you can buy a terabyte of storage for £ 57 .
Unless you 're recording hundreds of hours ' worth of telly , you'd be hard - pressed to fill such a drive .
Likewise , you can buy a no - name quad - core PC with the aforementioned terabyte disc for £ 348 .
This machine will compute all the spreadsheets you ever need to tot up without breaking a sweat .
It 's easy to think of some extremely specialised collaborative environments that benefit from cloud computing – we used a Google spreadsheet to plan our wedding list and a Google calendar to coordinate with my parents in Canada – but if you were designing these applications to provide maximum utility for their users ( instead of maximum business - model for their developers ) , they 'd just be a place where encrypted bits of state information was held for periodic access by powerful PCs that did the bulk of their calculations locally .
That 's how I use Amazon 's S3 cloud storage : not as an unreliable and slow hard drive , but as a store for encrypted backups of my critical files , which are written to S3 using the JungleDisk tool .
This is cheaper and better than anything I could do for myself by way of offsite secure backup , but I 'm not going to be working off S3 any time soon .

DevOps , Continuous Delivery & Database Lifecycle Management
Continuous Integration
Programming in SQL can be both a fun and a challenging task .
Those with a background in traditional programming languages such as Java , C , C++ , and VB often find it difficult to adapt to the “ set - based ” mindset .
Even seasoned SQL developers and DBAs can get trapped in one of the many pitfalls of the SQL language .
I have been there and I ’m willing to bet that you have too .
Mastering the fundamentals takes time , and even then some mistakes are hard to spot .
My intention with this article was to highlight some of the more common mistakes that I ’ve seen people make when coding SQL .
The list reflects my direct experience working with different development teams and developers , performing code review sessions , and so on , as well as the issues I see every day on the newsgroups and forums .
The list of common mistakes is far from exhaustive , and is presented in no particular order of severity .
In fact , the list could be regarded as the result of the following query :
1 2 3 SELECT TOP ( 10 ) mistake FROM CommonSQLProgramming
Mistakes ORDER BY CHECKSUM ( NEWID ( ) ) ;
Without further ado , here is the list :
NULLs and the NOT IN predicate Functions on indexed columns in predicates Incorrect subquery column Data type mismatch in predicates Predicate evaluation order Outer joins and placement of predicates Subqueries that return more than one value Use of SELECT * Scalar user - defined functions Overuse of cursors
The examples are presented using SQL Server ’s Transact - SQL dialect , but most of the concepts are valid in any SQL implementation .
NULLs and the NOT IN predicate
One of the most common requests is to retrieve data based on some column value not included in a list of values .
The following two tables illustrate the scenario .
We have tables with colors and products :
Colors table :
1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 color
----------
Black Blue Green Red Products table : sku product_description color ----
--------------------
------ 1 Ball Red 2 Bike Blue 3 Tent NULL
Note that these tables do not represent a perfect design , following normalization rules and best practices .
Rather , it is a simplified scenario to help illustrate this example better .
In reality , the colors table would most likely contain a color code key column that would be referenced in the products table .
The request is to select a list of colors that have not previously been used on products .
In other words , we need to construct a query that returns only those colors for which there is no product with that color .
It might seem , at first glance , that the NOT IN predicate provides a very intuitive way to satisfy this request , very close to how the problem would be stated in plain English :
1 2 3 4 SELECT C . color FROM Colors AS C WHERE C . color NOT IN ( SELECT P . color FROM Products AS P ) ;
You may have been expecting this query to return two rows ( for ‘ black ’ and ‘ green ’ ) but , in fact , it returns an empty result set :
1 2 3 4 color ---------- ( 0 row ( s ) affected )
Obviously this is ‘ incorrect ’ .
What is the problem ?
It ’s simply that SQL uses three - valued logic , driven by the existence of NULL , which is not a value but a marker to indicate missing ( or UNKNOWN ) information .
When the NOT operator is applied to the list of values from the subquery , in the IN predicate , it is translated like this :
1 " color NOT IN ( Red , Blue , NULL ) "
This is equivalent to :
1 " NOT ( color = Red OR color = Blue OR color = NULL ) "
The expression “ color=NULL ” evaluates to UNKNOWN and , according to the rules of three - valued logic , NOT UNKNOWN also evaluates to UNKNOWN .
As a result , all rows are filtered out and the query returns an empty set .
This mistake will often surface if requirements change , and a non-nullable column is altered to allow NULLs .
It also highlights the need for thorough testing .
Even if , in the initial design , a column disallows NULLs , you should make sure your queries continue to work correctly with NULLs .
One solution is to use the EXISTS predicate in place of IN , since EXISTS uses two - valued predicate logic evaluating to TRUE / FALSE :
1 2 3 4 5 SELECT C . color FROM Colors AS C WHERE NOT EXISTS ( SELECT * FROM Products AS P WHERE C . color = P . color ) ;
This query correctly returns the expected result set :
1 2 3 4 color ----------
Black Green
Other possible solutions are as follows :
1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 /* IS NOT NULL in the subquery */ SELECT C . color FROM Colors AS C WHERE C . color NOT IN ( SELECT P . color FROM Products AS P WHERE P . color IS NOT NULL ) ; /* EXCEPT */ SELECT color FROM Colors EXCEPT SELECT color FROM Products ; /* LEFT OUTER JOIN */ SELECT C . color FROM Colors AS C LEFT OUTER JOIN Products AS P ON C . color = P . color WHERE P . color IS NULL ;
While all solutions produce the desired results , using EXCEPT may be the easiest to understand and use .
Note that the EXCEPT operator returns distinct values , which works fine in our scenario but may not be correct in another situation .
Functions on indexed columns in predicates
We often tend to write code as a direct translation of given request .
For example , if we are asked to retrieve all customers whose name starts with the letter L , it feels very natural to write the query like this , using the LEFT function to return the first character of their name :
1 2 3 SELECT customer_name FROM Customers WHERE LEFT ( customer_name , 1 ) = ' L ' ;
Alternatively , if we are asked to calculate the total sales for January 2009 , we might write a query like the following , which uses the DATEPART function to extract the relevant month and year from the sale_date column :
1 2 3 4 SELECT SUM ( sale_amount ) AS total_sales FROM Sales WHERE DATEPART ( YEAR , sale_date ) = 2009 AND DATEPART ( MONTH , sale_date ) = 1 ;
While these queries look very intuitive , you will find that the indexes that you ( of course ! ) have on your customer_name and sale_date columns remain unused , and that the execution plan for these queries reveal index scans .
The problem arises from the fact that the index columns are being passed to a function , which the query engine must then evaluate for every single row in the table .
In cases such as these , the WHERE clause predicate is deemed “ non- SARGable ” and the best that the query optimizer can do is perform a full index or table scan .
To make sure the indexes get used , we need to avoid the use of functions on the indexed columns .
In our two examples , it is a relatively simple task to rewrite the queries to use SARG - able predicates .
The first requested can be expressed with this logically equivalent query :
1 2 3 SELECT customer_name FROM Customers WHERE customer_name LIKE 'L % ' ;
The equivalent for the second query is as follows :
1 2 3 4 SELECT SUM ( sale_amount ) AS total_sales FROM Sales WHERE sale_date >= ' 20090101 ' AND sale_date < ' 20090201 ' ;
These two queries are most likely to utilize index seek to retrieve the data quickly and efficiently .
It ’s worth noting that SQL Server is getting “ smarter ” as it evolves .
For example , consider the following query , which uses the CAST function on the indexed sale_date column :
1 2 3 SELECT SUM ( sale_amount ) AS total_sales FROM Sales WHERE CAST ( sale_date AS DATE ) = ' 20090101 ' ;
If you run this query on SQL 2005 or earlier , you ’ll see an index scan .
However , on SQL Server 2008 you ’ll see an index seek , despite the use of the CAST function .
The execution plan reveals that the predicate is transformed into something like the following :
1 2 3 4 SELECT SUM ( sale_amount ) AS total_sales FROM Sales WHERE sale_date >= ' 20090101 ' AND sale_date < ' 20090102 ' ;
However , in general , you should use SARGable predicates where possible , rather than rely on the evolving intelligence of the optimizer .
Incorrect subquery column
When writing a subquery , it is very easy to abstract yourself from the main query logic and concentrate on the subquery itself .
This can lead to the innocent mistake of substituting a column from the subquery source table for a column with similar name from the main query .
Let ’s look at two very simple tables ; one is a Sales table containing sales data , and the other is an auxiliary Calendar table that has all calendar dates and holidays ( abbreviated here ) :
Sales table :
1 2 3 4 5 6 sale_date sale_amount
----------
-----------
2009 - 01 - 01 120.50 2009 - 01 - 02 115.00 2009 - 01 - 03 140.80 2009 - 01 - 04 100.50
Calendar table :
1 2 3 4 5 6 7 calendar_date holiday_name
-------------
----------------
2009 - 01 - 01 New Year ' s Day 2009 - 01 - 02 NULL 2009 - 01 - 03 NULL 2009 - 01 - 04 NULL 2009 - 01 - 05 NULL
Our task is to retrieve sales data for holiday dates only .
It seems like a trivial query to write :
1 2 3 4 5 SELECT sale_date , sale_amount FROM Sales AS S WHERE sale_date IN ( SELECT sale_date FROM Calendar AS C WHERE holiday_name IS NOT NULL ) ;
However , you ’ll find that query simply returns all rows from the Sales table !
A closer look at the query reveals that the culprit to be the SELECT list of the subquery .
It accidentally references the sales_date column from the Sales table , instead of the calendar_date column from the Calendar table .
If that is the case , why did we not get an error ?
Although the outcome was not what we expected , this is still a valid SQL statement .
When using a subquery , the outer query ’s columns are exposed to the inner query .
Here , we unintentionally converted the self - contained subquery , to be executed once and the value passed to the outer query , to a correlated subquery , logically executed once for every row returned by the outer query .
As a result , the subquery evaluates to sale_date IN ( sale_date ) which is always true , as long as there is at least one holiday date in the Calendar table , and so our result set returns all rows from the Sales table .
Of course , the fix is easy in this case ; we simply use the correct date column from the Calendar table :
1 2 3 4 5 SELECT sale_date , sale_amount FROM Sales AS S WHERE sale_date IN ( SELECT C .
calendar_date FROM Calendar AS C WHERE C . holiday_name IS NOT NULL ) ;
This illustrates another important point : it is a best practice to prefix columns in subqueries with table aliases .
For example , if we had used an alias like this :
1 2 3 4 5 SELECT sale_date , sale_amount FROM Sales AS S WHERE sale_date IN ( SELECT C . sale_date FROM Calendar AS C WHERE holiday_name IS NOT NULL ) ;
Then this query would have resulted in an error – “ Error : Invalid column name ‘ sale_date ' ” .
Data type mismatch in predicates
This is another typical mistake that is sometimes hard to catch .
It is very easy to mismatch data types in predicates .
It could be in a stored procedure where the parameter is passed as one data type and then used in a query to filter data on a column of different data type .
Another example is joining tables on columns with different data types , or simply using a predicate where data types are mismatched .
For example , we may have a Customers table where the last_name column is of type VARCHAR :
1 2 3 4 CREATE TABLE Customers ( customer_nbr INT NOT NULL PRIMARY KEY , first_name VARCHAR ( 35 ) NOT NULL , last_name VARCHAR ( 35 ) NOT NULL ) ;
Then the following stored procedure is used to retrieve the customer information by customer last name :
1 2 3 4 5 6 CREATE PROCEDURE GetCustomerByLastName @ last_name NVARCHAR ( 35 ) AS SELECT first_name , last_name FROM Customers WHERE last_name = @ last_name ;
Notice here the parameter @last_name is of data type NVARCHAR .
Although the code “ works ” , SQL Server will have to perform implicit conversion of the last name column to NVARCHAR , because NVARCHAR is of higher data precedence .
This can result in a performance penalty .
The implicit conversion is visible in the query plan as CONVERT_IMPLICIT .
Based on collation , and other factors , a data type mismatch may also preclude the use of an index seek .
Use of the correct data type resolves the problem :
1 2 3 4 5 6 CREATE PROCEDURE GetCustomerByLastName @ last_name VARCHAR ( 35 ) AS SELECT first_name , last_name FROM Customers WHERE last_name = @ last_name ;
In many cases , this mistake is the result of splitting responsibilities on the team , and having one team member design the tables and another implement stored procedures or code .
Another reason could be using different data sources to join data where the join columns have different data types in the source systems .
The same advice applies not only to character data type mismatches , but also to mismatches between numeric data types ( like INT and FLOAT ) , or the mixing of numeric and character data types .
Predicate evaluation order
If you are familiar with the logical query processing order , then you may expect that a query is executed in the following order :
FROM WHERE GROUP BY HAVING SELECT
The sequence above outlines the logical order for executing query .
Logically the FROM clause is processed first defining the source data set , next the WHERE predicates are applied , followed by GROUP BY , and so on .
However , physically , the query is processed differently and the query optimizer is free to move expressions in the query plan in order to produce the most cost efficient plan for retrieving the data .
This leads to a common misunderstanding that a filter in the WHERE clause is applied before the next phases are processed .
In fact , a predicate can be applied much later in the physical execution plan .
Also , there is no left to right order for execution of predicates .
For example , if you have a WHERE clause containing “ WHERE x=1 AND y=2 “ , there is no guarantee that “ x=1 ” will be evaluated first .
They can be executed in any order .
For example , consider the following Accounts table where , in the account_reference column , Business accounts are denoted by a numeric reference and Personal accounts by a character reference :
1 2 3 4 5 6 account_nbr account_type account_reference
-----------
--------------- -----------------
1 Personal abc 2 Business Basic 101 3 Personal def 4 Business Plus 5
In general , this table indicates bad design .
The account_reference column should be represented as two different attributes , specific to business and personal accounts and each with the correct data type ( not even belonging to the same table ) .
However , in practice , we very often have to deal with systems designed with shortcomings , where altering the design is not an option .
Given the above scenario , a valid request is to retrieve all business type accounts with an account reference that is greater than 20 ( assuming account reference has some meaningful numeric value for business type accounts ) .
The query may look like this :
1 2 3 4 SELECT account_nbr , account_reference AS account_ref_nbr FROM Accounts WHERE account_type LIKE ' Business % ' AND CAST ( account_reference AS INT ) > 20 ;
However , the query results in error :
1 " Conversion failed when converting the varchar value ' abc ' to data type int "
The query fails because , as noted earlier , there is no prescribed order for executing predicates and nothing guarantees that the predicate “ account_type LIKE ‘ Business % ’ ” will be evaluated before the predicate “ CAST ( account_reference AS INT ) > 20 “ .
In our case , the second predicate is evaluated first resulting in a conversion error , due to the incompatible values in the account_reference column , for personal accounts .
One attempt to resolve this issue might be to use a derived table ( or common table expression ) to filter the business type accounts first , and then apply the predicate for account_reference column :
1 2 3 4 5 6 SELECT account_nbr , account_ref_nbr FROM ( SELECT account_nbr , CAST ( account_reference AS INT ) AS account_ref_nbr FROM Accounts WHERE account_type LIKE ' Business % ' ) AS A WHERE account_ref_nbr > 20 ;
However , this results in the exact same error because derived tables and CTEs are expanded in the query plan and a single query plan is produced , where predicates can again be pushed up or down in the plan .
As indicated earlier , the problem here is a mix of bad design and misunderstanding of how SQL Server performs physical query execution .
What is the solution ?
The best solution is to design the table correctly and avoid storing mixed data in a single column .
In this case , a work around is to use a CASE expression to guarantee that only valid numeric values will be converted to INT data type :
1 2 3 4 5 6 SELECT account_nbr , account_reference AS account_ref_nbr FROM Accounts WHERE account_type LIKE ' Business % ' AND CASE WHEN account_reference NOT LIKE ' % [ ^ 0 - 9 ] % '
THEN CAST ( account_reference AS INT ) END > 20 ;
The CASE expression uses a LIKE pattern to check for valid numeric values ( a double negation logic is used which can be translated as “ there is not a single character that is not a digit ” ) , and only for those values performs the CAST .
For the rest of the values the CASE expression results in NULL , which is filtered out because NULL is not matched with any value ( even with NULL ) .
Outer joins and placement of predicates
Outer joins are such a great tool but are also much misunderstood and abused .
Some people seem to like them so much that they throw one into almost every query , regardless of whether or not it is needed !
The key to correct use of outer joins is an understanding of the logical steps required to process an outer join in a query .
Here are the relevant steps from the query processing phases :
A cross join ( Cartesian product ) is formed for the two input tables in the FROM clause .
The result of the Cartesian product is every possible combination of a row from the first table and a row from the second table .
The ON clause predicates are applied filtering only rows satisfying the predicate logic .
Any Outer rows filtered out by the predicates in step 2 are added back .
Rows from the preserved table are added with their actual attribute values ( column values ) , and the attributes ( columns ) from the non preserved table are set to NULL .
The WHERE clause predicates are applied .
An outer join query can produce completely different results depending on how you write it , and where predicates are placed in that query .
Let ’s look at one example , based on the following two tables , Customers and Orders :
Customers table :
1 2 3 4 5 6 customer_nbr customer_name
------------
-------------- 1 Jim Brown 2 Jeff Gordon 3 Peter Green 4 Julie Peters
Orders table :
1 2 3 4 5 6 7 order_nbr order_date customer_nbr order_amt -----------
---------- ------------ ---------- 1 2008 - 10 - 01 1 15.50 2 2008 - 12 - 15 2 25.00 3 2009 - 01 - 02 1 18.00 4 2009 - 02 - 20 3 10.25 5 2009 - 03 - 05 1 30.00
Our task is to retrieve a list of all customers , and the total amount they have spent on orders , since the beginning of year 2009 .
Instinctively , one may write the following query :
1 2 3 4 5 6 SELECT C . customer_name , SUM ( COALESCE ( O . order_amt , 0 ) ) AS total_2009 FROM Customers AS C LEFT OUTER JOIN Orders AS O ON C . customer_nbr = O . customer_nbr WHERE O . order_date >= ' 20090101 ' GROUP BY C . customer_name ;
But the results do not look good :
1 2 3 4 customer_name total_2009 --------------
------------
Jim Brown 48.00 Peter Green 10.25
Customers Jeff and Julie are missing from the result set .
Where is the problem ?
In order to understand what went wrong , let ’s play back this query one step at a time following the logical processing order .
The first step is a cross join between the two input tables :
1 2 3 SELECT C . customer_name , O . order_amt FROM Customers AS C CROSS JOIN Orders AS O ;
This results in every possible combination of rows from both input tables :
1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 customer_name order_amt order_date ---------------- ---------- ----------
Jim Brown 15.50 2008 - 10 - 01 Jim Brown 25.00 2008 - 12 - 15 Jim Brown 18.00 2009 - 01 - 02 Jim Brown 10.25 2009 - 02 - 20 Jim Brown 30.00 2009 - 03 - 05 Jeff Gordon 15.50 2008 - 10 - 01 Jeff Gordon 25.00 2008 - 12 - 15 Jeff Gordon 18.00 2009 - 01 - 02 Jeff Gordon 10.25 2009 - 02 - 20 Jeff Gordon 30.00 2009 - 03 - 05 Peter Green 15.50 2008 - 10 - 01 Peter Green 25.00 2008 - 12 - 15 Peter Green 18.00 2009 - 01 - 02 Peter Green 10.25 2009 - 02 - 20 Peter Green 30.00 2009 - 03 - 05 Julie Peters 15.50 2008 - 10 - 01 Julie Peters 25.00 2008 - 12 - 15 Julie Peters 18.00 2009 - 01 - 02 Julie Peters 10.25 2009 - 02 - 20 Julie Peters 30.00 2009 - 03 - 05
The next step is applying the ON predicates of the JOIN clause :
1 2 3 4 SELECT C . customer_name , O . order_amt , O . order_date FROM Customers AS C INNER JOIN Orders AS O ON C . customer_nbr = O . customer_nbr ;
The result of this query includes only customers with orders .
Since customer Julie does not have any orders it is excluded from the result set :
1 2 3 4 5 6 7 customer_name order_amt order_date --------------
---------- ----------
Jim Brown 15.50 2008 - 10 - 01 Jeff Gordon 25.00 2008 - 12 - 15 Jim Brown 18.00 2009 - 01 - 02 Peter Green 10.25 2009 - 02 - 20 Jim Brown 30.00 2009 - 03 - 05
The third step of the logical processing order is adding back the outer rows .
These rows were excluded in the prior step because they did not satisfy the join predicates .
1 2 3 4 SELECT C . customer_name , O . order_amt , O . order_date FROM Customers AS C LEFT OUTER JOIN Orders AS O ON C . customer_nbr = O . customer_nbr ;
Now customer Julie is added back in the result set .
Notice the added outer rows from the preserved table ( Customers ) have values for the selected attributes ( customer_name ) and the non-preserved table ( Orders ) rows have NULL for their attributes ( order_amt and order_date ) :
1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 customer_name order_amt order_date --------------
---------- ----------
Jim Brown 15.50 2008 - 10 - 01 Jim Brown 18.00 2009 - 01 - 02 Jim Brown 30.00 2009 - 03 - 05 Jeff Gordon 25.00 2008 - 12 - 15 Peter Green 10.25 2009 - 02 - 20 Julie Peters NULL NULL
The last step is applying the WHERE clause predicates :
1 2 3 4 5 SELECT C . customer_name , O . order_amt , O . order_date FROM Customers AS C LEFT OUTER JOIN Orders AS O ON C . customer_nbr = O . customer_nbr WHERE O . order_date >= ' 20090101 ' ;
Now the picture is clear !
The culprit is the WHERE clause predicate .
Customer Jeff is filtered out from the result set because he does not have orders past January 1 , 2009 , and customer Julie is filtered out because she has no orders at all ( since the outer row added for Julie has NULL for the order_date column ) .
In effect , in this case , the predicate in the WHERE clause turns the outer join into an inner join .
To correct our initial query , it is sufficient to move the WHERE predicate into the join condition .
1 2 3 4 5 6 SELECT C . customer_name , SUM ( COALESCE ( O . order_amt , 0 ) ) AS total_2009 FROM Customers AS C LEFT OUTER JOIN Orders AS O ON C . customer_nbr = O . customer_nbr AND O . order_date >= ' 20090101 ' GROUP BY C . customer_name ;
Now , the query returns correct results because Jeff and Julie are filtered out in the join predicates , but then added back when the outer rows are added .
1 2 3 4 5 6 customer_name total_2009 --------------
------------
Jeff Gordon 0.00 Jim Brown 48.00 Julie Peters 0.00 Peter Green 10.25
In a more complex example , with multiple joins , the incorrect filtering may happen on a subsequent table operator ( like join to another table ) instead in the WHERE clause .
For example , say we have an OrderDetails table containing product SKU and quantity , and the request is to retrieve a list of all customers , with order amount and quantity , for selected product SKUs .
The following query may seem correct :
1 2 3 4 5 6 7 SELECT C . customer_name , O . order_amt , D . qty FROM Customers AS C LEFT OUTER JOIN Orders AS O ON C . customer_nbr = O . customer_nbr INNER JOIN OrderDetails AS D ON D . order_nbr = O . order_nbr AND D . sku = 101 ;
However , here the INNER join with the OrderDetails table plays the exact same role as the predicate in the WHERE clause in our previous example , in effect turning the LEFT OUTER join to INNER join .
The correct query to satisfy this request needs to use a LEFT OUTER join to join to the OrderDetails table :
1 2 3 4 5 6 7 SELECT C . customer_name , O . order_amt , D . qty FROM Customers AS C LEFT OUTER JOIN Orders AS O ON C . customer_nbr = O . customer_nbr LEFT JOIN OrderDetails AS D ON D . order_nbr = O . order_nbr AND D . sku = 101 ;
Subqueries that return more than one value
A very frequent request is to retrieve a value based on some correlation with the main query table .
For example , consider the following two tables , storing details of products and the plants that manufacture these products :
Products table :
1 2 3 4 5 sku product_description
-----
------------------
1 Bike 2 Ball 3 Phone
ProductPlants table :
1 2 3 4 5 sku plant_nbr -----
----------- 1 1 2 1 3 2
The request is to extract the manufacturing plant for each product .
One way to satisfy the request is to write the following query using correlated subquery to retrieve the plant :
1 2 3 4 5 SELECT sku , product_description , ( SELECT plant_nbr FROM ProductPlants AS B WHERE B . sku = A . sku ) AS plant_nbr FROM Products AS A ;
Note that the point here is to illustrate a technique ; there could be a more efficient way to accomplish the same task .
However , all works fine and we get the correct result set :
1 2 3 4 5 sku product_description plant_nbr ----
------------------- -----------
1 Bike 1 2 Ball 1 3 Phone 2
The query will continue to work happily until the day arrives that the company decides to start manufacturing Balls at plant 3 , to cope with increasing demand .
The ProductPlants table now looks like this :
1 2 3 4 5 6 sku plant_nbr -----
----------- 1 1 2 1 2 3 3 2
All of a sudden , our query starts generating the following error :
1 2 Msg 512 , Level 16 , State 1 , Line 1 Subquery returned more than 1 value .
This is not permitted when the subquery follows = , != , < , <= , > , >= or when the subquery is used as an expression .
The error is descriptive enough .
Instead of the expected scalar value , our subquery returns a result set , which breaks the query .
Based on our business requirements , the fix is simple .
To list all plants manufacturing plant for a particular product , we simply use a JOIN :
1 2 3 4 SELECT A . sku , A . product_description , B . plant_nbr FROM Products AS A JOIN ProductPlants AS B ON A . sku = B . sku ;
Now the query completes without errors and returns the correct results :
1 2 3 4 5 6 sku product_description plant_nbr ----
-------------------- -----------
1 Bike 1 2 Ball 1 2 Ball 3 3 Phone 2
Note that the same error can occur in a predicate where a column or expression is tested against a subquery , for example “… column = ( SELECT value FROM Table ) “ .
In that case , the solution is to use the IN predicate in place of “ = ” .
Use of SELECT *
On first encounter with SQL we always praise the genius who invented the syntax SELECT *!
It ’s so handy and easy to use !
Instead of explicitly listing all column names in our query , we just use the magic wildchar ‘*’ and retrieve all columns .
For example , a common misuse of SELECT * is to extract a set of all plastic products and to insert them into another table with the same structure :
1 2 3 4 INSERT INTO PlasticProducts SELECT * FROM Products WHERE material_type = ' plastic ' ;
Job done !
However , one day business requirements change and two new columns are added to the Products table :
1 2 3 ALTER TABLE Products ADD effective_start_date DATETIME , effective_end_date DATETIME ;
All of sudden the magic query results in error :
1 2 Msg 213 , Level 16 , State 1 , Line 1 Insert Error : Column name or number of supplied values does not match table definition .
The fix is to explicitly list the column names in the query :
1 2 3 4 INSERT INTO PlasticProducts ( sku , product_description , material_type ) SELECT sku , product_description , material_type FROM Products WHERE material_type = ' plastic ' ;
The situation can get even worse if a view is created using SELECT * , and later the base tables are modified to add or drop columns .
Note :
If a view is create using the SCHEMABINDING option , then the base tables cannot be modified in a way that will affect the view definition .
To conclude , do not use SELECT * in production code !
One exception here is when using the EXISTS predicate .
The select list in the subquery for the EXISTS predicate is ignored since only the existence of rows is important .
Scalar user - defined functions
Reuse of code is one of the fundamental principles we learn when programming in any language , and the SQL language is no exception .
It provides many means by which to logically group code and reuse it .
One such means in SQL Server is the scalar user - defined function .
It seems so convenient to hide away all those complex calculations in a function , and then simply invoke it in our queries .
However , the hidden “ sting in the tail ” is that it can bring a heavy toll in terms of performance .
When used in a query , scalar functions are evaluated for each row and , with large tables , this can result in very slow running queries .
This is especially true when the scalar function needs to access another table to retrieve data .
Here is one example .
Given tables with products and sales for products , the request is to retrieve total sales per product .
Since the total sales value can be reused in another place , you decide to use a scalar function to calculate the total sales for a product :
1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 CREATE FUNCTION dbo .
GetTotalSales ( @ sku INT ) RETURNS DECIMAL ( 15 , 2 ) AS BEGIN RETURN ( SELECT SUM ( sale_amount ) FROM Sales WHERE sku = @ sku ) ; END
Then the query to retrieve the total sales for each product will look like this ;
1 2 SELECT sku , product_description , dbo .
GetTotalSales ( sku ) AS total_sales FROM Products ;
Is n’t this a very neat and good looking query ?
But just wait until you run it over a large data set .
The total sales calculation will be repeated for each and every row , and the overhead will be proportional to the number of rows .
The correct way to handle this is , if possible , is to rewrite the function as a table - valued function , or simply perform the calculation in the main query .
In our example , performing the calculation in the query will look like this :
1 2 3 4 5 SELECT P . sku , P . product_description , SUM ( S . sale_amount )
As total_sales FROM Products AS P JOIN Sales AS S ON P . sku = S . sku GROUP BY P . sku , P . product_description ;
And here is a table - valued function that can be used to calculate total sales :
1 2 3 4 5 6 CREATE FUNCTION dbo .
GetTotalSales ( @ sku INT ) RETURNS TABLE AS RETURN ( SELECT SUM ( sale_amount ) AS total_sales FROM Sales WHERE sku = @ sku ) ;
Now the table - valued function can be invoked in the query using the APPLY operator :
1 2 3 SELECT sku , product_description , total_sales FROM Products AS P CROSS APPLY dbo .
GetTotalSales ( P . sku )
AS S ;
Overuse of cursors
Let ’s face it – we love loops !
Whether we start programming with VB , C , C++ , Java , or C# , one of the first constructs we encounter is some form of a loop .
They can helpfully solve pretty much any challenge you might face .
And so , it is only natural on the day we start programming with SQL to seek out our favorite loop construct .
And here it is – the mighty cursor ( and its little WHILE brother ) !
Then we hurry to put the well known tool to use in solving our problems .
Let ’s look at one example .
Given a table with product prices , we have to perform a monthly update of prices for products ; the price updates are stored in another table with new prices .
ProductPrices table :
1 2 3 4 5 6 sku price effective_start_date effective_end_date ----
------
-------------------- ------------------ 1 10.50 2009 - 01 - 01 NULL 2 11.50 2009 - 01 - 01 NULL 3 19.00 2009 - 01 - 01 NULL 4 11.25 2009 - 01 - 01 NULL
NewPrices table :
1 2 3 4 sku price ---- ------ 2 11.25 4 12.00
A cursor solution may look like this :
1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 DECLARE @ sku INT ; DECLARE @ price DECIMAL ( 15 , 2 ) ; DECLARE PriceUpdates CURSOR LOCAL FORWARD_ONLY STATIC READ_ONLY FOR SELECT sku , price FROM NewPrices ; OPEN PriceUpdates ; FETCH NEXT FROM PriceUpdates INTO @ sku , @ price ; WHILE @ @ FETCH_STATUS = 0 BEGIN UPDATE ProductPrices SET price = @ price , effective_start_date = CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
WHERE sku = @ sku ; FETCH NEXT FROM PriceUpdates INTO @ sku , @ price ; END CLOSE PriceUpdates ; DEALLOCATE PriceUpdates ;
Mission accomplished !
Now we can take a well - deserved break while the query is running .
Soon , the realization dawns that procedural row by row processing is not working well in SQL .
Besides being very slow , our solution is long , hard to read and maintain .
This is the moment we understand the power of SQL is its set - based nature .
The same task can be accomplished using a very efficient set - based query that is easier to understand and maintain :
1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 UPDATE ProductPrices SET price = ( SELECT N . price FROM NewPrices AS N WHERE N . sku = ProductPrices . sku ) , effective_start_date = CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
WHERE EXISTS ( SELECT * FROM NewPrices AS N WHERE N . sku = ProductPrices . sku ) ;
There are different ways to write a set based query to solve this problem : using the MERGE statement , update with Common Table Expression , or the SQL Server specific update with join .
But the point is to utilize the natural power of the SQL language and use set based techniques to solve problems and to avoid procedural solutions .
Note :
While you should avoid cursors as much as possible , there are certain problems , such as running total aggregations , that today are still best solved using cursors .
We can be optimistic that future enhancements will provide better tools to solve those problems in a set based way .
Summary
Maybe now is a good time for the next code review of your SQL code .
Hopefully some of these examples will help you be a better developer / DBA and produce more reliable and efficient code .
It is not always easy to spot these patterns , especially in more complex queries .
But as long as you understand the fundamentals , avoiding these mistakes is easy .
Happy SQL coding !
When Spike Jonze set out to create live - action versions of the classic creatures from “ Where the Wild Things Are ” for his movie adaptation of the beloved children ’s book , the writer - director had a very clear image in mind -- of what he did n’t want .
In 2004 , around the time he also started co-writing its script with novelist Dave Eggers , Jonze rejected a number of submissions from a Hollywood special - effects company for being , well , “ too creature -y . ”
Jonze thought they simply failed to capture a bestial je ne sais quoi found in Maurice Sendak ’s 1963 picture book about Max , a little boy in a wolf costume who misbehaves and imagines himself transported to a faraway land where he becomes the king of all Wild Things .
“ I wanted the monsters to retain the strange design that Maurice had created , ” he said .
“ Weird , cuddly , charming .
Looking at each other out of the corner of their eye .
They ’d be almost , like , conspiring .
You do n’t know if Max has total control over them . ”
To ensure his monsters would have the proper “ soul , ” though , Jonze decided he needed an illustrator from outside the movie biz to draw mock - ups first .
Over dinner , Jonze ’s friend Karen O , lead singer of the alt - rock trio the Yeah Yeah Yeahs , and Julian Gross of the noise rock band Liars steered the director toward their pal Sonny Gerasimowicz .
Advertisement
He was n’t a professional creature creator or artist .
A former graffiti writer turned ad agency creative , Gerasimowicz was a kind of closet artiste with only one illustration for a magazine article to suggest his skill .
Offered the chance to work with the zeitgeist - riding auteur , Gerasimowicz did n’t present him a polished portfolio .
He showed Jonze rough pencil drawings of the Wild Things .
And the lo - fi renderings struck just the right nerve .
“ I sent him sketches that were , like , things I drew while I was on the telephone .
Like on scraps of paper , ” Gerasimowicz recalled .
“ When it comes down to something as delicate as tone , it became clear we had to find someone who had the right aesthetic , ” Jonze said .
“ It ’s finding people that have the right judgment , even if they ’ve never done the specifics . ”
Gerasimowicz landed the job in early 2005 , the mandate being not to slavishly imitate Sendak ’s singular style , more to articulate the creatures ’ distinct personalities as per the script ( it helped that Jonze physically acted out each character for him ) .
In turn , Gerasimowicz drafted scores of monster drawings : previsualizations for Photoshop - version Wild Things , the stage during which such crucial details as their fur , feathers , musculature and eyes would be decided .
Then the two traveled to Connecticut to show Sendak the renderings and get his blessing .
The then - 76 - year - old writer - illustrator made some tweaks -- suggestions about the muzzle on a bull - like Wild Thing and the feathers on the rooster
Thing not being “ flamboyant ” enough -- but remained markedly nonproprietary .
“ His attitude is so contrary to protecting anything , ” Jonze said .
“ His assignment to us was , ‘ Take this , make it your own .
Make it something personal .’ ”

In 2006 , the project landed at Warner Bros. and monster production began at Jim Henson Co.'s Creature Shop .
Gerasimowicz was kept on as head creature designer , overseeing work by some of the foremost practitioners in the business .
Nevermind that he had absolutely no experience .
Or that the expense of making the monsters accounted for the largest part of the movie ’s production costs .
Or that his staff was n’t exactly certain where he fit in .
“ I would give them aesthetic direction , ‘ What if we kind of did this a little bit ? ’
And they ’d be , like , ‘ That ’s a cool thought . ’
But they would keep moving with what they were doing , ” Gerasimowicz said .
With principle photography in Australia approaching in the spring of 2006 , anxiety set in .
Jonze had precise ideas about the way the Wild Things should look , i.e. , “ not like they were guys in suits . ”
But Jonze and Gerasimowicz ’s lack of familiarity with how special effects are created resulted in sleepless nights during the characters ’ fabrication .
“ It was so hard ! ” Gerasimowicz exclaimed .
“ They show us a bare - bones suit and it would be the scariest thing in the world because it ’s just a big foam thing .
Not doing this ever before , it was hard to visualize . ”

“ We freaked out every step of the way , ” Jonze added .
“ By the time we got to Australia , we were nervous wrecks . ”
Compounding matters , the actors who were to perform in the Wild Thing suits had to be in costume up to 12 hours a day .
Suits weighed up to 150 pounds and temperatures reached triple digits .
When one of the actors dropped out at the last minute , Gerasimowicz ’s job description changed again :
He stepped into the role of Alexander , a small , snarky goat in the film .
“ Sonny has a demeanor similar to that character , ” Jonze said .
“ I always describe him as a disgruntled Muppet . ”
For anyone familiar with Sendak ’s book , Jonze ’s “ Wild Things , ” which opens Oct. 16 , will be a marvel .
The characters -- voiced by such actors as James Gandolfini , Forest Whitaker and Lauren Ambrose -- seem comfortingly familiar and yet occupy a totally unique movie universe , a vivid live - action extrapolation of Sendak ’s classic work .
Especially the creatures ’ emotive faces .
Asked if CGI was responsible for their expressiveness , however , Jonze grew cagey .
“ The faces were static when we shot them and we put the faces on in post - production , ” he said .
“ I did n’t want to have CGI faces where it ’s synthetic fur .
So it ’s more manipulating what we ’d shot in - camera .

“ It ’s not like it ’s a big secret .
But I want to let that come out later .
I do n’t want the attention to focus on that . ”

Fig.8 is an unusual browser - game , with poetry at places , you would n’t expect .
In Fig.8 you play a bike , that drives around in some sort of classical book , filled up with “ figures ” .
That sort of technical drawings , books used to have in the pen and pencil era .
Well , there is basically nothing more to say here .
Best you experience the game by yourself , because all words are wasted here , trying to describe this experience .
Only one click away !
So play Fig. 8 . The game was made by Intuitiongames .
At Intuitiongames we also find some interesting background about the game :
At first Fig. 8 was actually called US and it was an art installation .
In my junior year of college I was walking in the snow one night and I noticed some bike tracks running through the snow ; an unusual scene in the middle of winter .
While I walked along I noticed the two paths diverging then returning to a single unified track , it made me think about how relationships change over time how we grow distant then return .

When ESPY Award nominees were announced , I wondered if the Steelers would lose to the Penguins , or vice versa , in the Best Team category .
If I remember my words exactly , I think I said :
“ … since Pittsburgh became the first city to claim both the NHL and NFL championships in the same year , that means the ESPY for Best Team will pit the Stanley Cup - winning Penguins against the Lombardi - hoisting Steelers .
There ’s other nominees up for that award , but they are n’t winning . ”
Whoops .
Apparently , the Lakers are a better team than either the Steelers or Penguins .
Because a team coached by the guy with the most titles in league history did it better than championship teams with second year and rookie head coaches , respectively .
That does n’t mean the city was shut out , though .
Santonio can back up his promise to bring home an ESPY , as his Super Bowl - winning catch from Ben Roethlisberger won the award for Best Play .
The Super Bowl win also got the Best Game nod .
And Sidney Crosby may not have been a Hart finalist at the NHL Awards , but he snagged the Best NHL Player ESPY like it was nobody ’s business .
You can catch a complete list of winners here .
Because who needs to watch the actual ceremony when you ’ve already scoured this list ?

The US military ’s “ do n’t ask , do n’t tell ” policy on homosexual soldiers has the perverse effect of protecting bigots who commit violence against homosexuals , while preventing homosexuals who comply with the policy from seeking protection , says a former Navy officer .
In an article published in Sunday ’s Washington Post , Joseph Rocha , a former petty officer stationed in Bahrain during the early years of the Iraq war , wrote : “ The irony of ‘ do n’t ask , do n’t tell ’ is that it protects bigots and punishes gays who comply . ”
ADVERTISEMENT
Because homosexuals can’t admit their sexuality to senior officers , they ca n’t complain about abuses , and that provides cover for those committing violence against them , Rocha explained .
Rocha ’s criticism of “ dont ’ ask , do n’t tell ” comes on the heels of a gay - rights march on Washington , DC , this past weekend , ahead of which President Barack Obama gave a speech in which pledged to end the policy .
But many gay - rights activists have accused the president of dragging his heels on the policy change .
Shortly after joining the Navy ’s canine bomb - sniffing unit in Bahrain in 2004 , Rocha says he was subjected to repeated hazing by his commanding officer .
CNN reports that Rocha and others in his unit were subjected to numerous acts of humiliation , including being hog-tied , being force - fed dog treats , and being duct - taped to a chair and left inside a dog kennel .
“ Shop talk in the unit revolved around sex , either the prostitute - filled parties of days past or the escapades my comrades looked forward to , ” Rocha wrote in the Post .
“ They interpreted my silence and total lack of interest as an admission of homosexuality .
My higher - ups seemed to think that gave them the right to bind me to chairs , ridicule me , hose me down and lock me in a feces - filled dog kennel .
“ I told no one about what I was living through , ” Rocha continued .
“ I feared that reporting the abuse would lead to an investigation into my sexuality .
My leaders and fellow sailors were punishing me for keeping my sexuality to myself , punishing me because I would n’t ‘ tell . ' ”
ADVERTISEMENT
The man Rocha blamed for the abuses was his commanding officer , Chief Master - at - Arms Michael Toussaint .
But following an investigation , the Navy decided to charge the unit ’s second - in - command , Petty Officer Jennifer Valdivia .
Toussaint has since been promoted and now works with the Navy Seals .
Valdivia was herself the victim of hazing .
Rocha described to CNN how Valdivia was once “ dressed only in a bedsheet , handcuffed to a bed , and forced into a catfight with two other women . ”
After learning she would be blamed for the hazing , Valdivia committed suicide , leaving behind a message on her MySpace page in which she said she was “ tired of being blamed for other people ’s mistakes . ”

Following a Youth Radio investigation into the matter earlier this year , members of Congress are beginning to sit up and take notice .
Rocha ’s ordeal is being championed by US House Rep. Joe Sestak ( D - PA ) , a former Navy admiral who , according to CNN , “ is so disturbed about allegations of abuse and hazing in the Navy ’s canine unit in Bahrain he ’s demanding answers from the Navy , asking the same question some sailors are :
Where is the accountability ? ”
Sestak has reportedly requested an inquiry into Rocha ’s allegations , sending a letter to Navy Secretary Raymond Mabus asking for answers about the allegations .

“ EXTRAORDINARY how potent cheap music is , ” the playwright Noel Coward declared .
He could have said the same about cheap money .
With cash on deposit yielding not much more than zero in many rich countries , there has been a powerful rally in most financial markets .
In America , money - market funds yield around 0.1 % after fees , so an investor with $ 100,000 receives just $ 100 in annual interest .
Unsurprisingly , investors have withdrawn $ 332 billion from such funds this year , or around 10 % of total assets , according to EPFR Global , a data provider .
Investors elsewhere also seem to be putting their cash to work .
The MSCI world index of global share prices is up by almost 24 % so far this year , having fallen by a similar amount between January 1st and March 6th .
In the debt markets , the spread ( or excess interest rate over Treasury bonds ) on high - yield corporate bonds has fallen from more than 16 percentage points at the start of the year to around seven and a half points now ( see chart ) .
Commodities have not missed out — gold has moved back above $ 1,000 an ounce .
The markets are enjoying a “ sweet spot ” in which economic and profit forecasts are being revised higher but the outlook for interest rates ( and thus borrowing costs ) remains on hold , thanks to subdued inflation .
On September 23rd the Federal Reserve said that the American economy had “ picked up ” but that interest rates were set to remain “ exceptionally low ” .
The data indicate that most developed economies have emerged from recession .
The second - quarter profits of S&P 500 companies may have dropped by nearly 30 % year - on - year but they were still an improvement on the first quarter .
Analysts forecast a 28.7 % increase in global corporate earnings in 2010 .
What is true for the developed world is true in spades for emerging markets .
Emerging stockmarkets are up by a remarkable 62 % since the start of the year and are 94 % above their lows .
Mark Mobius , an emerging - markets investor at Franklin Templeton , thinks that analysts are underestimating the potential for recovery and that many markets can surpass 2007 highs .
Indeed , there is already talk that emerging markets could be the next bubble to be inflated by loose monetary policies .
Investors perceive developing countries to have much better growth prospects than those in the developed world .
Liquidity is fuelling the Chinese market in particular .
According to Dylan Grice of Société Générale : “ [ Chinese ] banks which have n't wanted to lend have lent to borrowers who did n't want to borrow … the money is now flowing into the stockmarket , into commodity inventories and into property . ”
But bubble talk seems a little premature .
Markets have rallied very fast , but they fell just as quickly in the six months to March .
It is worth remembering that even if the Dow Jones Industrial Average regains the 10,000 level in the near future , it will still be more than 4,000 points below its all - time high , recorded in October 2007 .
The MSCI world index is around 32 % below its peak .
Some of this rally is down to sheer relief that the market is out of crisis mode ( the cost of borrowing in the money markets is back to near - normal levels , for example ) .
The more difficult question to answer is whether the surge is the start of a long - term bull market or simply yet another bear - market rally , like those Japan enjoyed in the 1990s .
The deleveraging that many have long predicted has not really started ; government debt has simply substituted for private - sector debt .
So the economy may be very reliant on action by central banks and governments and may slump once that support is taken away .
Some forms of stimulus are already being withdrawn .
The American “ cash - for - clunkers ” subsidy for car sales ended in August .
Edmunds.com , a website , predicts that the annualised rate of car sales in September will be 8.8 m units , down from more than 14 m in August .
The fear is of a “ Weekend at Bernie 's ” recovery , after the 1989 film , in which two office workers pretend their dead boss is alive ( putting sunglasses on the corpse and propping it up ) so they can enjoy the party lifestyle .
Equity and corporate - bond markets have also been boosted by quantitative easing ( QE ) , the process whereby central banks create money to purchase ( mostly government ) bonds .
That has helped keep the lid on Treasury - bond yields .
In June the ten - year bond yielded almost 4 % ; it is currently around 3.5 % , pretty low by historical standards even though governments are issuing record amounts of debt .
The fear is that if QE stops , yields may rise sharply , driving up borrowing costs for everyone .
“ At some point the quantitative easing will come to an end but until it does this bull market is sponsored by [ governments ] and everyone should enjoy it , ” Crispin Odey , a hedge - fund manager based in London , recently urged his clients .
Yet the stockmarket seems to assume a robust economic recovery .
The S&P 500 index is trading on a price - earnings ratio of around 20 , based on 2009 forecasts for operating earnings .
A more cautious approach , using earnings reported under official accounting standards , puts the multiple at 27 .
Both numbers are well above the historical average .
According to Smithers & Co , the American market is 37 % overvalued on the best long - term measure , the cyclically - adjusted price - earnings ratio ( which averages profits over ten years ) .
As a result , the markets look vulnerable to a setback .
As strategists at UBS remarked in a recent research note : “ Liquidity has been a much bigger driver of this market than fundamentals .
Liquidity - driven rallies have a habit of reversing violently without warning . ”
WASHINGTON–Of all the bitter pills Americans are swallowing nowadays , from joblessness to home foreclosures to runaway national debt , it might come as no surprise that a pill of another sort is flying off the shelves at a recession - defying pace – the antidepressant .
It 's an easy jump to conclude that hard times are turning the country comfortably numb , as the Washington Post suggested in a weekend report on the sales of the drug Cymbalta , up 14 per cent since the summer of 2008 and now among America 's most popular happy pills .
Drill deeper and you will find that the U.S. , though far and away a world leader with its $ 10 - billion - a - year antidepressant habit , is not alone .
Over the summer , British politicians fretted over the impact of recession on mental health amid data showing a spike of 2.1 million antidepressant prescriptions last year , when the downturn took its first precipitous dive .
Same in India , where pharmaceutical firms reported a 20 per cent expansion of the antidepressant market in the year ending December 2008 .
And in New Zealand , where the global plunge was linked to reports of a near doubling in antidepressant prescriptions between 2002 and 2008 .
But drill down deeper still and the story behind the flurry of cause - and - effect headlines is far more nuanced .
While many researchers acknowledge there is likely an uptick in med sales as a consequence of the poor economy , most say it is driven as much or more by trends decades in the making .
There is no question America loves its happy pills , but consumption was skyrocketing long before the Dow melted down .
The real story , in fact , may be that the link between recession and mental health points in precisely the opposite direction – the possibility that people in the most dire straits today are also the most likely to be suffering depression but without access to any medical help .
That is what Dr. Craig Pollack of the University of Pennsylvania discovered during a study of 250 Philadelphia homeowners on the brink of foreclosure .
Pollack 's findings , published last month , showed 37 per cent of the distressed homeowners suffered from major clinical depression .
But nearly half of his study group said they were too poor to buy prescription drugs .
" Clearly for some , poor health leads to foreclosure .
And for others , foreclosure may be leading to poor health , " Pollack said .
Dr. Ronald Dworkin , a Maryland anaesthesiologist and senior fellow at the Hudson Institute , warns that to make too much of the recession 's role in prescription drug - taking is to wildly underplay the larger story of how the country has swarmed toward the pill bottle every since the 1970s , when Valium hit the scene .
" America is all about the gratification of pleasure .
We are the kings of pleasure and proud of it , " said Dworkin , author of Artificial Unhappiness : The Dark Side of the New Happy Class .
" But the other side of it is that we 're not very good at preparing for or dealing with unhappiness , which of course is an inevitable part of life .
And what we 've done since the ' 70s is to transform into a culture that treats unhappiness as a disease . "
Dworkin says primary - care doctors wrote about 75 per cent of the more than 164 million antidepressant prescriptions dispensed in 2008 in the U.S. , a fact he says gainsays the notion that psychiatrists and big pharma are to blame .
But however one tracks the evolution , Dworkin contends the practice of " stupefying ourselves to cure everyday unhappiness " treats the symptom , not the cause .
And that is a bigger problem today than it used to be , given the surfeit of unhappiness associated with recession .

" There is a paradox : taking antidepressants makes people feel better , thereby reducing their interest in actually doing something about the things in their life that cause the unhappiness , " he said .

The urgency of change fades away . "
WASHINGTON ( CNN ) --
House Democratic leaders are discussing adding a tax on insurers as a way to reduce the overall price tag of their health care bill .
House Speaker Nancy Pelosi has said a public option is the best idea for health care reform .
House Speaker Nancy Pelosi said Friday that an excise tax on high - end insurance plans , similar to the one included in the Senate Finance Committee 's health care overhaul legislation , was " under consideration . "
But Pelosi added that leaders are looking at other proposals to offset the costs of the bill .
" We have to see how much money we need , and if we 're taking the bill down in costs , there are other provisions in the Senate bill that bend the curve that might be more palatable .
We 'll see , " she added .
House Democratic leaders and key committee chairmen met Friday to try to come up with a final version of the House health care bill .
Much of the discussion centered on how to cut about $ 200 billion in costs from the measure .
The Congressional Budget Office estimated that the House bill costs $ 1.1 trillion over 10 years , but President Obama told Congress he wants a bill that costs $ 900 billion .
The House Democrats ' health care plan includes a surtax on wealthy Americans .
The graduated tax would apply to families making more than $ 350,000 a year , with the rate increasing as income levels go up .
But a number of freshmen Democrats argued that the initial income level should be raised so the tax does n't unfairly burden small businesses .
Leaders have now agreed to apply the surtax on those making more than $ 1 million a year .
But losing some revenue from the surtax is forcing Democratic leaders to look for other sources of funding .
Democratic leadership aides say that if the House moves ahead with a tax on insurers , it would probably modify the Senate Finance Committee version , because many Democrats are worried the Senate plan would hit middle - class families .

The scientists received the group admission rate , which included lunch .
Terry Mortenson , a lecturer and researcher for Answers in Genesis , the ministry that built and runs the Creation Museum , said he did not expect the visit to change many minds .
“ I ’m sure for the most part they ’ll be of a different view from what ’s presented here , ” Dr. Mortenson said .
“ We ’ll just give the freedom to see what they want to see . ”
Near the entrance to the exhibits is an animatronic display that includes a girl feeding a carrot to a squirrel as two dinosaurs stand nearby , a stark departure from natural history museums that say the first humans lived 65 million years after the last dinosaurs .
“ I ’m speechless , ” said Derek E.G. Briggs , director of the Peabody Museum of Natural History at Yale , who walked around with crossed arms and a grimace .
“ It ’s rather scary . ”
Dr. Mortenson and others at the museum say they look at the same rocks and fossils as the visiting scientists , but because of different starting assumptions they arrive at different answers .
For example , they say the biblical flood set off huge turmoil inside the Earth that broke apart the continents and pushed them to their current locations , not that the continents have moved over a few billion years .
“ Everyone has presuppositions what they will consider , what questions they will ask , ” said Dr. Mortenson , who holds a doctorate in the history of geology from Coventry University in England .
“ The very first two rooms of our museum talk about this issue of starting points and assumptions .
We will very strongly contest an evolutionist position that they are letting facts speak for themselves . ”
The museum ’s presentation appeals to visitors like Steven Leinberger and his wife , Deborah , who came with a group from the Church of the Lutheran Confession in Eau Claire , Wis .
“ This is what should be taught even in science , ” Mr. Leinberger said .
The museum founders placed it in the Cincinnati area because it is within a day ’s drive of two - thirds of the United States population .
The area has also long attracted paleontologists with some of the most fossil - laden rocks in North America , where it is easy along some roadsides to pick up fossils dated to be hundreds of millions of years old .
The rocks are so well known that they are called the Cincinnatian Series , representing the stretch of time from 451 million to 443 million years ago .
A war of words broke out between London and Berlin yesterday as the German Finance minister , Peer Steinbrück , made an outspoken attack on the City .
As world leaders meet at the G20 summit in Pittsburgh , Mr Steinbrück laid bare the disagreements between France and Germany on one side and the UK and US on the other about tighter regulation .
He said he hoped that the summit would agree " specific measures " to limit bankers ' bonuses , but added : " There is clearly a lobby in London that wants to defend its competitive advantage tooth and nail .
" In the United States , too , the financial industry is evidently putting a lot of pressure on Congress with the message , ' Do n't take things too seriously with regulation ' . "
Download the new Independent Premium app Sharing the full story , not just the headlines
Mr Steinbrück said the banking industry would " hopefully get a rule whereby bonuses will be limited to a proportion of fixed salaries " .
On the contentious issue of closer supervision of hedge funds and private equity , Mr Steinbrück suggested that British interests were having a hard time , " to put it politely " , in agreeing closer supervision .
Despite broad agreement on some issues , the fissures between the European and Anglo - American positions seem set to widen .
Other powers , such as China , also seem unlikely to subscribe to the Franco - German view .
President Nicolas Sarkozy of France , for example , has said he will walk out if there is no agreement at the summit on bank bonuses .
Sources close to the German government confirmed yesterday that " differences are widening " on the issue of how long nations that have traditionally run large trade surpluses , such as Japan , Germany and China , should be expected to continue to reflate their economies to help weaker nations such as Britain and America .
Meanwhile , the European Commission published its latest proposals on financial regulation , and rumours emanated from Brussels that the Governor of the Bank of England , Mervyn King , was being lined up to be vice - chairman of the new European Systemic Risk Board ( ESRB ) .
Jean - Claude Trichet , president of the European Central Bank , is expected to chair the ESRB , which will be a non-binding " early warning system " for financial crises .
The EC also firmed up its plan for EU - wide supervision of individual companies and sectors , and the role and powers of three new supervisory authorities : the European Banking Authority , the European Securities and Markets Authority , and the European Insurance and Occupational Pensions Authority .
Together with national , bodies they will form the European System of Financial Supervisors .
An EC document said : " The goal is one set of rules for all financial institutions in the EU , big or small , domestic or multinational . "
The commission 's president , Jose Manuel Barroso , added : " This European system can inspire a global one , and we will argue for that in Pittsburgh . "
The EC says the new bodies will develop draft proposals for technical standards ; work towards " a common rulebook " ; facilitate exchange of information and settle disagreements between nations ; supervise the credit ratings agencies ; and carry out " co-ordination and some decision - making in emergency situations " .
The problems that confounded national regulators in rescuing cross - border banks such as Fortis during the crisis have added momentum to these reforms .

Signaling a potentially tougher safety enforcement policy , federal aviation regulators proposed $ 9.2 million in civil penalties against US Airways and United Airlines for various maintenance lapses affecting more than 1,800 flights stretching back to early 2008 .
The Federal Aviation Administration 's new hard - nosed stance partly reflects heightened congressional and public concerns about maintenance slipups , according to industry and government officials .
But Wednesday 's announcement , these officials said , also may be a prelude to seeking potentially larger fines or penalties in pending enforcement cases targeting two other carriers that recently have been more prominently in the agency 's crosshairs : American Airlines and Southwest Airlines .
The FAA proposed a $ 5.4 million penalty against the US Airways Group Inc. unit for allegedly operating eight aircraft between October 2008 and January 2009 that had n't been properly inspected or otherwise failed to comply with government and airline safety procedures .
UAL Corp .'s
United unit was hit with a proposed $ 3.8 million penalty for flying a Boeing 737 jet for more than two months after mechanics left rags inside the oil system of one of its engines .
Both carriers have 30 days to appeal .
The fines are among the largest ever proposed by the FAA .
A UAL spokeswoman said the carrier was " reviewing " the penalty .
“ After becoming injured , I felt angry and overwhelmed .
I needed to find legal representation , and there were many law firms to choose from .
I chose the GoldenbergLaw firm to represent me after meeting with Noah and Stuart .
There were many reasons why I hired them to represent me , but the main reason I chose this firm was because of the personal approach they take with their clients .
They have the expertise , experience , and legal acumen combined with the understanding that this process can be emotionally difficult and overwhelming .
They immediately took on the responsibility of managing the case ( records , medical bills , weekly updates…etc. ) , which put me at ease and allowed me to focus on the most important aspect of the case , my recovery .
I truly appreciate everything they did and the support they provided .
My case was settled , and I was extremely happy with the outcome .
I am now in the process of successfully rebuilding my life thanks to GoldenbergLaw . ”

For a brief , shining moment , Spain was the best solar market in the world .
Unlike in cloudy Germany , the sun bakes Spain 's southwestern provinces -- the brown , hard - packed Extremadura and Andalusía -- on the Mediterranean coast .
And the Spanish government , eager to fulfill its commitments to renewable energy , guaranteed generous subsidies for any company that met its aggressive deadlines .
While the ministry expected a steady stream of investment , it got a flood , accounting for more than 40 percent of the world 's total solar installations last year .
Forced to revise the subsidies -- known as feed - in tariffs -- that it used to spur photovoltaic power last fall , Spain became one of the principal causes of the downturn in the solar industry .
And its faulty regulations have become a watchword for how government renewable - energy programs , poorly conceived , can go awry .
" [ The crash ] was an inevitable consequence of a policy that was not ... a long - term sustainable market design , " said Julie Blunden , vice president of public policy at U.S. - based SunPower Corp .
" Whenever you 've got something that 's unsustainable , eventually it gives .
And lo and behold , that happened . "
Many in Europe and some in the United States view feed - in tariffs , which guarantee elevated electrical rates to qualified projects , as the best way to spur immediate development of renewable markets .
The long - term stability provided by the subsidies lures capital , and the sliding scale of the tariff 's prices , which typically drop each year toward average rates , encourages early adopters .
There are many success stories : Germany 's program has become the model , with fellow E.U. countries France , Italy and the Czech Republic adopting similar schemes .
In the United States , California began a small - scale feed - in system last year to great success , and states like Vermont and Washington have added similar programs this year .
Such programs would do well to learn from Spain 's mistakes , solar executives and analysts say .
In just one year of boom , the country committed itself to solar payments estimated at $ 26.4 billion , which in turn led to taxpayer backlash and bust .
" Spain is a perfect example of how drastic changes in policy can really kill a market , " said Reese Tisdale , solar research director at Emerging Energy Research , " the caveat being the world economy tanked on us at the same time . "
" What 's important for the regulation of solar is stability , " said Santiago Seage , the CEO of Abengoa Solar SA , one of Spain 's largest solar developers .
" Unfortunately , up to now , we have had too many changes .
... [ And ] if the context changes , you can make mistakes in business decisions . "
The feed - in tariff established by Spain in 2007 guaranteed fixed electricity rates of up to 44 euro cents per kilowatt - hour to all new solar panel projects plugged into the electrical grid by September 2008 .
Also , a loophole in the tariff allowed bundles of small , ground - based projects to receive up to 575 percent of the average electricity price .
Given the country 's abundant sunshine and such a beneficial tariff , the market was bound to overheat , Tisdale said .
" If [ the tariff ] is too high , then everyone is going to go to that market , " he said .
" That 's just how it is . "
What went wrong
The photovoltaic market has been cutting its costs rapidly , and the Spanish tariff , with its high rates , created an artificial market , developers said .
And unlike Germany , Spain had no system built in to reduce tariff rates if its capacity targets were exceeded .
Indeed , there were no stepped reductions , or degressions , at all .
There was no ability to react .
" The most important lesson , which everyone has learned , is that if you 're going to establish a feed - in tariff , you need to figure out how to make it market - responsive , " Blunden said .
While the government had expected it would not see 400 megawatts of solar capacity in the country until 2010 , by the fall of 2007 , some 350 megawatts had already been installed .
Chinese solar firms were sending container after container , flush with solar panels , to the country .
Scrambling , the government upped its target to 1,200 megawatts .
But as it became clear the market would overshoot that limit , too , the boom became a frenzy as developers rushed to connect their projects to the grid before last September , when the government altered the tariff , dropping rates by 30 percent .
Many businesses feel burned by the boom and bust engendered by the tariff .
" If the Spanish government is going to pull the rug out from under them , that 's kind of a problem , " Tisdale said .
" There will be a rush to get projects in the ground .
They know in a mid-August night the government could pull the rug out from under them . "
Many companies faced accusations of fraud , based on claims that they had connected to the grid by the government 's deadline of Sept. 29 .
Spain 's National Energy Commission is currently investigating several projects , according to ASIF , Spain 's photovoltaic association .
Still , even with this fraud , some 3 gigawatts of solar capacity were installed in Spain within 18 months .
Fallout
The repercussions of the tariff revision can still be seen today .
The photovoltaic market was overwhelmed with excess panels , reducing prices .
Demand from feed - in systems begun by Italy and France helped , but did not soak up all the excess supply .
Spain 's solar industry lost more than 20,000 jobs .
The downturn hit many manufacturers hard , like Germany 's Q - Cells , which announced the layoff of 500 employees yesterday ( Greenwire , Aug. 17 ) .
Prices for solar panels are at about half what they were last year , selling for about $ 2.40 a watt .
In the end , Spain was an accidental innovator , Blunden said .
The government had hoped its tariff would spur construction of rooftop solar panels .
Instead , it jump - started the ground - based solar industry .
" Spain demonstrated to the world how fast to market [ solar ] can be , " Blunden said .
Americans and others would be wrong to avoid the feed - in tariff based solely on Spain 's experience , Abengoa 's Seage said .
" The feed - in tariff is a mechanism that , typically , Americans do n't like , " Seage said .
" They believe it does n't optimize costs for the taxpayers .
...
Nevertheless , I feel it has a huge advantage .
It 's a simple mechanism to get the market started . "
After the market is started , then you can fine - tune your numbers , Seage added .
The solar photovoltaic companies still operating in Spain have found themselves in a new business , said Eduardo Collado , ASIF 's technical manager .
" The photovoltaic model has changed from large , ground - based installations to roof installations , " he said .
" The latter generate close to places of consumption .
It is more distributed and close to consumers . "
The government 's revised tariff has set a hard cap of 500 megawatts to be built , most of this as more costly rooftop installations .
Revisions to the tariff are made on a quarterly basis .
Demand remains high , however , with 2,468 applications having been received recently , according to the Ministry of Industry , Tourism and Trade .
Spain will remain a viable solar market , most in the industry agree .
But the whole process could have been much less painful with a bit more foresight .
In the end , Blunden said , it is a simple truth : " If you 're not careful in your market design , you basically run out of money . "

My wife , who ’s working on her MBA , is currently wading through a class that focuses on leadership .
The other night she observed that “ there sure are a lot of people out there developing theories on leadership , are n’t there ? ”
Well , yes , and for good reason .
Most of those people are working to provide hooks for consulting practices , which can be pretty marketable .
Why ?
Every company needs strong leaders .
In fact , it ’s probably safe to say that very few companies , if any , have as much in the way of leadership skills as they would like .
Even if they have strong leadership at the top , you need leadership at all levels of the organization in order to be truly effective , and every business I ’ve ever encountered had at least a little room for improvement .
( Lest I be accused of excusing myself here , I ’m including my own previous businesses in this . )
Since it ’s hard to find great leaders , many organizations work to cultivate better leadership skills among their existing employee bases , and that ’s where consultants with leadership theories come in .
Are Leaders Made or Born ?
The problem , of course , is that leadership is hard .
For starters , let ’s understand that leadership and management are n’t the same thing .
We ’re not going to delve deeply into the characteristics of leadership here , but we will observe ( and pardon my oversimplification ) that it generally thrives on vision and the ability to motivate people , whereas management has more to do with making the trains run on time .
If you have somebody who embodies all of these capabilities , that ’s something special .
Let ’s also note that leadership is a function of multiple characteristics , and it ’s possible to have some but not others .
For example , a CEO may have so much charisma that people will follow him off a cliff , and so little vision that off a cliff is exactly where he leads them .
As a result , it ’s possible to develop leadership skills without necessarily producing a full - spectrum leader .
I ’ve had the misfortune of dealing with some bad leaders in the past , so when it comes to organizational and leadership issues I should acknowledge that I have my cynical moments .
Which is why I concluded by telling my wife that when push comes to shove , real leaders are a rare commodity .
Leadership and the Fear Problem
All this is leading back around to my post from last week , where I explained why fear is an organization killer .
One of my colleagues liked the piece , but said “ what you need to do now is explain how they can fix the problem . ”
Great advice , that .
So I thought for awhile about what I might say , and many suggestions presented themselves .
Plenty has been written about the value of promoting healthy internal communication , for instance .
Plenty more has been written about empowering employees and capturing their ideas .
There are structural measures ( breaking down the hierarchy and promoting genuine teamwork among equals ) .
Much can be done on the cultural front .
And of course , there ’s always Jim Collins ’s edict about getting the right people on the bus .
All of these areas offer promise for those interested in creating an atmosphere of professional investment in their businesses .
But the more I flailed away at the tactics , the more I realized that there ’s only one real answer , and it has to do with … you guessed it … leadership .
In a nutshell , fear in an organization , or the lack of it , is a result of the personality and will of those calling the shots .
In a smaller company this may be one person , and larger environments may have evolved a collective culture that ’s larger than any one person .
In either case , if leadership is committed to fully engaged employees , then whatever tactics are employed will likely to meet with some success .
If leadership is okay with a culture of fear , on the other hand , then all the great empowerment programs in the world are going to fail .
Put another way , trying to develop a list of “ things you can do ” to combat fear in an organization is like articulating individual leadership skills – here is a specific leaderlike thing that you can do , etc .
But in the end , driving the fear out of an organization and replacing it with a culture of engagement wo n’t result from leadership skills or tactics or programs .
It will only occur as a manifestation of true , full - on leadership .
I wish I had an easier answer for you , but I do n’t .
The design for a $ 180 - million train station and transit hub in Anaheim , by the Los Angeles office of the giant architecture firm HOK and engineers from Parsons Brinckerhoff , tries its best to enclose those contradictions under a single vaulted roof .
Known officially as the Anaheim Regional Transportation Intermodal Center , or ARTIC , the planned station is suffused with a sepia - toned futurism — with longing for what will be as well as for what was .
Getting from one city to another by train remains a thoroughly romanticized exercise — a humane relic of a more cosmopolitan and energy - efficient era in transportation .
And yet trains have also become a key component of efforts by young planners , architects and politicians to re-imagine or revivify American urbanism , with separate piles of federal and state funds — in California ’s case , nearly $ 10 billion — already earmarked for a network of new high - speed rail links .
The role that train travel plays in the American popular imagination is an increasingly contradictory one these days , somehow deeply nostalgic and symbolic of the future at the same time .
In winning the right to design the project , slated to fill a 16 - acre , wedge - shaped piece of land along the 57 Freeway and the Santa Ana River , roughly midway between Angel Stadium and the Honda Center , HOK beat out a high - powered list of competitors , including architect - engineer partnerships headlined by Frank Gehry , Cesar Pelli , Norman Foster and Santiago Calatrava .
It did so with a design that shares more than a few qualities with the hugely popular retro baseball stadiums produced by the firm ’s sports - architecture wing , once called HOK Sport and now , as an independent entity , known as Populous .
The station , expected to be finished by 2013 , will be full of modern amenities and rely on sophisticated engineering .
Its exterior frame will combine long - span steel beams , producing largely column - free interior space , with ETFE , the flexible material that covered the “ water cube ” swimming facility at last summer ’s Beijing Olympics .
It will have to execute a gymnastic flexibility in slipping next to and eventually under the 57 overpass near Angel Stadium .
Its tracks will have to accommodate Amtrak and Metrolink trains , as well as the anticipated high - speed line between Northern and Southern California and , possibly , another between Anaheim and Las Vegas .
As a visual symbol , ARTIC will operate quite differently .
It will appeal to a charming , essentially 19th century notion of the train station as a place of metropolitan arrival : a grand portal designed to deliver passengers directly into the middle of a crowded , bustling city , lending some sense of glamour to a train trip simply by a kind of architectural osmosis .
As the terminus of the California high - speed line ’s first phase , which will also pass through Union Station in downtown Los Angeles , the station will mark a significant entrance to Orange County — and , in the process , perhaps produce the landmark , the symbol of place and character , that the county has always lacked ( with the exception of its beaches and Disneyland , of course , which are nothing to sneeze at ) .
Clearly , the HOK design ’s sense of grand symbolism is a large part of what appealed to the city of Anaheim and the Orange County Transportation Authority , which jointly are planning the station .
The architects and Parsons Brinckerhoff submitted a pair of design concepts as part of their entry .
The first featured a low , pavilion - like building with a cone - shaped form , wrapped in digital lighting panels , emerging through the roof .
Decorated with the Angels logo , with Disney characters or a happy - new - year message , the cone would have acted as a digital beacon .
But it was the team ’s second concept that prevailed .
It is more explicitly connected to the history of train travel and train - station architecture than the first , inspired by the high - ceilinged spaces of Grand Central Terminal in New York as well as airplane hangars in the Orange County city of Tustin .
It will stretch a dramatic vaulted ceiling 150 feet above the main arrival hall .
It mixes in further references to Eero Saarinen ’s Gateway Arch in St. Louis , the soaring volumes of the much - mourned old Pennsylvania Station and Santiago Calatrava ’s skeletal , bone - white design for a new transit hub at the World Trade Center site in Manhattan .
Of course , in Orange County , the idea of stepping from a train right into the middle of dense urban life — the way you might exit Shinjuku Station in Tokyo , say , or London ’s Paddington — is an obvious fiction .
And it will remain a fiction for many decades , if not indefinitely .
Many more people will likely see the station ’s arched profile , in certain ways so symbolic of the rebirth of train travel , from their cars on the freeway than as they walk to or from a train .
The HOK design does its best to sketch out a path to future density , at least in the area immediately surrounding the station .
To the north and east — away from Angel Stadium and toward the Honda Center — the firm ’s master plan for the site imagines a close - knit collection of shops , offices and housing leading through landscaped open space toward a riverside park .
But the construction of those elements has been reserved for later phases of development , when the commercial real - estate market has bounced back .
The first phase of the project — the station itself , covering 66,000 square feet — is essentially fully funded already , by a mixture of county tax money and state bond and transportation funds .
But if the state ’s high - speed line is delayed or killed , or if the mixed - use portion of the development is never built , the station could wind up rising grandly over a collection of parking garages or empty lots , alongside a mostly dry riverbed .
A central part of high - speed rail ’s appeal , of course , is environmental .
Going by train from Anaheim to San Francisco — a trip high - speed advocates say could take less than three hours — is far more efficient , as far as carbon footprints go , than traveling by Southwest or SUV .
High - speed rail is a fundamental part of the growing effort , known as green urbanism , to make metropolitan areas more sustainable and less dependent on cars and suburban sprawl .
In that sense , ARTIC , whatever the shortcomings of its striking but somewhat derivative architectural approach , is poised to take up a position as the most prominent piece of green architecture in Orange County and one of the most prominent in Southern California .
As such , it will reflect one of the curious aspects of a rising interest in energy - efficiency and sustainability in American culture and politics .
In many cases , progress on the green front will be measured by how quickly we can re-create a new or souped - up version of what we once , many decades ago , took for granted .
This is certainly true of efforts to promote high - speed rail ; other examples include the truly walkable mixed - use neighborhood , that holy Grail of green urbanism , as well as a new generation of raised shotgun houses for New Orleans .
For many American cities , what ’s past is , if not prologue , then at least template .

“ Fat Man ” on Nagasaki is that the world saw what the energy from such a weapon can do .
President Truman was a little loose with the facts when he urged Japan to surrender or he promised a “ reign of ruin ” for the nation .
Truth is , the US only had the two bombs and it would have taken awhile to make more .
At about 8 AM on August 6 , 1945 , the first atomic bomb was unleashed on Hiroshima , Japan .
We all know the history of that .
Perhaps the greatest benefit of the atomic blast on Hiroshima and the subsequent dropping ofon Nagasaki is that the world saw what the energy from such a weapon can do .

“ Little Boy ” and weighed nearly 10,000 pounds .
It was flown to the target in a single B - 29 , which was piloted by Kentucky Paul Tibbets .
Tibbets called the plane the Enola Gay , which was a reference to his mother .
When the bomb was tested in the New Mexico desert about 6 weeks prior , a blind girl 120 miles away reportedly “ saw ” the light .
The heat from the test gadget had turned the desert to glass .
So , when the bombadier of the Enola Gay released the bomb , Tibbets banked the plane quickly to reduce the impact of the shock wave and to reduce the effect of the blinding flash at detonation .
Navigator Dutch Van Kirk recalled the event vividly .
But , he banked so hard and headed away so fast at such an angle that the target was not seen until well after the initial blast .
So , when you see video of the atomic bomb exploding just after detonation , you know that its of “ Fat Man ” and not “ Little Boy ” because the most complete footage was from the second blast at Nagasaki .

The release time was 8:15 AM .
An air pressure detonator began the nuclear fission at 1980 feet at 8:16 AM .
At that instant , 66,000 people were killed and 69,000 injured .
Estimates vary but in the years to come , thousands more would die from their injuries , radiation sickness and cancers that were linked to the blast .
The actual explosion was about 10 kilotons , or about 10,000 tons of TNT , though I ’ve seen some sources site 20 kilotons .
It is estimated today that the rather crude instrument only yielded an energy release just 1/50th of its capability .
The nuclear weapon with the greatest yield ever produced by the United States was the , which had a blast equivalent of 25 million tons of TNT , though some sources claim it was 15 megatons .
Little Boy had a vaporization radius of about a half mile …. everything within a half mile was vaporized .
Total destruction occured within a 1 mile radius .
Severe blast damage was felt within 1.75 miles of the detonation zone .
Severe heat damage was felt within 2.5 miles with the living things that survive the blast and heat suffocate from fire burning up all the oxygen .
Three miles out , fire and wind damage can still be found .
Keep in mind that winds at this radius had fallen off to 98 mph .
At its core , winds were estimated to be 320 mph .
As a comparison , a 20 Megaton explosion ( 20 million tons of TNT ) would have an optimum effect with a detonation at 17,500 feet .
The vaporization radius of nearly 9 miles would be 18 times greater than the Hiroshima bomb .
Total destruction would occur 14 miles out with severe blast damage conditions extending 27 miles from ground zero .
Everything flammable would be burning at 31 miles and damaging winds of near 100 mph would stretch out some 35 miles .
And keep this in mind …
The Soviet Union once designed a weapon , named the Tsar Bomb ( aka Tsar Bomba , Big Ivan and King of Bombs ) , to have a yield of 100 megatons , but it was only tested at 50 megatons to cut down on the fall out … so glad they cared .
The 2004 Indian Ocean Earthquake yielded 9,560 gigatons of TNT , which I suppose is over 9.5 trillion tons of TNT , but that was at the core .
The surface rupture energy release was just 26 megatons .
An earthquake in Chile in 1960 is said to have released 60,000 gigatons of TNT energy equivalent .
A typical Supernova has an energy release estimated to be around 10 octillian tons of TNT , which is 10 to the power of 28 .
So , man can build much greater destructive mechanisms than the initial atomic blast in the New Mexico desert or the second in Hiroshima or the third in Nagasaki .
But as the numbers bear out , man comes nothing remotely close to the energy release capability of nature , which is why some point out that it is rather arrogant to think that man can destroy the world .
But that is little consolation to those who suffer at the still massive destructive capability of man .
Atomic weapons have never have been used again thanks in large part to the awesomely devastating and tragic affect that “ Little Boy ” and then “ Fat Man ” brought on the Japanese Empire .
Let us hope that is a lesson never lost on the world .
So , what about Snow White ?
While Disney Studios has provided what could be the perfect wedding photo of my bride and I , my Snow White began her tale on this date in history .
She entered a world of such complication and fear , yet , she has since pranced about spreading joy and love and happiness to all creatures great and small who have crossed her path .
Even the uncontrolable Nit and Wit have fallen under her spell .
Walt Disney had come up with his own version eighteen years earlier but the teenager was no match for the little infant .
She grew up to be deemed an angel by many , a source of Faith and Hope to others and a wife to me .
She gives so much to so many , that I have to remind her that its sometimes good to receive .
Her volunteer work at the Cabbage Patch has been consistent and heart felt and the kids give her more love than I could ever muster in a single lifetime .
As much as I try , I will never be able to live up to the ideals of a Prince , so instead I have taken on the role of Dopey and I now have Hope that I have a place on this planet .
Anyone who has ever met Snow
White knows that she is a truely blessed soul .
The Lord was having a good day when he shared her with us on this date in history and every day since .

In the wake of the downfall of the Berlin Wall , the breakup of the Soviet Union , and the emergence of capitalism in China , I was asked to teach the comparative - economic - systems class at Auburn University for the summer term in 1989 .
My only exposure to the topic had been as an undergraduate student , where my teacher was a Cold War–era professor who concentrated almost exclusively on the Soviet Union .
His implicit message was to fear the Soviet Union , which would soon come to smother the American dream .
My assignment came at the last minute , so there would be no reviewing of textbooks and preparations of lectures in advance .
I spent the summer term preparing lectures on the fly and staying one chapter ahead of the students .
Also , I had to choose a textbook somehow , even though I was n't familiar with my options , which meant I did n't know what political punch line the author would deliver at the end .
My unorthodox choice was the recently published A Theory of Socialism and Capitalism by Hans - Hermann Hoppe .
My first exposure to Hans was at a public lecture he delivered to the economics faculty at Auburn University .
As I remember , his topic was the theory of public goods .
His German accent was particularly thick at this time and he read his manuscript as only Hans can — with precision and authority .
Public - goods theory was , and largely still is , sacred ground for most economists , and at the time it had not been subjected to many Austrian criticisms .
I remember being impressed by Hans 's detailed critique , but even more than that , the utter shock and surprise on the faces of the members of the economics departments .
When the lecture was completed you could have heard a pin drop .
The economics department was largely " free market " and " Austrian friendly , " but questioning the validity of public - goods theory was apparently a sort of desecration of Holy Scripture .
Afterwards , and for several days , I defended Hans and debated his position .
I would win over concession after concession in these debates with my professors , but failed to win a single convert .
The book arrived in the bookstore in time for my class , but it looked nothing like a textbook .
In fact , the production values of the book were the worst I had ever seen .
Neither of these factors mattered to me , but I do note them here to indicate that the deck was stacked against me the first day I walked into class .
Plus the class was completely full of students who had little or no interest in comparative economic systems ; they simply needed an elective of some type .
To my great surprise , the class went much better than I had hoped and was one of the most gratifying teaching experiences in my career .
Free - market - oriented economics students seemed to revel in the complete and utter devastation of socialism that would follow , but even outright socialist students and more unbiased minds appeared to have a certain respect for the material presented in class .
Much of the credit for this success I attribute to A Theory of Socialism and Capitalism , because more than three - quarters of class time relied specifically on the book .
" Russian - style socialism is the most obvious and recognizable form of socialism , but social democracy is the most common and dominant form of socialism . "
The success of the book in reaching the students rests first on that fact that it is a theoretical , rather than empirical , treatise that provides a clear , unambiguous analytical framework to understand any particular economy that a student might face .
Second , the book analyzes and debunks , or rather reconstructs , the two major " exceptions " of mainstream economics — monopoly and public - goods theory — and therefore presents economic theory as a unified whole .
Third , the moral and ethical aspects of economics and economic policy are introduced in an integrated and scientific fashion , and fourth , the book provides an understanding of economic and social change .
Although this latter point may not have been a primary aim of the author , it sure was handy to answer questions regarding why socialism was imploding — especially given that most other professors on campus were teaching that socialism and redistributionism of all kinds were the panacea for social ills .
In addition to all these positive traits of the book , long - time readers of Professor Hoppe will clearly recognize the consistency of his writings over time .
Beginning in the Garden of Eden ( so as to highlight the role of scarcity ) , he proceeds deductively to establish the concepts of property , contract , and aggression , and then to establish the meaning of pure capitalism as a social system based on property and the absence of coercion , while pure socialism is a system based on systemic violence and the absence of property rights .
In addition , he shows how each system impacts the personality and prosperity of individuals living in those systems .
From beginning to end , his argument is logically deduced and intuitively obvious .
Throughout , Hans is always alerting the reader to possible misconceptions and weaknesses that he will address later in the text .
Beginning with the familiar case of Russian - style socialism , capitalism is shown to be superior to an economy run by caretaker - central planners .
The absence of opportunity costs for the caretaker inevitably leads to reduced investment , misallocation , and overutilitzation of capital and labor .
Added to this critique is the impact on the personal character and personality of individuals in a socialist society because efficient use of resources and catering to the consumer are no longer rewarded , and so people gravitate toward " political " action .
Hoppe illustrates all this with a brief look at Russian - style economies and the natural experiment of East and West Germany , but modern westerners need only to take a close look at their own governments ' bureaucracies to understand the impact of socialism on character and personality .
Russian - style socialism is the most obvious and recognizable form of socialism , but social democracy is the most common and dominant form of socialism .
Here , the democratic process substitutes for the central authority .
Social - democratic socialism allows for some property rights to remain intact , although not immune from attack .
It initiates a system of taxation that takes the property of producers and a system of redistribution to enrich nonproducers .
The system does solve some problems of Soviet - style socialism and reduces others , but , in the end , it produces essentially the same type of results .
All conservative socialist systems — such as feudalism , monarchies , Nazism , and the Republican Party — lead to impoverishment just like social - democratic socialism .
Conservative socialism is at the opposite end of social - democratic socialism , but both also have many similarities .
Social democrats want " change , " while conservatives oppose it .
Social democrats want to redistribute property while conservatives want to enforce the status quo and " stay the course . "
Conservatives support price controls , regulations including antitrust policies , and behavioral controls like prohibitions .
Hoppe shows how the reality of mixed economies and ideologies make empirical examinations complex but that his theoretical framework provides clarity to all conservative socialist systems such as feudalism , monarchies , Nazism , and the Republican Party .
All lead to impoverishment just like social - democratic socialism .
Although most economists would not understand all the implications of these various types of socialism , many would now agree with Hoppe that Russian - style socialism is bad and that anything beyond moderate conservative or social - democratic socialism is also bad for the economy .
After analyzing these forms of socialism , the book turns to more controversial matters and the case for social engineering , where economists and other academics would prefer to implement only policies that " work " rather than blindly following some ideology .
Here ,
Hans embarks on an all - out onslaught on social engineering and its foundation in positivism .
This section and the following digression on epistemology required extensive class coverage supplemented with examples and illustrations , but it was well worth the investment to undermine the so - called pragmatic notion that we should only implement " what works . "
Social engineering , with its scientific veneer , is in reality not scientific at all ; in practice it is completely normative , and in the end is extremely dangerous .
The most controversial matter occurs in chapter seven : " The Ethical Justification of Capitalism and Why Socialism is Morally Indefensible , " Hoppe 's intriguing " argumentation ethics " defense of libertarian ethics .
The students found this interesting for many reasons , but the fact that it was an explicitly argued ethical position was something rather novel for them .
I drove home Hans 's core point where he demonstrates the moral superiority of capitalism over socialism in that " one cannot communicate and argue that one cannot communicate and argue " ( which , by the way , is contained in a parenthetical statement ) .
Some thought that this was some kind of trick , but most were willing to play along .
With the argument made , I told the students — for effect — that Hoppe 's argument against socialism is completely undermined when you examine collective action that is completely voluntary .
For example , Major League Baseball establishes and enforces all sorts of rules on its member teams ; family units can adopt Russian - style socialism if they wish ; homeowner associations can establish , change , and enforce rules on how and when lawns will be mowed and garbage will be collected ; fraternities can require that new members be spanked with wooden planks ; and entrepreneurs can require that patrons wear shoes or not smoke on their premises .
" Social engineering , with its scientific veneer , is in reality not scientific at all ; in practice it is completely normative , and in the end is extremely dangerous . "
Anything that socialism claims to accomplish ( and much more ) can be accomplished with voluntary agreements .
One bright , future economist in the class corrected me by pointing out that this really did not undermine Hans 's argument , because it was actually an argument for capitalism .
I think the fact that the " American way " is perceived to be more voluntary compared to other societies and that Hans was just taking volunteerism to its logical extreme helped win over many of the students to our position .
Without efficiency or morality to back it , socialism is then revealed as merely a parasitic state using the carrot of political favors and the stick of violence to live off its host .
Ultimately , the state uses propaganda of many forms to sustain an ideology that prevents the host from relieving itself of the parasite , and in class we had a wide - ranging discussion as to propaganda of the US government .
Hoppe notes that the best system for achieving and sustaining the goals of the parasite is democratic - majority rule , which of course would be a major theme of his book Democracy : The God that Failed .
Ultimately , the state finds its strength in the immortal words of Franklin Roosevelt — " the only thing we have to fear is fear itself " — meaning everything will be fine as long as we have the state to take care of us .
The last two chapters of the book deal with the problems of monopoly and public goods .
Here ,
Hans aptly shows that monopoly is not a problem of the free market but is solely a problem of the government 's own creation .
He then demolishes the theory of public goods and explains how the market addresses the issues of public goods and externalities .
This was all new information to the students , including the economics majors , and I employed several digressions using mainstream literature to back up Hans 's points .
As I tightened the noose around the neck of the mainstream theories of monopoly and public goods , using both deduction and illustrations , the students paid close attention and asked many questions .
In the end , I think the students appreciated this " new version " of economics , where there were no exceptions to the rules of economics and where there was a way in which the moral and ethical implications of economic systems could be analyzed .
The success of the book in reaching my students was based on the fact that it helped explain the turbulent changes that were occurring in the world , such as the fall of the Berlin Wall , the breakup of the Soviet Union , and the acceptance of capitalism in China .
In addition , the book presents economic analysis as a unified whole — without the exceptions of monopoly and public goods .
Furthermore , the book brings a moral and ethical analysis to comparative economic systems that is integrated into the economic analysis itself .
In short , A Theory of Socialism and Capitalism is a treatise that is a " breath of fresh air " for student and teacher alike .
I believe that my experience supports an important point regarding strategy and the future of Austrian economics .
Recall the reaction of my professors to the public lecture given by Hans Hoppe on public - goods theory .
They were shocked into denial and beyond any attempt to logically debate the issues raised .
Yes , public - goods theory could be criticized on any number of levels , but professional economists could not conceive of abandoning the concept in its entirety .
On the other hand , undergraduate students who were probably leery of the concepts of natural monopoly and public - goods theory to begin with were open to Hoppe 's criticisms , and many even accepted them .
Indeed , I think that most of the students welcomed the opportunity to be exposed to this radical alternative , with several of them embracing it in its entirety .e lesson here , I believe , is that Austrian economics should not proceed in a manner solely to gain acceptance among mainstream economists .
That is not to say that Austrians should withdraw from debates and not engage with other economists — far from it .
Lines of communication and debate should be maintained and discussions about commonalities and disagreements with other schools of economic thought should go forward , as is the great tradition of the Austrian School .
However , my experience with students suggests that the most fruitful strategy is to spread the knowledge of the Austrian School to as wide an audience as possible , particularly among those with an open mind .
The great practical advantage of the Austrian School is that it is a form of economic analysis that is founded in realism and helps us understand both progress and problems in the real world .
Therefore , it is a useful tool for people in the real world , but is of little use , and indeed is a threat , to mainstream academic economists .
One final point I would like to make is that , in 1989 when Hans published A Theory of Socialism and Capitalism , every textbook in comparative economic systems was obsolete because of events surrounding the downfall of communism .
In contrast , not only was Hans 's book timely but it has proven itself timeless in that it continues , twenty years later , to be as relevant as ever and a classic treatise on the subject .

AUSTRALIA AUSTRALIA : Did Galileo discover Neptune ?
Tweet Astronomy may need to credit Galileo Galilei with the discovery of the planet Neptune a full 234 years before the recognised discovery date of 1846 , an Australian physicist suggests .
Galileo certainly observed Neptune nearly 400 years ago - he recorded it in his notebooks - but apparently thought it was a star , not a planet .
Now Professor David N Jamieson , head of the school of physics at the University of Melbourne says there is evidence Galileo did indeed recognise Neptune as a planet .
If so , the planet 's discovery would be added to a list of breakthroughs including the discovery of Jupiter 's moons , the rings of Saturn , and the phases of Venus .
In a paper published in Australian Physics and reproduced on this site , Jamieson explains that Galileo observed Neptune in December 1612 and on 28 January 1613 .
The scientist 's notes suggest that during the latter observation he saw Neptune move when it passed close to a star , but he did not follow the matter up .
But Jamieson says the notebooks have an unlabelled ink mark on a 6 January observation .
The mark could have been made by Galileo after the 28 January observation to indicate the position of Neptune .
" If so , this would suggest he did indeed form the hypothesis that he had seen a new planet which had moved right across the field of view during his observations of Jupiter over the month of January 1613 . "
Jamieson says the date on which the ink mark was made could be identified using trace element analysis of the ink .
The analysis would identify differences in the composition of ink used on 6 January and 28 January , indicating when the mark was made .
But Jamieson says there is one other intriguing possibility .
Galileo sent cryptic anagrams to his correspondents as a means of establishing the primacy of his discoveries .
" It is therefore possible that there remains , undiscovered in the Galileo literature , an anagram put there by Galileo to establish the date of his discovery of Neptune , " he says .
" If Galileo had used his observations to propose the discovery of a new planet , it would have been the first time a planet had been discovered by humanity since deep antiquity , and would be without precedent in recorded history . "
* This year is the 400th anniversary of Galileo 's first discoveries using an astronomical telescope and has been designated the International Year of Astronomy by the United Nations .
