WASHINGTON , Oct. 9 — The Supreme Court today turned down the chance to elaborate for the first time in more than 50 years on the “ state secrets privilege ” by refusing to hear an appeal filed on behalf of Khaled el - Masri , who claims he was abducted and tortured by United States agents while imprisoned in Afghanistan .
Without comment , the justices let stand an appeals court ruling that the state secrets privilege , a judicially created doctrine that the Bush administration has invoked to win dismissal of lawsuits that touch on issues of national security , protected the government ’s actions from court review .
Mr. Masri , a German citizen of Lebanese descent , says he was detained while on vacation in Macedonia in late 2003 , transported by the United States to Afghanistan and held there for five months in a secret prison before being taken to Albania and set free , evidently having been mistaken for a terrorism suspect with a similar name .
Mr. Masri alleges that he was tortured while in the prison .
After investigating the case , German prosecutors earlier this year issued arrest warrants for 13 agents of the Central Intelligence Agency .
The German Parliament is continuing to investigate the incident , which has become one of the most public examples of the United States government ’s program of “ extraordinary rendition . ”

Last Sunday in San Francisco , the Anti-Defamation League sponsored " Finding Our Voice , " a conference designed to help Jews recognize and confront the " new anti-Semitism . "
For me , it was ironic .
Ten days before , my own voice was silenced by fellow Jews .
I was to give a talk about our Middle East policy to high school students at the Harker School in San Jose .
With one day to go , my contact there called to say my appearance had been canceled .
He was apologetic and upset .
He expected the talk would be intellectually stimulating and intriguing for students .
But , he said , " a certain community of parents " complained to the headmaster .
He added , without divulging details , that the Jewish Community Relations Council of Silicon Valley had played a role .
[ Editor 's note : Diane Fisher , executive director of the Jewish Community Relations Council of Silicon Valley , says that although she left a message for the school principal , she never actually spoke to him , and any suggestion that the council was responsible for the cancellation of Beinin 's appearance at the school is inaccurate and an " unlikely inflation of JCRC 's influence . " ]
I was raised a Zionist .
I went to Israel after high school for six months to live on a kibbutz .
I met my wife there .
We returned four years later thinking we 'd spend our lives on a kibbutz , working the land and living the Zionist dream .
Why did the council feel the need to silence me ?
In fact , this was not our first run-in .
I have long advocated equal rights for the Palestinians , as I do for all people .
I criticize Israeli policies .
I seem to have crossed the council 's line of acceptable discourse .
Because I am a Jew , it is not so easy to smear me as guilty of this " new anti-Semitism . "
Instead , hosts like the Harker School , and others , are intimidated , and open dialogue on Israel is censored .
In 2005 , Marin 's Rodef Sholom synagogue caved to the council and revoked my invitation , unless my talk could be accompanied by a rebuttal .
Roy Mash , a board member , resigned in protest .
He asked in his resignation letter whether " given Judaism 's long and deep tradition of concern for justice and ethics , a Jewish venue is ( not ) precisely the setting most appropriate for a speaker like Dr. Beinin ? "
I was indeed raised to believe that being Jewish meant being actively committed to social justice .
I moved to Israel expecting to pursue that ideal .
Yet much of what I saw there called this into question .
I tended livestock on Kibbutz Lahav , which was established on the ruins of three Palestinian villages .
The Palestinian inhabitants had been expelled and , because they are not Jewish , were unable to return .
One day , we needed extra workers to help clean manure from the turkey cages .
The head of the turkey branch said we should not ask for kibbutz members to do the work because , " This is n't work for Jews .
This is work for Arabushim . "
" Arabushim " is an extremely derogatory racial term .
I had participated in the civil rights movement in America , picketing Woolworth 's stores that would n't serve African Americans .
Yet in Israel I discovered the same , stark racism .
How could this bring peace between Palestinians and Israelis ?
While still living in Israel , I began to speak out for equal rights for Palestinians , as I had done for blacks in America .
Organizations claiming to represent American Jews engage in a systematic campaign of defamation , censorship and hate - mongering to silence criticism of Israeli policies .
They hollow the ethical core out of the Jewish tradition , acting instead as if the highest purpose of being Jewish is to defend Israel , right or wrong .
No one is spared .
New York University Professor Tony Judt also moved to Israel with notions of justice .
Judt learned , as I did , that most Israelis were " remarkably unconscious of the people who had been kicked out of the country and were suffering in refugee camps to make this fantasy possible . "
In October , the Polish Consulate in New York canceled a talk by Judt after pressure from the Anti-Defamation League and the American Jewish Committee .
Even former U.S. presidents are not immune .
Jimmy Carter has been the target of a smear campaign since the release of his latest book , " Palestine : Peace Not Apartheid . "
Carter 's most vociferous critics have not challenged him on the issues .
Rather , they discredit him with personal attacks , even insinuating that the man who has achieved more than any other American president in Arab / Israeli peacemaking is anti-Semitic .
Why discredit , defame and silence those with opposing viewpoints ?
I believe it is because the Zionist lobby knows it cannot win based on facts .
An honest discussion can only lead to one conclusion :
The status quo in which Israel declares it alone has rights and intends to impose its will on the weaker Palestinians , stripping them permanently of their land , resources and rights , cannot lead to a lasting peace .
We need an open debate and the freedom to discuss uncomfortable facts and explore the full range of policy options .
Only then can we adopt a foreign policy that serves American interests and one that could actually bring a just peace to Palestinians and Israelis .
IBM has announced that it too is throwing its hat into the free office suite ring by introducing a free word processor , spreadsheet , and presentation suite based on OpenOffice.org .
IBM describes the software , called Lotus Symphony , as " enterprise - grade " office software , with collaboration capabilities like those in Lotus Notes 8 .
Lotus Symphony will be able to run on Windows XP and Vista , several Linux platforms , with " support for Apple Macintosh planned for the future . "
" IBM is very pleased to be joining the OpenOffice.org community .
We are very optimistic that IBM 's contribution of technology and engineering resources will provide tangible benefits to the community membership and to users of OpenOffice.org technology around the world , " IBM 's Mike Rhodin said in a statement .
" But how does this differ from StarOffice ? " you may ask .
Parts of OpenOffice.org 1.x were integrated into IBM 's software several years ago , which were updated with a new UI and accessibility enhancements for the recently - released Lotus Notes 8 .
The applications in Lotus Symphony are just standalone applications of the same versions that are available as part of Notes .
Conversely , StarOffice is built off of the OO.org 2.x code with some contributions from Sun , and so the two are slightly branched from one another .
One more difference between StarOffice and Lotus Symphony is file format compatibility .
IBM says that Lotus Symphony apps will support the Open Document Format ( ODF ) and PDF , as well as Microsoft native file formats ( .doc , .xls , .ppt ) .
IBM does warn , however , that not all Office - created documents will open flawlessly , particularly those that make use of embedded macros or are encrypted .
The move comes as a direct challenge to Microsoft Office and its dominance of the enterprise market .
While OpenOffice.org has never made much of an impact on Office 's market share , IBM 's repackaging and support of the free software solution could attract many more users over to the platform .
Other free office solutions , such as Google 's collection of apps , are also said to challenge Office , although some parties are highly skeptical that the free , basic applications can truly address the needs of enterprise customers .
IBM hopes that it will have an advantage in the enterprise , however , with its good name and well - known support giving the product a boost above the competition .
Israeli President Moshe Katsav resigned today , a day after admitting to sex crimes against women employees in a case that has brought unprecedented disgrace on an Israeli head of state .
When his resignation from the largely ceremonial post takes effect on Sunday , the speaker of parliament will be president for two weeks .
Former prime minister Shimon Peres , elected earlier this month to replace Katsav , takes office on July 15 .
Parliament spokesman Giora Pordes said Katsav had written to legislators saying : " I ask to end my tenure in office two weeks ahead of time and announce my resignation . "
He cited Mosul and Baquba , in the north , and Basra , in the south , as being among the cities refusing to route electricity elsewhere .
“ This greatly influenced the distribution of power throughout Iraq , ” Mr. Wahid complained .
At times the hoarding of power provides cities around power plants with 24 hours of uninterrupted electricity , a luxury that is unheard of in Baghdad , where residents say they generally get two to six hours of power a day .
Mr. Wahid said Baghdad was suffering mainly because the provinces were holding onto the electricity , but he said shortages of fuel and insurgents ’ strikes on gas and oil pipelines also contributed to the anemic output in the capital .
Although a refusal by provincial governments to provide their full quotas to Baghdad could easily be seen as greedy when electricity is in such short supply , many citizens near the power plants regard the new reality as only fair ; under Saddam Hussein , the capital enjoyed nearly 24 hours a day of power at the expense of the provinces that are now flush with electricity .
Keeping electricity for the provinces , said Mohammed al - Abbasi , a journalist in Hilla , in the south , “ is a reaction against the capital , Baghdad , as power was provided to it without any cuts during the dictator ’s reign . ”
Other Iraqis are just grateful for anything that brings more comfort to their families and neighborhoods .
“ We support any step that provides us with power , ” said Ahmed Abdul Hussein , an ironsmith in Najaf , in the south .

Hard drives have long utilized small bits of cache memory to boost performance , and some recent hybrid hard drives already combine up to 256MB of NAND flash memory with traditional platter - based storage .
Now a Japanese company called DTS has taken the idea of hybrid drives in a slightly different direction , having just unleashed a new type of hard drive called Mcell that offers 1GB of on - drive cache using standard DDR RAM .
DTS markets the disc as being a significantly cheaper way to get some of the benefits of solid state drives without the price .
The Mcell is an interesting beast .
In terms of size , it fits in the standard 3.5 " form factor , but inside it actually contains a 2.5 " 5400rpm hard drive , a stick of 1GB DDR2 RAM , and a special chip from DTS that contains a real - time OS and CPU .
Do n't let the slow RPM fool you .
The combination of the write - through cache and the 2.5 " disc should afford much quicker access times than with 3.5 " 7200 r pm drives .
According to DTS , the additional memory combined with its I/O management chip drastically improves hard drive transfer speeds : the drive sees speeds above 110MBps in random read tests for data sizes of 64KB to 512MB .
Larger data samples than that , of course , will tend to go outside the cache and performance will drop off .
And we need remind you that these are manufacturers claims , so take them with a grain of salt .
If trustworthy , 110MBps is an impressive figure considering that many 7200rpm SATA hard drives have sustained transfer rates on the order of 60 MBps , and the SATA interface itself tops out at 150 MBps .
Again , this data makes sense to us because of the benefits of the smaller 2.5 " drive and the random read / writes of small bits of data .
The Mcell hard drive .
Photo courtesy DTS
The drive will initially be available in 80GB , 120GB , and 160 GB sizes , with the 80 GB model selling for ¥ 15,800 ( $ 136.15 ) .
According to the drive 's product page , it contains a " quick boot up option " as well as a " one - stop software failure option , " although it 's not entirely clear how the latter will work .
Hybrid hard drives are seeing increased interest among systems builders , professional and enthusiast , with operating system features such as Windows Vista 's ReadyBoost promising to increase overall system performance .
As RAM gets faster and cheaper , Flash - based drives become more attractive to system builders looking for fast performance and low power consumption .
Hybrid hard drives are also likely to become more popular as they combine the fast transfer rates of Flash - based devices with the larger storage capacity of traditional magnetic drives .
While the Mcell is n't a " true " hybrid drive — those have nonvolatile Flash RAM on board — it is a stepping stone on the way to the next generation of hybrid storage .
Additional images can be found at Akiba , where the availability of the standalone drives was first reported .
Mcell is currently available in Japan , but we 're trying to find out when and if these drives will be coming to North America .
DTS has been selling technology under the Mcell name for a couple of years but has previously focused on the RAID market .

Every time I buckle my son into his car seat - positioned between the side impact air bags and above the antilock brakes in our five - star safety - rated automobile - I think about my preferred mode of travel in the summer of 1983 .
I spent that season at the Connecticut wilderness home of a friend from elementary school , who was moving from the Bay Area to the East Coast .
When it was time to drive the station wagon down the mountain road , his father would often give us a choice :
Would we like to ride in the backseat or on the roof of the car ?
In retrospect , this was probably a really bad idea .
If two 12 - year - olds were seen traveling on the roof of a car in 2007 , it would likely trigger an Amber Alert , four dozen cell phone calls to Child Protective Services and a viral YouTube video to be played endlessly on " Nancy Grace . "
But I 'm sort of glad it happened .
Being perched on the top of that slow - moving Ford Country Squire was a small risk ( remember , this was the pre-Ford Taurus 1980s , when station wagons had giant luggage racks that were practically made for passenger travel ) , but there was also a reward .
Riding on the roof of that car made me a little bit less of a wuss .
The wussification of American children is a relatively recent phenomenon , but a very real one .
We pamper our kids , over - schedule them , overemphasize fairness in competition ( the score ends in a tie ... again ! ) and keep them indoors too much , to the point that we 're doing them a huge disservice .
Kids are n't learning how to get hurt , lose , fend for themselves , find their balance and discover minor dangers on their own - all important parts of growing up .
The most encouraging parenting - related quote I 've heard this year came from Peter Cornall , the head of leisure safety for the Royal Society for the Prevention of Accidents in England ( best business card title ... ever ) , who says that overprotective parenting can hurt the development of children .
" Parents and children must not be frightened about venturing outside , " he told the London Times in a June article .
" When children spend time in the great outdoors , getting muddy , getting wet , getting stung by nettles , they learn important lessons - what hurts , what is slippery , what you can trip over or fall from .
We need to try to break down the perceived safety barriers to playing outside . "
I do n't think he 's saying people should get rid of their car seats or start smoking two packs a day while they 're pregnant again .
The point is to take some time and rediscover a few forgotten traditions , particularly ones that take place outdoors .
The popularity of " The Dangerous Book for Boys " is one great sign that coddling may be on the wane .
That best - seller by brothers Conn and Hal Iggulden focuses on traditions - including how to build a tree house and instructions for making a go - cart - that are facing extinction in our paranoid parenting culture .
Accompanying this article are a few more " dangerous " things families can do together in the Bay Area , all chosen to help you de-wussify your brood .
You may need to bring some Bactine now - but your kids will thank you later .

Introduction
The following story is a highly disturbing account of a roommate that more or less slowly descends into madness .
This eventually reaches a point where dead animals are stored inside an oven and defecation takes place in a variety of places that are distinctly not the toilet bowl .
As the story was posted on the Something Awful Forums in 2005 by a user named Martin Random , I have no way of verifying its accuracy or truthfulness .
Regardless , it is still a classic , disturbing and frankly hilarious story and should be enjoyed as such .
Fuck the Bible , this is the greatest story ever told .
ArousingWedgie
Shortly after the story was posted , I rehosted it on this website and it enjoyed some success and popularity on the Internet .
Due to changes in the site and its hosting , the story was lost for a number of years .
Recently , however , I came across the original source files and have decided to rehost the story once again for all to enjoy .
I would like to specifically note that the copyright of the story and the accompanying images , which were added by forum members Shii and easyjo , are not mine .

Bush Says He 's Keeping Eye On Kurdish Oil Deal
By Andrew Tully
WASHINGTON , September 20 , 2007 ( RFE / RL ) --
In a White House news conference , U.S. President George W. Bush today again defended his " surge " strategy in Iraq , acknowledging that while goals have n't been met as fast as he would like , the fight must continue .
He said those goals include a country that can govern itself , sustain itself and defend itself and is an ally against extremists and radicals .
Bush has repeatedly said the point of his surge strategy in Iraq is to give the Iraqi government the security it needs to seek reconciliation in the divided country .
One part of that effort was a national oil law that would let all Iraqis share the revenues of their country ’s most valuable natural resource .
That law has been a long time coming and is still stalled in Iraq 's parliament .
Meanwhile , the regional government of the Kurds in northern Iraq has signed a separate contract allowing the Hunt Oil Company of Texas -- owned by a Bush supporter -- to drill for oil on its territory .
' I Knew Nothing '
Today , Bush was asked how he feels about the Hunt deal , and whether it's a factor in the delay of the national revenue - sharing law .
" Our embassy also expressed concern about it .
I knew nothing about the deal .
I 'm -- I need to know exactly how it happened , " Bush said .
" To the extent that it does undermine the ability for the government to come up with [ an ] oil revenue - sharing plan that unifies the country , obviously I 'm -- if it undermines that , I 'm concerned . "
But Bush added that he has n't lost hope in the nationwide oil law .
He said once it is passed , the country 's Sunni , Shi'as , and Kurds will recognize that Prime Minister Nuri al - Maliki ’s government is serious about reconciliation .
Bush also was asked about the recent deaths of Iraqi civilians in a firefight in Baghdad involving employees of Blackwater USA , a private U.S. security contractor .
At least 11 Iraqis were killed , according to local officials , and the Iraqi government has revoked Blackwater 's license to operate there .
Bush expressed sorrow at the deaths , but said Blackwater had been required to follow strict rules when confronting a suspected threat .
He said a joint U.S. - Iraqi panel will determine exactly what happened .
" The folks [ who work at companies ] like Blackwater , who provide security for the State Department , are under rules of engagement , " he said .
" In other words , they have certain rules .
And this commission will determine whether or not they violated those rules .
And I 'm looking forward to finding out what the results are . "
Ahmadinejad Comments
On another subject , one reporter asked about recent comments by French Foreign Minister Bernard Kouchner that the world should be prepared for war with Iran if Tehran acquires nuclear weapons .
Bush replied that the United States and its allies are still trying to resolve Iran 's nuclear ambitions through diplomacy .
Yet he expressed concern about some of the more strident statements made by Iranian President Mahmud Ahmadinejad .
" It 's very important for us to take the threats coming out of the mouth of the president of Iran very seriously , " Bush said .
" This is a person that is , you know , constantly talks about the use of force on Israel , for example , and Israel 's our very firm and strong ally . "

Chris Rock thinks George W. Bush is a retard .
In the latest issue of Life magazine , featuring Chris on the cover , Rock is asked , " Is this country ready for an African American president ? "
Rock answered , " It 's ready for a retarded president , why would n't it be ready for an African American president ? "
Oh no he did n't !
Rock went on to say that he likes Al Gore , and that he does n't expect to see a black president in his lifetime .
The comedian , doing publicity for " I Think I Love My Wife , " also took the opportunity to quash persistent rumors that his marriage was in trouble .
" My marriage is just like everybody else 's , " Rock said .
" Great like everybody else 's and whatever like everybody else 's .
Everything 's fine . "

Until the monks were seized or held prisoner in their monasteries by General Than Shwe 's troops last Thursday night , they led the heroic demonstrations in Burma , proving a trend of modern times that organised religion is very often the only means people have of challenging a dictatorship and bringing about the enlightened political values that Hitchens holds dear .
He will know that among the many things forgotten about the neglected miracle of the uprising in East Germany in 1989 is that it all began in a Lutheran church - the Nikolaikirche in Leipzig - when a pastor called Christian Fuhrer inaugurated prayers for peace after the Monday evening service .
It was a small gesture of defiance but through September 1989 , the crowds swelled in the square outside the church .
Many carried candles to show that they planned no violence or vandalism , the idea being that you cannot throw a brick when you 're shielding a candle in the night air .
The vanguard of barefoot monks in Rangoon denoted the same peaceful intention .
The turning point in Germany came on 9 October when 400,000 people filled the centre of the city .
From then on , the communist regime in the GDR , among the most repressive in Eastern Europe , was doomed , although no one could have predicted that 31 days later the Berlin Wall would fall and the regimes in Czechoslovakia and Romania would follow quickly .
No one had any doubt about what had happened at the Nikolaikirche .
One of the six luminaries of the Leipzig protests , Bernd - Lutz Lange , remarked that the leadership was not a person , but a place .
' There was no one leader of the revolution .
In fact , the only leadership was Monday , 5 pm , the Nikolaikirche . '
The discussions about freedom of speech , travel , assembly and association would have taken place anyway .
The point is that church provided the institutional context in which to challenge the state , while the faith of so many ordinary people gave them the courage to go into the streets on that critical evening when paratroops had been flown in , the Stasi were armed and hospitals cleared to receive hundreds of casualties .
Together , faith and passive mass resistance create an inspired force that is more than the sum of the parts .
That is why the churches across the GDR in 1989 and temples in Burma last week were points of ignition .
I do n't say it always happens - the Archbishop of San Salvador , Oscar Romero , was shunned by Catholic colleagues before being shot in his cathedral in 1980 - just that religion can be a platform of resistance and any history of liberty and modern civilisation must concede that .
There are other striking similarities between Burma and Germany The GDR was ruled by an inflexible and out - of - touch gerontocracy led by Erich Honecker .
Like the aged Burmese generals , Honecker 's party officials lived in privileged enclaves with every possible service and luxury , while the people went without .
Both regimes made the mistake of allowing conditions where the people had nothing but their lives to lose .
The GDR was a political dependency of the USSR , as Burma is of China .
In October 1989 , Mikhail Gorbachev went to the GDR to attend the country 's 40th anniversary celebrations .
During the visit , he made some not - so - off - the - cuff remarks to a TV reporter about history penalising those who did not change with the times .
In their oblique way , the Chinese may be saying the same to the Burmese junta , although there is a difference in relationship .
While the GDR needed Soviet oil , the Chinese are desperate for Burmese oil .
Yet the Chinese sense the danger of this extraordinary movement in Burma and they must wonder if the course of their own peculiar political evolution is threatened by infection from their client state , as was the Soviet Union by the revolutions in Europe .
The Chinese want the Burmese situation to go away as quickly as possible .
That may have been achieved for the time being , but the fire has been lit and the resolve of the people and monks may yet prevail .
Much was made last week of the way the Burmese used the internet and mobile phones to skirt round the fierce censorship by the regime , often sending tiny fragments of a picture or report by text message .
In the autumn of 1989 , there were no mobile phones in East Germany , Apple had just released its first laptop and an obscure scientist , Tim Berners - Lee , had only just published his paper on hypertext , describing the idea of a web .
Communication was at a minimum .
Just one camera hidden and fixed along the route partially filmed the historic march on 9 October , which is why the West underestimated what was happening .
I am not persuaded that the internet and mobile phone make peaceful uprising easier .
In the technology race between state and the people , the state has constantly moved to control technology or equip itself with the means of spying on its citizens , as in Britain and the USA .
The Chinese first censored Google , then allowed the US search engine to censor itself , which , if nothing else , proves that a company which celebrated its ninth birthday last week has the morals to match its age .
Still , it has been difficult not to be moved by the film coming out of Burma , particularly of Aung San Suu Kyi receiving the marchers in the pouring rain .
Seeing this marriage between the heroic , poised secularity of the elected leader and the staunchness of the monks , I wondered if the Palestinians were not missing a trick .
The circumstances in the Middle East are obviously different , but peaceful processions in Gaza and along the Israeli defence wall , processions that excluded the bully boys firing AK47s from the back of pick - up trucks , may well have an arresting effect on world opinion and attitudes in Israel .
But the thing that should come to us as we allow the sequestration of our rights to assemble in Parliament Square , to communicate without being monitored and to move about without being watched is that once these things disappear into the vaults of the state , we face a long , perilous fight to reclaim them .
The crowds in Burma could only offer passive resistance to Than Shwe 's forces .
They may look beaten now , but their day will come , even if the general resorts to mass internment and large - scale executions .
World opinion is activated and on the eve of the Olympics , China must move to control him .
In Germany , the regime was restrained by the Soviet Union which refused to mobilise any of the hundreds of thousands of troops stationed the GDR .
Yet the actual reason the demonstration in Leipzig on 9 October did not end in bloodshed was that on the morning of that extraordinary day , a statement was read from the pulpits of every church in the city appealing for peace and self - control .
The pastors gave that message authority and the people courage .
Without them , the most peaceful revolution ever seen would have been very different .
The monks have been beaten and their monasteries sacked in Burma , yet they have served the cause of freedom and their religion well .

To vprašanje sem si zastavljal zadnjih nekaj dni .
Vprašanje , ki deluje kot evolucija prejšnjega je , kako najlažje do neke smotrne predstavitve teh podatkov .
Na spletu so se pojavile plačljive storitve , ki to omogočajo , vendar so predrage in delujejo prepočasi .
Pa sem sestavil wordpress razširitev , ki počne prav to .
Akumulira klike obiskovalcev in jih predstavi na " vročinski klik karti " .
Recimo za primer lahko pogledamo tale prikaz klikov iz strani e-horoskop .
Gledamo 1538 zabele ženih klikov .
To zaradi različnega rendranja vsebine spletnih strani .
Prav tako je situacija podobna , če ima kateri izbrane zelo veliko ( majhno ) pisavo .
Prihaja tudi do zaokrožitvene napake pri izračunavi pozicije ob različnih velikostih okna brskalnika .
Ko to naštevam hočem poudariti , da je potreben večji vzorec za dober občutek kaj se dogaja na neki strani .
Na zgornji sliki je precej jasno , da obiskovalci največkrat kliknejo na gumbe za izbiro rojstnih datumov , ki se nato razširi v seznam in tako prihaja še do klikov navzgor in navzdol .
Nisem pa še uspel pojasniti klikov na zunanji levi strani , ki se pojavijo samo na straneh z bioritmom .
Ima kdo kak šno idejo ?

Income inequality worst since 1920s , according to IRS data Nick Juliano
Published : Friday October 12 , 2007

The superrich are gobbling up an ever larger piece of the economic pie , and the poor are seeing their share of earnings shrink : new IRS data shows the top 1 percent of Americans are claiming a larger share of national income than at any time since before the Great Depression .
The top percentile of wealthy Americans earned 21.2 percent of all income in 2005 , up from 19 percent in 2004 , according to new Internal Revenue Service data published in the Wall Street Journal Friday .
Americans in the bottom 50 percent of wage earners saw their share of income shrink to 12.8 percent in 2005 , down from 13.4 percent .
" Scholars attribute rising inequality to several factors , " the Journal reports , " including technological change that favors those with more skills , and globalization and advances in communications that enlarge the rewards available to ' superstar ' performers whether in business , sports or entertainment . "
The data could cause problems to President Bush and Republican presidential candidates , who have played up low unemployment and a strong economy since 2003 , crediting Bush 's tax cuts for contributing to both .
In an interview with the Journal , Bush downplayed the significance of the income gap , saying more education is the answer to narrowing it .
" First of all , our society has had income inequality for a long time .
Secondly , skills gaps yield income gaps , " Bush told the Journal .
" And what needs to be done about the inequality of income is to make sure people have got good education , starting with young kids .
That 's why No Child Left Behind is such an important component of making sure that America is competitive in the 21st century . "
The Journal notes that many Americans fear the economy is entering a recession , and the IRS data show income for the median earner fell 2 percent between 2000 and 2005 to $ 30,881 .
Earnings for the top 1 percent grew to $ 364,657 -- a 3 percent uptick .
Scholarly research suggests that top earners did not have such a large share of total income since the 1920s , the Journal reported .
The Journal reports that a recent stock boom likely contributed to higher earnings among those in the top income bracket , with hedge fund managers and Wall Street attorneys seeing their incomes skyrocket in recent years .
Another prominent pool or wealthy Americans gathers regularly on Capitol Hill to write the nation 's laws .
The Center for Responsive Politics , which tracks campaign spending and politicians ' wealth , says more than a third of Congress members are millionaires , with at least half the Senate falling into the millionaires club .
Forbes reported that last year 's incoming class of new Senators did " little to shake the Senate 's image as a millionaires club , " with half of the newly elected members having seven - eight - or nine - figure personal fortunes .
Freshman Sen. Bob Corker ( R - TN ) is worth between $ 64 million and $ 236 million , and newly elected Sen.
Claire McCaskill 's ( D - MO ) fortune is between $ 13 million and $ 29 million .
R Roll Call estimates Sen. John Kerry ( D - MA ) is the chamber 's richest member with an estimated net worth of $ 750 million ; another Democrat , Wisconsin Sen .
Herb Kohl , is among the chamber 's richest with between $ 220 million and $ 234 million in personal assets .
Eating pizza in a restaurant at lunchtime , I caught wind of two men on the table behind me discussing the perils of interior design .
Man 1
" She showed me all the paints and asked me which one I liked .
I said I did n't mind - that we'd get whatever she wanted . "
Man 2
" How did that go down ? "
Man 1
" Well she lost it , there and then .
Starts saying I do n't care , I do n't take enough of interest , all that number . "
Man 2
" Yeah , they resent all that .
You say ' you decide ' and it's like a red rag . "
Man 1
" So I 've gone the other way - if you want my opinion you can have it , you know what I 'm saying ? "
Man 2 " I hear you . "
Man 1
" So I 've looked at 'em all , and said what I like and now , of course , we can't agree .
She 's chosen different ones from me so I really throw myself into it .
There 's 48 paints on the chart , right ?
And there 's six that we like between us .
So I said to her we 'll have six points each to give to our favourite paints - distribute them any way we like - and then the one with the most points is the colour we use .
Man 2 " Brilliant ! "
Man 1 " Innit ?
But then I 've gone a step further .
I give all six of my points to the one I like and she 's split all hers up into one point fives like I knew she would .
So I 've won ! "
Man 2 ( Laughing )
" You 've gone too far there ! "
Man 1
" I know , and I could see she was upset , so I just said , look , why do n't you choose ? "
Man 2
" That 's fair .
What colour did you end up with up ? "
Man 1 ( Proudly , through a mouthful of food ) " Impala . "
“ I am disappointed the leadership of Congress recycled an old bill that would simply overturn our country ’s carefully balanced policy on embryonic stem cell research , ” Mr. Bush said in a statement .
“ If this bill were to become law , American taxpayers would for the first time in our history be compelled to support the deliberate destruction of human embryos .
Crossing that line would be a grave mistake . ”
Critics of the legislation said taxpayer dollars should not be used to increase spending on embryonic stem cell research , particularly in the wake of a new scientific advance reported Wednesday in which biologists believe they can use skin to generate new heart , liver or kidney cells .
Such a technique , if proven successful , could sidestep the ethical debates surrounding stem cell research .
Throughout the Congressional debate , several Republicans who oppose the legislation seized upon reports of the new scientific advance .
“ How many more advancements in noncontroversial , ethical , adult stem cell research will it take before Congress decides to catch up with science ? ” said Representative Joseph Pitts , a Pennsylvania Republican , holding up a front - page newspaper account of the scientific discovery .
“ These have all of the potential and none of the controversy . ”
While those who support increasing the federal financing of embryonic stem cell research also hailed the development , they said such advances should not replace expanding research to press for a litany of diseases , including Alzheimer ’s and juvenile diabetes .
We 'll always have the memories .

DC Comics President Paul Levitz has been talking about what 's coming up on the DC movie slate , and there 's little update on anything other than letting us know that there can be a long time between signing and a movie .
However he has some words of personal hope for the long awaited movie version of Watchmen .
From SuperHero Hype :
" Warners is looking at Watchmen right now .
I believe they are looking for a director at the moment .
I negotiated the Watchmen film deal when the third issue of the maxi-series was coming out in 1985 or 1986 .
It 's been through Fox , Universal , Paramount so far and now it's at Warners .
God knows .
I think it's an extraordinary difficult property to do right as a film .
It is a creative property that is very specifically designed for the medium in which it is published .
I think it 's a real challenge to break out and do it .
I think they had a very interesting script and certainly Paul Greengrass is a great director , so I had some hope for the Paramount one .
I hope Warner will be able to put something great around it . "
Spot on , and I would n't expect anything else from the DC Pres .
It 's both a good and bad sign that he views it as specifically for the original medium and not film .
I thought Greengrass was the best hope the film had , and that fell at the hands of accountants and business reorganisation .
Perhaps we might have to concede that this will just never be made ?

Amy Winehouse is one of Universal 's artists
It will allow the sale of thousands of albums and tracks available in MP3 - form without the protection , known as digital rights management ( DRM ) .
Most major recording studios insist music sellers use DRM technology to curb online piracy .
Universal artists include 50 Cent , the Black Eyed Peas , and Amy Winehouse .
Universal said : " The experiment will run from August to January and analyze such factors as consumer demand , price sensitivity and piracy in regards to the availability of open MP3s . "
Retailers including Google , Wal - Mart , and Amazon.com , will participate in the DRM - free trial , Universal said .
But participants do not include Apple iTunes online music store , the third largest music retailer in the US - although iTunes already offers a selection of music from EMI free of copy protection , albeit for a higher price .

“ It ’s a lot , ” she said , enough to cover 60 square miles half an inch deep every year , an amount that would slow or even reverse land loss in the state ’s marshes , which have shrunk by about a quarter , more than 1,500 square miles , since the 1930’s .
Such a program would not turn things around immediately , “ but every year new land would be built , ” said Joseph T. Kelley , a professor of marine geology at the University of Maine , who took part in the April meeting .
As the bird - foot delta broke up , Dr. Reed said , it would provide needed sediment to the frail strings of barrier islands that line some of the Louisiana coast .
Another potential benefit , Mr. Hanchey said , would come from the substantial nutrient runoff from inland agriculture in chemicals that contribute to the so - called dead zone of oxygen - poor water near the river ’s mouth .
Applied to the marsh , the nutrients might encourage desirable plants , he said .
Designing such a diversion would be complex and time - consuming , and the experts who met in April did not even attempt it .
Even this fall ’s meeting is not to plan the project , but to plan how the project should be planned , Mr. Hanchey said .
Though Louisiana is rich in experts on river , wetland and coastal science , he said , state officials hoped to recruit scientists and engineers from all over the world to tell them “ what we would have to know before we could initiate work on something like this , and what we would have to do to gain that knowledge . ”
In a way , the bird - foot delta is an artifact of engineering .
Without the levees and other structures that keep the river in place , it probably would have taken another path .
Like many major rivers , the Mississippi has tributaries , which feed water into it , and distributaries , which carry water away from it as it nears its mouth .
Its tributaries include the Missouri and Ohio Rivers ; one way or another , every stream , storm drain and parking lot from the Rockies to the Appalachians drains into the Mississippi .
But about 250 miles from the gulf , near Lettsworth , La. , the river stops taking water in and starts feeding it out , into the gulf through the main stem of bird - foot delta but also in distributaries like the Atchafalaya River , which flows into Atchafalaya Bay to the west .
Until people interfered with its flow , the Mississippi ’s path to the gulf silted up naturally over time ; water flow slowed and the river bed lost its capacity to carry a big flood .
When next the big flood came , the river would suddenly turn one of its distributaries into its new main stem .
P2P video service Joost quietly slipped its 1.0 beta for Mac and Windows out the door late last week , and we were curious as to why there was no fanfare for the ( almost ) 1.0 release .
It turns out that the team was holding off on the celebrations for today , as it has announced via the Joost blog that Joost is now open to the public .
No longer will curious testers be forced to beg their friends for Joost invites ( does this mean I will stop getting a steady stream of e-mails requesting invites too ? ) as anyone who wants to watch the streaming video channels can now do so at their leisure .
Joost sprang forth from the minds of Skype 's Janus Friis and Kazaa 's Niklas Zennström last year , dubbed originally as The Venice Project .
The service was launched with the goal of offering ad - supported television content over the Internet , but through a distributed streaming model like that of BitTorrent — instead of pulling video content from a central server , it would instead stream it from multiple users around the ' Net .
The P2P service opened up to its first small group of beta testers in December and was renamed to Joost this January .
Since then , Joost has been slowly ramping up .
Media giant Viacom signed a deal with Joost in February that would allow the service to broadcast shows from MTV , BET , Comedy Central , and even a few movies from Paramount .
The move came just after Viacom walked away from talks with YouTube and just before it filed its $ 1 billion lawsuit against the site for " brazen " copyright infringement .
CBS was next to hop on board with Joost with a few of its shows ; CNN joined the party in May with content from Larry King Live and Cartoon Network 's Adult Swim .
Major League Baseball also inked a deal with Joost just last week , allowing the video service to stream the upcoming MLB playoffs within 24 hours of initial airing .
While many of those shows are popular with viewers , Joost is still extremely limited in its content selection — most users cannot survive on Larry King and Adult Swim alone .
The video service may be free , but the lack of fresh content is still driving many TV aficionados to paid services like the iTunes Store to get a much wider selection of shows or the world of BitTorrent for an even wider selection sans cost .
There 's also still the dilemma of getting that content onto the actual television set .
A recent survey by Accenture showed that the majority of Internet users would rather watch video downloads on the TV instead of on their monitors , which is something that Apple , Microsoft , and even Amazon are attempting to do with the Apple TV , Xbox 360 , and TiVo , respectively .
Joost has yet to find an official hardware partner , however , which means that users who want to watch Joost programming on the TV will need to use an HTPC .
That 's a fine solution for the tech - savvy audience , but it has a very limited reach when it comes to the general population .
Joost 's public debut is sure to net a number of new users who were unable to score invites during the service 's private beta period .
But until Joost manages to sign on more content partners and figures out a way to make its way to the TV screen , it will find itself fighting an uphill battle against competing video services .

Scaring lawmakers to sell FISA
A couple of years ago , former Homeland Security chief Tom Ridge acknowledged that the Bush administration periodically put the USA on high alert for terrorist attacks based on flimsy evidence .
“ There were times when some people were really aggressive about raising it , and we said , ‘ For that ? ' ”
Ridge told reporters .
The answer , of course , was to scare the bejeezus out of people , in the hopes that Bush ’s approval ratings would go up , the administration could get more power , or both .
Sometimes , though , the scare tactics are directed at lawmakers themselves .
Roll Call reported in early August , “ Capitol Police officials have stepped up the department ’s security presence on Capitol Hill in response to intelligence indicating the increased possibility of an al - Qaida terrorist attack on Congress sometime between now and Sept. 11 . ” Sen. Trent Lott ( R - Miss . ) turned up the heat , adding “ Congress needed to pass changes to terrorist surveillance laws before leaving for the August recess and warned that otherwise ‘ the disaster could be on our doorstep . ' ”
And therein lied the point : Congress was debating whether ( and how ) to revise FISA when lawmakers were told al Qaeda might attack Capitol Hill directly .
The message to members had all the subtlety of a sledgehammer — give the administration more sweeping powers , immediately , or your lives are on the line .
Newsweek , following up on comments Rep. Jane Harman ( D - Calif. ) made to the Center for American Progress Action Fund , reports that the threats may have been a scam .
A leading House Democrat has charged that congressional Republicans promoted “ bogus ” intelligence about a reputed terror threat on Capitol Hill last summer , inflaming debate over the Bush administration ’s proposal to dramatically expand the U.S. government ’s electronic surveillance powers .
Rep. Jane Harman , who chairs a key homeland - security subcommittee , has provided new details this week about an alarming intel report in August that warned of a possible Al Qaeda attack on the Capitol .
The report , which was quickly discredited , was circulated on Capitol Hill at a critical moment : just as the administration was mounting a major push for a new surveillance law that would permit the U.S. intelligence community to intercept suspected terrorist communications without seeking approval from the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court .
To be sure , I ’ve argued that Dems handled the debate poorly , and rushed to give Bush too much of what he wanted , without checks and balances .
But this at least points to a mitigating factor .
In the days before the vote on the surveillance bill in early August , the U.S. Capitol Police suddenly stepped up security procedures , and one top Republican senator , Trent Lott , seemed to allude to the report when he claimed that “ disaster could be on our doorstep ” if the Congress did n’t immediately act .
Inside the Congress , “ there was a buzz about this , ” Harman told NEWSWEEK .
“ There was an orchestrated campaign to basically gut FISA [ the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act ] , and this piece of uncorroborated intelligence was used as part of it . ”
In fact , the intel report that provoked the concern was never publicly cited by the Bush administration in the run up to the surveillance bill — and was clearly labeled as unreliable when it was first passed to the U.S. Capitol police over the summer .
The report lacked any specifics and was based on a foreign intelligence source U.S. officials did not view to be credible .
( A written summary of the report , which made clear its limits , was also provided to the House and Senate Intelligence Committees . )
But the alleged misuse of the information by some members of Congress illustrates the perils of one of the major changes instituted after the September 11 attacks : a commitment by U.S. intelligence officials to share with state and local law - enforcement agencies all reports about prospective terror threats in their communities no matter how vague and unreliable .
“ This stuff falls under the category of , ‘ somebody , somewhere , some day is going to do something , ’ said a congressional aide who works on intelligence issues but who asked not to be identified talking about sensitive information .
In the past , many law - enforcement and intelligence professionals viewed it as irresponsible and unduly alarmist to pass along such uncorroborated reports .
But now they are routinely shared — lest federal officials are later accused of “ holding back ” information that might have saved lives .
And if that dubious intelligence just happens to push lawmakers into giving Bush expanded and unprecedented powers , then the administration gets a two - fer .
Maybe the outcome of the vote would have been exactly the same ; it ’s hard to know for sure .
But consider this : does anyone think the administration and congressional Republicans are above pushing bogus intelligence to get the legislation they want ?
Specter secured 188 individual earmarks this year — more than any other senator — in the Labor - HHS bill .
| John Shinkle / POLITICO
Specter 's pet project : Sexual abstinence
A glance at the earmarks secured by Sen. Arlen Specter ( R - Pa. ) in recent years prompts the question : Does Pennsylvania have a problem with sex ?
The senator , who supports abortion rights , is turning the state into the abstinence - earmark capital of the country , directing more than $ 8 million into dozens of programs and , in the process , arching more than a few eyebrows .

He ’s done it again this year , setting aside $ 1 million for an Erie women ’s center that provides “ abortion recovery ” counseling , a community group once chaired by a late supporter and 23 other school districts , hospitals and local organizations .
No other member of Congress earmarks money for abstinence education .
The reason Specter does it offers insight into the political machinations behind — and the abiding allure of — the narrow - interest spending requests maligned by fiscal watchdogs but desired as much as ever by members of Congress .
Specter views the abstinence earmarks as a response to “ a significant segment of his constituency , which he believes is entitled to implement programs most consistent with their values , ” the senator ’s chief of staff , Scott Hoeflich , said in a statement .
But those familiar with Pennsylvania politics and the politics of earmarks say Specter ’s motives are not one - dimensional .
The five - term senator is renowned for his refusal to leave even a pebble of support unturned .
And , critics say , the use of abstinence earmarks is merely an extension of his Pennsylvania survival strategy : to blunt his weakness among conservatives by selectively championing their causes .
“ It ’s another example of why earmarks are so problematic , ” said Larry Frankel , legislative director of the American Civil Liberties Union of Pennsylvania .
“ They can be used to pry and curry favor with constituents based on political expediency rather than a demonstration that the earmark is the best use of money . ”
Specter , as a longtime leading appropriator and ranking member of the Appropriations Subcommittee on Labor , Health and Human Services and Education , has fielded this type of criticism before , and he dismisses it .
His staff vets the applicants and “ makes decisions based on what creates good policy for Pennsylvania , ” Hoeflich said .
Specter secured 188 individual earmarks this year — more than any other senator — in the Labor - HHS bill , which passed the Senate last week and must be reconciled with the House version .
In total dollars , though , he trails other subcommittee members with $ 19 million , according to a database maintained by two nonpartisan groups , Taxpayers for Common Sense and the Sunlight Foundation .
Sen .
Tom Harkin ( D - Iowa ) , the subcommittee chairman , collected $ 60 million .
Sen .
Ted Stevens ( R - Alaska ) , despite his entanglement in a federal corruption probe that appears to be focused on his appropriations work , snagged $ 51 million .
The 15 members of the subcommittee claimed half of the bill ’s $ 560 million in earmarks .
Specter ’s abstinence - minded politics have become an annual ritual .
And even though he also favors comprehensive sex education , which includes information on contraception , his support for no - sex - until - marriage education is generating the attention .
Taxpayers for Common Sense highlighted a $ 30,000 earmark this year for the program A+ for Abstinence , a repeat recipient that runs a website called Coolvirginity.com .
One liberal blog headlined a recent entry , “ Arlen Specter REALLY does n’t want you having sex . ”
The senator ramped up his advocacy for abstinence programs in 2003 , around the time that Pennsylvania , according to Specter ’s staff , declined a major source of federal abstinence funding through the Department of Health and Human Services .
States have taken issue with restrictions on how the curriculum could be taught .
It was also at this time that Specter began his 2004 primary fight against Pat Toomey , then a U.S. representative with strong conservative credentials .
Specter always faces his toughest challenge winning the Republican nomination because he ’s a centrist in an increasingly right - leaning party , in a state where conservatives dominate the primary election .
But Pennsylvanians also like knowing what their senators have delivered for them lately , and this is where the earmarks come in .
Specter plays up his skills like few others .
He puts out press releases announcing each funding request .
During campaigns , he runs TV ads tailored by region , highlighting the money received by local hospitals or businesses .
The abstinence programs are just part of the Specter tableau .
Through 2003 and 2004 , when he secured almost $ 7 million in earmarks , Specter attended a teen abstinence ceremony , touted his support of abstinence programs to conservative audiences across the state , and convened a field hearing in Harrisburg on abstinence - only education ( scheduled for the same day he filed paperwork for his reelection campaign ) .
“ Abstinence education has demonstrated its value in a society where there is so much concern about the morality of the young people and access to abortions , ” Specter said at the hearing .
“ It is plain that if we can persuade young people to avoid premarital sex and unintended pregnancies , there will be an enormous step forward . ”
Whether abstinence education actually achieves that is a point of contention .
Each side points to studies that buttress their arguments .
With Specter vowing to seek reelection in 2010 , fiscal watchdogs suspect politics is a motivator , at least in part , behind the latest batch of earmarks .
Some of the groups boast political connections .
The Urban Family Council , which has received $ 250,000 in earmarks in the past and could collect $ 80,000 this year , was founded by a Philadelphia evangelical activist with deep ties to the Pennsylvania religious community .
The Progressive Believers Ministries , a first - time grantee slated to receive $ 30,000 , is headed by a pastor active in the Black Clergy of Philadelphia and Vicinity , which endorsed Specter in 2004 .
And Partners for Healthier Tomorrows , which has accepted $ 100,000 in the past and could see an additional $ 25,000 , was chaired by Robert Bensing , a GOP leader in the conservative stronghold of Lancaster County who , according to the Lancaster Sunday News , endorsed Specter in 2004 .
Bensing died in August .
Specter maintains that his staff chooses earmark recipients based solely on merit .
Brenda Newport , executive director of the Women ’s Care Center of Erie County , said the senator was sold after visiting her facility , which has received $ 400,000 since 2003 .
“ He saw what we do , ” Newport said , explaining her center ’s success with earmarks .
“ People who would see it firsthand would have a different attitude about it .
If they could see it , they would believe in it . ”

Facebook BALAD AIR BASE , Iraq ( AP ) 
The airplane is the size of a jet fighter , powered by a turboprop engine , able to fly at 300 mph and reach 50,000 feet .
It is outfitted with infrared , laser and radar targeting , and with a ton and a half of guided bombs and missiles .
The Reaper is loaded , but there is no one on board .
Its pilot , as it bombs targets in Iraq , will sit at a video console 7,000 miles away in Nevada .
The arrival of these outsized U.S. " hunter - killer " drones , in aviation history 's first robot attack squadron , will be a watershed moment even in an Iraq that has seen too many innovative ways to hunt and kill .
That moment , one the Air Force will likely low - key , is expected " soon , " says the regional U.S. air commander .
How soon ?
" We 're still working that , " Lt. Gen. Gary North said in an interview .
The Reaper 's first combat deployment is expected in Afghanistan , and senior Air Force officers estimate it will land in Iraq sometime between this fall and next spring .
They look forward to it .
" With more Reapers , I could send manned airplanes home , " North said .
The Associated Press has learned that the Air Force is building a 400,000 - square - foot expansion of the concrete ramp area now used for Predator drones here at Balad , the biggest U.S. air base in Iraq , 50 miles north of Baghdad .
That new staging area could be turned over to Reapers .
It is another sign that the Air Force is planning for an extended stay in Iraq , supporting Iraqi government forces in any continuing conflict , even if U.S. ground troops are drawn down in the coming years .
The estimated two dozen or more unmanned MQ - 1 Predators now doing surveillance over Iraq , as the 46th Expeditionary Reconnaissance Squadron , have become mainstays of the U.S. war effort , offering round - the - clock airborne " eyes " watching over road convoys , tracking nighttime insurgent movements via infrared sensors , and occasionally unleashing one of their two Hellfire missiles on a target .
From about 36,000 flying hours in 2005 , the Predators are expected to log 66,000 hours this year over Iraq and Afghanistan .
The MQ - 9 Reaper , when compared with the 1995 - vintage Predator , represents a major evolution of the unmanned aerial vehicle , or UAV .
At five tons gross weight , the Reaper is four times heavier than the Predator .
Its size — 36 feet long , with a 66 - foot wingspan — is comparable to the profile of the Air Force 's workhorse A - 10 attack plane .
It can fly twice as fast and twice as high as the Predator .
Most significantly , it carries many more weapons .
UNDER THE RADAR : Air Force ramps up in Iraq
While the Predator is armed with two Hellfire missiles , the Reaper can carry 14 of the air - to - ground weapons — or four Hellfires and two 500 - pound bombs .
" It 's not a recon squadron , " Col .
Joe Guasella , operations chief for the Central Command 's air component , said of the Reapers .
" It 's an attack squadron , with a lot more kinetic ability . " " Kinetic " — Pentagon argot for destructive power — is what the Air Force had in mind when it christened its newest robot plane with a name associated with death .
" The name Reaper captures the lethal nature of this new weapon system , " Gen. T. Michael Moseley , Air Force chief of staff , said in announcing the name last September .
General Atomics of San Diego has built at least nine of the MQ - 9s thus far , at a cost of $ 69 million per set of four aircraft , with ground equipment .
The Air Force 's 432nd Wing , a UAV unit formally established on May 1 , is to eventually fly 60 Reapers and 160 Predators .
The numbers to be assigned to Iraq and Afghanistan will be classified .
The Reaper is expected to be flown as the Predator is — by a two - member team of pilot and sensor operator who work at computer control stations and video screens that display what the UAV " sees . "
Teams at Balad , housed in a hangar beside the runways , perform the takeoffs and landings , and similar teams at Nevada 's Creech Air Force Base , linked to the aircraft via satellite , take over for the long hours of overflying the Iraqi landscape .
American ground troops , equipped with laptops that can download real - time video from UAVs overhead , " want more and more of it , " said Maj .
Chris Snodgrass , the Predator squadron commander here .
The Reaper 's speed will help .
" Our problem is speed , " Snodgrass said of the 140 - mph Predator .
" If there are troops in contact , we may not get there fast enough .
The Reaper will be faster and fly farther . "
The new robot plane is expected to be able to stay aloft for 14 hours fully armed , watching an area and waiting for targets to emerge .
" It 's going to bring us flexibility , range , speed and persistence , " said regional commander North , " such that I will be able to work lots of areas for a long , long time . "
The British also are impressed with the Reaper , and are buying three for deployment in Afghanistan later this year .
The Royal Air Force version will stick to the " recon " mission , however — no weapons on board .

In its delightfully named column “ The Political Whore , ” Creative Loafing Tampa notes that a recent issue of The St. Petersburg Times featured an anti-gay religious advertisement right next to coverage of the St. Pete Pride Parade .
The ad , by Lighthouse Baptist Church , reportedly said that Hurricane Katrina was sent by God to punish New Orleans for tolerating gays .
How could such a statement make it into a newspaper ?
I ’m not asking because of its vile sentiment .

Gonzales may have revealed classified meeting , committed perjury Will Menaker
Published : Wednesday July 25 , 2007 Print This Email This Capitol Hill 's leading daily seems to have it in for Attorney General Alberto Gonzales .
Today 's headline from yesterday 's hearings ?
" Gonzales Digs Deeper Hole . "
After finishing up his latest round of testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee , Gonzales may have more than his credibility to lose .
Wednesday's ( paid- restricted ) Roll Call reports the AG " may have put himself in legal jeopardy " as senators from both parties cast doubt on the veracity of his testimony .
Republican Sen. Arlen Specter ( R - PA ) put it bluntly : " I do not find your testimony credible . "
He reminded Gonzales that the entire committee would review his testimony , in an apparent threat of legal consequences for lying to Congress .
Gonzales clashed with other senators over the many conflicting and shifting elements of his and others ' testimony surrounding a 2004 trip Gonzales and White House chief of staff Andy Card took to visit then - Attorney General John Ashcroft in the hospital to gain approval for the President 's warrantless wiretapping program .
In his testimony , Gonzales revealed for the first time a meeting with the so - called " Gang of Eight " -- the two top Republican and Democratic Congressional leaders and the chairmen and ranking members of both chambers '
Intelligence committees -- on the same day as the Ashcroft hospital visit , where the members of Congress were supposedly briefed on " vitally important intelligence activities . "
In revealing this meeting , Gonzales may have undercut his previous testimony in which he claimed the disagreement at the Justice Department was " not about the terrorist surveillance program that the president announced to the American people . "
One " Gang of Eight " member , Rep. Jane Harman ( D - CA ) , who was present at this classified briefing took issue with Gonzales even speaking about the meeting , " ' The attorney general is selectively declassifying material from a classified briefing , which I find improper . ' "
Meanwhile , Harman questioned the appropriateness of Gonzales even revealing that there had been a classified Gang of Eight meeting .
" He doesnt have the authority to do that , " she added .
Another " gang member , " Senate Intelligence Committee Chairman Jay Rockefeller ( D - WV ) , when asked if he believed Gonzales had perjured himself , responded , " " Based upon what I know about it , I 'd have to say yes . "

1. Speak a little less , listen a little more
Most people get tremendous pleasure from speaking about themselves .
But , here we have to be careful ; if we always speak about our achievements or tribulations , people will get fed up with our egoism .
If we are willing and able to listen to others , we will find it much appreciated by our friends .
Some people are not aware of how much they dominate the conversation .
If you find you are always talking about yourself , consider the advice of the Greek philosopher , Epictectus :
“ Nature gave us one tongue and two ears so we could hear twice as much as we speak . ”
2 . Which is more important being right or maintaining harmony ?
A lot of problems in relationships occur because we want to maintain our personal pride .
Do n’t insist on always having the last word .
Healthy relationships are not built through winning meaningless arguments .
Be willing to back down ; most arguments are not of critical importance anyway .
3. Avoid Gossip
If we value someone ’s friendship we will not take pleasure in commenting on their frequent failings .
They will eventually hear about it .
But , whether we get found out or not , we weaken our relationships when we dwell on negative qualities .
Avoid gossiping about anybody ; subconsciously we do n’t trust people who have a reputation for gossip .
We instinctively trust and value people who do n’t feel the need to criticise others .
4. Forgiveness
Forgiveness is not just a cliché , it ’s a powerful and important factor in maintaining healthy relationships .
However , real forgiveness also means that we are willing to forget the experience .
If we forgive one day , but then a few weeks later bring up the old misdeed , this is not real forgiveness .
When we make mistakes , just consider how much we would appreciate others forgiving and forgetting .
5. Know When to Keep Silent
If you think a friend has a bad or unworkable idea , do n’t always argue against it ; just keep silent and let them work things out for themselves .
It ’s a mistake to always feel responsible for their actions .
You can offer support to friends , but you ca n’t live their life for them .
6. Right Motive
If you view friendship from the perspective of “ what can I get from this ? ” you are making a big mistake .
This kind of relationship proves very tentative .
If you make friendships with the hope of some benefit , you will find that people will have a similar attitude to you .
This kind of friendship leads to insecurity and jealousy .
Furthermore , these fair weather friends will most likely disappear just when you need them most .
Do n’t look upon friends with the perspective “ what can I get out of this ? ” .
True friendship should be based on mutual support and good will , irrespective of any personal gain .
7. Oneness .
The real secret of healthy relationships is developing a feeling of oneness .
This means that you will consider the impact on others of your words and actions .
If you have a true feeling of oneness , you will find it difficult to do anything that causes suffering to your friends .
When there is a feeling of oneness , your relationships will be free of jealousy and insecurity .
For example , it is a feeling of oneness which enables you to share in the success of your friends .
This is much better than harbouring feelings of jealousy .
To develop oneness we have to let go of feelings of superiority and inferiority ; good relationships should not be based on a judgemental approach .
In essence , successful friendship depends on the golden rule : “ do unto others as you would have done to yourself . ”
This is the basis of healthy relationships .
8. Humour
Do n’t take yourself too seriously .
Be willing to laugh at yourself and be self - deprecating .
This does not mean we have to humiliate ourselves , far from it — it just means we let go of our ego .
Humour is often the best antidote for relieving tense situations .
9 . Work at Relationships but do n’t over analyze
Maintaining healthy relationships does n’t mean we have to spend several hours in the psychiatrist ’s chair .
It means we take a little time to consider others , remembering birthdays and anniversaries etc .
But , it is a mistake to spend several hours ruminating and dissecting relationships .
This makes the whole thing very mental ; it ’s better to forget any negative experiences .
Good friendships should be built on spontaneity and newness , sharing a moment of humour can often do more benefit than several hours of discussion .
10 . Concern and Detachment
Healthy relationships should be built on a degree of detachment .
Here , people often make a mistake ; they think that being detached means , “ not caring ” .
However , this is not the case .
Often when we develop a very strong attachment we expect the person to behave in a certain way .
When they do n’t we feel miserable and try to change them .
A good friendship based on detachment means we will always offer good will , but we will not be upset if they wish to go a different way .

I 've read recently that geeks make better lovers because they are so unaccustomed to romance that they will do anything for their mates .
Also because geeks do n't have the social skills to cheat ( wanna bet ? ) .
Yeah , ha ha , let 's chuckle at the stereotypes .
Might as well add that geeks wo n't waste valuable relationship time watching football .
Or that geeks are clueless and fashion - impaired and have the social skills of a bowl of fruit .
But you know what ?
Humorous Top - 10 lists aside , geeks really do make the best lovers , for reasons that have nothing to do with adolescent ostracism or puppy - like devotion .
It 's all about sex - tech .
( Tell us what you think below . )
Geeks build it so you will come
Second Life 's SexGen animation system , Red Light Center 's ( NSFW ) beautiful sex animations and open - source teledildonics did not simply coalesce out of the mists during a marketing department meeting .
These projects require strong technical know - how along with an open - minded approach to sexual variation .
After all , you can't build sex - tech that serves only your own preferences if you expect others to use it .
Especially if you want them to buy it .
That geeks have the passion to commit their technical skills to expanding sexual options for everyone is evidence enough of their enthusiasm and dedication as lovers .
Geeks get personal with tech
All engineers may be geeks , but not all geeks are engineers .
Does n't matter .
You do n't need to know how to build a platform in order to do a half - gainer in full pike with a twist into the river of love .
A geek is more likely to figure out how to customize toys and to design arousing environments for your avatars to play in than a non-geek .
And that experience translates into a greater sensitivity to atmosphere and mood during sex – beyond lighting a candle .
Do n't be surprised if your geek lover puts more thought into arranging the boudoir than you do , or if common household items ( " pervertibles " ) soon take on a new dimension .
More than one geek has told me that Home Depot is their favorite adult store .
Geeks dig consensual role playing
Geek lovers combine a well - developed and oft - exercised erotic imagination with their physical technique .
It is n't a big leap from " I 'm a level - 13 thief , evil - aligned " to " I 'm the prison warden and you 're the new detainee . "
Scientists and therapists alike claim that the brain is the most critical sexual organ ; a geek 's familiarity with fantasy arouses your mind even as the handcuffs – or the bag of loot – bring your body to attention .
Geeks interact
A technophobe mostly talks to you in person , but a geek is happy to be with you by texting your phone , flirting with you in a chat room , Skyping you , Twittering just in case you 're on your vibrating couch ( NSFW ) , sending funny cell - phone snapshots to your e-mail , playing online games , commenting on your blog , Digging articles that interest you , seducing you by instant message … .
Geeks get things done
Geeks know all the shortcuts .
They research your interests , send you surprise gifts , plan your perfect vacation , get the bills and grocery shopping out of the way , write to their mothers , and tease you mercilessly , all while pretending to work .
And when you ask them to set up your home Wi-Fi or install a home theater , it 's done quickly , expertly and without complaint .
In other words , geeks know how to get everything else out of the way so there 's more time for lovemaking .
Geeks are hot …
… and wear the coolest glasses .
Geeks do n't shock easily
Geeks have seen all the porn you can imagine and then some , priming them to be open to your sexual peccadilloes .
They are not only less likely to be shocked by your exotic requests – they might not even realize that other people think your turn - ons are exotic .
Conversely , your geek lover might be relieved that your wildest fantasy involves only two other people , five utensils and a trapeze .
Geeks know kinky people
Geeks have n't just seen a variety of positions , kinks and fetishes in blue movies .
They know ( or are ) people who enjoy those things , so they do n't dismiss entire categories of sexual interests as the sole province of a bunch of weirdos in San Francisco .
It 's hard to sustain prejudice and bias against an abstract group when you develop relationships with individuals and discover they 're just like you .
It does n't matter if they dress up like ponies , or refuse to conform to a societal idea of gender norms , or eat pancakes for dinner .
Geek lovers know better than to try to impose their sexual preferences or standards on others – including your friends – and are more likely to love and let love .
Geeks understand multi-dimensional relationships
Geeks connect with their online buddies in several guises , often getting to know the person behind the avatar as friendships deepen and move from adult communities to personal IM .
A geek can flow seamlessly between conversation about a friend 's partner and kids in one window and an elaborate group sex scene in another , without feeling any discontinuity between the personas .
Even if the friend is a 43 - year - old father of two in IM , and a 22 - year - old dominatrix in the group .
With all that going on , a geek has no problem accepting that sometimes you want mocha ripple cherry fudge chunk swirl with almonds and a waffle and sometimes you want vanilla lite .
Geeks are n't threatened by new tech or " the future of sex "
Geeks have read the science fiction .
They know the dire predictions of a world in which the sticky press of flesh is replaced by neural nets and sex robots that also do housework ( or is that house robots that also do sex work ? ) .
Geeks have imagined more sexual dystopias than the average person and are the first to see the technological developments that could lead us down dark paths .
Which only makes sense , considering who develops those technologies in the first place .
At the same time , geeks know better than anyone that something always goes wrong when you lean on machines for your social fulfillment .
A geek does n't mind if you bring home the iiErotoTrix 5000 v3 – as long as you share it .
Literacy and the printing press did not replace sex ; neither did photography , automobiles , video , online porn or 3 - D escort services .
Geek lovers spend enough time with technology to appreciate the unique wondrousness of human touch .
See you next Friday , Regina Lynn

Presidential campaigns are very creative at linking with voters -- especially when it comes to obtaining their names and e-mails for fund appeals .
Remember helping pick Hillary Rodham Clinton ’s official campaign song ?
Barack Obama ’s campaign invited selected donors of small amounts to dinner .
John McCain sends a copy of his new book in return for a donation .
John Edwards ’ newest gimmick ?
He wants five people to join him next month for some hard labor : helping build in a poor New Orleans neighborhood .
But it ’ll cost you .
The catch is , in order to do this volunteer work , he ’d like you to give him money for the privilege .
“ Help John rebuild New Orleans with a [ campaign ] contribution today , ” says an e-mail from David Bonior , campaign manager .
Exactly how giving money to Edwards helps the New Orleans neighborhood is not explained .
But Bonior adds , “ By giving between now and the end of the quarter on Sunday , Sept. 30 , you -- and four other supporters -- could have the opportunity to work alongside John .
. . .
“ This campaign is about creating big , bold change on the issues that matter -- so we ’re not offering you gimmicks , ” the Bonior e-mail continues .
“ We ’re not offering you a fancy dinner .
And we ’re not offering you the chance to hobnob with celebrities and former presidents . ”

Just the chance to buy a chance to sweep and hammer with a former senator .
A smaller line of type just like this at the end of the Edwards e-mail says , “ No purchase or contribution necessary to enter . ”

Awaiting a Kucinich surge
Advertisement
No one ever accused Rep. Dennis Kucinich of joining the pack to chase the most votes .
According to last week ’s Los Angeles Times / Bloomberg poll , the six - term Ohio congressman , who seems to be perennially campaigning for president , has voter support ranging from 1 % of Democrats in South Carolina all the way up to 3 % in New Hampshire , which loves mavericks who tell them how important they are .
Recently the House voted on a commemoration resolution establishing Sept. 11 “ as a day of remembrance , extending sympathies to families of victims . . . and honoring those who have fought in Afghanistan and Iraq . ”
The vote was 334 to 1 .
Guess who voted against it ?
Kucinich says the resolution should have mentioned numerous lies that took the U.S. into Iraq , keep its soldiers there , are setting the stage for a war against Iran , and undermine U.S. civil liberties .

Fresh from that vote and a recent chat with Syrian President Bashar Assad , Kucinich , 60 , and wife Elizabeth , 29 , headed for that political linchpin , Hawaii .
He says he ’s the first candidate of either party to work the Hawaii vote .
Kucinich is obviously aware of the state ’s history : No Democrat has ever won the presidency without winning or losing there .

Survivor , the GOP edition
Mike Huckabee , the affable former Arkansas governor , is still riding high on his second - place showing in last month ’s largely irrelevant Ames , Iowa , straw poll .
Huckabee said visits to his campaign website are up , as is fundraising , though he could n’t say by how much .
Hmmm .

In fact , the quest for money is what brought Huckabee to Orange County and L.A. last week .
He spoke before a Lincoln Club group in Irvine ( not a fundraiser , but you can bet one will be planned ) , and then he attended a Beverly Hills fundraiser hosted by Suzi and Fred Wehba , a real estate investor whose holdings include the Watergate in Washington , D.C .
But the post - Iowa cash influx has n’t been enough for Huckabee to upgrade his travel arrangements .
He ’s still flying commercial , an everyman experience just as frustrating and time - consuming for him as the rest of us .
“ One of the first things I do as president , ” he joked , “ is I fix the air traffic control system . ”

Hot topic , or not ?
Advertisement
Last week ’s Times / Bloomberg poll in the early - pick states of Iowa , New Hampshire and South Carolina underscores what has been evident by listening to the candidates : the importance of the illegal - immigration issue depends very much on one ’s partisan inclinations .
In a nutshell , the survey found that few Democratic - leaning voters in those states rate the matter as the top priority for White House contenders .
By contrast , a healthy slice of Republicans in those states rank it high .
The findings help explain why illegal immigration rarely gets a mention among the Democratic presidential candidates and why it ’s a hot topic in the GOP race .
In Iowa , 9 % of Democrats chose illegal immigration as the top issue ; among GOP voters , the figure was 30 % ( basically tying with the Iraq war and with protecting the United States from terrorists ) .
The gap was comparable in New Hampshire ( 5 % versus 25 % ) and South Carolina ( 7 % versus 23 % ) .
A similar divergence was found on healthcare with the roles reversed -- especially in Iowa and New Hampshire .
Many more Democratic voters than Republicans ranked that as their main priority .

She stays under the radar
Candidate spouses have become increasingly prominent in presidential campaigns , perhaps a consequence of the elongated process of seeking the White House .
One who has not is Barbara Richardson , wife of Bill .
She has been by his side throughout his political career , but she ’s always been low - profile .
Advertisement
“ I ’ll never be as outspoken as some other candidates ’ wives , because they ’re more comfortable at it , ” she said in a recent Associated Press interview .
“ I would feel free to tell [ Bill ] what I thought of an issue , but in terms of day - to - day advice , I do n’t , ” she said .
Besides , she added , “ he ’s not even around day to day .
He goes out for eight to 10 days at a time .
He comes back for a day of rest .
The last thing he wants is me yammering on about an issue . ”
Many couples can relate , we think .

Questions which spring immediately to mind are :
Since when can the fucking Department of State offer immunity for murder ??
I know that theoretically if one branch or agency of government has knowledge , it is imputed to the whole . . . but I doubt that the Dept. fo Agriculture can call for nuclear strikes on Iran ( or can they ? ? ) .
And - it 's probably hopelessly old school of me . . . but WHERE IS THE FUCKING OUTRAGE from the MSM ???
Does no one care that the community - college - PhD - Ms. - Condoleeza - Rice is now deciding who will and wo n't be prosecuted for murder .
Finally - since everyone - including that cretin of a President - says that Iraq is a sovereign nation . . . which means they have sovereignty . . . so why can't the Iraqis try these trigger happy bastards for murder ??
My father imposed the veil on me three times and I took it off three times .
The following is the story of how I took off the veil for that final time .
Although I have lived in Britain for the past 23 years I was born and brought up in Amman , Jordan .
My parents were conservative Muslims , but my mother was more liberal than my father .
Although he believed in education he wanted all his children - there were nine of us - to be good pious Muslims , upright and chaste , especially his daughters .
We wanted to be as he wished us to be , but most of us failed to measure up and had to come to terms with that sense of failure and guilt .
My father was a reluctant tyrant , who once sat on top of my 10 - year - old brother and stuffed a whole packet of cigarettes into his mouth because he caught him smoking .
The whole family stood around in the dining room watching .
I never forgave myself for standing by , but I was young then , only 16 .
It was seven years later , when I was 23 , that my father finally succeeded in imposing the veil on me .
By then I had already twice taken it off with the help of my unveiled , secular aunt .
( She had always encouraged me to resist and taught me how to negotiate a way out : I accepted every other condition , such as a seven o'clock curfew , but refused to cover my head . )
Now I had been offered a place at the University of Jordan , but my father was refusing to pay for my education unless I covered my head .
So believing my education was more important than resistance , I went to the market , bought two metres of white polyester , wrapped my head with them and pinned the veil under my chin .
It took seven years for the pin to be removed .
After I finished my degree I got a scholarship to study creative writing at Lancaster University .
But my father refused to let me leave Jordan , so I jumped up and down on my parents ' bed , weeping and saying , " You can not stop me .
As long as there is pen and paper in the world you cannot stop me from becoming a writer . "
After a number of quarrels , negotiations , abstentions from food , discussions and mediation my father agreed to send me to Britain to study , but attached two conditions : I must observe the veil at all times , and my 17 - year - old brother must accompany me as a muharam , guardian .
When I arrived in Britain I was 28 and much had happened in my life : I had been married and divorced , had a six - year - old child and lost custody of him ( part of the deal for getting the divorce ) , and I was in tatters .
I had failed as a daughter , a Muslim , a wife and a mother .
Here I was in a foreign country and on arrival at Heathrow with my young dependent brother could not even figure out the direction of the traffic .
The only thought that kept me together during the nightmarish journey from London to Lancaster was that I had my aunt 's Circassian pastries in my suitcase and soon I would be able to open the tin box , unwrap and eat them .
It was n't until two years later , in 1986 , that I decided to take off the veil .
This time I was back in Britain about to start a PhD and had reached the point where I could no longer both obey my father and keep a shred of self - respect .
When I arrived in London , one of my old friends met me at the airport , and we took a taxi back to her flat .
I put my hands up and , with trembling fingers , took out the pin and pulled the veil back to reveal my hair to the cab driver - the first time in seven years that a stranger had seen it .
I do n't know whether the cab driver even noticed but as soon as the fresh air touched my hair I began to cry .
I felt as if I had taken off my skin , my identity , my whole family and clan .
They would not want to have anything to do with me now .
The fits of crying lasted for three days and then I left for Norwich and my degree .
Some months later I sat down one afternoon , pulled off the veil , now covering the computer , as this had become its new role , and wrote a long letter to my father telling him what I had done and why .
After I posted the letter I lived in fear that he would come and drag me home .
I felt like a runaway .
I thought I was being watched .
It became impossible to continue living in this state of fear so I decided to go back home and face him without a veil .
I kept my visit a secret from everyone but my friend Sue , who was living in Amman .
Since many fathers in Jordan confiscate their children 's passports to stop them running away , I left mine with a feminist lecturer at Jordan University .
She had never met me or heard of me but agreed to help .
It was about 10 o'clock in the evening when we finally arrived at my house .
Sue hugged me , and left me with my suitcase at the doorstep .
I stood there with uncovered head and a pounding heart .
My father opened the door , paled and walked away .
He had aged so much , and his hair was mostly grey .
He was in his ablution clothes , a white sleeveless vest and loose pyjama trousers rolled to the knee so I could see the red patches of psoriasis on his dark thin legs .
Something warm rushed to my heart .
I followed him into the hallway and hugged him tight .
He turned his face from me , and stuck his arms tight against his body , refusing to hug me back .
" Please , Dad , " I said .
Nothing .
He stood there like a statue until my mother tore me away , hugged and kissed me .
Her eyes were full of tears when she said , " Greet your daughter ! "
Finally , my father said , " She looks like a western model ! "
I was the pain in his neck and I had returned to shame him in front of his peers .
The next day he sat me down to convince me not to leave the house without a veil .
I was eager to see the garden , our alleyway , the neighbourhood , but I agreed to attend the family court and present my case .
He sat on the sofa , and I sat opposite him .
But I had heard the same sermon so many times .
I kept repeating , " I am your daughter .
You and mum brought me to this world .
Am I less important to you than religion ?
You have never told me that you loved me .
You 've never said that you are proud of me .
Why ? "
This went on for five days and at the end I could argue no more .
I wanted some fresh air , so I had a shower , changed out of my pink pyjamas , which I had worn for a week , put on a pair of jeans and a T - shirt and asked my mother , " Shall we go shopping , mum ? "
" Yes , " she said , " let 's go shopping . "
She put on her veil , held my hand and we stepped together into the sunshine .
Hand in hand we walked , aware of the wagging tongues and fluttering curtains .
With a determined smile she greeted the grocer , the chemist , the sweet and nut seller while holding my hand firmly .
The winter sun was warm on our backs .
We talked , laughed , looked for bargains in the new one - dinar shop and went home contented .
My father must have heard about our outing because he stopped talking to me completely .
Occasionally we would have late dinner together and he would address my mother : " People have no shame , no morals , no religious values any more . "
I knew I would be on the opposite side of the divide from then on .
One evening , three weeks after I arrived , I was having dinner with my parents .
We were alone , which did not happen often .
I looked at my mother and said , " Please tell my father that I am flying back to England on Friday to resume my studies . "
The Christmas vacation was over .
He had not acknowledged my presence for more than a week .
I was getting dressed when the phone rang .
I picked up the receiver and heard his voice : " I just want to wish you a good journey ... I am proud of you , but I do n't know things .
I do n't know how to say things .
Go , may Allah protect you ! "
Then he put the phone down .
The process of reconciliation had begun , but it took a failed relationship of mine to bring us really close .
When , at that time , I asked my father for help , he came to England .
We would walk in the woods for hours , talking .
I would ask him if he loved me , and he would hug me .
To have nine children educated in the UK , US , Turkey and elsewhere made my father realise that he had to enter into dialogue with us .
After years of education some of us became religious , others indifferent , and some totally secular .
When we got older my father tolerated our different points of view .
To his credit he was able to adapt at such an old age .
Now he is 76 and I am 51 , and writing this piece has brought us closer still .
A few weeks ago I sat with my father in the basement of our old house in east Amman and read it aloud to him .
I choked and stumbled over many words .
He also filled up twice .
He said he did not know that the veil had caused me so much suffering .
" Perhaps because you have nine children you did not notice , " I said .
He also said that the piece was accurate .
When I finished reading we dried our tears , laughed , and walked out together into the autumn sunshine .
The veil is still covering my computer but I feel we are father and daughter at last .

NO CONTINENT is urbanising faster than Africa .
Why ?
One answer is partly statistical : Africa has been the slowest to get started .
Another is that parts of Africa , such as the Sahel , have been affected recently by severe climate change , making marginal land unfarmable .
And in countries like Angola and Congo years of fighting have propelled millions to the cities .
But a fuller explanation is needed .
A look at Nairobi provides some answers , and throws up more questions .
For many years the biggest city in east Africa , where human life seems to have begun , was not a bad advertisement for the urban condition .
As the capital of Kenya , Nairobi had the subdued bustle of an administrative centre , some industry , hotels for tourists on their way to or from wildlife safaris , lots of greenery and even a small forest .
The population in 1960 was about 250,000 .
Today the forest remains , but , with 3 m people , Nairobi has lost much of its charm .
The traffic is awful , as is the crime , and the superlatives are usually reserved for Kibera , which is supposedly Africa 's largest , densest and poorest slum .
It probably is not .
Luanda , Kinshasa and Lagos , the world 's fastest - growing megacity , may all have slums to match Kibera , whose population is put at anything from 600,000 to 1.2 m , depending both on the estimator and on the time of year , many of its inhabitants being seasonal migrants .
What makes Kibera unusual is , first , that its 256 hectares ( 630 acres ) sit right in the middle of Nairobi and , second , that it finds itself on the doorstep of Habitat , the UN 's agency for towns and cities , which is based in a campus of bucolic tranquillity not far away .
Accordingly , Kibera gets no end of attention from outsiders , whether governments throwing money at it , NGOs engaged in mapping and studying it , or film stars shooting “ The Constant Gardener ” .
Ban Ki-moon paid it a visit within a month of becoming the UN 's secretary - general this year .
Most of what makes Kibera interesting , though , is what it shares with other African slums .
The density ( shacks packed so tightly that many are accessible only on foot ) ; the dust ( in the dry seasons ) and the mud ( when it rains ) ; the squalor ( you often have to pick your way through streams of black ooze ) ; the hazards ( low eaves of jagged corrugated iron ) ; and the litter , especially the plastic ( Kibera 's women , lacking sanitation and fearing robbery or rape if they risk the unlit pathways to the latrines , resort at night to the “ flying toilet ” , a polythene bag to be cast from their doorway , much as chamber pots were emptied into the street below in pre-plumbing Edinburgh ) .
Most striking of all , to those inured to the sight of such places through photography , is the smell .
With piles of human faeces littering the ground and sewage running freely , the stench is ever - present .
Not much , but it 's home
Striking , too , though , is the apparent contentment with which the inhabitants accept their lot .
It falls short of cheerfulness : tension is constant in Kibera , and small incidents can quickly turn nasty .
But most people are busy getting on with life .
Churches abound , and schools too .
Children play in the dirt or on the railway tracks that bisect the slum .
Stall - holders sell their goods .
Men , ragged or smartly dressed in dark suits , clean their teeth wherever they can spit .
Indoors , things can be more wretched .
On the northern slope of the area known as Soweto East , Josephine Kadenyi lives in a shack three metres square ( ten feet by ten feet ) .
It consists of one room , with a curtain dividing it .
It has no electricity and no sanitation .
Outside is a vast heap of litter and plastic bags used by children as a lavatory .
Just below that , 14 thin water pipes emerge from the ground , bound with sticky tape in a half - successful effort to stem the leaks .
Sewage runs alongside .
Mrs Kadenyi makes her living by selling uncontaminated water and looking after the disabled child of a neighbour .
In NGO - speak , Kibera is an “ informal ” settlement .
That means it does not officially exist .
The government provides nothing .
If there are schools or latrines or washrooms , they are privately run ( it costs three shillings , about four American cents , to use the latrine ) .
The government provides no basic services , no schools , no hospital , no clinics , no running water , no lavatories .
It does , however , own nearly all the land , so if you want to put up a shack , you must go to the chief , a civil servant in the provincial government , and get his permission .
For a consideration , perhaps 5,000 shillings ( about $ 70 ) , this can be obtained , but you receive no piece of paper , merely an oral consent .
Most shacks are in fact owned by “ landlords ” , some of them descended from Nubians rewarded by the British for their military service in the first world war with the right of abode in Kibera .
They now jostle with others who have established , through custom , corruption or force , the right to put up a “ unit ” .
These are then rented out to tenants , who have no rights of any kind .
The cost of erecting a shack is recouped within a year or two .
Daniel arap Moi , who served as president of Kenya from 1978 to 2002 , has long owned a house that abuts Kibera .
Like almost all other ministers of his as well as the present government , he does his best to ignore the slum next door .
Kenyan politicians seldom if ever visit it , or indeed the 200 or so smaller “ informal settlements ” in Nairobi , even though 60 % of the capital 's population live in these slums .
Several politicians are , however , reputed to be landlords , as are many civil servants and other local worthies .
Why does the government not bulldoze Kibera and rehouse everyone in multi-storey flats on the same site ?
Oh , that would be very complicated , the questioner is told .
The difficulties abound , apparently , and they are not all financial .
The real reason is that lots of people make lots of money from the slums , providing the services the state does not provide and extracting the bribes that anyone living in an illegal city has to pay just to survive .
Moreover , the slums provide the cheap labour that enables the city to operate .
The status quo suits the authorities quite nicely .
And what about the people who live in Kibera ?
Strangely , it suits them too , up to a point anyway .
Asked whether she would n't prefer to go back to the village in western Kenya that she left six years ago , Mrs Kadenyi says , “ Yes , of course .
But what would I do back home ? ”
What indeed ?
Kenya 's average rate of population growth for the past 30 years has been over 3 % a year , putting enormous pressure on the land .
With mouths to feed and no prospect of a job in the countryside , the rural poor head for the cities .
There at least they have some hope of employment .
Hope is all it is for most of them , at least in the formal economy .
But hope is what keeps them in places like Kibera .
It may be a dump , but it is central .
This means that anyone lucky enough to have a job , either in the offices or houses of the city , or in the industrial area nearby , can walk to work .
Those who have to peddle goods or search for casual labour are equally well placed .
Being able to avoid a time - consuming and expensive commute is a great benefit .
Still , centrality does not have to mean squalor .
In many cities the slums are on the outskirts , by the airport or somewhere out of sight .
But the people of Kibera are suspicious of efforts to improve their housing .
In the 1980s they saw some of their land taken for new flats , 400 in all .
No one in Kibera benefited , says Raphael Handa , a clergyman who heads a community committee set up with support from Habitat and the government ; all the tenants were brought in from outside .
Same story in Mumbai
The people of Kibera are increasingly organised , and increasingly determined to be involved in any plans to spruce up their slum .
In this they are typical of their counterparts elsewhere .
But in other respects , do Africa 's new cities , slums and slum - dwellers resemble those in other continents ?
An ocean away , Mumbai offers plenty of parallels .
Between 14 m and 18 m people live in Mumbai , according to where you draw the city limits , maybe half of them in slums .
That is about the same proportion as in Nairobi .
But as you drive in from the airport or along P. D'Mello Road by the port , you quickly see that these slums are classy .
Many of the shacks on the pavements are double - decked , and beds , chairs , goats and children spill on to the street , where head - carriers — porters with straight backs — wash themselves from buckets .
The peninsula of modern Mumbai was , 350 years ago , seven islands , which have gradually been joined and expanded by landfills to make up 65 square kilometres of land shaped a bit like a chilli pepper .
The city is hot in every sense but , more seriously , it is crowded , and room for expansion is limited .
Until 60 years ago newcomers to Mumbai tended to settle just outside , at Dharavi , where no rules applied and so sheep could be slaughtered and hides tanned .
Over the years ever more people came and squatted , and the city , India 's financial and commercial capital , expanded .
Today about 600,000 people live in Dharavi 's 210 hectares , which now lie in the heart of Mumbai .
Dharavi 's boast is that it is the biggest slum in Asia .
Conditions here are similar to Kibera 's : miserable housing , no security of tenure , contaminated water for the 40 % lucky enough to have it piped , mud for four months out of 12 , bribes needed for a blind eye to be turned to an illegal electricity connection , one lavatory for 800 people , the stink of sewage , and so on .
People come here for familiar reasons , too .
Life is grindingly hard for many rural Indians .
Agriculture has recently been growing at only 2 % a year , while the economy as a whole booms at over 8 % .
Crops fail , and many farmers are so deeply in debt that they are little more than bonded labourers .
Suicide is common : in just one region of Maharashtra , the state of which Mumbai is the capital , 1,450 farmers killed themselves last year .
In particular , many dalits , members of the lowest Hindu caste , see no hope of betterment amid the harsh conservatism of rural India .
Their only hope is to move to the cities .
It is an echo of what happened in medieval Europe , when moving to a city was for many an escape from serfdom .
Stadtluft macht frei ( City air sets you free ) , said the Germans .
Beats commuting , too
Life may indeed be a bit easier in a city .
Jockin Arputham , who has lived in Mumbai 's slums since 1963 , when he was 16 , makes Dharavi sound almost romantic .
“ You do n't have to work very hard to make a living , ” he says .
“ You can collect and sell garbage .
You can always ask people for food , and to sleep somewhere . ”
He made his bed on someone 's verandah for 12 years .
Then he founded an organisation for the inhabitants of India 's slums .
Now he is also head of the international federation of shack - and slum - dwellers .
People in Dharavi look cheerful .
Everyone is busy and many are reasonably well off .
Some live in flats and own television sets and other electronic gadgets .
Among slum - dwellers they are fortunate , for , like Kibera , Dharavi is central , close not just to the diamond market and the financial centre but also the airport , beyond which most Mumbaikars live .
Many therefore spend hours getting to and from work .
About 7 m commuters make their journey to and from the bottom of the peninsula each day .
The roads are jammed and the trains overflowing : 700 passengers are crammed into ( or clinging onto ) carriages meant for 120 .
About 3,000 people are killed on the tracks each year .
Panos
Even Diogenes would despair
Some people from the slums have been happily resettled farther out but close to a railway , which gives them ready access to their work .
Others are benefiting from the citizens ' groups that have taken root .
Mr Arputham 's National Slum - Dwellers Association , for instance , is allied to a co-operative through which some 250,000 people , nearly all of them women , regularly put money aside for their common good .
And governments , donors and international agencies find the two organisations to be reliable partners if they want to improve slum life .
Mr Arputham got involved in community action in 1975 , when the authorities decided to clear the slum in which he lived to make way for the Atomic Energy Department .
He failed to stop the evictions , but learnt that people affected by such clearance schemes had to organise if they were to have any influence .
Plain confrontation is much less successful , says Celine d'Cruz , who works with Mumbai 's pavement - dwellers , than informed argument , backed by statistics , surveys and the involvement of lots of potential victims .
Thanks to the efforts of such groups and consequent changes in the law , there are fewer evictions nowadays .
The controversies , instead , surround efforts to improve the slums .
The idea now in vogue is to bring in a developer , let him put up multi-storey buildings , use some of the flats to rehouse those living on the site and sell others at a profit .
Slum - dwellers often have enough money to pay rent , and such deals remove a financial burden from the local authority or landlord .
But the scheme is controversial .
Some slum - dwellers are too poor to pay even a service charge , which will be levied in return for water and the use of a lift , even if the flats are rent - free .
Others complain that only those who were resident before 1995 will be eligible for rehousing , leaving newer arrivals with nowhere to go .
Mr Arputham , who is not against development , says the chosen developer has no plans for a sewer and will undoubtedly make 25,000 families homeless .
Others worry that such schemes will allow corrupt officials and corrupt developers to make huge fortunes at the expense of the poor .
Under the headline “ Mumbai 's great slum robbery ” , the Hindustan Times recently published details of a police investigation involving , it was claimed , pay - offs to officials to free the builders ' hands .
Shirish Patel , a civil engineer with a long - standing concern for planning the city , believes that there are simply too many people in Dharavi to allow a developer to rehouse everyone and at the same time make an honest profit .
More generally , he believes that both government and developers have a strong interest in keeping property prices high — and Mumbai 's rank among the highest in the world .
Vijay Mahajan , of Bombay First , a businessmen 's group formed to promote and improve the city , agrees .
The higher the prices , the more builders can charge .
As for the politicians , they profit from an invisible line that runs directly from slumlord to local politician to state minister to his boss .
Money runs up along this line , and so do votes .
In return , the government lets the slums remain undemolished .
It is a pay - and - stay arrangement .
Nairobi and Mumbai certainly have lots in common .
Luckily , other places have fared better .
The outlook is not all bleak .
Is State Department Cover - up a Criminal Obstruction of Justice ?
Even as Condoleeza Rice was playing the coy fox with Henry A. Waxman 's Oversight Committee , was the news breaking the new Watergate of Blackwater and the State Department ?
Could this lead to the impeachment , thus putting her and others under criminal investigation for Obstruction of Justice ?
If so , would it eventually lead to the White House ?
Will the information State Department e-mails obtained by ABC News and subsequent investigations by the LA Times lead to Obstruction of Justice and eventually to impeachment proceedings ?
Did the White House know about all of this ?
The above cited Emails discuss how a regional State Department official WAS complaining about a number of incidents where Blackwater guards were reported as opening fire upon innocent civilians .
This particular official said that that Iraqis were frustrated because they were unable to find protection or justice for the reported alleged crimes by Blackwater .
He said , further , " If we are unable or unwilling to address this issue , sooner or later those requesting compensation for their losses will lose patience with us and seek recourse through other means ... in the worst - case scenario , some might seek revenge . "
Meanwhile Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice deflected , ignored and avoided commenting on a number of Blackwater issues put to her by Henry A. Waxman 's House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform and particularly , her department 's oversight of private security contractors .
Now in the wake of her appearance of faux ignorance , new evidence surfaced showing that the US was concealing alleged atrocities attributed to Blackwater , primarily shootings of Iraqi civilians over two years ago .
Condoleezza Rice ,
The Bushite Secretary of State is now regretful that the State Department did not properly supervise " private security contractors " in Iraq , however , she was defensive concerning the wider sphere of American diplomacy in Iraq during what she labeled , " complex and difficult " circumstances , remiss in not adding , Complex and difficult circumstances that the Bushites created .
Rice testified for more than three hours during a House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform , hearing , in which many responses were rather testy and hostile .
In May of 2005 , a Blackwater convoy was moving a senior U.S. diplomat down a Baghdad roadway when suddenly guards opened fire on an approaching taxi .
The driver , Mohammed Nouri Hattab , said to The Times , he was reducing and about to stop when a burst of machine - gun fire slashed into and through his taxi , wounding him and also killing 19 - year - old newlywed Yas Ali Mohammed Yassiri , a passenger , according to a chain of Emails obtained by ABC news .
Some of those internal Emails in question displayed the State Department officials were trying to deflect a 2005 Los Angeles Times battery of questions about the alleged killing of an Iraqi civilian by Blackwater guards .
One state department official said in the Email , " Give [ the Los Angeles Times ] what we can and then dump the rest on Blackwater .
... We can't win this one . "
Another official , in this chain of e-mails said that the " findings of the investigation are to remain off - limits to the reporter . "
Still another suggested that no one should even mention the existence of a criminal investigation because it would " ... raise questions and issues . "
In August 2005 , following a tip , the Times began their inquiries .
Peter Mitchell , who , at the time was a spokesman for the U.S. Embassy in Iraq , informed his bosses that he was going to inform a reporter that the State Department , " thoroughly investigated " the incident and there was " no criminal act .... "
The truth appears , to the contrary that however , the only investigation completed was " administrative . "
Nevertheless , two Blackwater employees were fired and returned to the U.S. because they violated operating procedures .
Blackwater has so far , refused to comment on the shooting or the firings any further , according to the Times .
Mitchell Emailed to superiors , " As for the legal jurisdiction under which a [ private security contractor ] operates , this is where things get hazy , " " If the [ private security company ] is found negligent , the only recourse is dismissal .
In cases where there was clear criminal intent , a criminal case could hypothetically be pursued in U.S. federal court , but this has yet to happen out here . "
Mitchell 's suggested responses were reported to have created a fiery debate within the department .
Although reporters tried , they were unable to catch - up with Mitchell for comment Thursday .
David Satterfield , now Rice 's senior advisor on Iraq , was eventually a party to the possibly criminal withholding of evidence in the Email trail .
Satterfield suggested that Washington should first approve any answers to the reporter .
" This is a sensitive story that deals with sensitive contract issues , " another , unnamed official Emailed .
Mitchell , in an e-mail to the Times reporter on the story , wrote that State officials were still investigating the issue and added , " I 've been assured that the issue continues to be staffed back in Washington " Even as all of this was going on , Condoleeza Rice was denying any knowledge within her aegis of any of the matters concerning Blackwater .
A number of lawmakers asked her whether she was even aware of some of the most heinous crimes that have been alleged .
" You 're the secretary of state ! " Chairman Henry A. Waxman said once , incredulous after Rice responded to a specific charge against Iraqi Prime Minister Nouri al - Maliki by saying , she was " not personally following every allegation of corruption in Iraq . "
What does she do with her time and who in that administration does , personally follow every allegation of corruption in Iraq ?
Congressman Henry A. Waxman said , " For most of this year , Congress has focused its attention on assessing the military surge , however , the quality and effectiveness of Rice 's actions in Iraq and the State Department 's management are a matter of urgent national concern . "
Pressed to express regret for what Representative John Sarbanes called " the failures of your department , your failures , " Rice said , " I certainly regret that we did not have the kind of oversight that I would have insisted upon . "
( Editor 's Italics )
She has implemented changes recommended by the review , she said , and " we now will have that oversight . "
Rice said she launched a review of the State Department 's private security contracts after Blackwater Worldwide guards allegedly shot and killed 17 Iraqi civilians last month because " I did not think personally that I could say that oversight and follow - up was appropriate . "
In spite of many reports of suspicious Iraqi citizen 's deaths over the last several years , she failed to act earlier , because she did n't want to " second - guess people on the ground " who had handled the shootings in Baghdad .
Let 's look at why , " We did not have the kind of oversight that I would have insisted upon ? "
I wonder , why did " we not have the kind of oversight that I ( Rice ) would have insisted upon ! " and why did she not insist upon them in the beginning , has she no foresight ?
How did she get this job ?
Was n't competence a consideration ?
She did not foresee , airplanes crashing into buildings as a possibility to defend against , she did not foresee , this .
She did not foresee that , what the Hell does she do with her time .
Is there anyone in this administration which is either competent or with an intellect and some foresight ?
Rice agreed that " there is a ' Lacuna ' " in U.S. law that has prevented prosecution of contractors .
Earlier this month , the House passed a bill that would place all contractors under the Military Extraterritorial Jurisdiction Act , and a similar measure is pending in the Senate .
The White House opposes the bill because it would have " unintended and intolerable consequences " for national security .
Boy , they must be in a Mad - Cow , brain - pitting , delusional , ecstasy , or heavily supplied by their Afghanistan , Coke and Heroin Dealers , to think that the American people are going to swallow that ' national security ' BS forever , and ever .
The FBI is investigating the September 16 Blackwater shootings .
An earlier shooting , in which a Blackwater guard allegedly killed the Iraqi vice president 's bodyguard after a Green Zone party on Christmas Eve 2006 , was referred to the Justice Department sometime back , but a lack of evidence has hobbled that investigation , Rice said .
Yeah , ' a lack of evidence ' another ' what me worry ' from the Alfred E Newman of politics , ( They look alike , do n't they ? ) the spoiled , twisted , sicko whose pleasures and hobbies are sadism , suffering of others , violence and death , hampered only by stupidity and lack of foresight , a sort of contagious Alzheimers .
Rice 's replies to the Government Accountability Office , the Special Inspector General for Iraq Reconstruction and the State Department having described pervasive corruption in the Iraqi government , which were in keeping with previous hearings and closed - door depositions , in which the oversight group was inundated with similar instances both from U.S. and Iraqi officials .
Incredulous at Rice 's appearance of either cluelessness , incompetence or contempt , Maryland Representative Elijah E. Cummings , snapped to Rice . "
This is not some pie in the sky !
This is your own department ! "
She kept up the masquerade by refusing any discussion of specific allegations in the open session .
She said it was .
" Potentially damaging to relationships we are very dependent on . "
And that the Americans should know , that " if there is corruption , the United States is in fact dedicated to rooting it out . "
However , she also said , " let 's not take Iraq in isolation . . ..
We need to understand that corruption is a pervasive issue " in many other developing and nondemocratic countries . "
I assume she was including America under Bush .
The Oversight Committee questioned an April 1 memo from Prime Minister Maliki forbids investigation of anyone in the government or the cabinet without his approval .
The former head of the Iraqi Commission on Public Integrity , Judge Radhi Hamza al - Radhi , turned the memo over to the Oversight Committee .
It now is understood that he is now seeking U.S. political asylum .
Judge Radhi Hamza al - Radhi , testified to the Oversight Committee in early October that his investigators had uncovered " rampant " corruption in Iraqi ministries and that close to 50 anti-corruption employees and / or their families , had been assassinated .
Despite the fact that nearly everyone , in America and Iraq , including grade school children have read or heard about the memo the memo has been widely publicized in U.S. and Iraqi and a senior State Department official was questioned about it in the Oct.
4 hearing when Radhi spoke of it , Rice told the committee she would " have to get back to you .
I do n't know precisely what you are referring to .
Our understanding , is that the Iraqi leadership is not in fact immune from investigation . . ..
If , in fact , there is such an order . . . that would certainly be concerning . "
This may be the straw that breaks the criminal 's backs , sends people to jail and begins the impeachment .
Let us hope so .

According to breaking news from NASA , a space program worker is alleged to have deliberately damaged a computer that was meant to fly aboard the Endeavour in less than two weeks , in an apparent act of sabotage .
NASA says the unnamed individual , who works for one of the space agency 's subcontractors , cut wires inside a computer that was headed to the International Space Station ( ISS ) on the shuttle .
The alleged tampering occurred outside of NASA operations in Florida , but the agency is n't naming the subcontractor or where exactly the incident took place .
The agency hopes to fix the damage and launch the Endeavour August 7th , as planned .
As this appears to be the first ever report of sabotage on the space program , you can expect to hear a lot more on this story in the very near future .

TOKYO ( Reuters ) - With her dyed - brown long hair and tight designer jeans , Shoko Tendo looks like any other stylish young Japanese woman -- until she removes her shirt to reveal the vivid tattoos covering her back and most of her body .
Shoko Tendo author of " Yakuza Moon " poses after an interview with Reuters in Tokyo August 28 , 2007 .
Tendo , 39 , the author of " Yakuza Moon " , a best - selling memoir just out in English , says that police efforts to eradicate the gansters have merely made them harder to track .
REUTERS / Kim Kyung - Hoon
The elaborate dragons , phoenixes and a medieval courtesan with one breast bared and a knife between her teeth are a symbol of Tendo ’s childhood as the daughter of a “ yakuza ” gangster and her youth as a drug - using gang member .
The author of “ Yakuza Moon , ” a best - selling memoir just out in English , the 39 - year - old Tendo says that police efforts to eradicate the gangsters have merely made them harder to track .
“ The more the police push , the more the yakuza are simply going underground , making their activities harder to follow than they ever were before , ” she told Reuters in a recent interview .
Police say full - fledged membership in yakuza groups fell to 41,500 last year , down from 43,000 in 2005 , a decline they attribute to tighter laws against organized crime .
The number of yakuza hangers - on , including thugs and members of motorcycle gangs , who are willing to do their dirty work , though , rose marginally to 43,200 .
More shocking for many in Japan , where gun-related crime is rare , were a handful of fatal shootings by yakuza earlier this year , including the killing of the mayor of Nagasaki .
Tendo said the shootings were a result of the legal crackdown on yakuza , which has made it harder for them to ply their traditional trades of prostitution , drugs and bid-rigging .
“ They ’re being forced into a corner , their humanity taken away , ” she said .
“ All the things they used to do for a living have been made illegal , so life has become very hard . ”
SOCIAL DISPARITY
Experts say this is especially true for gangsters in less affluent parts of Japan , a reflection of the same sort of income gaps that increasingly plague the nation as a whole .

“ Yakuza need a lot of money , but depending on where they are , business is n’t going so well , ” said Nobuo Komiya , a criminology professor at Tokyo ’s Rissho University .
“ So they turn to guns . ”
Descended from medieval gamblers and outlaws , yakuza were long portrayed as latter - day samurai , bound by traditions of honor and duty and living extravagant lives .
Tendo ’s father , the leader of a gang linked to the Yamaguchi - gumi , the largest yakuza group , led a “ classic ” yakuza life replete with Italian suits , imported cars and a Harley - Davidson motorcycle .
Raised with strict ideas of honor , she was both spoiled and scolded by the tattooed men who frequented her family home .
But she also faced prejudice and bullying because of her father .
In response , she joined a gang , took drugs and become the lover of several gangsters before near - fatal beatings and drug overdoses convinced her to change her life .
Now a writer and mother , Tendo has distanced herself from the yakuza world , which she feels is rapidly losing its traditions .
Being a gang member is not illegal in Japan , and until recently the gangs were known for openness .
Their offices even posted signs with their names and membership lists inside .
Gangs cooperated with police , handing over suspects in return for police turning a blind eye to yakuza misdemeanors , but this broke down after organized crime laws were toughened in 1992 .
AGEING GANGSTERS
The largest part of yakuza income now comes from pursuits involving stocks , property and finance .
“ What we ’re going to see from here on is the yakuza becoming more structured , like the U.S. Mafia , and dividing itself between business experts and violence experts , ” said Manabu Miyazaki , a writer whose father was also a yakuza .
“ As the world becomes more borderless , they ’ll need experts who can deal with this too , speaking Chinese and English . ”
Like Japan as a whole , gangsters are also ageing , and fewer young people look to organized crime as a career option .
Police figures showed fewer than 20 percent of yakuza were in their 20s in 2005 , a trend both Tendo and Miyazaki attributed to young people ’s dislike for the tough life involved .
“ They think being a yakuza is like joining a company , ” Miyazaki said .
“ There ’s a joke about a young man going to a gang office and asking what the salary was , and would he get insurance . ”
But while today ’s yakuza are eschewing tattoos and amputated fingers -- cut off to atone for mistakes -- in favor of more mainstream lifestyles , they are unlikely to disappear altogether .
“ Fewer people want to become yakuza , ” Miyazaki said .
“ But those who do will be very logical , very scary -- and much , much more dangerous . ”
Thousands march against the war in S.F. , across the country SAN FRANCISCO Similar demonstrations held across the nation to oppose U.S. involvement in Iraq
Saturday Protest and Rally .
Chronicle Graphic Saturday Protest and Rally .

On cue from a bullhorn 's blast , thousands of protesters fell to the pavement on Market Street in a symbolic " die-in " Saturday as part of a coordinated protest staged in cities across the country against the war in Iraq .
For three minutes the demonstrators lay on the pavement , representing what organizers said were more than 1 million Iraqis killed since the war began in 2003 .
The protesters then resumed their march from San Francisco 's Civic Center to Dolores Park .
March organizers put their number at 30,000 - old , young , workers , students , religious leaders .
Police declined to give a formal estimate , but onlookers said the demonstrators definitely numbered more than 10,000 .
They filled up Market Street for several blocks , shouting that U.S. troops should be brought home and carrying banners decrying the war .
At the head of the marchers was a band of Native American drummers who pounded a steady beat as protesters chanted , " No more war ! "
Before the march began , demonstrators gathered in front of City Hall to hear speakers berate the Bush administration and call on Americans to stand up against the war .
Organizers said part of the reason for staging this protest was to mark that it is now five years since Congress voted to authorize the use of U.S. force in Iraq .
" Silence shows compliance , " Nicole Davis , a leader of the Campus Anti-War Network group , told the crowd at the San Francisco event , which was organized by the Oct.
27th Coalition of several groups , including ANSWER - Act Now To Stop War and End Racism .
" If you disagree with this war , " she added , " it is your duty to stand up and let the world know . "
Sarah Sloan , an ANSWER spokeswoman , said her group estimated the size of the crowd " based on the number of blocks - about seven - that the march takes up and the density of the crowd . "
In New York , thousands demonstrated in the rain , marching to Foley Square .
In Chicago , thousands of protesters gathered at Union Park and marched to the Federal Plaza .
Organizers said anti-war rallies , sponsored nationally by a coalition of groups headed by United for Peace & Justice , also took place in Seattle , Salt Lake City , Jonesborough , Tenn. , Philadelphia , Orlando , Los Angeles , New Orleans , Boston and other cities around the country .
" It would be one thing if it were just San Francisco , but it 's not , " Jim Haber , a Bay Area chapter representative of United for Peace & Justice , told The Chronicle .
" We 've helped organizers mobilize their communities in places like Jonesborough , Tenn. , and Salt Lake City , which you do n't typically associate with anti-war demonstrations .
This underscores the broad opposition to the war in Iraq . "
At Dolores Park , hundreds of black boots were placed in rows on a hillside in memory of the U.S. soldiers who died in Iraq .
A tag bearing the name of a dead soldier was attached to each pair of boots , and many of the boots had daisies and other flowers placed in them .
At the park , demonstrators listened to an array of speakers , including American Indian Movement leader Dennis Banks and anti-war activist and congressional candidate Cindy Sheehan .
She asked people to vote for her instead of her opponent , House Speaker Nancy Pelosi , in 2008 .
Banks told his audience : " As I look out over this crowd , I see many young people .
That gives me great hope . "
He recalled that it was the young - many of them students - during the Vietnam War in the late 1960s who took to the streets to pressure the United States to end that war .
Anne Roesler , of the group Military Families Speak Out , said her son was a U.S. soldier who had been deployed to Iraq three times and returned with post - traumatic stress disorder .
" This is Congress ' war , " she said .
" They have the blood of this war on their hands - they are building their political careers with the blood of our loved ones and Iraqis . "
Clarence Thomas , past secretary - treasurer of the International Longshore and Warehouse Union Local 10 , said , " We have to take a lesson from the civil rights movement .
We have to wake up and understand we are all in this together . "
In the throng of San Francisco demonstrators was a trio of Code Pink members , including one attired as the Statue of Liberty , who belted out , " I am going to sing until the world is free , down by the riverside . "
One group , the Raging Grannies , entertained the crowd with protest lyrics sung to classic songs such as " Anchors Away . "
Labor groups made a special effort to get their members to turn out , with hundreds of workers showing up - among them sign installers , teachers , roofers , nurses , security guards and communication workers .
Sharon Cornu , secretary - treasurer Central Labor Council of Alameda County , said it would be the first time that seven Bay Area labor councils - San Francisco , Monterey Bay , North Bay , South Bay , San Mateo , Contra Costa and Alameda - worked together to urge members to attend the protest .
Although Bay Area labor groups have been involved in earlier protests against the war , Cornu said , this was the biggest effort yet .
" More and more union members are seeing the war 's impact on our schools , transportation and health care systems because money is being spent abroad that could be spent at home , " Cornu added .
" We are working people - we make things in this country , and we want to be heard , " said Oakland roofer Leroy Cisneros , echoing Cornu 's words about the pressing need for expenditures on education and health care .
Wendy Bloom , a nurse from Children 's Hospital in Oakland , said , " Our priorities are distorted .
We are spending billions on an unnecessary war instead of health care . "
In the days before the protest , organizers used anti-war videos on the Internet to encourage participation in the rallies across the country .
One video was a two - minute short by the Brave New Foundation in Culver City that invited viewers to be part of something " huge and meaningful . "
Another two - minute video , " Confront the War President , " featured a series of wrenching images of the Iraq war 's dead and dying , grieving relatives and the wounded .
It included film clips of President Bush in interviews - one in 2006 saying , " To assume I wanted war is just flat wrong , " and another in 2004 stating : " I am a war president .
I make policy decisions here in the Oval Office on foreign policy matters with war on my mind . "

May 24 , 2007 : Wasp builds home
Presented with no further explanation , xoB finds
Presented with no further explanation , xoB finds this beautiful set of a wasp building a nest
It 's been a while since Apple launched iTunes Plus , its version of DRM - free tracks sold through the iTunes Store .
Only EMI tracks were sold as 256 kbps , DRM - free AAC files through the iTunes Store in May , and in June , EMI reported that the iTunes Plus tracks were selling well .
Since then , however , we have n't heard much news about it .
But according to people familiar with the matter , we will tomorrow .
Apple plans to expand iTunes Plus to include certain indie music labels starting Wednesday , October 17 ( or sometime this week , at least ) .
This tiny step is encouraging for those of us who like freedom with our music , but it sucks that more of the larger labels are still holding off from hopping on board .
This expansion wo n't include all independent music labels just yet , although we 're optimistic that more will be included in the future .
The bigger news on the iTunes Plus horizon , however , is that Apple plans to drop the price of all iTunes Plus tracks .
Currently , each track is $ 1.29 while " normal " DRMed tracks are 99¢ apiece .
That discrepancy will be no longer , as Apple will begin pricing all of its iTunes Plus songs at 99 ¢ apiece ( DRMed tracks will also remain at 99 ¢ ) .
While we have no information on whether the iTunes Plus songs are selling well , we assume that the decision to drop the price is a response to the Amazon MP3 store .
Amazon sells individual tracks for between 89 ¢ and 99¢ apiece , all without any DRM restrictions .
With that in mind , it 's kind of hard for Apple to compete at $ 1.29 .
We look forward to hearing more details directly from the horse 's mouth very soon .

Equivalence has been on my mind recently !
And you wonder why I have been doing this since the seventies but somehow managed to miss out on earning a Turing Award while utterly failing to amass a small private fortune ?
Judging by the click - throughs on my blog in the last year , there are plenty of people who ca n’t quite bring themselves to pick up a book about ML .
Do n’t fret , the authors have also written The Seasoned Schemer for your first - class functional pleasure .
In an effort to expand my own mind , I will be starting their book about logic programming , The Reasoned Schemer tomorrow .
Note : I wrote this post very quickly last evening , in an almost stream - of - conciousness style .
I had just endured some particularly frustrating client issues , and I really , really wanted to focus on a few bright moments that I had enjoyed that day .
You know , trying to be a good dog After publishing it , I felt unsatisfied with the post .
It did n’t feel like I was saying or thinking anything particularly new , just the same old , same old thing about stretching the mind and looking for the elusive “ quality without a name ” that lies behind well - written software .
So I yanked it and went home .
I was talking with a friend who writes for a living , and she quoted a great aphorism : “ All writing is rewriting . ”
She suggested I rework it , not discard it .
So here it is again , and I hope to rework it until I ’m satisfied .
The first major change will probably be to cut it in half .
We ’ll see about the rest .
I finished reading The Little MLer this morning .
This is abook .
It ’s obviously valuable if you want to learn something about SML or Ocaml .
But having read it , I ’d argue that it ’s a great introduction to strongly typed functional languages , period .
In fact , it ’s probably the very best first book to read before learning Haskell if you have n’t already used a language that combines first - class functions and strong , static typing .
If you read this first , you can concentrate on lazy evaluation and monads without having to grok currying and other first - class functional ideas at the same time .
Two things jumped out at me this morning .
The first was chapter eight , “ Bows and Arrows . ”
This was an introduction to currying and partial function application .
When I say it that way , it sounds rather dry .
But it rolled along quite pleasantly .
The material will be familiar to anyone with a passing familiarity with the idea of a function returning a function .
It has the same ideas you ’ll find in Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs , but delivered with static typing .
This alone is worth the price of the book : I came to the subject with an impoverished experience set : I had used latently typed languages like Scheme and Ruby , as well as static and declaratively typed languages like C++ and Java .
Although I knew “ intellectually ” how languages like Ocaml and Haskell deliver some of the power of Scheme along with the benefits of compile - time type checking , there is no substitute for walking through the examples to spark the “ Aha ! ” feeling .
Incredibly , chapter eight got better .
It finished with a real bang :
The examples in the chapter constructed various functions that took multiple arguments , then constructed their equivalents by combining smaller functions with partial evaluation .
Then it closed withIn other words , first - class functions let you break monolithic functions that take a lot of arguments into smaller components that can be combined and recombined .
This is a deep idea in writing programs .
We often see the tension between programs as collections of small pieces that fit together and black boxes that are configured by means of switches and dials on the outside .
This is a good tension : we call the black box approach “ abstraction ” and we call the combinatory approach “ bottom - up programming . ”
Both produce programs that are expressed economically , but the black box does so by sweeping the complexity “ under the carpet ” and bottom - up programming does so by identifying and combining the simple constituent elements of a program in an economical way .
I think of black box abstractions like inventing new nouns for new ideas .
A web server ?
We ’ll call that a “ Fizbuhlsweepnik . ” A REST server ?
We ’ll call that a “ Harkonnensmelt . ”
Whereas I think of bottom - up programming as inventing smaller nouns , verbs , adjectives , and adverbs , so we can say a “ web server ” or a “ REST server ” or even a “ Caching REST server . ”
Being able to combine the small words gives us more to say with much less effort .
( I am not a linguist , so this argument is suspect ! )
Giles Bowkett nailed this idea when he wondered whether languages like Scheme are actually easier to learn than languages like Java
This makes a lot of sense from the perspective of simplicity .
Pure Scheme is based on just five axiomatic “ special forms ” plus macros to build almost everything else out of the five axioms .
That ’s a lot easier to learn than a language that tries to provide the same power with a plethora of knobs and switches like , and This tells us something about ecosystems versus languages .
Lately , quite reasonable people have wondered aloud whether the ecosystem of frameworks and libraries are more important than the languages themselves .
As we ’re beginning to see with multiple languages running on common VMs , the point may become moot very shortly .
But for now , it is easy to see that libraries tend to look like black boxes .
When they do exactly what you need , they save time and trouble .
But they tend to be wide and shallow , just like Java .
They have a lot of knobs and switches .
Good languages , OTOH , give you power that can be combined and recombined like first - class functions .
They let you tame the black boxes by wrapping up the parts you need and combining them in simple ways .
With currying , a function with twenty arguments can be transformed into a function with one argument .
With powerful languages , a baroque library can be deftly specialized to fit your program .
In the same chapter , the authors talked about extensional equivalence .
This is the idea of two functions that can have the exact same behaviour as each other , even though they are defined in different ways .
As the authors point out , proving that two functions are extensionally equivalent is impossible in the general case .
That should n’t stop anyone with a taste for reading esoteric programming weblogs Something was tickling the back of my mind about this problem .
Yes , it had to do with rewinding into the past to correct mistakes , something like backtracking in a reasoning system .
So perhaps we want an equivalence function that takes two functions “ p ” and “ q ” and returns a Boolean .
Both functions must have the same signature , obviously .
How can we write such a function ?
Here ’s one approach : Scan the history of the program for calls to .
For each call , calland compare the results .
If they differ , return .
Do the same for each call to , comparing its result to the result of callingwith the same arguments .
If there are no differences , return .
But wait , maybe your sample size is insufficient .
No problem , continue forward in the program , and every timeorare called in the future , compare the results from both functions again .
If they are the same , continue on .
But if they differ , rewind back to when the equivalence function was called and return false .
That does not guarantee equivalence , of course , they may differ for some set of inputs that you never tested in your program .
But if they are equivalent for the set of inputs you actually run , what do you care if they differ for inputs outside of the “ event horizon ” of your program ?
Now quite honestly , I cannot think of a practical use for this “ rewinding extensional equivalence predicate . ”
I mention it only because the thought captures for me one of the benefits of reading certain kinds of books : they provoke you into thinking about new things in new ways .
They may be useful immediately , or they may pop up down the road .
Or maybe they were just a passing thought that amounted to nothing of grave importance .
But overall , my experience is that people and writing that pushes you into unfamiliar thinking territory is good for you .
And in that spirit , I recommend The Little MLer with as much enthusiasm as I recommend writing your own version of the Y Combinator
" Your shoes , clothes and car are already made automatically , but your house is built by hand and it does n't make sense . "
That 's word from Dr. Behrokh Khoshnevis , whose team at USC is getting ready to debut a $ 1.5 million robot designed to build homes with zero help from puny humans .
The bot should have its first test run in California this April , where it will build the shell of a two - story house in 24 hours .
The operation is akin to a 3D inkjet printer , with the robot moving about in three dimensional space , spraying out the home layer by layer .
Part of the simplicity of the process comes from the simplicity of the materials : nearly the whole house is built with concrete and gypsum , obviously leaving a bit of work for the decorators , but allowing for complicated shapes and cheap construction -- about a fifth of current costs .
A rival robotic house building being developed at Loughborough University takes a week to build a home , but will include fancier designs , including ducts for water , electrical and ventilation .
Unfortunately , we 'll have to wait around 5 years for that model to hit the market , and by then we 'll all be having so much fun driving around in our flying cars we wo n't even have time to bother with these " home " things .

Whither High School Computer Science ?
May 11 , 2007 at 11:12 am
Last year , when I finally decided that I wanted to pursue a career in computing and programming , I decided to take the AP Computer Science class my high school offers ( skipping Computer Science I , which uses Visual Basic 6 ) .
Though I had heard bad things about Java in the past , I figured it could n’t be all bad – after all , in order to get kids excited about CS , they would n’t teach in a crappy and flabby language , would they ?
Well , they did .
Now , I could launch into a rant about how CS does n’t necessarily have anything to do with programming languages , how all that ’s really important is algorithms and big - O efficiency , how aspiring CS students need math more than anything else , and so on and so forth in the vein of Knuth and Dijkstra .
But I do n’t believe it in the slightest .
Sure , CS does n’t necessarily have anything to do with any particular programming language , as shown by the decades of computer scientists who made stunning achievements simply through logic , mathematics and perseverance ; however , CS is only interesting as an academic field because there are things which computers can do and humans ca n’t ( and vice versa ) .
A CS student trained without a knowledge of programming languages is nothing more than a mathematics student .
But I also believe that languages should n’t interfere with learning through syntactic or design flaws .
Java is a major sinner in these regards .
We spent several weeks going over ( in excruciating detail ) the difference between an int and an Integer – what , exactly , does that have to do with CS ?
Sure , we learned something about OOP – except for all the interesting things , such as the history of OOP , the reasons behind encapsulation , the uses of multiple inheritance ( and the problems and solutions therein ) , and how OOP has changed from its pure Smalltalk roots to its bastardized Java form .
We learned that we need to predeclare variables in a statically - typed language , but not any of the reasons why static typing may or may not be a good thing ( speed , type safety , robustness , etc. ) .
And there ’s so much we did n’t learn .
We spent maybe a week on sorting and searching ; never mind that the truly remarkable thing about computer - based algorithms is that they can search , sort , and process data in ways that no dead , ink - based y=mx +b equation ever could .
We did n’t look at Nextstep ’s use of object - orientation to power an entire operating system , quite possibly the most concrete use of OOP ever .
If we wanted to focus on practical uses of Java , why did n’t we learn how to use Eclipse , the best Java IDE out there ?
Why did we use Java 1.4 instead of Java 1.5 or 1.6 , thereby abandoning templates , primitive autoboxing and helpful classes such as Scanner ?
If we truly wanted to learn about writing good code and learning the fundamentals of computer programming , we should have used Smalltalk .
Using Squeak or VisualWorks or Cincom , we could learned how a truly , 100 % object - oriented programming language works , the history of the GUI , how to create an intuitive GUI without endless Swing components , how to program in a robust , intuitive and simple language free of warts , and , most importantly , how to use computers to do things and solve problems that only computers can do .
Instead , we learn Java .

NEW YORK ( CNNMoney.com ) --
A significant proportion of lipstick manufactured in the United States and used by millions of American women contains surprisingly high levels of lead , the Campaign for Safe Cosmetics said Thursday .
According to new product tests , 61 percent of brand - name lipsticks tested contained detectable levels of lead , which can be toxic if ingested .
The top brands testing positive for lead included L'Or�al Colour Riche " True Red , " L'Or�al Colour Riche " Classic Wine , " Cover Girl Incredifull Lipcolor " Maximum Red " and Dior Addict " Positive Red , " the group said .
The FDA said it is aware of concerns about lead in lipstick and is following up on the report , a spokeswoman said .
" These concerns have not generally been supported by FDA 's own analysis of products on the market , " the spokeswoman said .
" In the present case , we are looking into the specific details of the issues raised . "
Federal regulation covers lead levels in lipstick coloring , she said .
An industry representative said the products tested by the CSC meet FDA standards .
" The FDA has set daily safe levels for lead exposure for adults , children and pregnant women , " said John Bailey , the executive vice president for the Science Cosmetic , Toiletry , and Fragrance Association , a trade group representing the cosmetics industry .
" The agency also has set strict limits for lead levels allowed in the colors used in lipsticks . "
In a statement , L'Or�al Group said it " is committed to upholding the highest standards of safety for all the products it makes and sells .
Each and every ingredient used in our products has been thoroughly reviewed and tested by our internal safety team . "
Procter & Gamble ( Charts , Fortune 500 ) , the company that owns Cover Girl , said it follows a " very rigorous scientific process " in evaluating its products and the ingredients used to make them .
" P&G stands behind the safety of our products because of the standards we set and the rigid requirements imposed by our industry , " the company said .
A spokeswoman for Christian Dior cosmetics was not available for comment .
According to the Campaign for Safe Cosmetics , one - third of the tested lipsticks exceeded the FDA 's limit for lead in candy - a standard established to protect children from directly ingesting lead .
Pregnant women and young children are particularly vulnerable to lead exposure .
" Lead builds up in the body over time and lead - containing lipstick applied several times a day , every day , can add up to significant exposure levels .
The latest studies show there is no safe level of lead exposure , " Mark Mitchell , M.D. , president of the Connecticut Coalition for Environmental Justice said in the CSC statement .
The lead tests were conducted by an independent laboratory over the month of September on red lipsticks bought in Boston , Hartford , Conn. , San Francisco and Minneapolis , according to the CSC .
The Campaign for Safe Cosmetics , established in 2002 , is made up of women's , public health , labor , environmental health and consumer - rights groups including the Breast Cancer Fund , Clean Water Fund and National Environmental Trust .
Longtime international journalist Robert Fisk has entered the debate over September 11th 2001 .
Immediately , he was pounced on by CounterPunch for voicing his concerns .
Manuel Garcia Jr. , whose actual career has included work on more advanced weapons of mass destruction ( WMD's ) for the US government , has written some questionable papers about the New York building " collapses " of 9/11 .
Garcia no longer includes his Lawrence Livermore Laboratory resume at the end of his articles , for some reason , but this is what he told us originally :
" [ Garcia 's ] working experience includes measurements on nuclear bomb tests , devising mathematical models of energetic physical effects , and trying to enlarge a union of weapons scientists . "
While establishing some level of expertise , the elephant in the room would be the morality of someone , at this late stage of our MAD evolution , helping build more effective nuclear bombs .
And , if one has no reservations about vaporizing thousands to millions of humans , in a single blast , what 's a little disinformation on the morality spectrum ?
Garcia 's first papers were rebutted by Kevin Ryan , formerly of UL Laboratories , the man who was outright fired from his position solely for raising issues about the World Trade Center " facts " with the head of the NIST .
If you 're a big fan of physical and mechanical arguments , you can wade into that debate .
But that 's not what makes Garcia a propagandist .
It is Garcia 's relentless insistence that there could not possibly have been any " conspiracy " whatsoever on 9/11 , despite mountains of evidence that this is the most likely scenario .
Garcia can jumble his numbers around all he wants , but he has not a word to say about the actions of FBI and CIA , Mossad , ISI , Saudi intelligence , and the alleged hijackers who supposedly carried out these deeds .
The cover -up by Bush operative Phillip Zelikow is irrlevant to Garcia as well , as is the whistleblowing of numerous witnesses .
It appears Garcia has never read the relevant material , yet he pontificates and ridicules ( like his editor A. Cockburn ) , without the slightest grasp of why something smells wrong with the entire September 11th affair .
This is either Garcia / Cockburn 's willful ignorance , or it's a deliberate disinformation campaign .
It 's not up to me to sort out the motives of irrational propagandists like Garcia and Cockburn .
Enter poor old Robert Fisk .
Already fearful of angry individuals whom Fisk has dubbed " the ravers " of 9/11 ( " no planers " ? ) ,
Fisk attempted to chart a measured and evidence - based course through the September 11th puzzle .
Here is what likely attracted Garcia 's attention .
Fisk :
" I am talking about scientific issues .
If it is true , for example , that kerosene burns at 820C under optimum conditions , how come the steel beams of the twin towers – whose melting point is supposed to be about 1,480C – would snap through at the same time ? "
-- Robert Fisk
Garcia also fails to answer Fisk 's most on - point observation : " would snap through at the same time ? "
The simultaneous and symmetrical " failure " is the heart of the controlled demolition hypothesis .
Such perfect symmetry does n't just happen , not once , not twice , God damn certainly not three times in a row !
It must be made to happen , quite carefully , quite expertly .
An entire industry exists just to make these steel framed buildings fall down exactly into their footprints , or else ... they WOULDN'T !
To acknowledge this is a responsible and credible observation , nothing like what Garcia puts out .
In Garcia 's physics , the controlled demolition industry is unnecessary .
One just needs a kerosene tank and some office furniture to bring down a skyscraper neatly .

Andrei Lugovoi has denied the charges
Russia 's constitution did not permit it to hand over citizens and British prosecutors ' competence was in doubt if they had not known that , Mr Putin said .
He said if the UK sent enough evidence a trial could be held in Russia .
The UK wants to charge Andrei Lugovoi , who denies involvement , with murdering Mr Litvinenko , 43 , in London in 2006 .
He died in November after exposure to the radioactive isotope polonium - 210 .
Mr Litvinenko , who was granted political asylum in the UK in 2000 , was a former KGB agent himself and a critic of Mr Putin .
The UK's director of public prosecutions has recommended that Mr Lugovoi be tried for murder by " deliberate poisoning " and a formal extradition request has been handed over to the authorities in Moscow .
KEY EVENTS IN CASE 1 November 2006 : Alexander Litvinenko meets Andrei Lugovoi and another Russian at a London hotel 23 November 2006 : Litvinenko dies in a London hospital 24 November 2006 : A Litvinenko statement accuses Russian President Vladimir Putin of involvement in his death .
Experts say Litvinenko was poisoned 6 December 2006 : UK police say they are treating the death as murder 22 May 2007 : Lugovoi should be charged with Litvinenko 's murder , British prosecutors say 28 May 2007 : UK makes formal request for Lugovoi 's extradition from Russia
Full timeline of events
The request has been made under the 1957 Council of Europe European Convention on Extradition , of which Russia is a signatory .
However , Russia does have the right , under Article 6 , to refuse to extradite one of its nationals .
Speaking to journalists ahead of his attendance at the G8 summit in Germany , Mr Putin reiterated the fact that Russia can prosecute a citizen for a crime in a foreign country .
However , he said the UK had not yet supplied it with sufficient details of the case against Mr Lugovoi , who met Mr Litvinenko on the day he fell ill .
" Rather than simply demand Lugovoi 's extradition , they should send enough evidence for the case to be taken to court , " he said .
" We 'll do it in Russia , and any person found guilty of causing Litvinenko 's death will be convicted . "
Mr Litvinenko's widow , Marina , has dismissed Mr Lugovoi 's claims that British secret services had a part in the death .
She said her husband 's case was different from anything that had happened before and Russia should reconsider its law over extraditions .
" This day is a launching day .
This is the day when we are going to do something different in this city , " Street said .
" Every one of us is going to make a personal commitment today that . . .
' I 'm going to do the work to make this a better community . '
It 's a new day . "
Electromagnetically - induced transparency , or EIT , has been known in the visible realm for quite some time .
The process is used to control such characteristics as dispersion and absorption in gases , allowing the gases to become transparent at a certain wavelength from an interacting laser .
Until now , EIT has not been used in x-rays .
Researchers at Argonne National Laboratory in Illinois are changing that .
Their paper predicting EIT for x-rays in laser - dressed neon gas is titled “ Electromagnetically Induced Transparency for X Rays , ” and published in Physical Review Letters .
“ Very fast x-ray pulses are a subject of investigation now , ” one of the researchers , Christian Buth , tells PhysOrg.com .
“ With ultra - fast x-rays , we can watch atoms in a molecule move , almost like a movie . ”
Linda Young , another of the Argonne researchers on this project , points out that being able to image the structure of a complex molecule could be one of the interesting applications to emerge from this work .
“ We could watch molecules reacting in real time , learning about fundamental interactions . ”
One of the reasons this method of getting ultra - fast x-ray pulses is interesting rests in the fact that it is relatively low cost .
“ Expensive x-ray sources are coming , ” says the third member of the group , Robin Santra , “ and we have found that a laser could produce , in a practical way , short x-ray pulses . ”
Buth adds that this method is “ less expensive , and the shorter pulses are important , because with the longer pulses the molecule just vibrates , and the image is blurred . ”
Santra explains that this method can be applied in pump - probe experiments , making them more direct , allowing scientists to learn more about the actual changes .
“ In all pump probe experiments , ” he explains , “ you give a molecule a well - defined ‘ kick , ’ perturbing it in a controlled way .
Then you wait a certain amount of time to see that molecule going into a specific change in geometry . ”
Santra says that right now , scientists look at the time evolution of light absorption , and the observation is indirect .
Ultrafast x-rays , Santra points out , allows direct observation .
“ With these ultra - fast x-rays , we hit the molecule with an initial pulse , and then probe it with another pulse .
Each pulse is well defined , in time duration and relative time delay .
You could even do more pulses , and directly watch the evolution of the molecule with these pulses in real time . ”
In this particular instance , the Argonne researchers suggest using EIT in neon to produce ultra - short x-ray pulses .
“ We tried it with krypton , ” Young explains , “ but it has a high nuclear charge and showed small effects .
Neon , on the other hand , has a lower charge and the inner shell decay takes longer , giving rise to dramatic changes . ”
She continues : “ Our theory indicates that by putting on a 800 nanometer laser , we can make neon gas , which is normally opaque , transparent . ”
Young also points out that the transparency effect is reversible .
“ It is only transparent when the laser is on the gas . ”
Even though this form of producing ultra - fast x-ray pulses would have its uses , the Argonne researchers admit to its limitations .
“ A tunable x-ray free electron laser is more useful for spectroscopy applications .
The fingerprint of an atom or molecule provided by spectroscopy would make it possible to follow the changes associated with a particular atom or molecule in complex material .
Right now we ca n’t do this . ”
“ At this point our scheme could do diffraction , but could only measure groups of atoms ; it could n’t resolve single atoms , ” Santra adds .
“ If we could increase the resolution , suddenly atoms could be distinguished .
The goal is to move to even shorter wavelengths . ”
EIT for x-rays is still at the theory stage .
However , Young is planning an experiment at the Advanced Light Source at Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory with Argonne ’s Atomic Physics Group .
This should demonstrate whether or not the prediction for neon transparency can be substantiated experimentally .

The last flight out taxied from the sparkling new Harare airport , built to handle the non-existent tourists , lifted over the city and dipped its wings in farewell .
With that , at 9 am yesterday , British Airways said goodbye to Zimbabwe , amid mutterings from supporters of Robert Mugabe that the pull - out had less to do with the collapse of its economy than a British government plot to unseat the Zimbabwean ruler .
In seat 13H , Cephas Msipa , a lifelong member of Mr Mugabe 's Zanu - PF , said he thought it probably was all a conspiracy but he was going to miss British Airways anyway , particularly when he reflects on the alternative .
" In these difficult times , Air Zimbabwe has developed what you might call a reputation for being unreliable , " he said .
What he means is that Zimbabwe 's national carrier is in much the same state as the country , with flights running days late for lack of fuel or maintenance , or diverted at Mr Mugabe 's whim to a shopping trip in Kuala Lumpar or to attend the Pope 's funeral .
Annie , a white Zimbabwean who preferred not to give her surname for fear of retribution by " Comrade Bob " as Mr Mugabe is nicknamed , is going to miss BA for another reason .
" You know there 's toilet paper on this plane .
I have n't been able get toilet paper in the shops for weeks , " she said .
" I do n't know why it matters that this is the last flight but it does .
It 's as if we 're finally being cut off from the rest of the world .
I think for us [ whites ] it felt like the escape route if we ever needed it .
It 's stupid really because we can get to South Africa easily enough but it just made us feel better having the BA link . "
Though symbolic , it 's not the first time BA has been forced out of Zimbabwe in the 75 years since the first flying boats opened up the aerial link with southern Africa .
Services were discontinued in 1965 as Ian Smith declared independence for Rhodesia with the deluded pledge that not in a thousand years would a black man rule .
BA was back 15 years later as Mr Smith was defeated by the reality of economics as much as war ; Rhodesia ceased to exist and the only black man to ever rule Zimbabwe , Robert Mugabe , took power .
Yesterday , the last plane left behind another government sinking deeper into the delusion that everything is under its control .
As the economy contracts amid hyperinflation and collapsing production , Mr Mugabe has created a vast new bureaucracy to oversee price controls on non-existent goods in the shops .
His finance minister maintains an official exchange rate so out of proportion with the hidden market that the central bank governor has to send his staff out to buy dollars on the street .
The regime has declared " the mother of all agricultural seasons " even though there is no bread in the shops because the wheat harvest has fallen short by two - thirds and production of tobacco , once Zimbabwe 's biggest money earner , has dropped to one - fifth of what it once was .
Cigarettes are in such short supply that a marijuana joint is cheaper .
The government has even announced plans to sell electricity to Namibia next year although it does n't generate the power to keep lights on at home .
The reality is that a man living in a Harare township lucky enough to have a job earns , on average , Z$ 5 m dollars a month , or £ 2.50 at the hidden - market rate .
His transport to work in Harare costs more than that but he has to overspend if he wants to keep his job .
Other European airlines abandoned Zimbabwe as it sank deeper into the mire but BA stayed because historic ties with Britain , the old colonial power , assured a steady supply of passengers .
But the airline says it has been defeated by escalating costs , particularly the price of having to ship fuel in by road from South Africa , and the unreal maths of the Zimbabwean economy .
An Air Zimbabwe economy class ticket to London and back officially costs £ 7,500 at the government exchange rate but just £ 225 on the alternative rate , half the price of a BA ticket ( which could only be bought in pounds sterling or US dollars ) , after the Zimbabwe dollar plummeted from $ 5,100 to the pound at the beginning of the year to close to $ 2 m today .
Mr Msipa is suspicious of the economic claims , as is the Zimbabwean government .
He does n't understand how BA is n't making money .
" It 's interesting that it 's pulling out at the same time Gordon Brown came in and made a more concerted effort to cut ties with Zimbabwe .
To us it would seem it 's part of the ratcheting up of sanctions .
Mr Msipa admits there is a crisis though , and that his dad might be part of the problem .
His father , who shares the same name , is a liberation war hero and now the Zanu - PF governor of Midlands province where he has overseen the confiscation of white - owned farms and the collapse of agriculture .
Mr Msipa concedes this may have been a mistake .
" Being an old nationalist he would be in the mainstream of this soil - based development , that everything is about the land .
Whereas our generation says we should get into computers and call centres .
I do n't see myself being a horse - drawn plough , " he said .
The younger Mr Msipa is a property developer who travels regularly to London .
At home he also sells houses .
He suspects many of those buying are Zimbabweans living abroad , and those selling are in desperate need of cash .
That has kept the worst of it at bay for him and his five children .
" We have a relative advantage .
I can get things done ... I have contacts , " he said .
" But how I 'm going to get to London now is a problem .
No one wants to go through Johannesburg .
They steal your luggage there .
I suppose it will just have to be Air Zimbabwe . "
ON APRIL 2 , this newspaper reported that the Los Angeles Police Department had asked Philip Morris USA for a $ 50,000 donation to help fund its investigation into counterfeit cigarettes .
That makes a lot of sense :
If TV cop shows have commercials , why should n’t real police work have corporate sponsors too ( you know , aside from the obvious reasons of favoritism , bias and perverse incentives ) ?
For that matter , what ’s wrong with wealthy families in La Cañada Flintridge , San Marino and other communities holding constant fundraisers to pay for the unfunded needs of their local public schools — drama societies and marching bands and that sort of thing ?
Or with parents having to go out and purchase body armor on their own so that their sons are protected in Iraq ?
What ’s so odd about the crown jewel of the University of California graduate system , Boalt Hall Law School , having to move toward “ privatization ” so that it can raise more money and better compete with its private counterparts in an era when state funding has dried up ?
What ’s so wrong , in other words , with hollowing out the public sector and replacing it with a pay - as - you - go society ?
It is the natural endpoint , after all , of the privatization craze , of the gospel of tax cuts and of the smaller - government - is - better - government mentality that has been on the ascendancy in the U.S. for nearly 25 years .
The New York Times recently offered a particularly striking example : Apparently there are about a dozen jails throughout California that offer pay - to - stay “ upgrades . ”
Inmates ( or “ clients , ” as they ’re known ) who pay an extra $ 75 to $ 127 a day get a cell with a regular door , located at some distance from violent offenders , as well as the right , in some cases , to bring in an iPod , a cellphone or a laptop .
The rich no longer need patronize the same jails as the rest of us .
It makes you wonder whether Paris Hilton ’s unexpected jail time is a sentence or a scouting mission for new hotel expansion opportunities .
How has this come to pass ?
As the old adage goes , when the gods want to punish you , they give you what you want .
Conservatives talk a lot about government failure , but over the last few years , it ’s really we who have failed government , depriving it of the revenue , the conscientious management and the attention needed for it to succeed .
Undercapitalize a pizza joint and your customers will taste the poor ingredients , become frustrated by the long waits and grow repulsed by the grimy environs .
Staff it with your unmotivated drinking buddies and the service will falter , as will the quality of the product .
It ’s no way to run a pizza place , and it ’s certainly no way to run a government .
But that ’s exactly what we ’ve done .
With Proposition 13 and the famous California tax revolt , and with presidents whose entire domestic programs amounted to mindless tax - cutting , and with Congresses that have been happy to pass cuts and stack deficits , we have systematically deprived the government of the revenues it needs to provide basic services , even as we ’ve come to need it to do so much more .
The Bush administration has only added to the problem .
The president once said : “ I was campaigning in Chicago , and somebody asked me , ‘ Is there ever any time where the budget might have to go into deficit ? ’
I said only if we were at war or had a national emergency or were in recession .
Little did I realize we ’d get the trifecta . ”
He ’s right .
Not only have we spent more than $ 500 billion in Iraq and Afghanistan and untold more on homeland security measures , but we ’ve created , in Medicare Part D , the most expensive new entitlement since President Johnson signed the Great Society into existence .
We ’ve also increased education spending through the No Child Left Behind Act .
And during all this , tax cuts have robbed the Treasury of $ 200 billion in revenue ; the need for a two - thirds majority in the Legislature impeded the flexibility of California to raise state taxes to compensate , while Proposition 13 continued to handicap our municipalities .
All that money has to come from somewhere .
And the “ where ” is n’t the high - profile initiatives that the media is watching — the Medicares and Social Securities ( although they may suffer too ) — but from the smaller , less - noticed , but critically important programs and departments that millions rely on .
If Congress must constantly approve high - profile emergency expenditures that funnel hundreds of billions of dollars toward Iraq , and states cannot pick up the slack , there will have to be cuts in funding for police and schools and jails and Pell Grants and the Food and Drug Administration and the National Institutes of Health and the Department of Veterans Affairs and the nation ’s infrastructure and all the rest .
So is it any surprise that law enforcement is extending a beggar ’s cup to Philip Morris , public colleges are becoming less affordable and UC law schools are shilling for corporate dollars ?
And that it ’s all happening even as the globalizing economy demands ever higher skills , as ill and traumatized Iraq war veterans are going without care , as roads and schools are crumbling and myriad other minor catastrophes are underway beneath the notice of the national media but well within the range where they harm ordinary Americans .
Such unhappy outcomes are not merely morally unsettling , they ’re often economically inefficient .
Government spending can be more than necessary , it can be desirable .
It can step in , for instance , when the market fails to deliver public goods that society desires but private entities have n’t figured out how to fund .
( It ’s useful having a national military , right ? )
And it can use its regulatory power to ensure that competition works to increase well - being rather than to simply amp up industry profits .
UC Berkeley economist Brad DeLong once wrote that “ sometimes government failures are greater than the market failures for which they purport to compensate .
Sometimes they are not . ”
The trick is knowing which is which .
But if , like the Bush administration , you are blithely unconcerned with running an efficient , effective government , funding its necessary elements , presenting honest choices to the American people between tax cuts and social investment and staffing the whole enterprise with skilled professionals , you never need make those judgments as you have neither the resources nor the personnel to effectively deploy the central organizing structure of modern societies .
And that ’s a shame .
Libertarian humorist P.J. O’Rourke likes to say that “ Republicans are the party that says government does n’t work , and then they get elected and prove it . ”
Over the last few years , that ’s been true .
But government can work , and increasingly , Americans appear to be anticipating its return .
A new Pew Research Center poll finds that public support for a societal safety net and for government protections is at its highest levels in more than a decade — which suggests that Americans do n’t think bake sales are the way to fund their schools or that Philip Morris is really who they want subsidizing law enforcement .
And in recent elections , the once popular “ Taxpayer ’s Bill of Rights ” amendments that seemed so unstoppable a decade ago are being rejected and , in Colorado , repealed , as voters finally tire of paying the costs in broken infrastructure and insufficient public services .
When asked what type of political system Americans would have , Ben Franklin famously responded , “ A republic , if you can keep it . ”
Well , he also bequeathed us a government , if we can run it .
And somehow , I do n’t think the Philip Morris police department is quite what he had in mind .
Can Capitalism Be Green ?
By Stephen Leahy
Experts say continuous economic growth , intrinsic to capitalism , is not viable on a planet with increasingly scarce natural resources .
May 7 ( IPS / IFEJ ) – Capitalism has proven to be environmentally and socially unsustainable , so future prosperity will have to come from a new economic model , say some experts .
Just what this new model will look like is the subject of intense debate .
One current states that continuous growth can be environmentally compatible if clean and efficient technologies are adopted , and if economies stop producing material goods and move towards services .
This is known as sustainable prosperity .
International agreements to fight global problems , like the thinning of the atmosphere ’s ozone layer and climate change , used market principles to achieve compliance by the private sector .
But the problem is , “ We are consuming 25 percent more than the Earth can give us each year , ” says William Rees , of the School of Community and Regional Planning at the University of British Columbia .
Rees and other experts have calculated that annual human consumption of natural resources exceeds the planet ’s ecological capacity to regenerate them by 25 percent , a proportion that has been growing since 1984 , the first year the calculate that humanity crossed that capacity threshold .
“ Our planet needs natural capital ( resources ) like trees to provide the ecosystem services of clean air and water that we all depend on , ” said Rees in an interview .
He was one of the inventors in 1992 of the concept of “ ecological footprint ” , an indicator of how much productive land a certain human population needs in order to supply itself with resources and to absorb its waste .
Capitalism is all about accumulation of wealth based on the consumption of natural resources , whose availability is strictly limited , he said .
We are also exceeding the maximum amounts of pollution or waste products , such as carbon dioxide emissions — the main contributor to climate change – , that the planet can absorb and process without affect .
Market economists call pollution and its impacts “ externalities ” , and rarely factor them into the economic models , he said .
Rees defines sustainable prosperity as the global use of resources and generation of wastes that do not exceed the planet ’s capacity to regenerate and absorb .
Equally important , he says , is the social dimension : true prosperity is possible only when income disparity between the rich and poor is small .
“ U.S. executives are paid 500 to 1,000 times more than their workers , and this inequity continues to worsen , ” he said .

KHH Obituary
Britain 's first remote control police aircraft , dubbed the " spy drone " , took to the skies today .
The unmanned CCTV drone , which measures only a metre wide , is fitted with the latest in CCTV cameras and can record images from a height of 500m .
It was originally designed for military reconnaissance but is being used in a trial by Merseyside police to monitor public disorder , large crowds and traffic congestion .
The force will also be looking at how the drone could be used during firearms operations and in efforts to reduce anti-social behaviour .
The controversial new spy plane was launched a day after Ian Readhead , the deputy chief constable of Hampshire police , warned that Britain risked becoming a surveillance society .
He said Britain faced an Orwellian style system of spying with cameras on every street corner .
But police in Merseyside insisted that the drone did not represent the next phase in creating a Big Brother society .
Assistant chief constable Simon Byrne said : " People clamour for the feeling of safety which cameras give .
Our feedback from the public is anything we can do to fight crime is a good thing .
" There are safeguards in place legally covering the use of CCTV and the higher the level of intrusion , the higher the level of authority needed within the police force to use it .
So there is that balance there . "
The miniature helicopter , classified as an unmanned aerial vehicle , is almost silent when in use and is fitted with night - vision cameras to enable operators to carry out surveillance after dark .
It can be airborne in less than three minutes and the high - quality digital images it records can be instantly transmitted to a support vehicle or control room .
Alistair Fox , from Stoke - on - Trent - based MW Power , which supplies the drone in the UK , said the device was not restricted by civil aviation requirements and could either be flown by remote control or by using pre-programmed GPS navigation systems .
" It is much easier to control than an ordinary remote - controlled helicopter .
It 's pretty much forward , back , left , right and record , " he said .
" They are military derived and obviously I can't talk too much about that particular use but they are essentially reconnaissance tools .
" They have been used in Germany for eight years and we have been involved with them for about six months . "
Police said the drone was expected to be fully operational next month and would be given a three - month trial .
With the shuttles back to their regular flight schedule , NASA is working through the backlog of components they need to attach to the International Space Station .
One of the important ones will be the Columbus space laboratory , developed by the European Space Agency .
Columbus was flown to Florida back in May , 2006 , to get in line for its launch to the station .
Earlier this year , it was removed from temporary storage , and engineers equipped it with experiment racks and orbital hardware .
After a break over the summer , workers will continue preparing it for launch .
If all goes well , it will blast into space atop the space shuttle Atlantis as early as December 6th , 2007 .
The module was originally supposed to launch in 2002 , but the Columbia disaster and the station construction delays pushed the schedule back 5 years .

“ " When in 1951 I was inducted into the CIA as a deep cover agent , the procedures for disguising my affiliation and my work were unsmilingly comprehensive .
It was three months before I was formally permitted to inform my wife what the real reason was for going to Mexico City to live .
If , a year later , I had been apprehended , dosed with sodium pentothal , and forced to give out the names of everyone I knew in the CIA , I could have come up with exactly one name , that of my immediate boss ( E. Howard Hunt , as it happened ) .
In the passage of time one can indulge in idle talk on spook life .
In 1980 I found myself seated next to the former president of Mexico at a ski-area restaurant .
What , he asked amiably , had I done when I lived in Mexico ?
" I tried to undermine your regime , Mr. President . "
He thought this amusing , and that is all that it was , under the aspect of the heavens ” .
In 1951 the CIA recruited Yale graduate William F. Buckley , Jr. , who wrote the paragraph above , into their ranks as a “ deep cover agent . ”
Yale supplied most of the early agents for the CIA and many of these individuals went on to placement high up in government or in multinational corporations .
It was an exclusive fraternity , serving the interests not of Americans but of the corporations .
Through their lives they took with them loyalties and a world view that was very different than that of ordinary Americans , uninvested in those very special interests .
There is a case to believe that William Buckley remained in that service .
It was not so much service to the CIA as it was to those who had come to control government , the collation of multinational corporations that today have given up trying to hide their intentions with the very public and obvious moves now underway .
Among these are the North American Union , or Security and Prosperity Partnership of North America ,
The driver 's licenses , ready for use , show their logo of the whole of North America ; the insistence by the Feds on a Real ID that asserts absolute Federal Control ; the LESO program that is now converting control of local law enforcement into Federal property .
These prove what they denied for years .
You can try to go to the LESO site but if you do a block comes up .
You can read more about it on the Rockwell site ; Lew is not usually an alarmist .
These are the end times , but not in the way Evangelicals have imagined ; many who had bought into the Rapture are horrified at the bankruptcy now facing America , brought on by these same interests .
In the name of furthering the agenda or corporations America has justified torture , endless war , covert ops carried out routinely on all of us , and more .
We are watching as the markets collapse and as people lose their homes in steadily increasing numbers , as the vital resources that belong to all of us , including the air ways themselves , are sold off along with the water we drink .
The only cheering note is the report that ' they ' are now preparing to destroy the evidence of this in Washington D. C. , so perhaps Bush intends to leave after all , failing to finish what his grandfather Prescott Bush planned in 1943 , the military take over of the US government .
Those working on this are relatively small in number .
Buckley is one of them .
William Buckley was trained and paid by the CIA as a covert agent ; he admits this as a matter of simple fact .
If you look closely at his actions between 1951 and now there are many reasons to conclude he never left that job ; all that changed was his assignment and perhaps how he was compensated .
To control the direction of America it was essential to limit the ideas in politics , especially movements that changed the framing regarding the power of government and the rights of the people .
At that point in time there was only one movement that worried them .

でかいソフトウェアの、大量のソースコードを短時間で読む必要が生じたので、その補助ツールとしてptrace(2)ベースのLinux用関数トレーサを自作しました。こういうツール上でまずソフトウェアを実行してみて、どのファイルのどの関数がどういう順で呼ばれるか把握おけば、いきなりソースコードの山と格闘を始めるより楽かなーと思いまして。せっかく作ったので公開します。
http://binary.nahi.to/hogetrace/
straceはシステムコールだけ、ltraceは共有ライブラリ( DSO)の関数呼び出しだけ*1をトレースしますが、このツールは、実行バイナリ中の自作関数の呼び出しもトレースします。例えば再帰で1から10まで足し算するソースコードを用意して
% cat recursion .c # include < stdio.h > int sum ( int n ) { return n == 0 ? 0 : n + sum(n - 1 ) ; } int main ( ) { int s = sum ( 10 ) ; printf ( " sum ( 10 ) = %d
" , s ) ; return s ; }
最適化なしで普通にコンパイルしてトレーサにかけてみるとこんな感じの出力になります。-g をつけると、ファイル名/行番号を出せるので、そうしてあります。

The man found dead after being hit on Interstate 880 in Hayward was identified Friday as a hitchhiker from Berkeley who secretly clung to the bottom of a truck for 20 miles before losing his grip , falling to the freeway and being struck by numerous cars , authorities said .
David Connolly , 37 , walked up to a truck parked off Interstate 80 in Berkeley before dawn Thursday and , in Spanish , asked the driver for a ride , said California Highway Patrol Officer Mike Davis .
The truck driver , who had been sleeping , told authorities he was uncomfortable with the idea and told Connolly no .
When Connolly insisted and tried to open the truck door , the driver blocked him and started to drive away .
Without the driver 's knowledge , however , Connolly had somehow climbed underneath the truck and hidden himself in a space above the driveshaft , Davis said .
Near the A Street exit on I - 880 in Hayward , Connolly apparently lost his grip .
It was unclear whether Connolly let go because the truck hit a bump , if he passed out from fumes or fell asleep .
It is also not known whether he died as a result of falling to the freeway or from being hit by many cars , Davis said .
Asked how Connolly could have hung on in such a fashion , Davis said , " For dear life . "
Authorities reached their conclusion after the truck driver came forward .
He had seen news reports about the death and found bits of clothing and remains under his truck , Davis said .
The space between the bottom of the truck and the ground measured 44 inches , which was enough to provide clearance for someone , Davis said .
Connolly 's remains were strewn across five lanes and 1,000 feet of highway , and the CHP reported receiving about 80 phone calls from witnesses or drivers who had hair or blood on their cars .
The southbound freeway was shut down for more than two hours .
The Alameda County coroner 's office used Connolly 's fingerprints to identify him .
BERLIN ( Reuters ) - A mysterious blonde paid a visit to a petrol station shop in the small eastern German town of Doemitz on Sunday -- wearing nothing but a pair of golden stilettos and a thin gold bracelet .
The tall , slender woman strolled into the shop in the town of Doemitz on the warm afternoon and bought cigarettes , petrol station employee Ines Swoboda told Reuters on Monday .
“ I was n’t surprised because she ’s come in naked before -- she ’s a very nice woman , ” Swoboda said , adding none of the other customers was bothered .
The woman could have faced charges of creating a public disturbance if anyone had complained .
A quick - witted customer did , however , snap pictures of the woman believed to be about 30 years old as she walked back to a waiting Ferrari and climbed into the passenger seat .
Several of those photos appeared in the German media on Monday .
A Stanford University study had kids taste food in McDonald packaging and unmarked packaging and asked which they preferred .
The kids preferred the McDonald packaged food not realizing that they went for it because they were conditioned to believe " it must taste good . "
You can be negative about the effects of advertising and packaging , but I think if you apply the lesson learned from the study noted above , you 'll find that you can use this information positively .
After being inspired by the Stanford University study on McDonald 's packaging effect on kids , I came up with an idea to get kids to eat their veggies as enthusiastically as ' snack ' .
If zip - seal bags would be pre-printed with cool graphics like those on national brand snack packaging ( which kids love ) , then they might be more inclined to take , display and eat their healthy snacks in school with zest .
Well , Mobi has already created this product !
They make a great array of appealing sandwich bags , pre-printed with various designs that can even give cut - up celery sticks a zap of show - off cool factor .
Mobi's bags would be perfect for influencing kids to see healthy snacks as the ' cool thing ' .
As an added bonus , these bags are environmentally friendly .
The materials used to make them are recycled and recyclable .
Furthermore in 2008 the company plans to use strictly biodegradable films in their products .
In addition to the environment , they are also passionate about helping endangered species and global aid .

About You Can Get Arrested for That
Two Englishmen on a crime spree break American laws !
Stupid , unreasonable , and long - forgotten laws — but laws just the same .
In 1787 the wise framers of the U.S. Constitution laid out the laws of the land .
Since then , things have gone awry , and a few laws even the far - sighted framers could n’t have imagined have worked their way onto the books in towns and cities across the country .
Did you know that in the United States it ’s illegal to :
• Fish while wearing pajamas in Chicago , Illinois ?
• Enter a theater within three hours of eating garlic in Indianapolis ?
• Offer cigarettes or whiskey to zoo animals in New Jersey ?
• Fall asleep in a cheese factory in South Dakota ?
Englishman Rich Smith discovered these little - known laws during a great American crime spree that took him from coast to coast in search of girls to kiss ( it ’s illegal to kiss for longer than five minutes at a time in Kansas ) , oranges to peel ( which the law says should n’t be done in hotel rooms in California ) , and whales to hunt ( unlawful in Utah ) .
What inspired a perfectly law abiding , mild - mannered Englishman to come to America and take on the law ?
He simply wanted to know why .
How did these “ only in America ” laws come to be , do the police know they exist , and would they care if he broke them ?
So with his best mate , Bateman , by his side — and at the ready should bail be required — Smith set out to break the law in the United States .
Part road trip , part chronicle of the absurdity of human behavior , part search for the ultimate in roadkill , You Can Get Arrested for That follows Smith and Bateman on their not quite Bonnie and Clyde adventure .
GLETSCH , Switzerland —
To hear the locals tell it , you would think they were referring to a loved family member declining in old age .
“ It hurts , it hurts , ” Philipp Carlen said of his feeling toward the vast Rhone glacier , which once came to the edge of his hotel , but now has receded several hundred yards .
The glacier , whose soft contours and dirty gray surface make it resemble some huge sea creature , a whale perhaps , is rapidly shrinking , in the mild autumn weather , by 12 to 15 feet a day .
Eight thousand years ago , Mr. Carlen said , the glacier was the largest in Europe , with arms that reached all the way to Lyon , in France .
Indeed , it remains the source of the Rhone River , which flows westward into France and from there into the Mediterranean .
Now , however , it is only the fifth largest glacier in Switzerland , and experts foresee the day , probably in this century , when the glacier , all six miles of it , will melt away to nothing .
The shrinkage has consequences for the little village that owes its name — Gletsch means glacier in Swiss German — and its very existence to the icy behemoth .
There are a few things in this world that thieves need to keep in mind in order to run a successful criminal operation .
For example , do n't take the cash you just stole from one bank to another bank down the street to have it deposited into your account .
Do n't steal someone 's MacBook and take it to the Apple Store Genius Bar the next day to get help with OS X .
And finally , do n't steal a drivers ' license printer from the DMV , only to call up the manufacturer the next day looking for drivers .
That 's one tip that 33 - year - old Missouri resident Timothy Scott Short apparently was n't aware of when he stole some equipment from the Missouri Department of Revenue earlier this month , only to find himself facing jail time after outing himself to tech support .
Short stole the Digimarc printer , along with a PC containing names and birthdates , from the Department of Revenue 's contract office in St. Charles .
Unfortunately for Short , the PC was locked , and he was unable to access anything on it , department director Trish Vincent told IDG .
But without the software installed on the PC , the printer was essentially useless .
Think of the millions of fake IDs that could be created on that thing !
Short apparently could n't stop thinking about it , as he broke down and called Digimarc for support — twice — a couple of days later asking whether he would be able to obtain printer drivers .
Secret Service Special Agent John Bush told IDG that he recognized Short 's voice on the recording from another , unrelated investigation and that the phone number that Short had provided matched up to another identity theft case .
Here 's another tip for thieves : do n't use your regular phone number for all of your crimes .
Get a business line or something .
Short was then tracked down a few days later and charged with possession of document - making implements with the intent to use them for fraud .
He now faces a $ 250,000 fine and up to 10 years in prison .
' I wrote this testimony myself , ' Petraeus swears before Congress Nick Juliano
Published : Monday September 10 , 2007
Print This Email This General says success in Iraq ' will be neither quick , nor easy '
In his testimony before Congress Monday , Gen. David Petraeus was quick to counter suggestions that his assessment was little more than a recetation of White House talking points .
" I wrote this testimony myself , " Petraeus assured the assembled lawmakers and observers , as well as viewers of all three cable news networks , which carried the hearings live .
Critics had seized on reports that Petraeus 's progress report was actually being written by the White House to undercut his testimony , and some have accused the administration of " cherry picking " intelligence assessments designed to show progress in Iraq .
The top US commander in Iraq asked lawmakers to give the military more time in Iraq , citing military gains in some areas , but acknowledging that political reconciliation has been slow to materialize .
Although Petraeus argued that US goals could be achieved in Iraq over time , doing so " will be neither quick nor easy , " he told a joint hearing of the House Armed Services and Foreign Affairs committees Monday .
Ambassador Ryan Crocker , the top US diplomat in Iraq , echoed the tough - but - achievable sentiment towards progress in Iraq .
" This process will not be quick , " Crocker said .
" It will be uneven , punctuated by setbacks as well as achievements . "
Both officials called for a continuation of President Bush 's buildup of US troops in Iraq , which began earlier this year , and they argued that an early withdrawal of US troops would make matters worse .
Petraeus said a one Marine unit of about 2,000 troops would come home beginning later this month , followed by another Army brigade in December .
But he said the US military presence would not fall to its pre-surge levels until mid-July of next year .
He did not address reports that the US military is too stretched to maintain the surge much beyond next spring .
Although he did not mean for his assessment to be " disheartening , " Crocker warned that measuring progress and assigning a date for complete withdrawal will be nearly impossible .
" There will be no single moment at which we can claim victory , " he said .
" Any turning point will only be recognized in retrospect . "
Later , Crocker said he " cannot guarantee success in Iraq , " but he believed " it is attainable . "
He warned that a premature drawdown of troops " will bring failure . "
" Undoubtedly Iran would be a winner in this scenario , " Crocker said .
Petraeus also echoed the harsh rhetoric against Iran , accusing it several times of funneling weapons and other support to Shiite militias in Iraq .
( Some have speculated that attempts to link Iran to Iraq is paving the way for a US invasion of that country as well . )
Petraeus cited some decreases in violence , and cooperation among former insurgents and US troops in Anbar Province as evidence that the surge is working , but some independent assessments have called such findings into question .

In a lawsuit that harks back to the Enron scandal , the Bush administration is at odds with the federal agency that oversees securities markets as well as with state attorneys general and consumer and investor advocates .
President Bush personally weighed in with his views before the administration decided not to support investors whose securities fraud case is now before the Supreme Court .
The president 's message was that it 's important to reduce '' unnecessary lawsuits ' ' and that federal securities regulators are in the best position to sue , said Al Hubbard , Bush 's chief economic adviser and director of the National Economic Council . [.. ]
UPDATE : Barney Frank ( Chairman of House Financial Services Committee ) Critical of Bush 's Involvement in Suits
Bush 's role in the case underscores its significance .
The outcome of the Supreme Court case could determine whether investors can pursue lawsuits to recover investment losses if they can prove collusion between Wall Street institutions and scandal - ridden companies .[.. ]
'' The president believes that it 's important to make certain that we reduce the unnecessary lawsuits because that 's a very big burden to the economy , which adversely impacts investors , '' Hubbard added .
'' There was a difference of opinion within the administration , but ultimately the president makes up his own mind , '' said Hubbard .
He said the Federal Reserve and the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency sent letters supporting '' the policy position that the president believes in . ''
The Securities and Exchange Commission voted 3 - 2 to ask the solicitor general to support shareholders in the pending court case .
MyDD : The Enron Case : Bush 's Criminal Conspiracy
New Haven , Conn .
-- A study by researchers at the Yale Stem Cell Center for the first time demonstrates that piRNAs , a recently discovered class of tiny RNAs , play an important role in controlling gene function , it was reported this week in Nature .
Haifan Lin , director of the stem cell center and professor of cell biology at Yale School of Medicine , heads the laboratory that originally identified piRNAs .
Derived mostly from so - called " junk DNA , " piRNAs had escaped the attention of generations of geneticists and molecular biologists until last year when Lin 's team discovered them in mammalian reproductive cells , and named them .
The lab 's current work suggests that piRNAs have crucial functions in controlling stem cell fate and other processes of tissue development .
In this study Lin and his Ph.D. student , Hang Yin , discovered more than 13,000 Piwi- associated piRNAs in fruit flies .
One particular piRNA , they found , forms a complex with the protein known as Piwi , which then binds to chromatin , a strategic region in the genome that regulates the activity of the gene .
Chromatin's role is to package DNA so that it will fit into the cell , to strengthen the DNA to allow cell division , and to serve as a mechanism to control gene expression .
" This is important in maintaining self - renewal of stem cells , " Lin said .
" These small RNAs might provide new tools to harness the behavior of stem cells and other biological processes related to diseases . "
" This finding revealed a surprisingly important role for piRNAs , as well as junk DNA , in stem cell division , " Lin said .
" It calls upon biologists to look for answers beyond the one percent of the genome with protein coding capacity to the vast land of junk DNA , which constitutes 99 percent of the genome . "

Credit Card Gas Limits
Here ’s an interesting phenomenon : rising gas costs have pushed up a lot of legitimate transactions to the “ anti- fraud ” ceiling .
Security is a trade - off , and now the ceiling is annoying more and more legitimate gas purchasers .
But to me the real question is : does this ceiling have any actual security purpose ?
In general , credit card fraudsters like making gas purchases because the system is automated : no signature is required , and there ’s no need to interact with any other person .
In fact , buying gas is the most common way a fraudster tests that a recently stolen card is valid .
The anti-fraud ceiling does n’t actually prevent any of this , but limits the amount of money at risk .
But so what ?
How many perps are actually trying to get more gas than is permitted ?
Are credit - card - stealing miscreants also swiping cars with enormous gas tanks , or merely filling up the passenger cars they regularly drive ?
I ’d love to know how many times , prior to the run-up in gas prices , a triggered cutoff actually coincided with a subsequent report of a stolen card .
And what ’s the effect of a ceiling , apart from a gas shut - off ?
Surely the smart criminals know about smurfing , if they need more gas than the ceiling will allow .
The Visa spokesperson said , “ We get more calls , questions , when gas prices increase . ”
He / she did n’t say : “ We make more calls to see if fraud is occurring . ”
So the only inquiries made may be in the cases where fraud is n’t occurring .

Their point is to criticize the poorly thought out deregulation in various US States over the past 15 years , and they explain clearly how energy markets work ( something which is rare enough in the mainstream media ) , and what the consequences of various bits of deregulation are on market behavior and thus on electricity prices .
In an Op - Ed that was published in the Wall Street Journal last month ( and is available in full to non-subscribers on CATO 's website ) two CATO economists specialised in deregulation and energy markets provide a breath of fresh air in the debates on energy .
As a first point , they take the time to explain one of the most basic consequences of electricity deregulation : marginal pricing :
Under the old regulatory regime , electricity generators received their costs plus an allowed return on capital .
If generators ' costs differed , they received differing revenues .
Prices were then established by a " weighted average " of all producer costs .
Under deregulation , however , generators receive revenues based on the price charged by the most expensive generator whose output is necessary to meet demand in each hour .
While some may find such pricing to be odd , it is found in all commodity markets .
Potatoes , for example , sell at the same price even though the cost of production varies across farmers .
The supermarket does not price potatoes based on the " weighted average " of their acquisition costs , and producers do not sell at cost plus a modest mark - up .
They sell at what the market will bear , and the market will bear the highest cost source of potatoes necessary to meet consumer demand .
Thus , in a regulatory regime , rising natural gas prices affect electricity prices only according to the percentage of electricity generated by natural gas ( about 18.7 % of supply nationwide in 2005 ) .
But in deregulated markets , all generators get revenues based on the price charged by the most expensive ( often natural gas ) plant in operation .
Does this mean that consumers are always worse off under market ( marginal - cost ) prices rather than regulated ( weighted average ) prices ?
Well , regulation certainly delivers lower prices than the market during shortages .
But regulation delivers higher prices during times of relative abundance .
Their description is absolutely correct , and so is their conclusion , which is a fundamental insight about deregulation and abundance .
They also provide the logic behind deregulation : in the 90s , natural gas was very cheap and abundant , and thus spot prices ( a proxy for marginal price in a mostly regulated market ) were lower than prices charged by the traditional generators .
Massive investment in what were then highly competitite gas - fired plants led to a huge increase in gas - fired power generation capacity , and in low market prices , thus in a push for users to get access to those cheaper prices .
Deregulation took place , as Van Doren and Taylor point out , but in an imperfect manner , as end - user ( retail ) prices were kept regulated - and high .
The goal then was to protect the old style generators , which had relatively high production costs and not the consumers .
The gas - power plant investors were happy , because , with their low marginal costs , they benefitted from such regulated tariffs even more thna the " old style " utilities .
This led to the " gas bubble " - massive investment in gas - fired plants :
It 's hard to say if there is a direct link between that boom and the subsequent increase in gas prices , but increase they did :
Which means that suddenly the situation was reversed : marginal costs went through the roof , and regulated prices were suddenly insufficient to cover the production costs of the gas - based generators .
This ( together with market rigging by some players ) caused the California crisis and the belated realisation that deregulated markets did not push prices only down - something that Van Doren and Taylor note explicitly : " free market reformers promised rate reductions they had no business promising . "
Their conclusion is worth flagging again :
regulation certainly delivers lower prices than the market during shortages .
But regulation delivers higher prices during times of relative abundance .
The two authors are consistent , at least , and their logic is to say that high prices lead to high profits for some actors and thus eventually to entry of new players to balance the market back , in a classic boom - and - bust scenario .
They consider that the temporary price spikes in that regime are acceptable to consumers in that they get lower prices on average .
While this certainly neglects the political price to be paid for headlines blasting electricity prices occasionally 10 or 100 times higher than usual , it also forgets to underline what these price peaks are about : they are necessary , at times when supply is insufficient , to cause demand destruction , i.e. people giving up using electricity because they can no longer afford it , even for a short while .
Electricity being the vital good that we know , this explains why the peaks are so high , but it also means that markets balance because some - mostly poor - people " choose " to give up electricity for a while because they wo n't pay that price and cannot afford it .
Balance is created by denial of service to some , via prices .
Thus the authors are certainly libertarian , in accepting that electricity be allocated , at times of insufficient supply , in accordance with ability or willingness to pay rather than any other criteria , such as social or medical needs ( oh sure , they 'll usually accept that special cases can be made to protect the most vulnerable people - the old , the sick , etc ... but wo n't acknowledge that their preferred method of allocation specifically targets these , in practice ) .
And , of course , their underlying assumption is that we 'll always come back eventually to periods of abundance .
There is no physical or practical limit to the boom - and - bust cycle .
Resources will be mobilized because it 's profitable to do so , and will be used up to the level that balances the market .
Depletion does not exist in their world - it has no price , anyway .
But if you 're trying to find ways to organise your power sector for the next 30 years , and are told that one mechanism delivers lower prices in times of abundance ( of generation capacity , thus of coal and gas ) , and another lower prices in times of more constrained supply ( by , say , depletion , or worries about carbon emissions , or worries about security of supply of the fuels used ) , whatshould be your preference ?
That question is implicitly asked in that article .
They also implicitly answer it by ignoring such risks .
I obviously take a different view .
: : ::
But that gets us to a second , even more interesting point made by the two authors .
That deregulation was further hampered , in the US , by the regulators ' bizarre passion for unbundling :
In sum , allowing markets to dictate electricity prices is a good thing for consumers , even if they are sometimes higher than under regulation .
Unfortunately — and here is the fly in the ointment — price deregulation has been accompanied by rules encouraging the legal separation of generation from transmission and the purchase of wholesale power through organized spot markets .
This was published a few days before the EU Commission made its big announcements about the necessity of unbundling , and how it was the real step that would deliver more competitive energy markets in Europe , and here we had CATO , hard core libertarians , writing black and white that it's a stupid idea that is actually detrimental to deregulation !
And they provide several ( of course valid ) arguments :
First , vertical integration is an efficient response to the so - called " holdup " problem .
Investors in generating plants worry that , because the assets are costly , dedicated and immobile , they can be " held up " by transmission line owners .
Investors in transmission lines fear being held up by generators .
Vertical integration ends the fight .
Second , transmission and generation are substitutes for one another — and the right amount of investment in either is an economic , not an engineering , puzzle .
Efficient investment in both may not be possible through decentralized arrangements ( prices and contracts ) between separately owned assets .
In contrast , an organization that owns both generation and transmission assets is more likely to invest optimally in both .
Third and finally , vertical integration minimizes risk in the real - time operation of the system .
The better coordinated are generation and transmission , the less chance there is of cascading blackouts and other problems .
Coordination is far easier when there is one actor rather than hundreds .
These considerations largely explain why 10 of the 11 published studies on this issue conclude that vertical integration is the most efficient corporate organizational form for electricity providers .
Unfortunately , the debate about utility restructuring has almost completely ignored those studies — assuming rather that vertical integration serves no useful purpose other than facilitating the market power of incumbent electricity providers .
Coordination , coherence of investment in complementary sub-sectors of the industry , security of operation - vertical integration has a lot of real world advantages that are being forgotten - or seen as " unfair " competitive advantage for the industrial giants of the sector that have so far managed all aspects of the electricity infrastructure .
And the CATO economists drive their criticism further :
Interestingly enough , the deregulators are trying to create a world that would probably never arise in a totally free electricity market .
In a world of deregulated vertically integrated firms , both producers and consumers would almost certainly resist spot market relationships .
During gluts , firms would not recover the cost of capital ; and during shortages , electricity consumers would be vulnerable to economic extortion , as competitive entry and rivalry can't happen overnight .
Both firms and consumers would likely prefer long - term contracts , an arrangement that meets consumers ' interest in price protection and firms ' interest in cost recovery .
Accordingly , the equilibrium relationship between firms and consumers in a totally unregulated world might resemble that of the old regulatory regime , albeit an equilibrium achieved through contract .
The only ( unanswerable ) question is how different the specifics of such hypothetical contracts would be from current regulatory practices .
As most participants in the industry know , most players , producers and consumers , small and large , crave stability and consistency .
The industry is complex enough to manage as it is without having to worry on a constant basis about access to the grid , or access to fuels , or availability of the end product - thus long term contracts are the rule .
End consumers want the certainty that they will have power when they turn the switch , and understandable ( i.e. simple ) prices .
Producers want to be sure that prices over the long term will be sufficient to cover the investments they have to make upfront .
They also want to ensure that they are able to respond to demand variations in a effective way , with the requisite technical coordination between producers and network managers on an ongoing and trustful basis .
Which means , as the CATO writers conclude , that in a really , really free market , players would end up with something that would look amazingly similar to a fully regulated market , based on long term contracts and smoothed out price formulas .
So why bother with deregulation ?
To be sure that the choice they make is actually that one ?
As they point out , deregulation has been botched , incoherent and / or inconsistent every single time it has been tried , for various reasons .
The time spent to get to a perfect " free market " has actual costs in real life , and it is worth asking if they are worth paying .
Re-regulate .
Even CATO points that way .
Want to create an FM radio station for your town ?
It 's easier than you think
The FCC has made it pretty much impossible for the average person ( or even a group of people ) to start and run a community focused radio station that reflects the local listeners interests .
Thanks to the National Association of Broadcasters , a few well paid senators and big radio corporations like Clear Channel , there just is n't room on the dial ( or so they 'd like you to believe ) .
The reality is Low Power FM could easily fit into the existing spectrum available on the FM dial .
The folks above have made sure you can't do this though .
They 've created rules based on false information that make it impossible to get a license .
Hell with that .
Set up your own pirate radio station and go on the air .
It 's easier than you might think .
What you need :
A Studio Transmitter Link Setup ( this is placed in someone 's back yard with the antenna mounted in a tree or on the roof ) .
Gear : Total cost for new equipment : $ 5000 ( max ) .
- And FM transmitter .
Best ones cost about $ 3000 and are from Broadcast Warehouse out of England .
The TX100 is a perfect box .
- A Comet 5/8ths wave antenna .
They 're easy to tune to your the frequency you want on the dial .
They cost about $ 100 - 150 and you can get one from Progressive Concepts ( www.progressiveconcepts.com).
You can get your transmitter there as well .
- 100 feet of 50 ohm cable .
Get it when you buy the antenna .
- A cheap laptop .
An old one with a wimpy processor works fine .
Intalled RealVNC software on it ( allows you to control the computer remotely ) .
- An outdoor plastic case ( to put all this gear into ) .
Get it at Home Depot for $ 50 .
- A small mixer ( Behringer makes a great one for $ 50 ) .
- And internet connection .
All of this gear is plugged together into a working FM radio station .
Once in place you put a big piece of duct tape over it that says " Ham Radio Repeater " .
Your Studio :
- Another computer with a library of music and an internet connection
- Another Behringer mixer .
- A decent microphone .
You can get one at Best Buy for $ 30 .
- An account on Live365 .
What you 're going to do is set up a studio that feeds an internet stream of your show to Live365 .
You 're then going to log into that stream from the cheap laptop sitting in the box , which is plugged into the transmitter which is plugged into the antenna .
You get power from the house and you get internet from either a cable running from the houses internet or , better , from a wifi connection between the house and your cheap laptop .
By separating the Pirate DJ from the transmitter , and giving the house where you 've got the transmitter plausible deniability , you can play a cat and mouse game with the FCC for years .
When ( not if ) the FCC shows up , your remote transmitter setup is going to be inspected by the field agents .
The person hosting that site simply says : " I thought it was some ham radio thing .
I met a guy at a party that asked if they could put it in our back yard because we had a good location and they 'd pay our internet bill for us .
We had no idea it was an FM transmitter " .
The FCC may buy it , they may not , either way they have to do the same thing :
Ask your host to turn it off ( which they do immediately ) and then if they can have the setup ( the answer is : " No , it 's not mine " ) .
The FCC will have what they want :
It 's off .
So they leave .
They may leave a Notice of Apparent Liability .
This is a letter that says ' show us your license to run this or turn it off in 10 days ' .
No license , but it 's off .
They win .
They leave .
Your host then calls you .
You come 4 or 5 hours later ( giving the FCC time to clear out of the area ) and you set it up at your next host location ( which you 've hopefully already set up ) .
Downtime is usually 24 hours or less .
Your hosts are ( usually ) also your DJ's .
Or , they 're friends and fans of the station .
Some basic rules :
Never use real names .
Everyone has a handle .
Everyone uses it .
No one knows each others real names .
This is easier than you think and fun at parties ( yell across the room " hey Beerguy ..
I saw JuiceBag yesterday " can be very enteraining to the other guests ) .
Keep your studio and transmitter separate .
No one under 18 , no drugs and no guns in the studio .
Ever .

Jeffrey Speiser , a lawyer for Mr. Nacchio , declined to comment yesterday .
As part of his defense , Mr. Nacchio claimed that he had knowledge of top secret contracts with the N.S.A. and other government agencies that made the company ’s financial prospects brighter than was publicly known .
Prosecutors denied the claims .
At the time of the claimed meeting at the N.S.A. ’s Fort Meade , Md. , headquarters on Feb. 27 , 2001 , Mr. Nacchio was chairman of the National Security Telecommunications Advisory Committee , whose members included top executives of most of the major communications companies .
Like nearly every chief executive in the industry , he had been granted a security clearance to work with the government on secret projects .
In the court papers , Mr. Nacchio ’s lawyers said he and James F. X. Payne , then Qwest ’s head of government business , spoke with N.S.A. officials about the agency ’s Groundbreaker project , in which the agency ’s non-secret information technology would be contracted to private companies .
At the same meeting , N.S.A. officials made an additional proposal , whose exact nature is not made clear in the censored documents .
“ The court has prohibited Mr. Nacchio from eliciting testimony regarding what also occurred at that meeting , ” one of the documents states .
Another passage says : “ The court has also refused to allow Mr. Nacchio to demonstrate that the agency retaliated for this refusal by denying the Groundbreaker and perhaps other work to Qwest . ”
Another document , a transcript of an interview that the F.B.I. conducted with Mr. Payne in 2006 , stated that the N.S.A. pressed its request for months afterward .
“ Nacchio said it was a legal issue and that they could not do something their general counsel told them not to do , ” Mr. Payne told the F.B.I .
“ Nacchio projected that he might do it if they could find a way to do it legally . ”
Mr. Payne declined to comment .
In support of Mr. Nacchio ’s accusations , his lawyers quoted from one of several lawsuits filed against telecommunications companies , accusing them of violating their customers ’ privacy .
That lawsuit , filed last year against several companies , asserts that seven months before the Sept. 11 attacks , at about the time of Mr. Nacchio ’s meeting at the N.S.A. , another phone company , AT&T , “ began development of a center for monitoring long distance calls and Internet transmissions and other digital information for the exclusive use of the N.S.A . ”
The lawsuit contends that the center would “ give the N.S.A. direct , unlimited , unrestricted and unfettered access ” to phone call information and Internet traffic on AT&T ’s network .
Sprawling suburban parking spaces outnumber drivers by three to one in a Midwestern county , a finding that typifies a troubling trend nationwide that increases urban heating and pollution , researchers say .
Digitalized aerial surveys taken in 2005 were used to calculate the total area devoted to parking lots in Indiana 's Tippecanoe County and revealed the paved lots covered an area larger than 1,000 football fields and that there were three times as many parking spaces as drivers who lived in the county , said study leader Bryan Pijanowski of Purdue University .
Pijanowski said that his study was relevant across the country because generally Americans are paving an increasing amount of land each year on which to park when they go to the store , work , school or other places .
The results of the Tippecanoe study — 355,000 parking spaces in a county that is home to 155,000 residents — are cause for concern because parking lots are a major source of water pollution , contributing 1,000 pounds of heavy metals into water runoff every year , he said .
" The problem with parking lots is that they accumulate a lot of pollutants — oil , grease , heavy metals and sediment — that cannot be absorbed by the impervious surface , " said study member Bernard Engel .
" Rain then flushes these contaminants into rivers and lakes . "
The research findings were presented at a recent conference of land - use experts in the Netherlands .
Because parking lots also prevent the rain from soaking into the ground , they can worsen local flooding and erosion , Pijanowski said .
The paved surfaces also add to the urban heat island effect , which can raise temperatures by 2 to 3 degrees Celsius by absorbing more of the sun 's rays than the surrounding ground , said Indiana state climatologist Dev Niyogi , a colleague of Pijanowski at Purdue who did not work directly on this study .
The parking lot count focused on lots at businesses , Purdue University and other public properties .
Lots on private property and multi - level parking garages were not counted , so Pijanowski says his parking space calculation is a significant underestimate .
To back away from the American trend of " paving paradise to put up a parking lot , " to paraphrase songwriter Joni Mitchell , mega - churches and businesses such as " big box " retailers could build shared lots , Pijanowski suggests , which would help conserve land and stave off some of the parking lots ' negative effects .
While destroying a field of opium poppies in Uruzgan Province , members of the Afghan Eradication Force came under fire in an ambush apparently orchestrated by the Taliban .
Photograph by Aaron Huey .
ATLAS PRESS
In the main square in Tirin Kot , the capital of Uruzgan Province , in central Afghanistan , a large billboard shows a human skeleton being hanged .
The rope is not a normal gallows rope but the stem of an opium poppy .
Aside from this jarring image , Tirin Kot is a bucolic - seeming place , a market town of flat - topped adobe houses and little shops on a low bluff on the eastern shore of the Tirinrud River , in a long valley bounded by open desert and jagged , treeless mountains .
About ten thousand people live in the town .
The men are bearded and wear traditional robes and tunics and cover their heads with turbans or sequinned skullcaps .
There are virtually no women in sight , and when they do appear they wear all - concealing burkas .
A few paved streets join at a traffic circle in the center of town , but within a few blocks they peter out to dirt tracks .
Almost everything around Tirin Kot is some shade of brown .
The river is a khaki - colored wash of silt and snowmelt that flows out of the mountain range to the north , past mud-walled family compounds .
On either side of the river , however , running down the valley , there is a narrow strip of wheat fields and poppy fields , and for several weeks in the spring the poppies bloom : lovely , open - petalled white , pink , red , and magenta blossoms , the darker colors indicating the ones with the most opium .
One afternoon this spring , at the height of the harvest , I drove through the area with Douglas Wankel , a former Drug Enforcement Administration official who was hired by the United States government in 2003 to organize its counter - narcotics effort here .
Wankel , who is sixty - one and has piercing blue eyes , was stationed in Kabul as a young D.E.A. official in 1978 and 1979 , during the bloody unrest that led up to the Soviet invasion .
“ I left on a flight to New Delhi a couple of hours before the Soviets rolled in , ” he said .
“ People thought it was because I knew it was coming .
I did n’t ; I just happened to be leaving on a trip .
But the Soviets branded me a C.I.A. agent , and so I could n’t come back — until now , that is . ”
Working first with the D.E.A. and then with the State Department , Wankel helped create the Afghan Eradication Force , with troops of the Afghan National Police drawn from the Ministry of the Interior .
Last year , an estimated four hundred thousand acres of opium poppies were planted in Afghanistan , a fifty - nine - per- cent increase over the previous year .
Afghanistan now supplies more than ninety - two per cent of the world ’s opium , the raw ingredient of heroin .
More than half the country ’s annual G.D.P. , some $ 3.1 billion , is believed to come from the drug trade , and narcotics officials believe that part of the money is funding the Taliban insurgency .
Wankel was in Uruzgan to oversee a poppy - eradication campaign — the first major effort to disrupt the harvest in the province .
He had brought with him a two - hundred - and - fifty - man A.E.F .
contingent , including forty - odd contractors supplied by DynCorp , a Virginia - based private military company , which has a number of large U.S. government contracts in Iraq , Afghanistan , and other parts of the world .
In Colombia , DynCorp helps implement the multibillion - dollar Plan Colombia , to eradicate coca .
The A.E.F.’s armed convoy had taken three days to drive from Kabul , and had set up a base on a plateau above a deep wadi .
With open land all around , it was a good spot to ward off attacks .
Much of Uruzgan is classified by the United Nations as “ Extreme Risk / Hostile Environment . ”
The Taliban effectively controls four - fifths of the province , which , like the movement , is primarily Pashtun .
Mullah Omar , the fugitive Taliban leader , was born and raised here , as were three other founders of the movement .
The Taliban ’s seizure of Tirin Kot , in the mid-nineties , was a key stepping stone in their march to Kabul , and their loss of the town in 2001 was a decisive moment in their fall .
The Taliban have made a concerted comeback in the past two years ; they are the de-facto authority in much of the Pashtun south and east , and have recently spread their violence to parts of the north as well .
The debilitating and corrupting effects of the opium trade on the government of President Hamid Karzai is a significant factor in the Taliban ’s revival .
The Taliban instituted a strict Islamist policy against the opium trade during the final years of their regime , and by the time of their overthrow they had virtually eliminated it .
But now , Lieutenant General Mohammad Daud - Daud , Afghanistan ’s deputy minister of the interior for counter - narcotics , told me , “ there has been a coalition between the Taliban and the opium smugglers .
This year , they have set up a commission to tax the harvest . ”
In return , he said , the Taliban had offered opium farmers protection from the government ’s eradication efforts .
The switch in strategy has an obvious logic : it provides opium money for the Taliban to sustain itself and helps it to win over the farming communities .
Wankel had flown in from Kabul five days earlier to meet with the governor of Uruzgan , Abdul Hakim Munib , about the eradication operation , only to discover that Munib had left for Kabul the day before .
Wankel was told that a sister of the governor had died or fallen ill — there were several versions — but nobody believed this was the real reason for his absence .
Munib , a former Taliban deputy minister , was suspected of retaining ties to the movement .
And , Wankel noted , there were poppy fields within sight of Munib ’s palace .
“ We ’re not able to destroy all the poppy — that ’s not the point .
What we ’re trying to do is lend an element of threat and risk to the farmers ’ calculations , so they wo n’t plant next year , ” Wankel said later .
“ It ’s like robbing a bank .
If people see there ’s more to be had by robbing a bank than by working in one , they ’re going to rob it , until they learn there ’s a price to pay . ”
We came to a wide bend in the river , a stretch of good , flat growing land with broad poppy fields .
The fields were neat and well tended , and the swollen bulbs beneath the blossoms on their long green stalks were dripping with dark - brown opium .
A heady , acrid odor like stale urine hung in the air .
Small groups of men and boys were in the fields , scoring the bulbs to bleed the opium .
They stopped and stared at us when we drove past , and then continued their work .
Before Doug Wankel could do anything in Uruzgan , he had to talk to the Dutch .
In a bewilderingly complicated arrangement , NATO member states have been put in charge of military operations in different Afghan provinces — the British in Helmand , for instance , and the Canadians in Kandahar .
Since August , 2006 , the Dutch have been in Uruzgan .
A seventeen - hundred - member Dutch force occupies a sprawling walled base southwest of Tirin Kot .
Smaller bases within the walls house contingents of Australians , U.S. Special Forces , and the Afghan Army .
Military aircraft land at and take off from an airstrip there at all hours .
There are small firebases elsewhere in the province , but troops at the main base rarely venture far from Tirin Kot .

Reading is not as simple as scientists once thought
Previously , researchers thought that , when reading , both eyes focused on the same letter of a word .
But a UK team has found this is not always the case .
In fact , almost 50 % of the time , each of our eyes locks on to different letters simultaneously .
At the BA Festival of Science in York , the researchers also revealed that our brain can fuse two separate images to obtain a clear view of a page .
Sophisticated eye - tracking equipment allowed the team to pinpoint which letter a volunteer 's eyes focused on , when reading 14 - point font from one metre away .
Rather than the eyes moving smoothly over text , they make small jerky movements , focusing on a particular word for an instant and then moving along the sentence .
Periods when the eyes are still are called fixations .
Crossed eyes
Professor Simon Liversedge , from the University of Southampton , said : " We found that in a very substantial number of fixations that people make when they read , they are n't looking at the same letter . "
Instead , the eyes often focussed on different letters in the same word , about two characters apart , he said .
" They could be uncrossed , in the sense that the two lines of sight are not crossed when you look at a word , or alternatively the two lines of sight may be crossed , " he added .
The team 's results demonstrated that both eyes lock on to the same letter 53 % of the time ; for 39 % of the time they see different letters with uncrossed eyes ; and for 8 % of the time the eyes are crossing to focus on different letters .
A follow - up experiment with the eye - tracking equipment showed that we only see one clear image when reading because our brain fuses the different images from our eyes together .
The tests showed that we use the information from both eyes , rather than our brain suppressing one image and only processing the other .
Professor Liversedge said : " A comprehensive understanding of the psychological processes underlying reading is vital if we are to develop better methods of teaching children to read and offer remedial treatments for those with reading disorders such as dyslexia . "

Here are my top 11 tips and tricks for getting things done faster with the Visual Studio 2005 IDE ( without using third - party add - ins or upgrading hardware … that ’s another article ) .
Yes , some of these tips and tricks may fall into the " obvious " category , but I think they are worth repeating .
I continue to see too many .NET developers not taking advantage of even the basic time - saving techniques .
I work mostly with C# so some of these tips may not apply to , or work differently with other Visual Studio languages such as Visual Basic .
NET .
(1) Express Yourself with Regular Expressions
Regular Expressions is a powerful and portable text search / replace / transformation language .
Learning basic Regular Expressions will immediately make you a more productive developer / power user .
Regular Expressions is supported in Visual Studio ’s various Search / Replace dialogs .
Any Regular Expressions skill you learn will also be useful in numerous other applications and settings : other text editors , unix shell / egrep , PowerShell , input validation , and Google search ( heh , just kidding on that last item ) .
You can also use Regular Expressions with macros and automation via the Regex class .
Here ’s an example of how you can save time with Regular Expressions in Visual Studio .
Say , you just wrote and tested a SQL in a Query Tool and you want to turn it into a string variable in your C# class ?
Here ’s how :
First , paste the SQL text into the editor .
Make sure to remove any unwanted indentation on the left side of the text ( SHIFT - Tab ) :
Then hit CTRL+H to bring up the Find and Replace Dialog and fill it out like this :
Note : For VB.NET , in the “ Find and Replace Dialog Window ” , change the value in
“ Replace With ” box : from { [ + “ \1 ″ ] }… to { [ & “ \ 1 ″ _ ] } .
Thanks to berkx for this info .
Choose Replace All .
Fix a couple of lines , sit back and admire your beautiful work :
Explanation ?
Basically , the " Find what " expression above matches the content of each line and give it a numbered " tag " .
The " Replace with " expression then replaces each line with the first tagged value ( \1 ) , wrapped around in + " " .
Click the fly - out ( triangle ) button next to each box to display a cheat - sheet of frequently used expressions .
Oh , and do n’t worry about the " + " string concatenations in the example , the compiler knows to optimize that syntax .
Once you ’ve created a few Search / Replace expressions like the above , create macros out of them and assign to shortcuts .
Here are some of the Regex transformations I use most often when writing code :
Surrounds each line with ( example above ) .
Transform a list of values separated by newlines into a coma-delimited list ( used in array initializers or SQL where clause ) .
Put double quotes around each value in a coma-separated list .
Tools to help you write / test Regular Expressions :
(2) Take ( Keyboard ) Shortcuts
Using keyboard shortcuts is the best way to get things done faster in Visual Studio ( and most other computer applications for that matter ) .
Below are my favorite Visual Studio keyboard shortcuts ( I am leaving out the really obvious ones like F5 ) .
CTRL+ALT+L : View Solution Explorer .
I use Auto Hide for all of my tool windows to maximize screen real estate .
Whenever I need to open the Solution Explorer , it ’s just a shortcut away .

(3) Make New Shortcuts
There is something you do a lot in Visual Studio and there is no shortcut for it ?
Create one .
Here ’s how :
Choose Tools / Options and select Environment / Keyboard .
Type in something into " Show commands containing " to get a list of matching commands .
If there is already a shortcut for the selected command , it ’ll be displayed in " Shortcuts for selected command " .
To assign a new shortcut to the selected command , put the cursor in " Press shortcut keys " and press the shortcut key or key combinations desired .
Have a custom Macro that you run often ?
Assign it to a keyboard shortcut .
Here are some of my custom keyboard shortcuts :
CTRL + Num , T : Show the Test View .
: Show the Test View .
CTRL + Num , D : Start debugging the selected Unit Test in Test View .
: Start debugging the selected Unit Test in Test View .
CTRL +’ , L : " Collapse all in Solution Explorer " macro ( see Macros section below ) .
: " Collapse all in Solution Explorer " macro ( see Macros section below ) .
CTRL +’ , S : " Surrounds each line with " Macro .
: " Surrounds each line with " Macro. CTRL +’ , C : Compare with previous Source Control version .
(4) Use Code Snippets
Save time typing repetitive code by using Code Snippets .
There are two types of Snippets in Visual Studio 2005 : Expansion and SurroundsWith .
To use Expansion Snippets , type the Snippet shortcut ( not to be confused with keyboard shortcuts ) , and press Tab twice .
For example , the " for " Snippet is an Expansion Snippet .
To use it , type " for " …
Then press Tab , Tab :
I find SurroundsWith Snippets more useful though .
An example SurroundsWith Snippet is " #region " .
First , select a block of code :
Then , type CTRL+K , CTRL+S and " #re " :
Then hit Enter :
Here are my favorite Snippets :
#region : Regions is a great way to organize your code .
using :
If you create an IDisposable object , you should use the " using " pattern .
In addition to the basic " using " Snippet , I also created several variations for TransactionScope , and IDataReader .
try / catch
{}
/// < summary > $end $ </ summary >

(5) State Your Preferences
Find yourself constantly switching to the Design view every time you create / open an ASPX page ?
Cannot locate your current file in the Solution Explorer ?
Easy … just change the right settings and never think about it again .
Here are the some settings in Visual Studio that can save you time :
Open HTML pages in Source View : Tools / Options / HTML
Designer / Start pages in .
Track the current file in Solution Explorer : Tools / Options / Projects and Solutions / Track Active Item in Solution Explorer .
Change the Start page or get rid of it : Tools / Options / Environment / Startup .
Change the default font - size to a smaller size so you can see more code .
My editor font setting is ProFontWindows at size 9 .
Turn of animations : Uncheck Tools / Options / Environment / Animate environment tools .
(6) " Attach to Process " to Start Debugging ASP.NET
Most ASP.NET developers use the standard F5 ( Debug / Start Debugging ) to start debugging from Visual Studio .
However , there is a much faster way to start debugging if you already have an instance of your web application running .
Just attach to it instead :
Choose Debug / Attach to Process .
Select the " aspnet_wp.exe " process and choose Attach .
Or , for keyboarders :
ALT+D , P , " as " , Enter .
Debugging this way is faster because you skip the often - lengthy compilation step , and you do n’t have to navigate from the start page to the actual page that you want to debug .
(7) Stop Conditionally ( Conditional Breakpoints )
How often have you found yourself repeatedly stepping through a loop while debugging , waiting to get to a specific loop value ( because the bug only occurs with that specific value ) ?
With Conditional Breakpoints , you do n’t have to do that .
Just set a Breakpoint Condition .
Set the Breakpoint .
Right click on the Breakpoint indicator ( red circle ) , and choose Condition :
Set the condition ( any valid C# expression ) :
Another debugging productivity trick I use is to override ToString ( ) to return a useful summary of your objects .
The Debugger uses the value returned by ToString in various Debug windows such as Watch Window .
You can also use the DebuggerDisplay attribute .
(8) Employ Task List Tokens
Use Task List tokens such as TODO and HACK to quickly mark incomplete code or code that requires further attention .
This allows you to keep flowing and skip over the details , but at the same time ensures that you will not forget to go back and finish up .
A shortcoming with Visual Studio 2005 ’s Task List is that it only shows the items in the current file .
You can get around this by using the Find in Files feature and search for " // TODO " .
(9) Go Directly to Any File with the Find Combo Box
This is the Find dropdown that is on the Standard Toolbar , not the Find dialog .
Use the shortcut CTRL+D to activate the Find dropdown in normal mode .
Use CTRL +/ to activate the Find dropdown in command mode ( with " > " prepended … this does n’t work sometimes for me ) .
To quickly go to a file , type CTRL+D , > open < start of file name > .
Intellisense works here just like in the Command Window .
" of " ( short for " open file " ) can be used instead of open .
Compare this with opening Solution Explorer , expand the correct folder / project , and visually hunt for the file you need .
With the Find Combo , you can also execute commands , macros , find text , etc .

( 10 ) Type Ahead ( Incremental Search ) in Lists
Type - ahead search works in many Visual Studio lists such as Solution Explorer , Active Files Combo ( CTRL+ALT + Down Arrow ) , Add References , Class View , Attach to Process , Test View , etc .
To see how it works , it ’s best to try it yourself .
Open the Solution Explorer and start typing the first few letters of a visible file .
( 11 ) Automate with Macros and Visual Studio Automation
I save this for last because I think macros and Automation have the potential to give you the biggest productivity booster , but also require the most initial time investment .
For many developers , the most effective way to take advantage of macros is to find and use or customize someone else ’s macros .
If you want to get started with writing your own macros , the first feature you should get familiarize yourself with is the Macro Recording feature ( shortcut CTRL+SHIFT+R ) .

The Philosophy of Punctuation
by Paul Robinson , author of Opera , Sex , and Other Vital Matters
Punctuation absorbs more of my thought than seems healthy for a man who pretends to be well adjusted .
The subject is naturally attractive to all with character structures of the sort Freud dubbed anal , and I readily confess to belong to that sect .
We anal folk keep neat houses , are always on time , and know all the do's and do n't's , including those of punctuation .
Good punctuation , we feel , makes for clean thought .
A mania for punctuation is also an occupational hazard for almost any teacher , as hundreds of our hours are given over to correcting the vagrant punctuation of our students .
One approach to punctuation is by way of rules .
In my very favorite book , The Elements of Style , by William Strunk and E. B .
White , we may read , for example , Rule Number 2 : " In a series of three or more terms with a single conjunction , use a comma after each term except the last . "
I could n't agree more heartily , and I love the quaint formulation .
Better than that , I have inserted the missing comma in countless sentences written by students and colleagues of mine .
I have also suffered no little distress seeing that comma removed from my own prose after it has been sent to the New York Times Book Review or ( yes , I 'm sorry to say ) the New Republic , both of which clearly have adopted policies of eliminating this serial comma so beloved by purists .
Rules are important , no question about it .
But by themselves they are insufficient .
Unless one has an emotional investment , rules are too easily forgotten .
What we must instill , I 'm convinced , is an attitude toward punctuation , a set of feelings about both the process in general and the individual marks of punctuation .
That set of feelings might be called a philosophy of punctuation .
I say " a " philosophy , because I 'm not yet so opinionated as to insist that everyone adopt my own .
I recognize legitimate alternatives , and I 'm quite aware that punctuation has a history .
A single page of Thomas Carlyle , or any nineteenth - century writer , reminds us , for instance , that a comma between subject and verb - - for me the most offensive of all punctuation errors -- was once perfectly acceptable .
A colleague of mine , whom I consider a fine writer , punctuates , as it were , by ear .
That is , he seeks to reduplicate patterns of speech , to indicate through his punctuation how a sentence is supposed to sound .
Consequently his punctuation lacks strict consistency .
But I can respect it as guided at all times by what I consider philosophical principles .
Given my character , my own philosophy is more legalistic .
My colleague , you might say , is a Platonist in punctuation , while I am an Aristotelian .
My punctuation is informed by two ideals : clarity and simplicity .
Punctuation has the primary responsibility of contributing to the plainness of one 's meaning .
It has the secondary responsibility of being as invisible as possible , of not calling attention to itself .
With those principles in mind , and on the basis of reading what now passes for acceptable writing , I have developed a set of emotional responses to individual marks of punctuation .
Precisely such emotional responses , I believe , are what most writers lack , and their indifference accounts for their errors .
Let me now introduce my dramatis personae .
First come the period and the comma .
These are the only lovely marks of punctuation , and of the two the period is the lovelier , because more compact and innocent of ambiguity .
I have fantasies of writing an essay punctuated solely with periods and commas .
I seldom see a piece of prose that should n't , I feel , have more periods and fewer of those obtrusive marks that seem to have usurped its natural place .
The comma , as noted , was once overused , but it now suffers from relative neglect .
The missing comma before the " and " introducing the last item in a series is merely the most obvious example .
Periods and commas are lovely because they are simple .
They force the writer to express his ideas directly , to eliminate unnecessary hedges , to forgo smart - aleck asides .
They also contribute to the logical solidity of a piece of writing , since they make us put all our thoughts into words .
By way of contrast , a colon can be used to smooth over a rough logical connection .
It has a verbal content ranging anywhere from " namely " to " thus , " and it can function to let the writer off the hook .
Periods and commas , because of their very neutrality , make one an honest logician .
Semicolons are pretentious and overactive .
These days one seems to come across them in every other sentence .
" These days " is alarmist , since half a century ago the German poet Christian Morgenstern wrote a brilliant parody , " Im Reich der Interpunktionen , " in which imperialistic semicolons are put to rout by an " Antisemikolonbund " of periods and commas .
Nonetheless , if the undergraduate essays I see are representative , we are in the midst of an epidemic of semicolons .
I suspect that the semicolon is so popular because it is the first fancy punctuation mark students learn of , and they assume that its frequent appearance will lend their writing a properly scholarly cast .
Alas , they are only too right .
But I doubt that they use semicolons in their letters .
At least I hope they do n't .
More than half of the semicolons one sees , I would estimate , should be periods , and probably another quarter should be commas .
Far too often , semicolons , like colons , are used to gloss over an imprecise thought .
They place two clauses in some kind of relation to one another but relieve the writer of saying exactly what that relation is .
Even the simple conjunction " and , " for which they are often a substitute , has more content , because it suggests compatibility or logical continuity .
( " And , " incidentally , is among the most abused words in the language .
It is forever being exploited as a kind of neutral vocalization connecting two things that have no connection whatever . )
In exasperation I have tried to confine my own use of the semicolon to demarking sequences that contain internal commas and therefore might otherwise be confusing .
I recognize that my reaction is extreme .
But the semicolon has become so hateful to me that I feel almost morally compromised when I use it .
Before leaving the realm of epidemics , I want to mention two other practices that are out of hand : the use of italics for emphasis and of quotation marks for distancing .
These are ugly habits because of the intellectual tone they set .
Italics rarely fail to insult the reader 's intelligence .
More often than not they tell us to emphasize a word or phrase that we would emphasize automatically in any natural reading of the sentence .
Quotation marks create the spurious impression of an aristocracy of sensibility .
Three paragraphs back I originally put quotation marks around " fancy , " to suggest quite falsely that I would never use such a word myself , being of too refined a temperament .
At the opposite pole are two marks of punctuation that have grown increasingly obsolescent , the question mark and the exclamation point .
Appropriately , the disappearance of the question mark largely reflects the disappearance of questions , which sound unpleasantly rhetorical to us .
But even real questions , if they are long enough , are now apt to end in periods .
The exclamation point is obviously too emphatic , too childish , for our sophisticated ways .
Psychologically speaking , the decline of these two marks is the inverse of the semicolon epidemic .
Questions and exclamations betray a sense of inquisitiveness and wonder that is distinctly unmodern , whereas semicolons imply a capacity for complex , dialectical formulations appropriate to our complex times .
As part of my campaign against the semicolon -- no doubt irrationally -- I am endeavoring to develop friendlier relations with these neglected gestures .
But I 'll admit that it 's not easy .
Then there are parentheses and dashes .
They are , of course , indispensable .
I 've used them five times already in this essay alone .
But I think one must maintain a very strict attitude toward them .
I start from the proposition that all parentheses and dashes are syntactical defeats .
They signify an inability to express one 's ideas sequentially , which , unless you 're James Joyce , is the way the language was meant to be used .
Reality may be simultaneous , but expository prose is linear .
Parentheses and dashes represent efforts to elude the responsibilities of linearity .
They generally betoken stylistic laziness , an unwillingness to spend the time figuring out how to put things in the most logical order .
Needless to say , they also betoken a failure of discipline .
Every random thought , every tenuous analogy gets dragged in .
Good writing is as much a matter of subtraction as creation , and parentheses are the great enemy of subtraction .
In all that I write I try to find ways to eliminate them .
A monstrous variation on the parenthesis is the content footnote .
What , after all , is a content footnote but material that one is either too lazy to integrate into the text or too reverent to discard ?
Reading a piece of prose that constantly dissolves into extended footnotes is profoundly disheartening .
Hence my rule of thumb for footnotes is exactly the same as that for parentheses .
One should regard them as symbols of failure .
I hardly need add that in this vale of tears failure is sometimes unavoidable .
Only one issue of punctuation generates no emotion in me , namely , the rules governing the placement of punctuation marks with respect to quotation marks .
Those rules are simple enough , but perhaps because they differ between England and the United States they possess for me only the arbitrary authority of commandments and none of the well - nigh metaphysical significance that I associate with the period , the comma , the parenthesis , and the semicolon .
You almost can't tell it's an attack on Mitt Romney .
In the television ad , the music is uplifting , the feminine narrator speaks firmly but sweetly .
In the excerpts from his speeches , Romney looks and sounds like a man in command .
There are lots of American flags .
But the rich production values conceal a sly assault .
All of the positions Romney declares in the ad , on abortion and gun control , are views he no longer holds .
The ad never acknowledges its real point , which is to mock Romney 's abandonment of his moderate Republican past as he seeks the mantle of social conservative in the Republican presidential primary .
The ad's creator is the Log Cabin Republicans , a group of gay and lesbian Republicans who push the party to be more inclusive .
Its purpose is to let other Republicans know that Romney is a big phony , said Log Cabin president Patrick Sammon .
" The issue here is about trust ; it 's about character ; it 's about principle , " Sammon said .
" Mitt Romney has real challenges on all those issues .
The lesson for Republicans is they need to be honest about what they believe . "
Interestingly , the ad does n't mention any gay and lesbian issues .
As a presidential candidate today , Romney favors an amendment to the U.S. Constitution to ban same - sex marriage .
As a candidate for office in his home state of Massachusetts years ago , he campaigned for gay and lesbian support , emphasizing his opposition to discrimination in the workplace .
" Certainly Governor Romney used to be supportive of gay rights , but I 'm not sure anyone knows what he supports now , " Sammon said .
The ad , which Sammon said has aired in Iowa and nationally on Fox News , uses Romney 's own words against him , showing video clips of Romney from a 1994 debate against incumbent Democratic Senator Ted Kennedy .
It comes on the heels of another YouTube video called " The Real Romney ? " , which features extended footage of Romney arguing for moderate social positions during the 1994 debate .
The video , which has over 200,000 views , was posted anonymously , but its authenticity has not been challenged .
Log Cabin Republicans are not endorsing a candidate in the Republican primary .
But if their attack on Romney helps anyone , it probably would be Romney 's fellow frontrunner Rudy Giuliani , who has supported gay issues in the past and has n't changed his previous positions to the extent that Romney has .
" There is a school of thought that says Giuliani is the most favorable of the Republican candidates for gay rights , " said Chuck Wolfe , president of the Victory Fund , which supports openly gay and lesbian candidates .
" But I think a lot that is a feeling more than a track record . "
Could the Log Cabin Republicans have other motives for attacking Romney ?
Sure , said Stuart Rothenberg , who edits the independent Rothenberg Political Report in Washington , D.C. " They 're probably doing it for several reasons , to raise money , to show their contributors they 're doing something , all those things . "
Sammon wo n't say whether donations have increased since the ad started running .
As to whether the Log Cabin attack will hurt Romney , it 's still too soon to say , said Rothenberg : " So far , conservatives seem to be saying , ' He was running in Massachusetts , he had to sound like a liberal . ' "
But Giuliani , who is running as a social moderate in the same GOP primary , is a popular candidate as well .
It 's surprising that Romney is n't taking more heat for switching positions , and that Giuliani is getting serious support without renouncing his moderate social views , Rothenberg said .
" The jury 's still out , " he said .
" It 's a very surprising race . "
BAGHDAD , Iraq ( CNN ) -- Coalition forces on Thursday arrested a suspected member of an elite Iranian unit that has been accused of training and equipping insurgents in Iraq , the U.S. military said .
An Iraqi soldier guards the scene of a car bomb Thursday in eastern Baghdad .
The military said the suspect , who was not identified , is a member of Iran 's Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps - Quds Force .
The U.S. military calls the force " a covert action arm of the Iranian government responsible for aiding lethal attacks against the Iraqi government and coalition forces . "
The military said the Quds Force suspect was involved in bringing roadside bombs from Iran into Iraq and in training foreign terrorists in Iraq .
The man , captured in the Iraqi Kurdish city of Sulaimaniya , is one of several Iranians in U.S. custody in Iraq .
Also on Thursday , an Iraqi National Police intelligence officer was taken into custody for " suspected involvement in illegal militia activities , " the U.S. military said .
Col .
Thamir Mohammad Sinah al - Husayni , also known as Abu Turab , was arrested by U.S. troops .
The officer used his position " to direct Iraqi National Police officers to use traffic checkpoints throughout western Baghdad to detain Sunnis , thereby aiding in sectarian evictions in Shia areas , " the military said .
The military also said he abused Sunni detainees and used them to obtain ransom .
Meanwhile , two Iraqi soldiers were among three people killed Thursday when a parked car detonated near an Iraqi Army checkpoint , an Interior Ministry official said .
The official said a tow - truck driver hauling a car approached the checkpoint and asked troops if he could drop off the vehicle he was towing near the checkpoint because he had to tow another car .
The driver dropped the car off and left .
Moments later , the parked car blew up , the Interior Ministry official said
The bomb exploded in the Habibiya neighborhood at the edge of Sadr City , the densely populated Shiite slum in northeastern Baghdad .
Seven people were wounded , including four soldiers .
Coalition forces elsewhere in Iraq on Thursday killed seven suspected al Qaeda in Iraq insurgents and detained eight others , the U.S. military said .
The seven were killed in fighting during a raid in Mahmoudiya , southwest of Baghdad .
Three people were detained there .
North of Baghdad in Samarra , five people were seized in another raid .
Lt. Gen. Raymond Odierno , a top U.S. commander in Iraq , told reporters Thursday that attacks across the nation have dropped " to their lowest levels " since the strike in February 2006 on the Askariya mosque in Samarra , an attack that spurred intense sectarian violence .
And in Baghdad , he said , civilian casualties have dropped since last year from an average of 32 per day to 12 per day .
The U.S. military announced the non-combat death of an American soldier Wednesday in Iraq 's Anbar province .
This brings the number of U.S. troop deaths in the war to 3,785 ; seven civilian contractors for the Defense Department also have been killed .
Fifty U.S. troops have died in Iraq so far in September .

New York Times : Wiretaps on Americans dug deeper than originally disclosed by FBI RAW STORY
Published : Saturday September 8 , 2007
Print This Email This Records obtained by the New York Times show that the FBI not only demanded information on American individuals from telecommunications providers in " national security letters , " but also expected information on people their subjects associated with , called one 's " community of interest . "
The practice was recently discontinued .
# EXCERPTS :
The community of interest data sought by the FBI is central to a data - mining technique intelligence officials call " link analysis . "
Since the attacks of Sept. 11 , 2001 , American counterterrorism officials have turned more frequently to the technique , using communications patterns and other data to identify suspects who may not have any other known links to extremists .
The concept has strong government proponents who see it as a vital tool in predicting and preventing attacks , and it is also thought to have helped the National Security Agency identify targets for its domestic eavesdropping program .
But privacy advocates , civil rights leaders and even some counterterrorism officials warn that link analysis can be misused to establish tenuous links to people who have no real connection to terrorism but may be drawn into an investigation nonetheless .
Typically , community of interest data might include an analysis of which people the targets called most frequently , how long they generally talked and at what times of day , sudden fluctuations in activity , geographic regions that were called , and other data , law enforcement and industry officials said .

LLVM 2.1 Release Notes
Written by the LLVM Team
This document contains the release notes for the LLVM compiler infrastructure , release 2.1 .
Here we describe the status of LLVM , including major improvements from the previous release and any known problems .
All LLVM releases may be downloaded from the LLVM releases web site .
For more information about LLVM , including information about the latest release , please check out the main LLVM web site .
If you have questions or comments , the LLVM developer 's mailing list is a good place to send them .
Note that if you are reading this file from a Subversion checkout or the main LLVM web page , this document applies to the next release , not the current one .
To see the release notes for a specific releases , please see the releases page .
This is the twelfth public release of the LLVM Compiler Infrastructure .
It includes many features and refinements from LLVM 2.0 .
LLVM 2.1 brings two new beta C front - ends .
First , a new version of llvm - gcc based on GCC 4.2 , innovatively called " llvm - gcc - 4.2 " .
This promises to bring FORTRAN and Ada support to LLVM as well as features like atomic builtins and OpenMP .
None of these actually work yet , but do n't let that stop you checking it out !
Second , LLVM now includes its own native C and Objective - C front - end ( C++ is in progress , but is not very far along ) code named " clang " .
This front - end has a number of great features , primarily aimed at source - level analysis and speeding up compile - time .
At this point though , the LLVM Code Generator component is still very early in development , so it 's mostly useful for people looking to build source - level analysis tools or source - to - source translators .
Some of the most noticable feature improvements this release have been in the optimizer , speeding it up and making it more aggressive .
For example : Owen Anderson wrote the new MemoryDependenceAnalysis pass , which provides a lazy , caching layer on top of AliasAnalysis .
He then used it to rewrite DeadStoreElimination which resulted in significantly better compile time in common cases ,
Owen implemented the new GVN pass , which is also based on MemoryDependenceAnalysis .
This pass replaces GCSE / LoadVN in the standard set of passes , providing more aggressive optimization at a some - what improved compile - time cost .
Owen implemented GVN - PRE , a partial redundancy elimination algorithm that shares some details with the new GVN pass .
It is still in need of compile time tuning , and is not turned on by default .
Devang merged ETForest and DomTree into a single easier to use data structure .
This makes it more obvious which datastructure to choose ( because there is only one ) and makes the compiler more memory and time efficient ( less stuff to keep up - to - date ) .
Nick Lewycky improved loop trip count analysis to handle many more common cases .
One of the main focuses of this release was performance tuning and bug fixing .
In addition to these , several new major changes occurred : Dale finished up the Tail Merging optimization in the code generator , and enabled it by default .
This produces smaller code that is also faster in some cases .
Christopher Lamb implemented support for virtual register sub-registers , which can be used to better model many forms of subregisters .
As an example use , he modified the X86 backend to use this to model truncates and extends more accurately ( leading to better code ) .
Dan Gohman changed the way we represent vectors before legalization , significantly simplifying the SelectionDAG representation for these and making the code generator faster for vector code .
Evan contributed a new target independent if - converter .
While it is target independent , so far only the ARM backend uses it .
Evan rewrite the way the register allocator handles rematerialization , allowing it to be much more effective on two - address targets like X86 , and taught it to fold loads away when possible ( also a big win on X86 ) .
Dan Gohman contributed support for better alignment and volatility handling in the code generator , and significantly enhanced alignment analysis for SSE load / store instructions .
With his changes , an insufficiently - aligned SSE load instruction turns into movups , for example .
, for example .
Duraid Madina contributed a new " bigblock " register allocator , and Roman Levenstein contributed several big improvements .
BigBlock is optimized for code that uses very large basic blocks .
It is slightly slower than the " local " allocator , but produces much better code .
David Greene refactored the register allocator to split coalescing out from allocation , making coalescers pluggable .
New features include : Bruno Cardoso Lopes contributed initial MIPS support .
It is sufficient to run many small programs , but is still incomplete and is not yet fully performant .
Bill Wendling added SSSE3 support to the X86 backend .
Nicholas Geoffray contributed improved linux / ppc ABI and JIT support .
Dale Johannesen rewrote handling of 32 - bit float values in the X86 backend when using the floating point stack , fixing several nasty bugs .
Dan contributed rematerialization support for the X86 backend , in addition to several X86 - specific micro optimizations .
New features include : Duncan and Anton made significant progress chasing down a number of problems with C++ Zero-Cost exception handling in llvm - gcc 4.0 and 4.2 .
It is now at the point where it " just works " on linux / X86 - 32 and has partial support on other targets .
Devang and Duncan fixed a huge number of bugs relating to bitfields , pragma pack , and variable sized fields in structures .
Tanya implemented support for __attribute__ ( ( noinline ) ) in llvm -gcc , and added support for generic variable annotations which are propagated into the LLVM IR , e.g. " int X __attribute__ ( ( annotate ( " myproperty " ) ) ) ; " .
in llvm -gcc , and added support for generic variable annotations which are propagated into the LLVM IR , e.g. " " .
Sheng Zhou and Christopher Lamb implemented alias analysis support for " restrict " pointer arguments to functions .
Duncan contributed support for trampolines ( taking the address of a nested function ) .
Currently this is only supported on the X86 - 32 target .
Lauro Ramos Venancio contributed support to encode alignment info in load and store instructions , the foundation for other alignment - related work .
New features include : Neil Booth contributed a new " APFloat " class , which ensures that floating point representation and constant folding is not dependent on the host architecture that builds the application .
This support is the foundation for " long double " support that will be wrapped up in LLVM 2.2 .
Based on the APFloat class , Dale redesigned the internals of the ConstantFP class and has been working on extending the core and optimizer components to support various target - specific ' long double's .
We expect this work to be completed in LLVM 2.2 .
LLVM now provides an LLVMBuilder class , which makes it significantly easier to create LLVM IR instructions .
Reid contributed support for intrinsics that take arbitrary integer typed arguments .
Dan Gohman and Chandler extended it to support arbitrary floating point arguments and vectors .
New features include : Sterling Stein contributed a new BrainF frontend , located in llvm / examples .
This shows a some of the more modern APIs for building a front - end , and demonstrates JIT compiler support .
David Green contributed a new -- enable - expensive - checks configure option which enables STL checking , and fixed several bugs exposed by it .
LLVM is known to work on the following platforms : Intel and AMD machines running Red Hat Linux , Fedora Core and FreeBSD ( and probably other unix - like systems ) .
PowerPC and X86 - based Mac OS X systems , running 10.2 and above in 32 - bit and 64 - bit modes .
Intel and AMD machines running on Win32 using MinGW libraries ( native )
Intel and AMD machines running on Win32 with the Cygwin libraries ( limited support is available for native builds with Visual C++ ) .
Sun UltraSPARC workstations running Solaris 8 .
Alpha - based machines running Debian GNU / Linux .
Itanium - based machines running Linux and HP - UX .
The core LLVM infrastructure uses GNU autoconf to adapt itself to the machine and operating system on which it is built .
However , minor porting may be required to get LLVM to work on new platforms .
We welcome your portability patches and reports of successful builds or error messages .
This section contains all known problems with the LLVM system , listed by component .
As new problems are discovered , they will be added to these sections .
If you run into a problem , please check the LLVM bug database and submit a bug if there is n't already one .
The following components of this LLVM release are either untested , known to be broken or unreliable , or are in early development .
These components should not be relied on , and bugs should not be filed against them , but they may be useful to some people .
In particular , if you would like to work on one of these components , please contact us on the LLVMdev list .
The - cee pass is known to be buggy , and may be removed in a future release .
pass is known to be buggy , and may be removed in a future release .
The MSIL backend is experimental .
The IA64 code generator is experimental .
The Alpha backend is experimental .
" - filetype=asm " ( the default ) is the only supported value for the - filetype llc option .
The X86 backend does not yet support inline assembly that uses the X86 floating point stack .
The X86 backend occasionally has alignment problems on operating systems that do n't require 16 - byte stack alignment ( including most non-darwin OS 's like linux ) .
PowerPC backend does not correctly implement ordered FP comparisons .
The Linux PPC32 / ABI support needs testing for the interpreter and static compilation , and lacks support for debug information .
Thumb mode works only on ARM v6 or higher processors .
On sub -ARMv6 processors , thumb programs can crash or produce wrong results ( PR1388 ) .
Compilation for ARM Linux OABI ( old ABI ) is supported , but not fully tested .
There is a bug in QEMU - ARM ( <= 0.9.0 ) which causes it to incorrectly execute programs compiled with LLVM .
Please use more recent versions of QEMU .
The SPARC backend only supports the 32 - bit SPARC ABI ( - m32 ) , it does not support the 64 - bit SPARC ABI ( - m64 ) .
On 21164s , some rare FP arithmetic sequences which may trap do not have the appropriate nops inserted to ensure restartability .
C++ programs are likely to fail on IA64 , as calls to setjmp are made where the argument is not 16 - byte aligned , as required on IA64 .
( Strictly speaking this is not a bug in the IA64 back - end ; it will also be encountered when building C++ programs using the C back - end . )
are made where the argument is not 16 - byte aligned , as required on IA64 .
( Strictly speaking this is not a bug in the IA64 back - end ; it will also be encountered when building C++ programs using the C back - end . )
The C++ front - end does not use IA64 ABI compliant layout of v-tables .
In particular , it just stores function pointers instead of function descriptors in the vtable .
This bug prevents mixing C++ code compiled with LLVM with C++ objects compiled by other C++ compilers .
There are a few ABI violations which will lead to problems when mixing LLVM output with code built with other compilers , particularly for floating - point programs .
Defining vararg functions is not supported ( but calling them is ok ) .
The Itanium backend has bitrotted somewhat .
Bugs
llvm - gcc4 does not currently support Link - Time Optimization on most platforms " out - of - the - box " .
Please inquire on the llvmdev mailing list if you are interested .
Notes
The C++ front - end is considered to be fully tested and works for a number of non-trivial programs , including LLVM itself , Qt , Mozilla , etc .
Exception handling only works well on the linux / X86 - 32 target .
In some cases , illegally throwing an exception does not result in a call to terminate .

Resolution Comparisons among 6 , 8 and 10 MP DSLRs .
Pixel Dumping I personally buy from Ritz , Adorama and Amazon .
I can't vouch for any other ads .
Introduction For normal 4x6 " ( 10x15 cm ) prints , even VGA ( 640 x 480 or 0.3 MP ) resolution is just fine .
Digital cameras did this back in 1991 !
In 1999 when digital cameras were only 1.2 or 2 MP , each megapixel mattered if you were making bigger prints .
Today , even the cheapest cameras have at least 5 or 6 MP , which enough for any size print .
How ?
Simple : when you print three - feet ( 1 m ) wide , you stand further back .
Print a billboard , and you stand 100 feet back .
6MP is plenty .
Sharpness depends more on your photographic skill than the number of megapixels , because most people 's sloppy technique or subject motion blurs the image more than the width of a microscopic pixel .
Even when megapixels mattered , there was little visible difference between cameras with seemingly different ratings .
For instance , a 3 MP camera pretty much looks the same as a 6 MP camera , even when blown up to 12 x 18 " ( 30x50 cm ) !
I know because I 've done this .

They 're made on a 6MP D70 .
There are plenty of shows selling shots from fuzzy Holgas for a lot more money , just that those folks do n't tell me about it .
Holgas sell for $ 24.95 , brand new , here .
You can see an award - winning shot made with a Holga hanging in Washington , D.C. 's Hemicycle Gallery of the Corcoran Museum of Art in their 2006 Eyes of History competition of the White House News Photographers Association here .
Sharpness has very little to do with image quality , and resolution has little to do with sharpness .
Resolution ( pixel count ) has nothing to do with picture quality .
Color and tone are far more important technically .
Even Consumer Reports in their November 2002 issue noted some lower resolution digital cameras made better images than some higher resolution ones .
That was a long time ago !
Explanation of Terms Pixels Pictures are made up of little dots called pixels .
Pixel stands for PICture ELement .
Put enough of them together and you have a picture .
They are arranged horizontally and vertically .
Get close enough to your computer screen ( or use a magnifier ) and you 'll see them .
Resolution ( Linear Resolution ) Image Resolution Resolution is how many pixels you have counted horizontally or vertically when used to describe a stored image .
Digital cameras today have between 2,048 and 4,500 pixels horizontally .
3 MP cameras have 2,048 pixels horizontally and 14 MP cameras have 4,500 pixels .
They have fewer pixels vertically since the images are n't as tall as they are wide .
That 's not much of a difference , is it ?
That 's the whole point of this article .
I 'll explain that a little further down .
Print Resolution Resolution is also how many pixels you have per inch or other linear unit when you print on paper .
Most prints are made at 200 - 300 pixels per inch ( PPI or DPI , dots per inch ) .
This is the image resolution and has nothing to do with the technology by which the print is made .
( For instance , inkjet printers ' nozzle sizes are the silly 2880 DPI or other numbers you see .
These printer numbers are often used by hucksters to hoodwink and distract you when talking about resolution .
These only refer to how the ink is spat out on the paper . )
Screen Resolution
Most computer screens today are about 100 DPI , dots per inch .
There is n't much variation from screen to screen so we rarely discuss this .
It 's easy to figure out : most computer screens are about 1,024 x 768 pixels .
If your screen is 10 " wide then divides 1,024 by 10 and you have a 102.4 DPI screen .
Bigger screens tend to have more pixels , for instance , my 22 " CRT has 1,600 x 1,200 pixels and has a viewing area of 16 x 12 . "
Yes , laptops with bigger screens tend to have lower linear resolution .
No big deal .
Pixel Count , expressed as Megapixels Pixel Count , expressed as Megapixels , is simply multiplying the number of horizontal pixels by the number of vertical pixels .
It 's exactly like calculating area .
A 3 MP camera has 2,048 ( horizontal ) x 1,536 ( vertical ) pixels , or 3,145,728 pixels .
We call this simply 3 MP .
Small differences in pixel count , between say 5 MP and 8MP , are unimportant because pixel counts are a square function .
It 's exactly like calculating area or square footage .
It only takes a 40 % increase in linear dimensions to double the pixel count !
Doubling pixel count only increases the real , linear resolution by 40 % , which is pretty much invisible .
The Myth The megapixel myth was started by camera makers and swallowed hook , line and sinker by camera measurebators .
Camera makers use the number of megapixels a camera has to hoodwink you into thinking it has something to do with camera quality .
They use it because even a tiny linear resolution increase results in a huge total pixel increase , since the total pixel count varies as the total area of the image , which varies as the square of the linear resolution .
In other words , an almost invisible 40 % increase in the number of pixels in any one direction results in a doubling of the total number of pixels in the image .
Therefore camera makers can always brag about how much better this week 's camera is , with even negligible improvements .
This gimmick is used by salespeople and manufacturers to you feel as if your current camera is inadequate and needs to be replaced even if the new cameras each year are only slightly better .
One needs at least a doubling of linear resolution or film size to make an obvious improvement .
This is the same as quadrupling the megapixels .
A simple doubling of megapixels , even if all else remained the same , is very subtle .
The factors that matter , like color and sharpening algorithms , are far more significant .
The megapixel myth is also prevalent because men always want a single number by which something 's goodness can be judged .
Unfortunately , it 's all a myth because the number of megapixels ( MP ) a camera has has very little to do with how the image looks .
Even worse , plenty of lower MP cameras can make better images than poorer cameras with more MP .
The Hype Here 's a complete fabrication by a company who is trying to spread the myth to get you to buy too much camera .
There 's a similar page here .
That page is brilliantly done , however it 's done with completely fraudulent data to exaggerate the differences .
At the low magnifications shown on the screen any and all of those examples should look perfect .
Instead the two lower resolution examples have been deliberately degraded to make them look worse .
Their page displaying results for a 5 x 7 " print actually show how the 4 MP camera would look blown up to 12 by 9 feet , not 5 x 7 inches !
How do we know their 4MP example is what you 'd see blown up twelve feet wide , not 5 x 7 inches ?
Easy : for the 4 MP example at maximum crop I see pixels blown up to little squares measuring 16 pixels per inch on my screen .
( Just get out your ruler and measure for yourself . )
You divide the number of pixels by the PPI ( DPI ) to get how many inches you get in print at that resolution .
Thus printing a 2,289 x 1,712 pixel ( 4MP ) image at 16 PPI gives ( 2289/16 ) " x ( 1712/16 ) " or 143 " x 107 " or , dividing inches by 12 to get feet , 12 ' x 9 . '
I 'm sure the designer of that page would feign ignorance of the technology involved if made to own up to it .
Page designers do n't have Ph.D.s in digital image processing , either .
Most likely the designer worked on it till their manager made sure that they showed a clear difference .
Their manager , if made to come clean , would probably explain that the page was put up to illustrate the differences as an educational service , not as actual science or a legitimate example .
They had to make certain " adjustments " to make the differences clear , namely , to make the 4 MP and 5 MP cameras look much worse than they are .
I taught you above how to calculate the differences among different resolution cameras .
The difference between the 6 MP and 4 MP cameras should be ( square root ( 6/4 ) ) or SQR ( 1.5 ) or 22.4 % .
In other words , the size of the pixels or number per inch should be less than 25 % different between the 4 MP and 6 MP cameras .
They 've made the lower resolution cameras look much , much worse by comparison on that page .
Honest Results for Comparison 3 MP uncropped Cropped as per red rectangle
Here 's the same percentage crop as that other store - sponsored website shows .
I gave them an advantage by showing my images above at twice the size as they did ( requiring four times the number of pixels ) and then starting with only a 3 MP camera , not the 4 MP as shown in their worst example .
Looks fine , eh ?
I actually had to throw many pixels away .
These sizes are easy to do with a 3 MP camera .
Even if they are adding in some unstated magnification to try to address other issues in rendering prints vs. screen images the differences between 4 MP and 6 MP are nowhere near as exaggerated as that store site shows .
They show at least a 4 x difference in the size of the pixels between 4 MP and 6 MP .
As you know the size difference between 4 MP and 6 MP is only 50 % in pixel count , and since pixels are square that means less than 25 % in pixel size or pitch !
Since that part of that retailer 's site is n't an ad for any particular product I doubt and truth in advertising rules apply .
Caveat emptor !
Print Sizes
Image clarity is more dependant on how you shot the photo than on the number of megapixels .
A clean shot from a 3MP camera is much better than a slightly out - of focus shot from a $ 5,000 12 MP camera .
A clear image can be printed any size from any modern digital camera .
Sure , if you print mural size and look at it from inches away you wo n't have the sharpness you 'd get from 4 x 5 " film , but if you shot it properly , it will be sharp enough to look great when viewed from a distance appropriate to the size of the print .
So long as you have 100 to 150 DPI ( dots or pixels per inch ) , you have plenty for a sharp print viewed at arm 's length .
This means a 6 MP camera can make prints 30 " ( 75 cm ) wide and still look great .
When was the last time you printed that big ?
Ideally you 'd like to print at 300 DPI to look super - sharp even when viewed too close with a magnifier .
You can figure this by : Long print dimension in inches = 4 x ( square root of megapixels )
Long print dimension in centimeters = 10 x ( square root of megapixels )
For example , the square root of four ( megapixels ) is two .
4 x ( two ) is eight .
Thus the biggest print you can make without losing sharpness as seen through a magnifier from a 4MP camera is 6 x 8 " ( 15x20 cm ) .
From a sixteen MP camera likewise you could go to 12 x 16 " ( 30x45 cm ) , and still look at the print through a magnifier .
The resolution issue is one of scale and viewing distance .
Sure , more resolution is better at bigger sizes , but how sharp your image is has little to do with how good it is .
Far more important technically is whether or not the colors are correct and whether or not any sharpening was done tastefully .
Many digital cameras add nasty looking sharpening that puts very artificial halos around sharp lines , making the image look obviously digital to those of us who recognize these things .
Sloppy sharpening is done to impress the innocent by overemphasizing the lines around things if real sharpness and resolution is lacking .
Of course you can print much bigger , since sharpness is n't as important in color as most people worry .
You can get great results from a 6 MP camera at 20 x 30 " if you want , since normal people view big images from further away .
This is all art and in the eye of the beholder ; I prefer huge prints made from my 4 x 5 " film camera , and for portraits I prefer the smoothing of digital cameras .
Do n't worry too much about this , since sharpness is not as important in color as it is in B / W. I make 12 x 18 " color prints all the time from 3 to 6 MP cameras and they look great , since I only print images that are good to begin with .
Replace Film ?
What size film ?
Film , like digital files , comes in many resolutions .
35 mm is an amateur format , medium format ( 120 or 6x7 ) is for head shots , and large format ( 4x5 " and up ) is for landscapes .
Arizona Highways prefers 4x5 " film .
As of 2008 , they now accept digital images , but with a catch : they have to be at least 300 DPI at 12x18 , " or 20 MP .
They say an 8 MP camera is OK , but you 'll notice that you have to supply 12x18 " at 300 DPI , which is 3,600 x 5,400 pixels , or 20 MP .
If you do fret the pixel counts , I find that it takes about 25 megapixels to simulate 35 mm film , which is still far more than any practical digital camera .
At the 6 megapixel level digital gives about the same sharpness as a duplicate slide , which is plenty for most things .
Honestly , I have actually had digital files written back out onto film to see this .
See also my film vs. digital page here .
Of course I use much bigger film than 35 mm for all the pretty pictures you see at my website , so digital would need about 100 megapixels to simulate medium format film , or 500 megapixels to simulate 4x5 " film .
This is all invisible at Internet resolutions , but obvious in gallery - size prints .

High oil prices , energy security fears and the potentially devastating effects of climate change have prompted the U.S. government to again explore the idea of placing millions of solar panels in orbit to beam immense amounts of clean power back to Earth .
Seriously .
An agency called the National Security Space Office , which reports to the U.S. Department of Defence , released a feasibility study last week recommending that " space - based solar power , " an idea first proposed in the U.S. some 40 years ago , be pursued in the name of national security .
The sun , after all , shines more strongly and for 24 hours a day in space , outside the filters of Earth 's clouds and its relatively dirty atmosphere .
There are also few real - estate problems up there , fewer people to complain and the potential of having a fuelling post for Richard Branson and other private space travellers .
According to the study , the energy collected would be electromagnetically beamed back to Earth and connected to the electrical grid , or used in the manufacture of synthetic fuels .
It even suggests that weaker beams could be directed at individual households .
Seriously .
" A single kilometre - wide band of geosynchronous Earth orbit experiences enough solar flux in one year to nearly equal the amount of energy contained within all known recoverable conventional oil reserves on Earth today , " the study states .
" There is enormous potential for energy security , economic development , improved environmental stewardship , advancement of general space faring , and overall national security for those nations who construct and possess ( the ) capability . "
It also says that Canada , among others , has expressed interest in such a project .
Again , the discussion has come up before .
NASA and the U.S. Department of Defence have together spent about $ 80 million ( U.S. ) over the last three decades studying the idea .
Seems like decent money , until you see that the U.S. government has spent about $ 21 billion over 50 years on that elusive energy utopia called nuclear fusion .
Perhaps it is time to give space - based solar power another look , given that such a system might already exist today had it received the money dumped into fusion .
Oil has surged past $ 80 a barrel and there 's a desperate need for low - or zero - carbon energy sources .
Lob a few bombs at Iran and the situation gets worse , not better .
On the positive side , technology has advanced significantly over the past four years .
" While significant technical challenges remain , space - based solar power is more technically executable than ever before and current technological vectors promise to further improve its viability , " according to the study .
" A government - led proof - of - concept demonstration could serve to catalyze commercial sector development . "
The recommendation is that a co-ordinated national program be created with " high - level leadership " and financial resources " at least " on level with nuclear fusion research or construction of an international space station .
It 's proposing a 10 - megawatt pilot plant that would beam a continuous flow of solar electricity back to Earth .
Not to say the barriers , mostly economic , are n't huge .
It costs dearly to rocket the materials into space that would be required to build the solar panels and associated equipment .
Would the fuel and related greenhouse gas emissions resulting from such frequent launches undermine the " clean " logic of space - based solar power ?
If one considers that the Internet started this way , as did the Global Positioning System , it 's not a stretch to see orbital solar power plants becoming a serious commercial venture .

Canine Smarts Behavioral Science Turns to Dogs for Answers
For a long time , domesticated dogs were seen as just the slobbering , dumbed - down ancestor of the wild wolf .
Dogs , though , have learned a few tricks of their own through the millennia -- and can teach us a lot about ourselves .
QIAN'AN , China–
The stars seemed to be in alignment for Jin Yani in the summer of 2000 .
She had just married .
Her partner , Yang Zhongchen , was a loving husband with a good income .
And the couple were looking forward to the birth of their first child – a girl , an ultrasound confirmed .
They would name her Yang Yin , they decided .
For a young woman from a broken family , Jin could n't believe her good luck .
But one evening , a knock came to the door – and all of that shattered in an instant .
Ten local family planning officials burst into her home , dragged her off and subjected Jin to a brutal , forced abortion .
She was in her ninth month .
Her crime ?
She had conceived her child five months before she and Yang were married , an illegal act in China .
The events that occurred seven years ago this week constitute a nightmare from which Jin has never recovered , although she and Yang have struggled for justice every day .
Now , justice might be coming .
Forced abortions are against the law in China .
And a district court has agreed to hear the couple 's appeal against a decision by a local court that absolved local family planning officials of all wrongdoing .
Jin and Yang are seeking about $ 185,000 from Hebei province 's Changli County in compensation for damages in a procedure that left Jin unable ever to bear children
" This is a first , " says Beijing lawyer Sun Maohang , who represents the couple .
" No court in China has ever agreed to hear an appeal on a charge against officials involving a forced abortion . "
While cautious ,
Sun says a legal victory would represent a " breakthrough " in Chinese law .
Further , it would likely trigger countless other Chinese to come forward with similar suits .
Forced abortions continue to be a grim reality in China , with some local officials prepared to use extraordinary measures to meet low birth targets set under China 's one - child only policy .
But Jin is realistic about the healing powers of a potential court victory .
" They can't really compensate for all that we have suffered , " she says , during an interview on the poor side of Qian'an , a prosperous iron ore mining centre , 300 kilometres east of Beijing .
" Our baby will never come back ... we just hope this kind of thing will never happen again . "
Nor will a " breakthrough " ever erase Jin 's dark memories .
" It was about seven in the evening , just after dinner , " says Jin , a slight woman a hair over five feet tall .
" My mother - in - law and I were preparing to lie down and have a rest .
Then , somebody knocked . "
As her mother - in law opened the door , the 10 officials burst in shouting , " Pack up !
Follow us ! "
One official yelled at her : " Who said you could have this baby ? "
" I was nine - months pregnant and my mother - in - law asked if we could wait until my husband returned .
They would n't allow it . "
Yang was working on a construction project in a town three hours away by train .
" I cried and cried and said I did n't want to go , " Jin recalls .
" But two men dragged me to a car and two women followed with my belongings .
They would n't let my mother - in - law come . "
Jin recognized two of the women .
They had come to her home just two days before to discuss details of the coming birth .
Given that Jin had conceived when she was 19 , and before she and Yang were officially married , the pregnancy was technically outside of the law .
But the couple had wanted to make things right .
Five months after conception , when Jin turned 20 and could legally marry , they wed and registered with the local county .
Also under Chinese law , they had to obtain a licence to have their first child .
Local officials said they could get one – if they paid a fine .
The couple agreed .
The women who came to her home two days earlier reassured her :
The paperwork would be done .
The birth would be made legal .
When Jin arrived at the local family planning clinic she was hustled inside where a doctor was summoned and she was " pushed and shoved " through a series of medical examinations , she says .
" I wanted to call my husband , but they would n't let me .
They said they did n't have a phone . "

By then Jin was becoming frantic .
She was crying , begging .
" I said , ` I do n't care how much I have to pay in fines .
I 'll pay them !
I just want to have this baby !'
" They said , ` We do n't care how much you 're willing to spend !
You 're not having it ! ' "
Officials tried to persuade her to sign papers approving the procedure .
But she refused .
A senior official at the clinic signed them .
Two men dragged Jin to another room .
" Then several people wearing white came in and they put me on a bed and tore my clothes open and held my arms down and injected me , " she says .
It was a needle larger than one used for blood samples , she recalls .
They injected it into her belly .
She passed out .
When husband Yang Zhongchen arrived by train at 7 p.m. the next day , he was prevented from entering the clinic .
He was only allowed to see his wife the following morning .
By then , she was in sheer agony .
" I could n't bear the pain , " she says , breaking down and crying for the first time during the interview .
On that day , some 48 hours after the injection had killed her child , a team of sweating doctors and nurses using forceps had to forcibly extract the dead body from her womb .
Jin lost blood , was traumatized and remained in hospital for 44 days .
" I could n't move for a month , " says Jin .
" I was like a small kid .
My husband had to carry me to the bathroom all the time .
He also brought food . "
And he paid for medicine .
" The people in the clinic said to me , ` If you want medicine , you 'll have to pay .
No money , no medicine , ' " Yang recalls .
Outraged , he set aside his job and set out on what would eventually become a seven - year campaign going to one government office after another trying to seek relief for his wife and himself .
His campaign was fruitless .
Running out of both money and hope , Yang was finally referred to lawyer Sun who took the case without pay .
" Whether it ( the abortion ) was voluntary is the key point , " says Sun .
" The signature for the operation is the most powerful piece of evidence . "
The local court did not force local officials to produce the document .
Sun is hoping the more powerful higher court will .
So is Jin .
" We 're hoping for a satisfactory resolution , " she says , " for the sake of our baby ... for our own peace of mind . "

In Wake of Racist Attacks in Mügeln Germany Wonders How to Stop the Neo- Nazis
Few are denying that Germany has a problem with right - wing violence .
But what should be done about it ?
With Mügeln having been turned down for federal funding to combat neo -Nazis , many are calling for more money .
As Americans honor those 2403 men , women , and children killed and 1178 wounded in the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor , Hawaii on December 7 , 1941 , recently released government documents concerning that surprise raid compel us to revisit some troubling questions .
At issue is American foreknowledge of Japanese military plans to attack Hawaii by a submarine and carrier force 59 years ago .
There are two questions at the top of the foreknowledge list : ( 1 ) whether President Franklin D. Roosevelt and his top military chieftains provoked Japan into an overt act of war directed at Hawaii , and ( 2 ) whether Japans military plans were obtained in advance by the United States but concealed from the Hawaiian military commanders , Admiral Husband E. Kimmel and Lieutenant General Walter Short so they would not interfere with the overt act .
The latter question was answered in the affirmative on October 30 , 2000 , when President Bill Clinton signed into law , with the support of a bipartisan Congress , the National Defense Authorization Act .
Amidst its omnibus provisions , the Act reverses the findings of nine previous Pearl Harbor investigations and finds that both Kimmel and Short were denied crucial military intelligence that tracked the Japanese forces toward Hawaii and obtained by the Roosevelt Administration in the weeks before the attack .
Congress was specific in its finding against the 1941 White House : Kimmel and Short were cut off from the intelligence pipeline that located Japanese forces advancing on Hawaii .
Then , after the successful Japanese raid , both commanders were relieved of their commands , blamed for failing to ward off the attack , and demoted in rank .
President Clinton must now decide whether to grant the request by Congress to restore the commanders to their 1941 ranks .
Regardless of what the Commander - in - Chief does in the remaining months of his term , these congressional findings should be widely seen as an exoneration of 59 years of blame assigned to Kimmel and Short .
But one important question remains :
Does the blame for the Pearl Harbor disaster revert to President Roosevelt ?
A major motion picture based on the attack is currently under production by Walt Disney Studios and scheduled for release in May 2001 .
The producer , Jerry Bruckheimer , refuses to include Americas foreknowledge in the script .
When Bruckheimer commented on FDRs foreknowledge in an interview published earlier this year , he said  That s all b___s___ .
Yet , Roosevelt believed that provoking Japan into an attack on Hawaii was the only option he had in 1941 to overcome the powerful America First non-interventionist movement led by aviation hero Charles Lindbergh .
These anti-war views were shared by 80 percent of the American public from 1940 to 1941 .
Though Germany had conquered most of Europe , and her U - Boats were sinking American ships in the Atlantic Ocean including warships Americans wanted nothing to do with  Europes War . 
However , Germany made a strategic error .
She , along with her Axis partner , Italy , signed the mutual assistance treaty with Japan , the Tripartite Pact , on September 27 , 1940 .
Ten days later , Lieutenant Commander Arthur McCollum , a U.S. Naval officer in the Office of Naval Intelligence ( ONI ) , saw an opportunity to counter the U.S. isolationist movement by provoking Japan into a state of war with the U.S. , triggering the mutual assistance provisions of the Tripartite Pact , and bringing America into World War II .
Memorialized in McCollums secret memo dated October 7 , 1940 , and recently obtained through the Freedom of Information Act , the ONI proposal called for eight provocations aimed at Japan .
Its centerpiece was keeping the might of the U.S. Fleet based in the Territory of Hawaii as a lure for a Japanese attack .
President Roosevelt acted swiftly .
The very next day , October 8 , 1940 , the Commander - in - Chief of the U.S. Fleet , Admiral James O. Richardson , was summoned to the Oval Office and told of the provocative plan by the President .
In a heated argument with FDR , the admiral objected to placing his sailors and ships in harms way .
Richardson was then fired and in his place FDR selected an obscure naval officer , Rear Admiral Husband E. Kimmel , to command the fleet in Hawaii .
Kimmel was promoted to a four - star admiral and took command on February 1 , 1941 .
In a related appointment , Walter Short was promoted from Major General to a three - star Lieutenant General and given command of U.S. Army troops in Hawaii .
Throughout 1941 , FDR implemented the remaining seven provocations .
He then gauged Japanese reaction through intercepted and decoded communications intelligence originated by Japans diplomatic and military leaders .
The island nations militarists used the provocations to seize control of Japan and organized their military forces for war against the U.S. , Great Britain , and the Netherlands .
The centerpiece the Pearl Harbor attack was leaked to the U.S. in January 1941 .
During the next 11 months , the White House followed the Japanese war plans through the intercepted and decoded diplomatic and military communications intelligence .
Japanese leaders failed in basic security precautions .
At least 1,000 Japanese military and diplomatic radio messages per day were intercepted by monitoring stations operated by the U.S. and her Allies , and the message contents were summarized for the White House .
The intercept summaries were clear : Pearl Harbor would be attacked on December 7 , 1941 , by Japanese forces advancing through the Central and North Pacific Oceans .
On November 27 and 28 , 1941 , Admiral Kimmel and General Short were ordered to remain in a defensive posture for  the United States desires that Japan commit the first overt act . 
The order came directly from President Roosevelt .
As I explained to a policy forum audience at The Independent Institute in Oakland , California , which was videotaped and telecast nationwide over the Fourth of July holiday earlier this year , my research of U.S. naval records shows that not only were Kimmel and Short cut off from the Japanese communications intelligence pipeline , so were the American people .
It is a coverup that has lasted for nearly 59 years .
Immediately after December 7 , 1941 , military communications documents that disclose American foreknowledge of the Pearl Harbor disaster were locked in U.S.
Navy vaults away from the prying eyes of congressional investigators , historians , and authors .
Though the Freedom of Information
Act freed the foreknowledge documents from the secretive vaults to the sunlight of the National Archives in 1995 , a cottage industry continues to cover up Americas foreknowledge of Pearl Harbor .
From Wired Magazine , a story on the " 100 Mile Suit :" When educator and designer Kelly Cobb decided to make a man 's suit only from materials produced within 100 miles of her home , she knew it would be a challenge .
But Cobb 's locally made suit turned into a exhausting task .
The suit took a team of 20 artisans several months to produce -- 500 man-hours of work in total -- and the finished product wears its rustic origins on its sleeve .
Cobb 's suit is a demonstration of the massive manufacturing power of the global economy .
Industrial processes and cheap foreign labor belie the tremendous resources that go into garments as simple as a T - shirt .
Here 's a photo gallery of the 100 - mile " suit .
" Thanks to Russ Roberts at Cafe Hayek , who points out that " Self - sufficiency is the road to poverty .
" Having access to the global economy gives us access to the best the world has to offer , which is usually better ( and cheaper ) than what your local area has to offer .
Think globally , shop globally , travel globally and invest globally .
Robert 's wife Sheri has this to say ....
Robert just called home and asked me to post a warning on he site for any of you coming into Washington for the demonstrations this weekend .
Has Washington closed it 's doors to the public ?
Well at least the ones on buses .
You 're not welcome , that is , unless they know you 're coming .
Washingon D.C. has passed an ordinance that took effect on the first of August that requires buses to have a permit to enter the district .
All buses that are coming into the district for the demonstrations are either being turned away or fined $ 500 .
There is afee of $ 50 for a 6 day permit to enter the city with a charter bus .
Robert asked my to pass along the information for anyone who may be coming inot the city wither this weekend or next .
Sheri went on to link to the District Department of Motor Vehicles

Its 27 floors on a 4,532 sq metre plot will provide a panoramic view of the entire city of Mumbai ( Bombay ) once it is completed next year .
With the country 's economy soaring , India 's commercial city is poised to have many more such skyscrapers .
Construction of the family home is well under way .
' Full view '
The son of a former petrol pump attendant who went on to build a business empire , Mukesh Ambani is reportedly spending $ 1bn on his new home .
Mr Ambani has been accused of an obscene display of wealth
Legend has it that Mr Ambani - the chairman , and largest shareholder of Reliance Industries , India 's largest private sector company - wants to enjoy a " full view " of the Arabian Sea .
So his architects came up with the idea of a 27 - storey home .
The first six floors will serve as car parks .
A health club will be built on the next two and the few floors above that will house hundreds of staff .
Fifty - year - old Mr Ambani and his family will occupy the top floors of the building which will also have a helipad and swimming pools .
Critics say it is an obscene display of wealth , especially in a city where more than half the inhabitants live on the pavements .
Architects believe that the construction of high - rises will provide a long - term solution to the problem of sheltering the city 's homeless , especially when development land is in short supply .
One architect who is constructing a building which will be even taller than that planned by Mr Ambani told the BBC that Mumbai will soon be " littered with high - rises " as the government strives to shift slum dwellers into tower blocks .

No , we do n't yet rate our own entry in Conservapedia , the online encyclopedia for right - leaning wing nuts .
But I 'd like to think that when the editors do include us , they will keep my humble submission in mind .
Conservapedia is just like Wikipedia , except that its 11,000 entries read like they were personally vetted by Pat Robertson and the 700 Club .
Fed up with Wikipedia 's purported liberal bias , Conservapedia 's founder , Andrew Schlafly , son of conservative activist Phyllis Schlafly , has created " an encyclopedia you can trust . "
And you can trust them , to give you some pretty loopy definitions .
Their entry on kangaroos , for instance , says that , " like all modern animals . . . kangaroos are the descendants of the two founding members of the modern kangaroo baramin that were taken aboard Noah 's Ark prior to the Great Flood . "
You may not recognize the word " baramin . "
It 's a 20th - century creationist neologism that refers to the species God placed on earth during Creation Week .
Special for kids : I would n't use that word on the biology final .
Although maybe your parents could sue the local school board for failing to teach the Book of Genesis in science class .
More on Conserva - kangaroos : " After the Flood , these kangaroos bred from the Ark passengers migrated to Australia .
There is debate whether this migration happened over land with lower sea levels during the post - flood ice age , or before the supercontinent of Pangea broke apart , or if they rafted on mats of vegetation torn up by the receding flood waters . "
Who knew ?
Conservapedia epitomizes modern Americans ' penchant for seeking out congenial realities , known as " cocooning . "
Just last week , the Creation Museum , derided as " the creationist Disneyland , " opened its doors in Petersburg , Ky .
The museum aims to illustrate the scientific underpinnings of the Bible .
" This is nonsense , " theoretical physicist Lawrence M. Krauss told The Washington Post .
" It 's fine for people to believe whatever they want .
What 's inappropriate is to then essentially lie and say science supports these notions . "
The yahoos are n't the only ones who hear what they want to hear and disregard the rest .
The liberal intelligentsia can't understand why the rest of the country does n't think it 's a swell idea to trade in their pickup trucks for prissy little Japanese Priuses , or why anyone would shop at a neo -Nazi conglomerate like Wal - Mart .
Perish the thought they should walk into a Wal - Mart store and find out what 's on sale there .
Good stuff , cheap .
But until Leftopedia comes along ( sample entry : " Al Gore : the Messiah , rejected by mankind in 2000 and again in 2008 " ) I have only Conservapedia to kick around .
Here 's its index of homosexuality entries , which do not betoken a broad - minded view of men and women at ease with their sexual identities :
1 Old Testament 2 New Testament ( Epistles ) 3 Promiscuity and disease 4 Homosexuality and Mental Health 5 Modern justifications 6 Judicial activism 7 Homosexuality and Marriage 8 Homosexuality and Animals 9 Homosexuality and Creationism and the Theory of Evolution 10 Reparative Therapy
Without identifying him , Conservapedia quotes the author of " A Parent 's Guide to Preventing Homosexuality " to the effect that " there is no such thing as a homosexual , but only heterosexuals that have a homosexual problem . "
Color me a heterosexual who has a Conservapedia problem .
Here is an odd , truthful sentence in the Conserva - entry for Ann Coulter : " Her incoherent books and vitriolic speaking style have endeared her to fans and infuriated opponents . "
Even the broken clock of conservative nuttery tells the correct time now and then .

Imagine there were a foreign politician who said :
• " We are all happy when U.S. soldiers are killed [ in Iraq ] week in and week out .
The killing of U.S. soldiers in Iraq is legitimate and obligatory . "
• In October 2003 , after rockets were fired at the hotel at which Paul Wolfowitz was staying in Baghdad , that " We hope that next time the rockets will be more accurate and effective in getting rid of this virus and his like , who wreak corruption in Arab lands . "
• That he felt " great joy " at the 2002 space shuttle Columbia disaster because one of the astronauts was Israeli .
• That the real axis of evil is " oil and Jews , " and " The oil axis is present in most of the U.S. administration , beginning with its president , vice president , and top advisers , including Rice , who is oil - colored , while the axis of Jews is present with Paul Wolfowitz . "
Next , imagine a Democratic president and vice president met with him on multiple occasions and spoke of their admiration for his " courageous stand . "
And that prominent liberal think tanks invited him to give high - profile speeches .
And then : imagine the weeks of wall - to - wall shrieking on every cable show in America .
Imagine how it could be heard on Mars .
Imagine the endless , furious denunciations by every Republican politician with a mouth .
Imagine the mass resignations , public disavowals and groveling apologies .
Imagine how the incident would be woven forevermore into a narrative about the need for Democrats to assure America every day until the end of time they had left behind their America - hating , anti-Semitic , terrorist - loving ways .
None of this happened , of course .
Because while Lebanese politician Walid Jumblatt has said all these things , he 's only met with a Republican president , George W. Bush ( last February ) .
And he 's only met , on multiple occasions , with a Republican Vice President , Dick Cheney .
( Cheney followed Jumblatt onstage just last week , which is when he took the opportunity to praise Jumblatt 's " courageous stand . " )
And Jumblatt has only been feted by prominent conservative think tanks , such as the American Enterprise Institute and the Washington Institute for Near East Policy .
It 's a measure of the absolute conservative dominance of the media and entire political system that not only is this all OK , almost no one is even aware of it .
Certainly the Democrats are n't ; I assume they have n't read up on it because they 're too busy denouncing MoveOn and forcing Pete Stark to lick George Bush 's boots .
( Jumblatt 's statements were briefly noted by the Washington Post last year on page A15 . )
A while back I tried signing up for an OpenID , an " open , decentralized , free framework for user - centric digital identity . "
The basic idea is that , instead of needing to choose a user name and password for every site you visit , you can identify yourself with an ID that many sites will accept .
It sounds great , but in practice I found the whole process bewildering .
In my opinion , it ’s not ready for consumer use .
Beyond security criticisms of the scheme that can be found elsewhere , I think OpenID has some significant user experience issues .
Some of the problems can be fixed , others are integral to the way the system works .
It 's way , way too hard to get started .
All the sites supporting OpenID point curious users to the home page for the OpenID Foundation .
From this site , it ’s actually stunningly difficult to find a link to a place where you can actually get an OpenID .
A link to a site called I want my OpenID !
sounds promising , but the destination page does n't actually deliver on the promise of getting a user an OpenID either .
The content and tone of the OpenID Foundation site is oriented at developers , not end users .
The second sentence of the home page boasts , " OpenID starts with the concept that anyone can identify themselves on the Internet the same way websites do — with a URI . "
You know what ?
To most people , that does n't sound like an advantage ; it sounds geeky , dehumanizing , and more than a little bit frightening .
While there are very cool benefits that come from identifying oneself with a URL ( URI ) , pity the poor consumer .
They have dutifully learned that a user name is an identity and a URL is a place to go .
Now they must wrap their weary brains around the concept that , when asked to identify themselves , they should provide a location .
" Why can't I just use my email address ? " they 'll wonder .
The process of selecting an OpenID provider will stump the average consumer .
They ’re being asked to pick an ID that they will , in theory , use everywhere and forevermore to gain access to everything they own .
They ’re supposed to obtain this ID by making an effectively random selection from a group of providers they have never heard of .
Various OpenID sites also promote the notion that users should set up their own OpenID provider .
This is fine for a teeny tiny portion of web users , and scary and out of the question for everyone else .
The lists of OpenID providers are presented in a static order .
In some cases this will be alphabetical .
The most commonly referenced list of OpenID providers is presented in chronological order of when the service went live , an order that is effectively random .
It 's not immediately clear in most of these lists why a user would pick one provider over another .
None of the lists I 've seen are organized around attributes which are relatively easy for a user to base a decision upon , like :
Do you have a blog already ?
Or , Which language do you prefer to speak ?
As an aside , when you ask a normal person to choose a provider from a list for a service they do n't understand , most people are just going to pick the first or last entry .
( If a default value is provided , they 'll pick that .
The default value will almost always be the first entry . )
So , a static list of providers turns out to be a really good way to screw the bulk of providers whose entries sit in the middle of the list .
Microsoft learned this lesson the hard way in various places in Windows , addressing such problems by dynamically shuffling provider names so that all providers spend equal time at the top of the list .
More usefully , the lists could reflect community - based provider ratings .
The ostensible universality and permanence of an OpenID actually makes the task of picking a provider harder .
Even if I happen to currently have a SixApart blog with a TypeKey , am I really prepared to use that ID everywhere ?
Exactly how long can a consumer expect a given OpenID provider to remain in existence ?
In my playing around on one site , when I remapped a URI from one provider to another , I lost my ID - related preferences .
This gives me pause in depending upon any provider that could potentially die before the web service I 'm using the ID with .
Frankly , many of the OpenID providers seemed like tiny organizations that could disappear overnight .
Nowhere could I find anything that would tell me what should theoretically happen to my ID - bound accounts if that were to happen .
Suppose that , at some point , a visitor to an OpenID - enabled site is really intrigued by this OpenID thing they keep coming across , and decides on the spot that they want to get one for themselves .
The OpenID community , and the sites that use it , appear to have given little thought to addressing this scenario .
Go to the LiveJournal home page and try figuring out how you ’d get an OpenID and come back to use it .
I ’ll bet analytics on the site will show that , of the tiny percentage of visitors to LiveJournal who go off from there to get an OpenID , only the most determined will make it back .
Why would a site operator let anyone leave their site to perform a task from which they will never return ?
An OpenID is an identity ( like a user name ) , not an account .
A consumer still needs an account to use the site .
However , this is n't at all obvious to a consumer .
When I tried to sign in to Plaxo with my OpenID , I got an otherwise blank page displaying the error , “ Unable to verify the specified OpenID . ”
Some sites do a reasonable job of letting a user who has never logged on before create an account on the spot .
When I tried to sign in to LiveJournal with my OpenID , they let me create an account and then start using it .
This inconsistency among implementations will confuse a lot of people .
When I actually tried to use my OpenID on a site , I got a confusing message from the OpenID provider requiring me to confirm that I really wanted to let the site access personal information I had associated with my OpenID .
The clarity of such messages varies from OpenID provider to provider , ranging from puzzling to incomprehensible .
In the case of Verisign , I was instructed to select which “ Trust Profile ” I wanted to associate with the site — or did I want to create a new Trust Profile ?
Wha ?
Since most users have never encountered the concept of sharing information across sites , a ton of education would be necessary to make these messages meaningful to the average user .
Currently , even those sites that do implement OpenID generally treat OpenIDs as a second - class form of identification .
They put their own proprietary means of signing in ( generally with a user name and password ) on their home page , and bury the OpenID sign in facility behind a link .
This means that the hip OpenID - using visitor has to make more clicks than the proprietary ID - using masses ... which does n't exactly sound like a reward .
And all this is for — what , exactly ?
To save me from having to pick a user name and password ?
As annoying as that can be , it 's just not that hard !
Remembering an arbitrary user name does cause real trouble , but simply allowing email addresses to be used as IDs can solve almost all of that problem .
As more and more sites allow email addresses as IDs , the need for OpenID becomes less compelling to a consumer .
For the time being , I ca n’t imagine a sane business operator forcing their precious visitors through this gauntlet of user experience issues just for the marginal benefits that accrue to a shared form of ID .
I 've read numerous claims that all it will take is for someone big like Google to support OpenID to crack this problem open .
Unfortunately , there 's no business of any size that can afford to direct their traffic down a dead end .
Most service operators will , at best , offer users a choice between using a proprietary ID or an OpenID , creating a terrible economic proposition for a consumer .
Faced with the proposition of : 1 ) struggling once for thirty minutes to struggle through a process they can barely understand , or 2 ) spending two minutes on every new site breezing through a familiar process they 've done countless times before , normal busy people will choose the familiar route time and time again .
I ’ll bet anything that most people will keep going for proprietary IDs , further deferring the network effects possible from OpenID adoption .
This is n't to say that OpenID is n't worth attempts to fix it .
At least some of the above problems can , and should , be addressed head on by the OpenID community .
My recommendations :
Redesign the OpenID home page for consumers .
The page 's main content should contain a brief explanation of OpenID in consumer - friendly terms , along with a giant Get an Open ID button .
Move all the developer material behind a Developers button .
Design an end - to - end process for getting an OpenID from a service operator 's site .
Since most services wo n't care which provider the user uses , let these services send the user into a real flow for picking a provider , getting an ID , and most importantly coming back to the original service to use the new ID .
When they get back to the service , the new OpenID should be prefilled .
Give the above flow a sidebar titled " Do you have a blog ? " that explains that , if they have a blog on LiveJournal , TypePad , etc. , they can use that for their OpenID .
A link in the sidebar should shunt the user into a page that has them pick their blog provider , then tells them what the ( blog service dependent ) form of their OpenID is .
The flow should then return the user to the service they started on ( again , with their OpenID prefilled ) .
Organize the list of providers around factors that can actually influence a user 's decision .
Consider offering provider ratings based on ease of use , uptime , etc .
Refine reference designs for the complex range of cases that come up in using OpenID with a service .
E.g. , define the expected behavior and terminology that should be used when a user tries to log in with an OpenID but does not already have an account with that ID .
Define guarantees that services should offer to users in the event their OpenID provider goes out of business .
Build an organization that can do real usability testing on this service with real consumers .
UPDATE ( October 7 , 2007 ) : This week OpenID . net overhauled their site , and the new site addresses a number of the criticisms listed above .
Hersh : Bush , Cheney ' really want ' Iran war Mike Aivaz and Nick Juliano
Published : Tuesday October 2 , 2007
Save This Page
Print This Email This Investigative journalist Seymour Hersh says that the " only thing " he 's hearing from inside sources is how much President Bush and Vice President Dick Cheney " really want " to go to war with Iran , and the president 's refusal to speak to Iran 's leaders shows how little commitment he has to diplomacy .
" He has no interest in talking to anyone he does n't like , " Hersh said of the president appearing on MSNBC 's Countdown Monday .
" If he would talk to them , I could say to you that there 's some reason we may not go to war , but the only thing you hear from inside is that these guys really want to " attack Iran .
The following video is from MSNBC's Countdown with Keith Olbermann , broadcast on October 1 , 2007 .
( Story continues below )
In his latest article for the New Yorker , Hersh says the administration 's rhetoric towards Iran shifted over the summer , from accusing the rogue regime of harboring nuclear - weapons ambition to blaming it for attacks on US troops in Iraq .
The investigative journalist told host Keith Olbermann that the " new gambit " was deliberate because administration officials believes it can build support among Americans and US allies for a series of surgical strikes aimed at cutting the flow of improvised explosive devices from Iran into Iraq .
Blaming Iran for attacks in Iraq has more to do with laying the groundwork for an invasion than reflecting the realities of weapons supplies in Iraq , though , he said .
" You 'd really think that every problem we have , every IED ... was given to the Iraqis by the Iranians , when in fact Iraq is a cesspool of weaponry , it has been forever , " Hersh said .
Although he 's unaware of any specific order to strike Iran , Hersh said he has no doubt that Bush is laying the groundwork to build support for an attack in the country , as he did leading up to the war in Iraq .
" The bottom line is , it 's real easy , you hear the White House spokeswoman say , ' We 're interested in a diplomatic track , ' " Hersh said .
" Well all he ( Bush ) has to do is start talking to them , and then you get diplomacy .
He 's not talking to them . "
As the president 's term draws to a close , Hersh said he was told that Bush 's and Cheney 's drive for war trumps their loyalty to their party and its future .
" Cheney and Bush do n't give a rats ass about the future of the Republican Party , " Hersh said , " when it comes to this . "

There are now several movies about peak oil that a person can show to audiences who are new to the subject .
But sometimes it would be helpful to have a " canned " PowerPoint presentation , or a set of prepared PDF handouts that you can discuss with newcomers or use for your own talks .
In this post , I link to a short PowerPoint presentation that is intended to be an introduction to newcomers .
I also offer a two - per - page handout version , that may be helpful for one - on - one discussions .
I cannot really show what the presentation looks like in HTML , but I will give the flavor of the content in the post .

The Pentagon was reeling last night from the American military 's second major nuclear weapons blunder in a month .
Congress is demanding a full scale investigation and serious questions are being asked about the competence of the officers in charge of the world 's mightiest arsenal .
The latest outrage came as Commander Michael Portland , the officer in charge of the USS Hampton , the most advanced nuclear attack submarine in the world , was fired after it was discovered that he had neglected to make basic daily safety
checks .
Scroll down for more ...
Last month 70 US airmen were demoted after they lost track of six nuclear - armed cruise missiles and allowed them to be flown halfway across America by a bomber crew that did n't even know they were there .
The Pentagon said that it had lost confidence in Commander Portland 's leadership after checks showed that he had failed to analyse the chemical and radiological properties of the submarine 's nuclear reactor for a month .
It is considered vital that the reactor 's condition be fully examined every day so that any malfunction can be caught early .
If something went wrong with the reactor it could lead to a devastating nuclear accident .
The USS Hampton , currently docked in San Diego , is armed with nuclear torpedoes , nuclear cruise missiles and a massive mine - laying arsenal .
US Navy officials said that it had also been discovered that logs on the USS Hampton had been filled out to make it appear the daily checks of the reactor water had actually been done .
Members of Congress are furious about the latest scandal especially as it follows so closely after the nuclear missile debacle .
In that incident a large US Air Force team failed to remove the nuclear warheads from six cruise missiles being flown by a B - 52 bomber from North Dakota to Louisiana .
It was described as one of the worst known breaches of nuclear weapons procedures ever .
The incident sparked a so - called " Bent Spear " nuclear alert , one step down in military terms from a " Broken Arrow " .
A " Broken Arrow " is triggered if a nuclear missile has been lost or detonated in a way that does not create the risk of nuclear war .
If the B - 52 had crashed there would not have been a nuclear explosion but there could have been major plutonium leakage causing thousands of deaths .
Independent inquires are being launched into both the nuclear missile and the nuclear submarine incidents and Congress is planning hearings into the Pentagon 's nuclear safety procedures .
An investigation is also underway into how the US Army came to accidentally fire a ground to air Patriot missile from a base in the Gulf Arab state of Qatar earlier this month .
The missile landed harmlessly in the desert but it could have brought down any aircraft in the vicinity and it has renewed charges in the Middle East that American soldiers can be trigger - happy and careless .
We noticed that this post from 2007 was trending this morning , obviously because Mr. Nugent decided to grab his crotch during a Trump rally .
Stay Classy , Ted Nugent ! -- eds .
Many
Thanks to Richard Roeper for exposing the wingnut fool known as Ted Nugent for being the coward during the Vietnam war that he was :
So Ted Nugent roams a concert stage while toting automatic weapons , calls Barack Obama " a piece of -----" and says he told Obama to suck on one of his machine - guns .
He also calls Hillary Clinton a " worthless bitch " and Dianne Feinstein a " worthless whore . "
That Nugent , he 's a man 's man .
He talks the talk and walks the walk , right ?
Except when it was time to register for the draft during the Vietnam era .
By his own admission , Nugent stopped all forms of personal hygiene for a month and showed up for his draft board physical in pants caked with his own urine and feces , winning a deferment .
Creative !... read on
When he had a chance to actually arm himself with a machine gun he cowered in his own excrement .
That 's Hannity 's man alright .
And Roeper makes a great point about the Dixie Chicks .
( h/t Peer )
WHAT was it about Bob Taylor ?
He was an unassuming man , steady , phlegmatic , with a thick brush of white hair and a craggy outdoorsman 's face .
He liked a pint , and a dram too , but not when he was working .
He smoked , but not too many .
In his house at the edge of Dechmont Woods near Livingston in West Lothian , where he had worked all his life as a forester , there were very few books .
And certainly there was none that could explain what happened to him on November 9th 1979 , and why his trousers , of thick navy serge like a policeman 's and with useful pockets in the sides , should have ended up in the archives of the British UFO Research Association .
Mr Taylor set off that morning , with his red setter Lara , to check the woods on Dechmont Law for stray sheep and cattle .
It was a damp day and , after he had parked the van and set off down the forest track , even the noise of the Edinburgh - Glasgow motorway was muffled by thick , dark fir trees .
The dog ran , and Mr Taylor 's trudging wellingtons made the only sound .
Then he turned a corner into a clearing filled with light , and saw it .
It was a “ flying dome ” , 20 feet wide , hovering above the grass .
No sound came from the object , and it did not move .
It seemed to be made of grey metal , shiny but rough , like emery paper .
About half - way down it had a circular platform , like the brim of a hat , set with small propellers .
There were darker areas on it that might have been portholes , but the strangest thing was that the dome would be solid one moment , transparent the next , so that Mr Taylor could see the fir trees through it , as if it was trying to camouflage itself .
Both he and the dog stood stock - still with surprise .
But then , suddenly , two smaller spheres dropped out of the dome and came trundling across the grass , one to his right , one to his left .
They were covered in long spikes , like navy mines , that made a ghastly sucking sound as they dug in and out of the mud .
They grabbed his trousers , one on the right leg , one on the left , ripping right through to his winter long johns , and giving off a foul choking smell like burning brakes .
Mr Taylor felt himself being pulled towards the craft ; then he blacked out .
When he came to , the visitors had gone .
So far , so impressive a story to explain a dishevelled homecoming on a Saturday night .
But it was in mid-week and at midday that Mr Taylor crawled home , with the dog but without the van , with a graze on his chin and his trousers torn , covered in mud and with a thumping headache .
His wife called a doctor and the police .
Mr Taylor felt no need for the doctor , and after two days of a wild , craving thirst and the weird brake smell , he felt fine .
But he took the police to the scene .
And there was the evidence .
A large circle and inner “ ladder ” marks , which had flattened the grass but not dented the ground , as if a heavy craft had hovered but not landed .
Forty little round holes , leaving the circle clockwise and anticlockwise , as if spiky “ mines ” had indeed rolled out of it .
But no track entering or leaving the clearing , making the machine 's arrival impossible unless it was a helicopter or something dropped by a mobile crane ; and nothing of that sort had been seen in the area that day or the day before .
Lights over Livingston
The detective sergeant in charge of the case did not believe in space visitors .
Mr Taylor 's boss at the Forestry Department did not believe either , and thought it was probably some secret device being tested by the government .
UFO debunkers thought Mr Taylor might have seen a magnified image of Venus distorted by the earth 's atmosphere , which had made him fall down in an epileptic fit .
The press came ; and by the time the story reached Edinburgh , it was “ small furry creatures ” that had poured from the spacecraft to attack him .
“ I know what I saw , ” said Mr Taylor .
So doughtily and drily did he stick to his tale ( and kept a camera with him ever after , to take the aliens ' pictures if they ever came for him again ) that the police opened a criminal investigation for assault , the only one in Britain to arise from a UFO “ sighting ” .
It remains open .
Mr Taylor 's neighbours proving much more sceptical , he eventually moved away to an undisclosed address .
But he also became the most famous “ witness ” to aliens in Britain .
His trousers were taken to spiritualist meetings to be analysed by psychics ( “ I feel pain from these trousers ” ) , and on anniversaries of the sighting UFO - spotters would gather in the clearing , just on the off - chance .
The aliens , meanwhile , did not give up .
Since that November day they have filled the skies of West Lothian with glimmering discs , strange lights and bouncing balls of fire .
The “ Falkirk Triangle ” now registers more UFO sightings , around 300 a year , than any other spot on Earth .
A good many happen outside the Forge restaurant in Bonnybridge , where fireballs sail over the trees and “ wingless planes ” are seen in the fields .
Some experts say West Lothian may be a “ thin place ” , offering a window from the Earth into another dimension ; others say the sightings are linked to the lack of jobs locally , and cheap liquor .
But some know the aliens are just looking for Bob Taylor , or his dog , or his van , in the place where they last saw him , suddenly amazing them in a clearing among the trees .
Gimme My $ 1.395 Million Back !
I know for a fact that I ’m not going to get my share of Social Security and I do n’t even have a choice whether I want to contribute or not .
But how much will my share be ?
Lets assuming the average person makes $ 50,000 a year for 35 years .
Even though most people start working with they ’re 16 and keep working until they ’re 65 , we ’ll exclude the first 14 years when they may not be making a lot .
We ’ll also ignore the effects of inflation and salary increases to keep the math simple .
Considering that Social Security taxes ( FICA and Medicaid ) are ~ 15 % , ( even if you ’re an employee andd only pay half of that , its a cost to your company that results in a lower salary to you ) that comes out to $ 7,500 per year .
Considering the savings could have been invested in the stock market at 8 % , the total comes to a whopping $ 1,395,766.11 .
But the Government does n’t have enough to pay out the baby boomers through the end of the next decade .
So I ’m sure I ’m not going to get of my Social Security checks in 30 + years .
I think the government should privatize Social Security and create individual accounts for everyone .
Or atleast stop taxing me and let me figure out my own retirement !
To see the opinions of various presidential candiates regarding Social Security , check out this link .
And please vote for Ron Paul if you ’d like the president to be someone who realizes that we ’re bankrupt and the monetary system needs to be fixed .

The Perils of Popularity , or : How Is a Frozen Website Like a Sick Person ?
It is hard to predict , in nearly every pursuit , what will be popular and what will not .
Blog posts are no exception .
Sometimes a blogger posts something that would seem to generate a lot of interest and it fades without a trace ; sometimes you post something that seems like no big deal and , for whatever reason , people care a lot .
The latter case happened here the other day , with a post about libraries .
The post was circulated via Reddit , which , if the wind is blowing just right , can be the equivalent of dropping a match in a dry pine forest .
Indeed , Reddit spread the post so quickly and well that our website was overwhelmed and , for the better part of 24 hours , was inaccessible , even to us .
We could n’t even get onto the site of our hosting service , 1and1.com , to see what was going on .
But that ’s what I learned in retrospect ; at the time , we were baffled .
When I was finally able to access the hosting site yesterday , I found a neat example of how illusory data can be .
Let me explain :
The first graph I looked at showed the number of daily unique visitors ( excluding feed readers ) on Monday and Tuesday of this week .
It was on Tuesday afternoon that we began to have overload problems .
But this graph alone did n’t indicate anything very unusual : there were about 60,000 visitors on Monday and 70,000 on Tuesday .
Next I looked at the hourly traffic for Tuesday .
It , too , looked normal , growing in late morning EDT , peaking at about 3 or 4 p.m. EDT , but overall showing a pretty gentle upward slope and then a gentle downward slope .
Again , if you looked at this graph alone , you would n’t have suspected anything out of the ordinary .
Why ?
I assume it ’s because the nature of the overload meant that some people were getting through , but it took a long , long time .
( I would show you these two graphs I refer to above but , sadly , 1and1 is still not providing full service to us , so I can ’t ; I did , however , download two images that are pasted below . )
But then I looked at the site data for Referrer URL’s — i.e. , where people are on the Internet before they land on our site .
This data usually only reflects about 10 % of our incoming traffic — it does n’t tell you when people come to your site from their own bookmark , for example — but it ’s still helpful .
Here the Referrer data for Monday , which was a normal day :
And here is the Referrer URL data for Tuesday :
Hello , Reddit !
Once you see this picture , the cause of our overload is pretty obvious ; but the first two layers of data I looked at offered no clues as to the nature of the problem — or even the fact that there was a problem .
This tiny and insignificant riddle made me think about how hard it is for a doctor to diagnose a problem in a patient , and why I was so impressed with Jerome Groopman ‘s book How Doctors
Think , which is an exploration of that exact problem .
Apologies to all of you who had a hard time getting onto our site , and apologies also for not posting during our outage .
The good news is that we will soon be making a pretty significant change around here , to be announced in a few weeks , that should ensure against this type of problem in the future .
The European Union wants to have 12 large CO2 capture and storage demonstration projects in place by 2015 , requiring an investment of 5 billion euro .
The expectation is that this development will cause significant cost reductions , making the technology affordable by 2020 .
There are however two large drawbacks , it will keep costing large sums of money and the process is quite energy intensive .
In this post the impact of the extra energy cost of the process on coal depletion is quantified , the economics will follow in a later article .
Capturing carbon dioxide from coal ( and gas ) fired electricity plants .
Subsequently transporting the carbon dioxide from the plant and storing it underground in ( abandoned ) oil / gas fields , in other geological formations or on the ocean floor .
It seems like an excellent solution for continued fossil fuel use in the coming decades .
A short overview of carbon capture and storage
To create a nearly pure stream of carbon dioxide at the power plant for storage there are three distinct possibilities .
Post combustion , in which the mixture of CO2 and flue gases after combustion is separated by using a liquid solvent .
Pre combustion , where the fuel is processed prior to combustion resulting in a mixture of mainly CO2 and hydrogen .
Both gas streams are subsequently separated , so that the hydrogen can be combusted for electricity production and the CO2 for storage .
Oxyfuel combustion , using pure oxygen instead of air when combusting resulting in flue gas that contains mainly water vapour and CO2 .
Both streams can easily be separated and treated further if necessary .
All three processes are already applied in several industries on smaller scales but not for storage purposes .
No attempt has been made to date to capture CO2 at large power plants .
The choice for the system is highly dependent on the type of power plant .
For instance in a gasification coal power plant pre combustion already occurs to a large extent so this option is much cheaper for such a plant .
Most coal power plants built so far do not rely on gasification .
For these post combustion is the best option .
Transport can be done either by pipeline or ship towards a preferred storage site .
A significant amount of depleted oil and gas fields , saline formations ( porous reservoir rocks saturated with brackish water or brine ) and possibly coal seams are well suited for storage .
In addition , carbon dioxide injection into mature oil fields can provide enhanced oil recovery by a process called miscible gas flood .
There are approximately one hundred carbon storage demonstration projects in various scales running at the moment .
Of these only three are of the scale to be somewhat representative for future large scale storage systems of a large power plant .
Weyburn in Canada , an enhanced oil recovery project .
There 3000 to 5000 tons of carbon dioxide have been injected since 2000 in the Weyburn oilfield on a daily basis to produce more oil .
Sleipner in Norway , a saline formation 800 meters below sealevel .
3000 tons of carbon dioxide per day have been injected from the nearby Sleipner West natural gas field since 1996 .
The reason being strict Norwegian carbon dioxide emission taxes of 45 euros per ton of emitted CO2 , making it cheaper to inject than to emit .
In Salah in Algeria , were 3000 to 4000 tons of carbon dioxide have been re-injected per day the In Salah gas field since 2004 .
A coal power plant of 800 megawatt emits around 13700 tons of carbon per day .
The energy costs of carbon capture
Creating a nearly pure carbon dioxide stream at a power plant is unfortunately quite energy intensive .
The energy costs result from several processes .
Firstly the added heat needed to create temperatures of 100 to 140 degrees celsius to regenerate the solvent that captures the CO2 out of the flue gas / CO2 stream .
Secondly the energy to create steam that acts as a stripping gas to remove the CO2 from the solvent .
Thirdly the electricity to operate the flue gas fan and pump the CO2 to its destination were it can be compressed .
Fourthly the energy costs of compression of the CO2 to make it transportable towards it ’s final destination were it can be stored .
Overall such processes raise the energy costs to produce the same amount of electricity in a cleaner way with 24 - 40 % for new ( supercritical ) conventional coal plants using post combustion and 14 % to 25 % for coal based Integrated Gasification Combined Cycle ( IGCC ) systems using pre combustion .
These systems are already initially different , conventional coal plants being more efficient then IGCC systems , which explains some of the difference .
Chart 1 - additional energy costs of carbon capture for different electricity plants , source : IPCC Special Report on Carbon Dioxide Capture and Storage .
To look at the impacts of wide scale application of CO2 capture and storage , the additional energy costs of one “ carbon wedge ” is taken .
The carbon wedge is a concept from the University of Princeton .
Telling us that if we want to stop the current growth path of CO2 emissions , we need to introduce technologies that can counter growth of annual emissions from 7 Gigatons now to 14 Gigatons by 2055 .
If CO2 capture and storage would count for 1 Giga ton of avoided annual emissions by 2055 or one “ wedge ” , this technology needs to be implemented at approximately 855 coal power plants of 1000 megawatts in the coming decades .
This figure of 855 coal plants was derived by the following calculation : A 1000 megawatt coal power plant emits 5.5 Megatons of carbon dioxide per year .
Converting this to carbon emissions ( from CO2 to C ) results in 1.37 Megatons of carbon per year .
CO2 capture and storage efficiency is approximately 85 % , so per power plant around 1.17 Megatons of carbon emissions per year would be reduced .
Dividing 1 Gigatons of emissions by 1.17 Megatons gives 855 coal power plants .
An average 1000 megawatt coal power plant consumes 2,000,000 tons of oil equivalent fuel per year .
Assuming that 25 % more fuel would be needed , the additional fuel would come down to 425 million tons of fuel in oil equivalents per year to implement CO2 storage and capture at 855 coal power plants of 1000 megawatts .
In 2006 coal consumption was 3090 million tons of oil equivalent per year according to the BP Statistical Review .
The effects of increased energy costs on coal depletion
If we process the 425 million tons into coal production forecasts , the effects on available energy from coal become clearer .
For this I have taken the coal production scenario from the German Energy Watch Group ( pdf ) , released a few months ago .
In this scenario peak coal production is expected around 2020 - 2030 with at slow declining slope .
When carbon dioxide capture and storage ( CCS ) is added the peak in energy provided shifts forward five years to 2015 - 2025 .
Furthermore the decline is much faster after the peak .
The effects on more optimistic coal production scenarios would be different , because CCS would be introduced earlier before the peak that is expected later .
That implies that the net energy peak would occur relatively earlier but the net energy slope after the peak will be less sharp .

Facebook is under investigation for failing to protect children from paedophiles on its site , it has been announced .
The hugely - popular but increasingly controversial social networking site has been subpoenaed by New York attorney general Andrew Cuomo after it failed to take action when undercover investigators were solicited for sex while posing as teenagers on the site .
Investigators who set up profiles as 12 to 14 - year - olds found their decoys were quickly contacted by other users seeking sex , Mr Cuomo said .
He also claimed Facebook bosses did not respond to written complaints on several occasions .
" My office is concerned that Facebook 's promise of a safe website is not consistent with its performance in policing its site and responding to complaints , " MrCuomo said .
" Parents have a right to know what their children will encounter on a website that is aggressively marketed as safe . "
No charges have been filed , but Facebook has been ordered to release documents relating to the security promised to its 42 million users and how it resolves complaints .
The attorney general 's office is investigating whether Facebook 's advertising and statements to users are " materially misleading " under state laws that prohibit deceptive business practices , Mr Cuomo said in a letter to Facebook 's founder and chief executive , Mark Zuckerberg .
Facebook spokesman Brandee Barker said the concerns were being taken " very seriously " .
" As our service continues to grow , so does our responsibility to our users to empower them with the tools necessary to communicate efficiently and safely , " he said .
" We strive to uphold our high standards for privacy and are constantly working on processes and technologies that will further improve safety and user control on the site . "
The investigation comes as the Wall Street Journal reports that Microsoft is in talks to buy a stake in Facebook in a deal that could value the networking site at more than £ 5 billion .
The price would justify Mr Zuckerberg 's decision to turn down Yahoo's $ 900 million ( £ 447 million ) offer in September last year to buy the whole company .
Microsoft is said to be willing to pay up to $ 500 million ( £ 248 million ) for a five per cent stake .
The move could spark a bidding war with Google .
Facebook launched in February 2004 and membership was initially restricted to Harvard students before being extended to other Ivy League universities .
Since September last year it has been made available to the general public .

Britsh MPs visiting the Pentagon to discuss America 's stance on Iran and Iraq were shocked to be told by one of President Bush 's senior women officials : " I hate all Iranians . "
And she also accused Britain of " dismantling " the Anglo - US - led coalition in Iraq by pulling troops out of Basra too soon .
The all - party group of MPs say Debra Cagan , Deputy Assistant Secretary for Coalition Affairs to Defence Secretary Robert Gates , made the comments this month .
Scroll down for more ...
The six MPs were taken aback by the hardline approach of the Pentagon and in particular Ms Cagan , one of Mr Bush 's foreign policy advisers .
She made it clear that although the US had no plans to attack Iran , it did not rule out doing so if the Iranians ignored warnings not to develop a nuclear bomb .
It was her tone when they met her on September 11 that shocked them most .
The MPs say that at one point she said : " In any case , I hate all Iranians . "
Although it was an aside , it was not out of keeping with her general demeanour .
" She seemed more keen on saying she did n't like Iranians than that the US had no plans to attack Iran , " said one MP .
" She did say there were no plans for an attack but the tone did not fit the words . "
Another MP said : " I formed the impression that some in America are looking for an excuse to attack Iran .
It was very alarming . "
Tory Stuart Graham , who was on the ten - day trip , would not discuss Ms Cagan but said : " It was very sobering to hear from the horse 's mouth how the US sees the situation . "
Ms Cagan , whose job involves keeping the coalition in Iraq together , also criticised Britain for pulling out troops .
" She said if we leave the south of Iraq , the Iranians will take it over , " said one MP .
Another said : " She is very forceful and some of my colleagues were intimidated by her muscular style . "
The MPs also saw Henry Worcester , Deputy Director of the Office of Iranian Affairs , who said he favoured talks with Iran .
The Pentagon denied Ms Cagan said she " hated " Iranians .
" She does n't speak that way , " said an official .
But when The Mail on Sunday spoke to four of the six MPs , three confirmed privately that she made the remark and one declined to comment .
The other two could not be contacted .
Keep on threadin' .
Or not , since we 're done .
Let 's add the poll .

Three Arab princesses were thrown off a packed British Airways flight after refusing to sit next to male passengers they did n't know .
The dispute - in which the three princesses from the ultra - conservative Qatar royal family demanded segregated seating - left the London - bound plane delayed on a baking Italian runway for nearly three hours .
Furious passengers whistled and clapped as the row intensified before the captain eventually ordered the women to be escorted off the plane .
The princesses , wearing traditional Arab dress , were returning from a day 's shopping in Milan .
They arrived at the city 's Linate airport and boarded Heathrow - bound flight BA 563 , which was due to take off at 4 pm on Thursday .
The women , all relatives of the oil - rich emir of Qatar , Bader Bin Khalifa Al Thani , were booked into business class in a party of eight which included the emir and an entourage of cooks , servants and other staff .
After passengers had fastened their seat - belts and the plane had taxied on to the runway , two male passengers in the entourage got up to protest about where the women were sitting .
According to the customs of Qatar and other Gulf states , women are not allowed to mix with men who are not relatives .
Cabin crew tried to rearrange the seats but passengers travelling together refused to give up their allotted places .
The captain tried to mediate but after more than two and a half hours of wrangling he ordered the bulk of their royal party off the plane .
It is understood that five of the eight - including the princesses and the men who left their seats to protest - were removed .
Police and diplomats from the Qatar consulate in Milan were also called in before the plane eventually took off .
The rest of the Qatar party left Milan later on an Alitalia flight .
A BA spokesman said : " The people were offloaded because they failed to comply with safety instructions when the aircraft was taxiing .
Two passengers stood up and refused to sit down . "
A spokesman at the Qatar embassy in Rome said : " This was a private matter and we have nothing to say . "

Jon Stewart did a follow - up story on Tuesday 's Daily Show concerning the resignation of Karl Rove .
" But before leaving for good -- and I use the term literally , " Stewart began , " last week Rove went on his farewell tour to defend himself and his president . "
Stewart then ran a clip of Fox host Chris Wallace saying , " Let 's take a quick look at some of Karl Rove 's greatest hits . "
" Ooh , I just bought that on K - Tel ! " Stewart exclaimed .
" Karl Rove 's Greatest Hits .
Including ' John McCain's Black Baby , ' ' Max Cleland the One - Limbed Pussy , ' ' The Queers are Coming ! ' and , of course , ' Schiavo A Go Go . '
No need to call now , your phones have already been tapped . "
" No one could accuse Rove of being a one - scandal wonder , " Stewart continued .
" The man 's back catalog is deep .
I mean , who could forget the fired US Attorney scandal ? "
" Why did you push to to fire some US Attorneys in the president 's second term , " Chris Wallace asked Rove on Fox News Sunday .
" Nice try , Chris , " answered Rove . "
" Oh , he 's good , " said Stewart , admiringly .
" Obviously foremost in Karl Rove 's mind , " Stewart concluded , " [ is ] serving his country , protecting national security .
Which makes you wonder about that whole outing a CIA spy to journalists thing . "
" I do n't recall Mr. Cooper 's conversation , " Rove told Wallace in response to a question about him revealing to Matt Cooper of Time that Ambassador Joseph Wilson 's wife worked for the CIA .
" Once again the administration 's memory herpes strikes , " Stewart commented .
" But a half hour later , Matt Cooper seemed to have a better memory for the conversation . "
" I think he was dissembling , to put it charitably , " Cooper told Meet the Press .
" To put it uncharitably -- ly-ing , " noted Stewart .
" He 's a fib blossom , if you will . "
The following video is from Comedy Central 's The Daily Show , broadcast on August 21 .
Assuming that they have even tuned in to this interminable presidential campaign , many Americans just caught a glimpse of a Rudolph W. Giuliani long known to New Yorkers .
Note that we said a Rudolph Giuliani .
There are several versions of the former mayor .
Understandably , he prefers to project the ones that would get any politician dreaming about a spot on Mount Rushmore : Rudy the clear - thinking , Rudy the principled , Rudy the focused , Rudy the unswerving ( never mind his recent swivels to the right on issues like immigration , gun control and abortion ) .
New Yorkers are well acquainted with at least one other version .
That would be Rudy the loopy .
The weirdness factor , as some have called it , is as much a part of the Giuliani package as 9/11 , banished squeegee men and shuttered porn parlors .
Non-New Yorkers got a taste of it the other day when Mr. Giuliani interrupted his speech — a very important speech — to the National Rifle Association in Washington .
His cellphone rang .
It was his wife , Judith .
Smack in the middle of his talk , he whipped out the phone .
Democrats pack in their antiwar charade
By Bill Van Auken
19 September 2007
Little more than 10 months after winning the leadership of both houses of the US Congress thanks to a swelling tide of opposition to the war in Iraq , the Democratic Party has largely abandoned even the pretense of a struggle to bring the war to an end .
This climb - down comes in the wake of last week ’s congressional testimony by the senior US commander in Iraq , Gen. David Petraeus , and the American ambassador to Baghdad , Ryan Crocker , defending the current surge , followed by President Bush ’s speech affirming that the beefed - up deployments will continue until next summer , when troop strength will return to the previous 130,000 level and remain there until after he leaves office in 2009 .
In response , the Democratic leadership has signaled its intention to put off any consideration or debate on the administration ’s request for another round of war funding , believed to amount to an additional $ 200 billion .
The White House is expected to submit the request for the money this week , demanding that it be passed by October 1 , the start of the new federal budget year .
The delay will have no impact upon the funding of the war .
While the administration ’s supplemental request is put in abeyance , the Democratic congressional leadership will move ahead with the drafting of a half - trillion - dollar annual Defense Authorization Act , providing the basic budget for the American military .
This measure , which covers arms procurement , payrolls , training and other routine costs of maintaining Washington ’s gargantuan military machine , will include a provision allowing the Pentagon to transfer money between different accounts , thereby providing a backdoor means of continuing to pay for the war and occupation in Iraq .
Democratic leaders in Congress have portrayed the decision to delay any debate on the next round of war funding as a tactical maneuver aimed at lining up more Republican support for an alternative policy in Iraq .
As the Associated Press reported , the move is designed to give the Democrats “ time to calculate their next move and see if Republican support for [ Bush ’s ] policies deteriorates . ”
It added that Democrats acknowledged the delay would provide “ breathing space to a party divided on what to do next . ”
In the meantime , the abortive proposals for withdrawal timetables floated last spring — in the run-up to Congress ’s approval of $ 100 billion to finance the surge — have been placed in mothballs .
Instead , the Democratic leadership is shifting to proposals that only months ago it had rejected as being too conciliatory towards the administration .
The debate has been ceded to the so - called “ centrists ” within the party who are seeking to craft legislation acceptable to Republicans that would continue the occupation indefinitely , albeit on a somewhat altered basis .
Thus Democratic Senators Ken Salazar of Colorado , Ben Nelson of Nebraska and Max Baucus of Montana , together with Maine Republican Senator Olympia Snowe , having returned from a weekend junket to Iraq , indicated that they would try to craft legislation that would keep US forces in Iraq , but shift them from combat operations to “ counterterrorism , ” the training of Iraqi puppet forces , and the protection of US interests .
“ A complete withdrawal would leave chaos in that region and I think would spell problems for us in the future , ” Senator Nelson told the New York Times .
Another major focus of the Democratic - led debate is a proposal drafted by Democratic Senator Jim Webb of Virginia that would require the Pentagon to grant troops deployed to Iraq equal amounts of time at their home bases .
Such a rotation would compel the military to make a modest reduction in the Iraqi deployment levels , unless additional National Guard or Reserve units were called up or the military draft reinstated .
A vote on the measure is expected this week .
Meanwhile , Senator Carl Levin of Michigan , the Democratic chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee , has announced a significant retreat from legislation he advanced last July calling for the withdrawal of all US “ combat troops ” to begin within 120 days and be completed by April 2008 .
Levin indicated Monday that he is prepared to join Republicans in backing a measure that would propose withdrawing such troops within nine months , setting this timeframe as a desired goal rather than a legislative mandate .
Under both proposals , tens of thousands of “ non-combat ” troops would remain in Iraq maintaining the occupation and continuing to kill and die in the struggle to suppress Iraqi resistance .
In the House , Democratic representatives John Tanner of Tennessee and Neil Abercrombie of Hawaii have put forward a patently toothless proposal that merely would require Bush to report to Congress on the administration ’s process of planning for a withdrawal .
It would not mandate a withdrawal , or even set any requirements for completing such a plan .
What this retreat makes clear is that the Democratic leadership is altering its position in tandem with the campaign launched by the White House with the orchestrated testimony of Petraeus and Crocker and the stand pat position enunciated by Bush .
This shift stands in stark contrast to popular sentiment , which is even more deeply opposed to the war today than at the time of the midterm elections last November .
Indeed , the latest polls conducted in the wake of the administration ’s propaganda campaign show that attitudes towards the war were virtually unmoved by the efforts of Bush and Petraeus .
A poll released Tuesday by the Pew Research Center again showed a clear majority — 54 percent — supporting the withdrawal of US troops .
A separate survey published by CBS News the day before found 68 percent wanted to see troops withdrawn entirely or drastically reduced .
This poll also showed less than one third — 30 percent — believe that the surge of 30,000 additional US troops into Iraq has registered any success , with the overwhelming majority saying that either it has had no impact or has made matters worse .
Thus , the turn by the Democratic leadership cannot be attributed to any fear of losing votes due to a shift in public opinion .
Nor can it be explained — as the media consistently attempts to do — by some kind of parliamentary arithmetic , based on the possibilities of gaining the 60 votes needed to preclude a filibuster or the 67 required to override a presidential veto .
From the very first day it took over the reins of Congress , the Democratic Party has consistently renounced the only two genuine means at its disposal to end the war .
The first is a vote to cut off funding , which can be achieved through a simple majority vote .
The Democratic leadership has consistently rejected this course on the phony pretext that it must “ support the troops ” — by approving the money that keeps them in Iraq to be killed and maimed .
The second is impeachment of the president and vice president for dragging the country into a criminal war based upon lies , something that Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid and House Speaker Nancy Pelosi announced was “ off the table ” from the outset .
The charade staged by the Democrats — posturing as opponents of the war while foreswearing any action that could actually end it — was for all intents and purposes shut down last July when Levin ’s initial amendment to the Defense Authorization
Act setting the April 2008 deadline for a partial withdrawal failed to win the 60 votes needed to forestall a filibuster .
At that point , the Pentagon funding measure was pulled from the legislative calendar and all debate suspended until after the scheduled report to Congress by Petraeus and Crocker .
Now that this report — hyped by both major parties and the media as some kind of “ turning point ” in Iraq — has come and gone , it is clear that the Democratic Party not only has no intention of waging a struggle to stop the war and end the occupation in Iraq , but has determined that even the pretense of opposing the war must be sharply curtailed .
In the end , the bitter differences that erupted over the debacle in Iraq were of an entirely tactical character .
All the talk of troop withdrawals , when one strips away the rhetoric , boils down to whether the US occupation will continue with 130,000 troops or whether this force will be scaled down to somewhere between 50,000 and 100,000 .
The decision to tone down the debate over this issue is driven by the consensus within the ruling elite as a whole that the stakes in Iraq for American capitalism are too high to abandon the project launched with the invasion of March 2003 .
Both parties fear that acknowledging defeat in Iraq would undermine the position of US imperialism internationally and encourage revolutionary movements all over the world .
Whatever their differences over military tactics , the role of diplomacy and who should pay the political price for the failures suffered in Iraq , Democrats and Republicans are agreed that the US must utilize its military might to offset its economic decline by establishing US hegemony over the strategic energy resources of the Persian Gulf .
Indeed , a persistent theme in Democratic criticism of the administration ’s policy is the conception that US military resources are tied down in Iraq when they may soon be needed for a new war against Iran .
Moreover , with the 2008 presidential elections little more than a year away , the Democratic leadership recognizes that it stands a good chance of taking control of the White House and assuming responsibility for the Iraqi occupation .
Given such a victory , promoting unrealistic popular expectations poses real dangers .
Finally , there is a bipartisan fear that under conditions of a deepening crisis of the political system as a whole and the growing threat of a major downturn in the world economy , encouraging the deep - going popular hatred of the war runs the risk of unleashing social forces that cannot be controlled .
It is necessary to draw the political lessons of the Democratic Party ’s trajectory since the November 2006 election .
The conception that the struggle against war can be waged by pressuring the Democrats to take action has proven entirely false and bankrupt .
Both major parties and all the existing political institutions function to disenfranchise the antiwar majority .
They represent not the interests of working people — the vast majority of the population — but those of a narrow financial elite whose wealth and power are bound up with militarism .
The fight to end the war in Iraq and prevent the launching of even more horrific military adventures can be advanced only by launching a new independent political movement of working people against war and the system that creates it .
Such a movement , independent of the Democrats and armed with a socialist and internationalist program , must be built to carry out the struggle for the immediate and unconditional withdrawal of all US troops from Iraq and for holding accountable all those responsible for this war .
NEW YORK ( CNNMoney.com ) -- Microsoft Corp. announced Wednesday that it is investing $ 240 million for a minority 1.6 percent stake in Facebook , a price that values the social networking site at $ 15 billion .
Under the terms of the agreement , Microsoft will be the exclusive advertising platform for Facebook .
Microsoft already had an agreement to sell ads in the U.S. and as part of the new deal will also now sell ads internationally .
" Making this investment and expanding this partnership will position Microsoft and Facebook to better take advantage of advertising opportunities around the world , " said Kevin Johnson , president of the Platforms & Services Division at Microsoft , in a prepared statement .
The agreement comes after intense competition between Microsoft ( Charts , Fortune 500 ) and Google ( Charts , Fortune 500 ) for the stake in Facebook .
Last year , Facebook rejected a $ 1 billion takeover offer from Yahoo Inc ( Charts , Fortune 500 ) .
Microsoft 's money should be more than enough to pay for Facebook 's ambitious expansion plans until the privately held company goes public .
Facebook founder , Mark Zuckerberg , 23 , has indicated he would like to hold off on an initial public offering for at least two more years .
In the meantime , Facebook hopes to become an advertising magnet by substantially increasing its current audience of nearly 50 million active users .
The Facebook investment represents a coup for Microsoft because it provides the world 's largest software maker with a toehold on one of the Internet 's hottest platforms and a potentially lucrative forum for selling online ads .
Redmond , Wash .- based Microsoft has been trying to become a bigger force in Internet advertising for several years , only to watch Google deepen its dominance of the space .
In its fiscal year ending in June , Microsoft 's online ad revenue rose 21 percent to $ 1.84 billion .
Over the same period , Google 's ad revenue totaled $ 13.3 billion .
With the Facebook investment , Microsoft dealt a rare setback to Google , which had previously trumped its bitter rival in earlier bidding battles involving AOL and Internet ad service DoubleClick Inc .
The coup shows Microsoft is getting more savvy about the Internet , said Matt Rosoff , an analyst for the research group Directions on Microsoft .
" I think they understand it now and they 're proceeding correctly .
Two years ago , I would have said they do n't get it at all . "
Tim Armstrong , who oversees Google 's North American advertising , declined to comment on the Facebook negotiations during a meeting with analysts Wednesday at the company 's Mountain View headquarters .
" We have tremendous respect for them , " Armstrong said of Facebook .
Although News Corp.'s ( Charts , Fortune 500 ) MySpace.com remains the largest social network , Facebook has been growing at a far more rapid clip during the past year .
Facebook attracted 30.6 million U.S. visitors during September compared with 68.4 million at MySpace .
Microsoft 's social networking equivalent -- called " Windows Live Spaces " -- attracted an audience of 9.8 million , according to comScore Inc .
Also on Wednesday , BlackBerry maker Research in Motion Ltd ( Charts ) .
announced it has launched software that will make it easier for Facebook users to use the popular social networking site .
The site has already been available through the BlackBerry 's Web browser , but the new software will allow BlackBerry users to automatically receive Facebook messages like they receive e-mail on the BlackBerry .
RIM said users will be able to wirelessly send and view Facebook photos , pokes and Wall posts .
T- Mobile USA will be the first carrier to provide the new application to its customers , as a free download .
The carrier already provides a program that connects to a competing social network , MySpace , on some of its handsets .

AS CALIFORNIA is to the United States , so British Columbia is to Canada .
Both are about as far south - west as you can go on their respective mainlands .
Both have high - tech aspirations .
And , although the Fraser Valley does not yet have quite the cachet of Silicon Valley , it may be about to steal a march on its southern neighbour .
For , on February 13th , D - Wave Systems , a firm based in Burnaby , near Vancouver , announced the existence of the world 's first practical quantum computer .
On paper at least , quantum computers promise to reduce dramatically the time needed to solve a range of mathematical tasks known as NP - complete problems .
One famous example is the travelling salesman problem — finding the shortest route between several cities .
This is a puzzle that increases exponentially in complexity with the number of cities considered .
The reason is that every possible permutation needs to be looked at in order to find the best .
Quantum computers provide a neat shortcut to solving such problems .
They do so by encoding all possible permutations in the form of a small number of “ qubits ” .
In a normal computer , bits of digital information are either 0 or 1 .
In a quantum computer these normal bits are replaced by a “ superposition ” ( the qubit ) of both 0 and 1 that is unique to the ambiguous world of quantum mechanics .
Qubits have already been created in the laboratory using photons ( the particles of which light is composed ) , ions and certain sorts of atomic nuclei .
By a process known as entanglement , two qubits can encode four different values simultaneously ( 00 , 01 , 10 and 11 ) .
Four qubits can represent 16 values , and so on .
That means huge calculations can be done using a manageable number of qubits .
In principle , by putting a set of entangled qubits into a suitably tuned magnetic field , the optimal solution to a given NP - complete problem can be found in one shot .
The end of the beginning
D - Wave Systems chose two very practical problems to demonstrate its 16 - qubit processor , which it has called Orion .
One was a pattern - matching application for searching through a database of molecules — the sort of task that a drug company looking for the key to a particular molecular lock in a disease - causing protein might want to do routinely .
The other was a scheduling application for assigning people to seats , subject to certain constraints .
Airlines might be interested in that one .
The catch is that Orion is not exactly desktop friendly .
It has to sit in a bath of liquid helium cooled to just a fraction of a degree above absolute zero ( - 273 °C ) in order to work .
This is because it relies on a superconducting device called a Josephson junction to produce the qubits , in the form of specially tweaked electrons that are stable only at such low temperatures .
Impractical as this may sound , Geordie Rose , D - Wave 's founder , is optimistic that it is the best way forward for quantum computing .
Other techniques involve huge lumps of machinery , but Josephson junctions can be made using the sort of microfabrication technology employed for normal silicon chips .
This means there is a realistic prospect of integrating quantum computers with conventional ones .
Dr Rose favours this route , because he sees quantum computers as specialised accelerators for certain tasks , rather than stand - alone number crunchers .
Shrink - wrapped quantum computers labelled “ Orion inside ” are not , therefore , about to start shipping anytime soon .
Quantum computing will be strictly mainframe for the foreseeable future .
Nevertheless Dr Rose plans later this year to provide free , remote access to an Orion processor so that potential customers can try running their problems on it and evaluate its performance .
Whether D - Wave will do for southern British Columbia what Fairchild Semiconductor — the firm that made the first commercial integrated circuits — did for central California 50 years ago remains to be seen .
The aspiration , however , was betrayed by D - Wave 's choice of the Computer History Museum in Mountain View , near Fairchild 's original home , to demonstrate Orion 's potential .
Come back in half a century to find out what happened .
I ’ve been reading the fascinating work of Paul Slovic , a psychologist who runs the social - science think tank Decision Research .
He studies a troubling paradox in human empathy :
We ’ll usually race to help a single stranger in dire straits , while ignoring huge numbers of people in precisely the same plight .
We ’ll donate thousands of dollars to bring a single African war orphan to the US for lifesaving surgery , but we do n’t offer much money or political pressure to stop widespread genocides in Rwanda or Darfur .
You could argue that we ’re simply callous , or hypocrites .
But Slovic does n’t think so .
The problem is n’t a moral failing :
It ’s a cognitive one .
We ’re very good at processing the plight of tiny groups of people but horrible at conceptualizing the suffering of large ones .
In one recent experiment , Slovic presented subjects with a picture of “ Rokia , ” a starving child in Mali , and asked them how much they ’d be willing to give to help feed her .
Then he showed a different group photos of two Malinese children — “ Rokia and Moussa . ”
The group presented with two kids gave 15 percent less than those shown just one child .
In a related experiment , people were asked to donate money to help a dying child .
When a second set of subjects was asked to donate to a group of eight children dying of the same cause , the average donation was 50 percent lower .
Slovic suspects this stuff is hardwired .
Psychologists have long observed that our ability to discriminate among quantities is finely tuned when dealing with small amounts but quickly degrades as the numbers get larger .
Our ears work that way , too .
When a very quiet sound becomes slightly louder , we detect the difference right away .
But once a noise is really loud , it has to increase dramatically for it to seem “ louder . ”
The same holds true for our judgments of weight and , of course , less tangible quantities like money .
We ’ll break the bank to save Baby Jessica , but when half of Africa is dying , we ’re buying iPhones .
Which brings me back to Gates .
The guy is practically a social cripple , and at times he has seemed to lack human empathy .
But he ’s also a geek , and geeks are incredibly good at thinking concretely about giant numbers .
Their imagination can scale up and down the powers of 10 — mega , giga , tera , peta — because their jobs demand it .
So maybe that ’s why he is able to truly understand mass disease in Africa .
We look at the huge numbers and go numb .
Gates looks at them and runs the moral algorithm : Preventable death = bad ; preventable death x 1 million people = 1 million times as bad .
We tend to think that the way to address disease and death is to have more empathy .
But maybe that ’s precisely wrong .
Perhaps we should avoid leaders who “ feel your pain , ” because their feelings will crap out at , you know , eight people .
What we need are more Bill Gateses — people with Aspergian focus , with a direct sensual ability to understand what a million means .
They ’ve got to be able to envision every angel on the head of a pin .
Because when it comes to stopping the mass tragedies of today ’s world , we ’re going to need every one of them .
With the news out of Britain that one month earlier than predicted , Facebook has overtaken MySpace , with more UK unique users in August ( 6.5 million ) than MySpace ( 6.4 million ) , it will be interesting to see how the battle for a chunk of FaceBook transpires over the next few weeks .
Right now Big , bad , fucking Microsoft is in discussions about acquiring a 5 % stake in the company , which has a valuation of about $ 10 billion .
Standing in the wings is the 800 pound gorilla with really fucking bad breath ...
Google , which is very interested in grabbing a share of the fast rising social networking site .
Either way , founder Mark Zuckerberg looks set to pocket a huge amount of money if a bidding war starts up .
Perhaps he can use some of that to fight off a law suit from a college mate , who claims Zuckerberg stole the original idea for FaceBook from him when they were both at Harvard .
You just can't trust these rich kid wankers !

WASHINGTON --
On the cusp of the two - year anniversary of Hurricane Katrina , Senator Barack Obama , Democrat of Illinois , will present a plan today aimed at hastening the rebuilding of New Orleans and restructuring how the federal government responds to future catastrophes in America .
The Gulf Coast restoration , said Obama , a candidate in the Democratic presidential primary , has been weighed down by red tape that has kept billions of dollars from reaching Louisiana communities .
As president , he said , he would streamline the bureaucracy , strengthen law enforcement to curb a rise in crime , and immediately close the Mississippi River Gulf Outlet to restore wetlands to protect against storms .
Obama also said that he would seek to lessen the influence of politics in the Federal Emergency Management Agency by giving its director a fixed term , similar to the structure of the FBI .
Under Obama 's plan , the FEMA director would serve a six - year term and report directly to the president .
Obama and several presidential hopefuls are scheduled to arrive in Louisiana this week to highlight how New Orleans has -- and has not -- recovered from Hurricane Katrina .
Democrats have sought to use the city as an example of what they believe was among the Bush administration 's greatest domestic failures .
John Edwards , the former North Carolina senator who announced his presidential candidacy in the city 's devastated Lower 9th Ward , is set to return to New Orleans tomorrow and to appear with Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton of New York at a summit dedicated to rebuilding the Gulf Coast .
For Democrats and Republicans alike , a plan for New Orleans is a new element of the 2008 campaign .
NEW YORK TIMES
A study in contrasts
MANCHESTER , N.H. --
A Democratic president would raise taxes and ravage the economy , GOP hopeful candidate Rudy Giuliani said yesterday .
The former New York City mayor said he would lower taxes , make permanent President Bush 's tax cuts , and eliminate inheritance taxes .
" The Democrats believe in government when they have a choice .
Republicans believe in people when we have a choice .
. . .
The Republican Party is the party of the people .
The Democratic Party is the party of the government , " Giuliani said at a town hall meeting .
He appeared with former presidential candidate Steve Forbes , who is a campaign adviser , and former Massachusetts governor Paul Cellucci .
Democrats took issue with Giuliani 's approach .
" Rudy Giuliani and the rest of the Republican candidates seem to be the last people in America who think the voters are looking for more of the same failed Bush agenda , " said Damien LaVera , a spokesman for the Democratic National Committee .

Edwards pushes fair trade
PLYMOUTH , N.H. --
With intensity that matched the heat , Democratic presidential hopeful John Edwards continued his scorching criticism of special interests yesterday , telling voters his trade policies would work for them , not big corporations .
As temperatures hit the upper 90s , the former senator wondered jokingly whether he actually was in his home state of North Carolina before turning serious .
" The question that has been asked as we negotiate our international trade deals has been : ' Is this good for the profits of big multinational corporations ? '
That 's the wrong question , " he said outside an elementary school .
" The question should be : ' Is this trade agreement good for working middle - class Americans ? ' "
Edwards said he will insist that the nation 's trade partners meet strict labor and environmental standards and will enact regulations barring other countries from manipulating their currencies .
" And we 're going to close down these tax loopholes that actually give incentives to take jobs and go overseas .
This is crazy , " he said .
In response to an audience question later , Edwards said those measures would help reduce the nation 's debt to China .
He said he also would push to enforce existing laws that require goods to be labeled with their country of origin , encourage people to buy locally and give the government more authority to inspect products and food from elsewhere .
Three days into a four - day bus trip of the state , Edwards has been framing his campaign as a fight against the lobbyists and other " Washington insiders " he argues stand between Americans and change .
After his brief remarks on trade policy , he took questions , often bringing the subject back to his universal health care policy .

We found the following email in our mailbox the other day .
Apparently it ’s been making the rounds on the Chinese - language internet :
花都芙蓉璋水库，每年都有好几个人莫明溺水死亡。到最近有个高官的子弟与朋友一起到水库游水溺死亡，才发现惊天秘密！
Each year , a few people will be drowned mysteriously in Huadu ’s Furong Reservoir .
It was not until recently when the brother of a certain official went swimming in the reservoir with his friend and were drowned that the secret was unravelled !
竟然是一条有三米多长，头有一米多宽的吃人唐蚤！宰割唐蚤后，惊人的发现：在其肚中竟然有人的骸骨！
It ’s a 3 metre long man-eating catfish whose head alone is 1 metre wide !
After cutting up the catfish people were surprised to find the remains of a man inside !
由于事件影响大，当地政府怕影响当地的旅游，下令封锁消息，但却有现场的人用手机偷拍的到捕获的吃人鱼！
Because this was a huge incident , and the local government was afraid of the impact on local tourism , they imposed an embargo on the news , but people came away with these pictures taken on their cell phones of the man-eating fish !
现在水库已经严禁有人下水，为恐会有另一条同类的唐蚤鱼在水中！
Swimming in the reservoir is now forbidden because it is feared another similar man-eating catfish is still lurking in the waters .
Now we ’re not experts on aquatic life and can’t confirm to you if that is really some mutant form of the clarius batrachus ( walking catfish ) as the email suggested ( where are the whiskers ? ) , but some netizens have already raised doubts saying this is a whale shark ( 鲸鲨 ) instead .
Now you decide for yourself :
Does it look more like the walking catfish or the whale shark ?
And if it is the whale shark , which is “ vulnerable to extinction ” according to Wikipedia , why did they kill it ?
Well , perhaps because they thought it killed a bunch of people .
But how did they find it , and catch it , and why did they kill it and chop it up in such a public manner , we wonder ?
We bet scientists would have liked to see this alive first ( we imagine saltwater whale sharks do n’t pop up in freshwater reservoirs too often … nor , we guess , do 30 cm catfish regularly turn into three - meter mutants ) .
But wait .
The Huadu government has also made a statement to dissociate itself from the post , saying that the contents of the post do not match the photos .
Also , no sighting of any large man-eating fish has been reported , and that no deaths have occurred in the reservoir between 25 July of last year and now .
As we have been accused of doing so in the past , we might choose to side with the government on this one .
Seems very likely that these are pics of a random whale shark killing that a prankster decided to spread around masked as the Huadu Reservoir man-eating monster .
It would seem the prank was a success .
But you never know … especially in Chinese waters .
Swim at your own risk .
More pictures after the jump .
See for yourself the remains of a human body inside the monster !?!
Or maybe not .
( We are , if you have n’t guessed , skeptical . )

The President 's Address to the Nation , January 10 , 2007 :
" I 've made it clear to the Prime Minister and Iraq 's other leaders that America 's commitment is not open - ended .
If the Iraqi government does not follow through on its promises , it will lose the support of the American people -- and it will lose the support of the Iraqi people .
Now is the time to act .
The Prime Minister understands this .
Here is what he told his people just last week : " The Baghdad security plan will not provide a safe haven for any outlaws , regardless of [ their ] sectarian or political affiliation . " (...)
A successful strategy for Iraq goes beyond military operations .
Ordinary Iraqi citizens must see that military operations are accompanied by visible improvements in their neighborhoods and communities .
So America will hold the Iraqi government to the benchmarks it has announced . "
Background Briefing by Senior Administration Officials , January 10 , 2007 :
" We have made very clear that the Iraqi government needs to meet the benchmarks it has set in order to do the things on which a broader reconciliation are required .
And you all know them .
They 're the oil law ; they 're de-Baathification , narrowing the limitations of the de-Baathification law ; they 're provincial elections to bring the Sunnis back into the political process at the local level .
There is also continuing , and we would hope even accelerating the transition of security responsibility to Iraqis elsewhere in the country and in Baghdad , because if this works it will actually enable Iraqis sooner to provide security in Baghdad .
And we have -- would like , and the Iraqis have made clear that one of their benchmarks is to take responsibility for security in the whole country by the end of the year . (...)
They have set forward this plan .
They have brought forward these benchmarks .
And what the President is saying is , fine , we will judge you now less on your words and more on your performance . "
Today , after news that the GAO will report that Iraq has failed to meet its benchmarks :
" An internal White House memorandum , prepared to respond to the GAO findings , says the report will claim the Iraqis have failed on at least 13 benchmarks .
It also says the criteria lawmakers set for the report allow no room to report progress , only absolute success or failure .
The memo argues that the GAO will not present a " true picture " of the situation in Iraq because the standards were " designed to lock in failure , " according to portions of the document read to the AP by an official who has seen it . "
And :
" At the White House , officials argued that the GAO report , which was required by legislation President Bush signed last spring , was unrealistic because it assigned " pass or fail " grades to each benchmark , rather than assessing whether the Iraqis have made progress toward reaching the benchmark goals .
" A bar was set so high , that it was almost not to be able to be met , " White House deputy press secretary Dana Perino said . "

Poker is like real life .
You have to make decisions on the basis of imperfect knowledge and you often have to bluff in order to achieve your goals .
One might think that computers cannot do these things , or at least do these things as well as humans can .
On July 23 and 24 , we might find out whether this is the case .
On July 23 and 24 , the poker - playing - computer named Polaris , built by the AI computer scientists at University of Alberta , will play Texas Hold ’em against Phil ( aka the Unabomber ) Laak and Ali Eslami for $ 5000 .
What is especially interesting about this match is that it has been designed to eliminate luck as a factor .
How do the scientists plan to eliminate luck as a factor ?
In one room Polaris will play Laak and in another room Polaris will play Eslami .
Polaris will get Laak ’s cards when playing Eslami and will get Eslami ’s cards when playing Laak .
If Polaris wins the poker match , this will have interesting philosophical implications .
Particularly , it will remove another barrier from seeing that computers could think .
Computer science has already shown that computers can “ go beyond ” what their programmers programmed them to do , when in 1997 Deep Blue , the IBM chess - playing computer defeated world champion Gary Kasparov .
The fact that Deep Blue beat Gary Kasparov ( Kasparov complained that Deep Blue cheated ) did not show that a computer can produce new knowledge .
Rather , Deep Blue ’s analysis of the game showed this , because it showed that certain endgames that always had been considered draws by humans were in fact wins .
If scientists can make computers that can come up with new knowledge , that can make good decisions on imperfect knowledge , that can misrepresent their knowledge , then they are one step closer to making a thinking mind .
Dawn breaks in this new depiction of Spaceport America in New Mexico , the future home of Virgin Galactic 's suborbital spaceliner fleet .
GOLDEN , Colorado --
Architectural and engineering teams have begun shaping the look andfeel of New Mexico ?s Spaceport America , taking the wraps off new images today thatshowcase the curb appeal of the sprawling main terminal and hangar at the futuristicfacility .
Last month , a team of U.S. and British architects and designers had been recommended foraward to design the primary terminal and hangar facility at SpaceportAmerica ?
structures that symbolize the world ?s first purpose - built commercialspaceport .
Selectedfrom an international field of eleven firms , the winning design is the work ofURS Corporation ?
a large design and engineering enterprise ?
teamed with Foster + Partners of the United Kingdom , a group with extensive experience in craftingairport buildings .
When the 100,000 square - foot ( 9,290 square - meter ) facility is completed -- the centerpiece ofthe world ?s first , purpose - built , commercial spaceport -- the structures willserve as the primary operating base for Sir Richard Branson ? s VirginGalactic suborbital spaceliner , and also as the headquarters for the NewMexico Spaceport Authority .
The terminal and hangarfacility will also provide room for aircraft and spacecraft , and VirginGalactic ?s operations facilities , including pre-flight and post - flightfacilities , administrative offices , and lounges .
The spacious maintenancehangar can hold two White Knight Two carrier aircraft and five SpaceShipTwospaceliners ?
vessels now underconstruction at Scaled Composites in Mojave , California .
Destinationexperience
The terminal and hangarfacility are projected to cost about $ 31 million , and will provide a ?
Destination Experience ? for visitors to Spaceport America .
Virgin Galacticintends to sign a 20 - year lease for approximately 84,000 square feet ( 7,803 square meters ) in the building .
? TheURS / Foster team presented us with a concept that blends sensitivity to theenvironment , cutting - edge technology and a stunning image and shape when viewedfrom high above , ?
noted Kelly O?Donnell , chair of the New Mexico SpaceportAuthority in a press statement last month .
The design chosen is alow - lying , striking bit of construction that uses natural earth as a berm , andrelies on passive energy for heating and cooling , with photovoltaic panels forelectricity and water recycling capabilities .
A rolling concrete shell acts asa roof with massive windows opening to a view of the runway and spacecraft .
According to a pressstatement released today , the low - lying , organic shape resembles a rise in thelandscape , and will use local materials and regional construction techniques .
? A careful balance betweenaccessibility and privacy is achieved , as visitors and astronauts enter thebuilding through a deep channel cut in the landscape , " the statement noted .
"
The walls will form an exhibition area leading to a galleried level abovethe hangar that houses the spacecraft and on through to the terminal building .
Natural light enters via skylights , with a glazed fa ? ade reserved for the terminalbuilding , establishing a platform for spectacular views onto the runway .?
Construction on the 100,000 square - foot hangar and terminal facility is scheduled to begin in 2008 .
Environmentallyefficient landmark
Renderings ofthe main terminal and hangar facility were to be unveiled today during a pressconference held at the Pan American Center on the New Mexico State Universitycampus in Las Cruces , New Mexico .
Announcements regarding the winning team anddesign selected were held up due to the tragic Mojave , California Air and SpacePort accident on July 26 , in which a test stand explosion killed three Scaled employeesduring a routine test .
Company founderof Foster +
Partners , Lord Norman Foster , said in an earlier press comment thatthe world ?s first space terminal would be a technically complex building .
Thefacility not only will provide a dramatic experience for the astronauts andvisitors , ? but will set an ecologically sound model for future spaceportfacilities , ?
he added .
Jens Deichmann , vicepresident of URS Corporation , accented their group ?s involvement : ?
Our team ofNew Mexico , regional , and international talent is excited to help the State ofNew Mexico and Virgin Galactic advance their goals of commercial space traveland scientific and engineering education . "
The NewMexico Spaceport Authority ( NMSA ) is currently finalizing contract negotiationswith URS and Foster +
Partners .
The team will then begin working with the NMSAand Virgin Galactic to finalize the design of the facility , and the NMSAexpects to put the construction of the facility out for bids in the first half of2008 .
Constructionof Spaceport America would begin in 2008 , given a Federal Aviation Administrationissuing of a site operator ?s license to the NMSA .
Completion is expected inlate 2009 or early 2010 .

On Linux kernel programming mailing lists oriented toward new developers ( see the on- line Resources ) , a number of common questions are asked .
Almost every time one of these questions is asked , the response always is , “ Do n't do that ! ” , leaving the bewildered questioner wondering what kind of strange development community they have stumbled into .
This is the first in an occasional series of articles that attempts to explain why it generally is not a good idea to do these kinds of things .
Then , in order to make up for the chastising , we break all of the rules and show you exactly how to do them anyway .
Read a File
The most common question asked in this do n't - do - that category is , “ How do I read a file from within my kernel module ? ”
Most new kernel developers are coming from user - space programming environments or other operating systems where reading a file is a natural and essential part of bringing configuration information into a program .
From within the Linux kernel , however , reading data out of a file for configuration information is considered to be forbidden .
This is due to a vast array of different problems that could result if a developer tries to do this .
The most common problem is interpreting the data .
Writing a file interpreter from within the kernel is a process ripe for problems , and any errors in that interpreter can cause devastating crashes .
Also , any errors in the interpreter could cause buffer overflows .
These might allow unprivileged users to take over a machine or get access to protected data , such as password files .
Trying to protect the kernel from dumb programming errors is not the most important reason for not allowing drivers to read files .
The biggest issue is policy .
Linux kernel programmers try to flee from the word policy as fast as they can .
They almost never want to force the kernel to force a policy on to user space that can possibly be avoided .
Having a module read a file from a filesystem at a specific location forces the policy of the location of that file to be set .
If a Linux distributor decides the easiest way to handle all configuration files for the system is to place them in the / var / black / hole / of / configs , this kernel module has to be modified to support this change .
This is unacceptable to the Linux kernel community .
Another big issue with trying to read a file from within the kernel is trying to figure out exactly where the file is .
Linux supports filesystem namespaces , which allow every process to contain its own view of the filesystem .
This allows some programs to see only portions of the entire filesystem , while others see the filesystem in different locations .
This is a powerful feature , and trying to determine that your module lives in the proper filesystem namespace is an impossible task .
If these big issues are not enough , the final problem of how to get the configuration into the kernel is also a policy decision .
By forcing the kernel module to read a file every time , the author is forcing that decision .
However , some distributions might decide it is better to store system configurations in a local database and have helper programs funnel that data into the kernel at the proper time .
Or , they might want to connect to an external machine in some manner to determine the proper configuration at that moment .
Whatever method the user decides to employ to store configuration data , by forcing it to be in a specific file , he or she is forcing that policy decision on the user , which is a bad idea .
But How Do I Configure
Things ?
After finally understanding the Linux kernel programmer 's aversion to policy decisions and thinking that those idealists are out of their mind , you still are left with the real problem of how to get configuration data into a kernel module .
How can this be done without incurring the wrath of an angry e-mail flame war ?
A common way of sending data to a specific kernel module is to use a char device and the ioctl system call .
This allows the author to send almost any kind of data to the kernel , with the user - space program sending the data at the proper time in the initialization process .
The ioctl command , however , has been determined to have a lot of nasty side affects , and creating new ioctls in the kernel generally is frowned on .
Also , trying properly to handle a 32 - bit user - space program making an ioctl call into a 64 - bit kernel and converting all of the data types in the correct manner is a horrible task to undertake .
Because ioctls are not allowed , the / proc filesystem can be used to get configuration data into the kernel .
By writing data to a file in the filesystem created by the kernel module , the kernel module has direct access to it .
Recently , though , the proc filesystem has been clamped down on by the kernel developers , as it was horribly abused by programmers over time to contain almost any type of data .
Slowly this filesystem is being cleaned up to contain only process information , such as the names of filesystem states .
For a more structured filesystem , the sysfs filesystem provides a way for any device and any driver to create files to which configuration data may be sent .

See previous articles in this column for how to create and use sysfs files within a kernel module .
I Want to Do This Anyway Now that you understand the reasoning behind forbidding the ability to read a file from a kernel module , you of course can skip the rest of this article .
It does not concern you , as you are off busily converting your kernel module to use sysfs .
Still here ?
Okay , so you still want to know how to read a file from a kernel module , and no amount of persuading can convince you otherwise .
You promise never to try to do this in code that will be submitted for inclusion into the main kernel tree and that I never described how to do this , right ?
Actually , reading a file is quite simple , once one minor issue is resolved .
A number of the kernel system calls are exported for module use ; these system calls start with sys_ .
So , for the read system call , the function sys_read should be used .
The common approach to reading a file is to try code that looks like the following : fd = sys_open ( filename , O_RDONLY , 0 ) ; if ( fd >= 0 ) { /* read the file here */ sys_close ( fd ) ; } However , when this is tried within a kernel module , the sys_open ( ) call usually returns the error - EFAULT .
This causes the author to post the question to a mailing list , which elicits the “ do n't read a file from the kernel ” response described above .
The main thing the author forgot to take into consideration is the kernel expects the pointer passed to the sys_open ( ) function call to be coming from user space .
So , it makes a check of the pointer to verify it is in the proper address space in order to try to convert it to a kernel pointer that the rest of the kernel can use .
So , when we are trying to pass a kernel pointer to the function , the error - EFAULT occurs .
Fixing the Address Space
To handle this address space mismatch , use the functions get_fs ( ) and set_fs ( ) .
These functions modify the current process address limits to whatever the caller wants .
In the case of sys_open ( ) , we want to tell the kernel that pointers from within the kernel address space are safe , so we call : set_fs ( KERNEL_DS ) ;
The only two valid options for the set_fs ( ) function are KERNEL_DS and USER_DS , roughly standing for kernel data segment and user data segment , respectively .
To determine what the current address limits are before modifying them , call the get_fs ( ) function .
Then , when the kernel module is done abusing the kernel API , it can restore the proper address limits .
So , with this knowledge , the proper way to write the above code snippet is : old_fs = get_fs ( ) ; set_fs ( KERNEL_DS ) ; fd = sys_open ( filename , O_RDONLY , 0 ) ; if ( fd >= 0 ) { /* read the file here */ sys_close ( fd ) ; } set_fs ( old_fs ) ;
An example of an entire module that reads the file /etc / shadow and dumps it out to the kernel system log , proving that this can be a dangerous thing to do , can be seen below : # include < linux / kernel.h > # include < linux / init.h > # include < linux / module.h > # include < linux / syscalls .h> # include < linux / fcntl.h > # include < asm/uaccess.h> static void read_file ( char * filename ) { int fd ; char buf [ 1 ] ; mm_segment_t old_fs = get_fs ( ) ; set_fs ( KERNEL_DS ) ; fd = sys_open ( filename , O_RDONLY , 0 ) ; if ( fd >= 0 ) { printk ( KERN_DEBUG ) ; while ( sys_read ( fd , buf , 1 ) == 1 ) printk ( " %c " , buf [ 0 ] ) ; printk ( "
" ) ; sys_close ( fd ) ; } set_fs ( old_fs ) ; } static int __init init( void ) { read_file ( " / etc/shadow " ) ; return 0 ; } static void __exit exit( void ) { } MODULE_LICENSE ( " GPL " ) ; module_init ( init ) ; module_exit( exit ) ;
But What about Writing ?
Now , armed with this newfound knowledge of how to abuse the kernel system call API and annoy a kernel programmer at the drop of a hat , you really can push your luck and write to a file from within the kernel .
Fire up your favorite editor , and pound out something like the following : old_fs = get_fs ( ) ; set_fs ( KERNEL_DS ) ; fd = sys_open ( filename , O_WRONLY|O_CREAT , 0644 ) ; if ( fd >= 0 ) { sys_write ( data , strlen ( data ) ; sys_close ( fd ) ; } set_fs ( old_fs ) ;
The code seems to build properly , with no compile time warnings , but when you try to load the module , you get this odd error : insmod : error inserting ' evil.ko ' : - 1
Unknown symbol in module
This means that a symbol your module is trying to use has not been exported and is not available in the kernel .
By looking at the kernel log , you can determine what symbol that is : evil : Unknown symbol sys_write
So , even though the function sys_write is present in the syscalls.h header file , it is not exported for use in a kernel module .
Actually , on three different platforms this symbol is exported , but who really uses a parisc architecture anyway ?
To work around this , we need to take advantage of the kernel functions that are available to kernel modules .
By reading the code of how the sys_write function is implemented , the lack of the exported symbol can be thwarted .
The following kernel module shows how this can be done by not using the sys_write call : # include < linux / kernel.h > # include < linux / init.h > # include < linux / module.h > # include < linux / syscalls .h> # include < linux / file.h > # include < linux / fs.h > # include < linux / fcntl.h > # include < asm/uaccess.h> static void write_file ( char * filename , char * data ) { struct file * file ; loff_t pos = 0 ; int fd ; mm_segment_t old_fs = get_fs ( ) ; set_fs ( KERNEL_DS ) ; fd = sys_open ( filename , O_WRONLY|O_CREAT , 0644 ) ; if ( fd >= 0 ) { sys_write ( fd , data , strlen ( data ) ) ; file = fget ( fd ) ; if ( file ) { vfs_write ( file , data , strlen ( data ) , & pos ) ; fput ( file ) ; } sys_close ( fd ) ; } set_fs ( old_fs ) ; } static int __init init( void ) { write_file ( " / tmp/test " , " Evil file .
" ) ; return 0 ; } static void __exit exit( void ) { } MODULE_LICENSE ( " GPL " ) ; module_init ( init ) ; module_exit( exit ) ;
As you can see , by using the functions fget , fput and vfs_write , we can implement our own sys_write functionality .

Back in the mists of time , straight after my doctorate , I worked for a UK start - up called Madge Networks initially maintaining device drivers that implemented LLC , NetBIOS , IPX / SPX protocols and then writing a TCP / IP stack .
Most of this work was done in C and assembler ( x86 and TMS380 ) .
When I first joined the company I was sent on an x86 assembly training course run by QA Training .
( It rained on the first day and we were locked out so one of the company big cheeses ran over with QA Training umbrellas ; to this day I use that umbrella ) .
During the course we were asked to write a simple function in C .
I 've forgotten what it was , but let 's say it was a classic factorial function .
I wrote something like : Later we looked at an assembly equivalent of the function , but before that I took at look at the person sitting next to me .
His function looked like this :
So , naturally I asked him why he used such horrible names for functions and variables .
It turned out that he worked for a government department and all identifiers were allocated and documented before the code was written .
Hence , somewhere a document would tell you that aq456 was a factorial function with excruciating detail of its parameters and return values .
And also you could discover that aq457 was the parameter for aq456 .
He recounted how each project had a unique two letter code ( he 'd chosen aq as being qa backwards ) followed by a sequence number .
He 'd chosen aq because all the projects had worked on were aa , ab , ac , ... the department had apparently never got past 26 projects .
I wonder why ?

An article in Newsweek about the struggle between evolution and creationism got me thinking about the recent post on religion and liberalism .
Day before yesterday I wrote about how liberalism seeks to promote domestic tranquility and individual freedom by drawing lines between the personal and the public .
To quote John McGowan :
Here I just want to end by noting how â€œunnaturalâ€ liberalism seems .
It involves self - abnegation , accepting the frustration of my will .
It involves , as I will detail in my next post , compromise in almost every instance , and thus can seem akin to having no strong convictions , no principles .
Yet its benefits are enormous ; it provides , I am convinced , the only possible way humans can live in peace together in a pluralistic world .
…
… Because liberalism aims to insure peace and prevent tyranny in pluralistic societies , it often works to establish zones of mutual indifference .
Liberalism strives to place lots of individual actions outside the pale of politics , beyond interference from the state or other powers .
And , culturally , it strives to promote tolerance , where tolerance is , at a minimum , indifference to the choices and actions of others and , at best , a recognition that diversity yields some social benefits …. …
Except for what are generally weak claims for the benefits of diversity ( weak not in the sense of being unconvincing , but weak in the sense that no very major social benefit is claimed and some costs are acknowledged ) , the liberal argument for non-political interference , for privacy and individual autonomy , is primarily negative .
Conflict is the result of trying to tell people what to believe and what to do , so we are better off cultivating a talent for resisting our inclinations to insist that others see the world and run their lives the way I do .
Ironically , anti-liberal forces in America use the values of liberalism against liberalism .
For example , creationism is argued to be an alternative view to evolution that is owed respect .
Peter Slevin wrote in the Washington Post ( March 14 , 2005 ) ( emphasis added ) :
Alabama and Georgia legislators recently introduced bills to allow teachers to challenge evolutionary theory in the classroom .
Ohio , Minnesota , New Mexico and Ohio have approved new rules allowing that .
And a school board member in a Tennessee county wants stickers pasted on textbooks that say evolution remains unproven .
… …
Polls show that a large majority of Americans believe God alone created man or had a guiding hand .
Advocates invoke the First Amendment and say the current campaigns are partly about respect for those beliefs .
“ It ’s an academic freedom proposal .
What we would like to foment is a civil discussion about science .
That falls right down the middle of the fairway of American pluralism , ” said the Discovery Institute ’s Stephen C. Meyer , who believes evolution alone cannot explain life ’s unfurling .
“ We are interested in seeing that spread state by state across the country . ” …
… That approach appeals to Cindy Duckett , a Wichita mother who believes public school leaves many religious children feeling shut out .
Teaching doubts about evolution , she said , is “ more inclusive .
I think the more options , the better . ”
“ If students only have one thing to consider , one option , that ’s really more brainwashing , ” said Duckett , who sent her children to Christian schools because of her frustration .
Students should be exposed to the Big Bang , evolution , intelligent design “ and , beyond that , any other belief that a kid in class has .
It should all be okay . ”
Fox — pastor of the largest Southern Baptist church in the Midwest , drawing 6,000 worshipers a week to his Wichita church — said the compromise is an important tactic .
“ The strategy this time is not to go for the whole enchilada .
We ’re trying to be a little more subtle , ” he said . …
… ” If you believe God created that baby , it makes it a whole lot harder to get rid of that baby , ” [ Southern Baptist minister Terry ]
Fox said .
“ If you can cause enough doubt on evolution , liberalism will die . ”
See , science is supposed to “ compromise ” with religion , because to deny religion equal say with science violates the liberal values of “ inclusiveness ” and “ freedom . ”
And the goal is to destroy liberalism .
Of course , if the creationists had the authority they ’d see to it that only their version of creation is taught in public schools , because they are n’t liberals .
Here ’s the latest round in the evolution wars , by Sharon Begley in the current issue of Newsweek :
There may be some battlefields where the gospel ’s “ blessed are the peacemakers ” holds true .
But despite the work of a growing number of scholars and millions of dollars in foundation funding to find harmony between science and faith , evolution still is n’t one of them .
Just ask biologist Richard Colling .
A professor at Olivet Nazarene University in Illinois and a lifelong member of the evangelical Church of the Nazarene , Colling wrote a 2004 book called “ Random Designer ” becauseâ € ” as he said in a letter to students and colleagues this yearâ € ” ” I want you to know the truth that God is bigger , far more profound and vastly more creative than you may have known . ”
Moreover , he said , God “ cares enough about creation to harness even the forces of [ Darwinian ] randomness . ”
For all the good it ’s done him , Colling might as well have thrown a book party for Christopher Hitchens ( “ God Is Not Great ” ) and Richard Dawkins ( “ The God Delusion ” ) .
Anger over his work had been building for two years .
When classes resumed in late August , things finally came to a head .
Colling is prohibited from teaching the general biology class , a version of which he had taught since 1991 , and college president John Bowling has banned professors from assigning his book .
At least one local Nazarene church called for Colling to be fired and threatened to withhold financial support from the college .
In a letter to Bowling , ministers in Caro , Mo. , expressed “ deep concern regarding the teaching of evolutionary theory as a scientifically proven fact , ” calling it “ a philosophy that is godless , contrary to scripture and scientifically unverifiable . ”
Irate parents , pastors and others complained to Bowling , while a meeting between church leaders and Colling “ led to some tension and misunderstanding , ” Bowling said in a letter to trustees .
( Well , “ misunderstanding ” in the sense that the Noachian flood was a little puddle . )
It ’s a rude awakening to scientists who thought the Galilean gulf was closing .
So much for compromise .
Colling ’s troubles come as more and more researchers are fighting the “ godless ” rap , emphasizing that evolution does not preclude a deity ( though neither does it require one ) .
Science does n’t have anything to apologize for .
It ’s the creationists and their “ intelligent design ” allies who dissemble and lie and misrepresent evolution and science in their war against liberalism .
I think it ’s a mistake for science to attempt “ compromise ” with the religionists ( and I doubt many scientists are thinking about doing so ) , because it would n’t be an honest compromise .
Creationism / ID “ theory ” is not only based on lies ; it has the intention of undermining science .
Same thing for liberalism , which does not require giving in anti-liberal factions in the name of “ inclusiveness . ”
As John Holbo wrote , ( h/t Dan S ) :
I would also like to request a moratorium on critiques of liberalism that consist entirely of a flourish for effect â€ “ with accompanying air of discovery â€ “ of the familiar consideration that liberalism is inconsistent with blanket , categorical tolerance of absolutely every possible act and attitude .
That is , liberalism is incompatible , in practice , with any form of illiberalism that destroys liberalism .
If something is inconsistent with liberalism , it is inconsistent with liberalism .
Yes .
Quite .
We noticed .
Also , it might not be a half - bad idea to notice that liberalism is not incompatible with religion , merely with illiberal forms of religion .
Just as liberalism is incompatible with illiberal forms of secularism .
Exactly .
We should all print that on our T - shirts .
It is not “ inclusive ” to allow propagandists to hijack science classes .
It is not “ academic freedom ” to lie to children to confuse them .
Do n’t forget that this controversy is not between religion and science .
It ’s between a faction of religious totalitarians and modern civilization .
We do not have to tolerate them , compromise with them , or humor them .
They must be utterly resisted in the public sphere .
And this resistance is not a betrayal of liberal values , but a defense of liberal values .
Here is the line drawn between the personal and the public :
That minority among the religious who find evolution incompatible with their beliefs are perfectly free to make up their own minds who and what to believe .
They can disregard science , if they wish .
They can do what Professor Richard Colling did and find their own middle ground .
They can even build creationist “ museums ” with their own money .
But they have no right to demand their views be respected as science , nor may they impose their views on children through public schools .
Science does n’t owe anything to religion , or anyone else , except to be honest , ethical and diligent about the practice of science .
However , neither does religion have to justify itself to science .
But that ’ll have to be the topic of another post .

DENVER - A 20 - year government effort to restore the population of an endangered native trout in Colorado has made little progress because biologists have been stocking some of the waterways with the wrong fish , a new study says .
Biologists called the finding a setback and a potential black eye but said there is still hope for restoring the greenback cutthroat trout because at least four pure populations of the fish have been identified .
The three - year study was led by University of Colorado researchers and published online in Molecular Ecology on Aug. 28 .
The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service , which is heading the recovery effort , said it is reviewing the findings .
The study said that out of nine populations of fish believed to be endangered greenback cutthroat trout that were descendants of survivors , five were actually the Colorado River cutthroat trout , which look similar but are a separate and more common subspecies .
The other four populations were greenbacks .
The recovery effort by Colorado and federal biologists was thought to be close to its goal of 20 self - sustaining populations of at least 500 fish each .
Bruce Rosenlund of the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service in Denver said federal and state agencies working on restoration believed the fish were found in 142 miles of waterways , including in Rocky Mountain National Park .
Researchers , though , said that based on genetic test results , the greenback cutthroat trout 's range is only 11 miles of streams .
The study said the results imply that the effort has " failed to improve the species ' status . "
Rosenlund said other scientists will read and comment on the research .
He said biologists working on restoring the greenback trout want to see " the science played out . "
" The report is just a continuation of different expert input provided to the team for consideration for restoration , " said Rosenlund , the project leader for the agency 's assistance office .
State and federal biologists will continue with other key parts of the recovery program , such as habitat restoration .

SEPTEMBER 11--A black West Virginia woman was sexually assaulted , stabbed , and tortured while being held captive by her white abductors , one of whom told her , " That 's what we do to niggers around here . "
The 23 - year - old victim was freed Saturday after cops responded to the home of Frankie Brewster for a " welfare check on a female that was reportedly being held against her will . "
When cops arrived , Brewster claimed she was the only one home , but then the victim limped to the door and said , " Help me . "
According to six harrowing criminal complaints , the woman , who apparently had been held for more than a week , had four stab wounds in her left leg , bruised eyes , and had been repeatedly sexually assaulted and humiliated .
The woman told police that she was forced to lick Brewster 's " toes , vagina , and anal cavity . "
Brewster 's son Bobby forced the woman to eat dog and rat feces , according to one complaint filed in Logan County Magistrate Court .
The victim , who is now hospitalized , was raped at knifepoint , choked with a cable cord , and had her hair pulled and cut during the ordeal .
Police , who have arrested six defendants for their roles in the abduction and attack , are looking for other suspects who may have lured the victim to Brewster 's home .
The arrestees are seen in these mug shots .

Damage to undersea Internet cables hit business across the Middle East and South Asia on Thursday , including the vital call centre industry , prompting calls for people to limit their surfing .
Around 70 percent of Internet users in Egypt have been affected since two submarine cables in the Mediterranean Sea were damaged on Wednesday , also rupturing connections thousands of kilometres ( miles ) away .
The cause of the damage is not yet known .
State - owned Saudi Telecom reported the loss of more than 50 percent of its international lines , and said it did not know when normal service would be restored , the Arab News reported .
Egypt ’s telecommunications ministry said repairs would take “ at least a week ” and appealed for users not to overload the backup system with hefty downloads and file - sharing applications .
“ Two of our cables are affected ; everyone will go onto a third cable , ” ministry spokesman Mohammed Taymur told AFP .
“ But that will not be enough bandwidth .
The cable will be overloaded and no one will be able to get access . ”
“ People should know how to use the Internet because people who download music and films are going to affect businesses who have more important things to do . ”
Taymur said a company had been asked to repair the cables but that “ for the time being we do n’t know the cause .
The two cables are a kilometre ( over half a mile ) apart and we do n’t know what could have affected both at the same time . ”
Like India , Egypt has a major call centre industry which has been affected by the outage , with a telecommunications ministry statement saying productivity was down to 30 percent .
The statement named other affected Arab countries as Saudi Arabia , the United Arab Emirates , Yemen , Qatar and Bahrain .
Egyptian blogger
The Arabist said he would “ resume posting after the problem is resolved ” and predicted , with a hint of sarcasm , “ complete social breakdown in vast swathes of ( upmarket Cairo districts ) Heliopolis and Mohandiseen as thousands are unable to update their Facebook status . ”
Bahrain ’s Batelco issued a statement appealing for people to limit use to browsing and email but to refrain from file - sharing applications which require more bandwidth .
Gas -rich Qatar said that less than 40 percent of its Internet services were affected but that international phone lines were functioning normally .
The Al - Raya daily quoted one of national operator QTel ’s directors as saying that repairs in the Mediterranean could take up to two weeks .
In Muscat , OmanTel issued a statement saying it had reestablished 76 percent of Internet services by Thursday .
In Kuwait , the government said “ weather conditions and maritime traffic ” had damaged two cables , affecting most of the region .
India ’s Internet - dependent outsourcing industry was also severely disrupted , with businesses saying it may take up to 15 days to return to normal .
“ Information - technology companies , software companies and call centres that provide online services to the UK or the US East Coast are the worst affected , ” said Rajesh Chharia , president of the Internet Service Providers ’ Association of India .
India ’s 11 billion dollar outsourcing industry employs 700,000 people working for companies that deliver services ranging from answering customer queries to to analysing equity markets for global clients .
The industry serves clients mainly in the US and Europe that sought to cut costs by farming out work to the country .
Neighbouring Bangladesh was also hit , with an official from the state Telegraph and Telephone Board saying that “ voice and data traffic bound for Europe and America is not working .
It slowed down the Internet services in the country . ”
Another Bangladesh provider , BDCom , said it was running at a quarter of its usual capacity .
“ Our operations have slowed down .
All the ISPs and call centres have also experienced similar problems , ” said Sabbir Ahmed Suman , BDCom director and a senior member of the Bangladesh Internet Service Providers Association .
Sri Lanka also faced a drastic drop in service quality , according to Sri Lanka Telecom , the country ’s largest Internet service provider .

( CNN ) -- A New Orleans grand jury that declined to indict a doctor on charges that she murdered patients in the chaotic days after Hurricane Katrina never heard testimony from five medical experts brought in by the state to analyze the deaths .
Memorial Medical Center had to be evacuated after floodwaters flowed through New Orleans in 2005 .
All five concluded that as many as nine patients were victims of homicide .
In detailed , written statements , the five specialists -- whose expertise includes forensic medicine , medical ethics and palliative care -- determined that patients at Memorial Medical Center had been deliberately killed with overdoses of drugs after Katrina struck New Orleans in 2005 .
The grand jury had been asked to consider second - degree murder charges against a doctor and two nurses in four deaths .
But in July , the grand jury decided that no one should be indicted .
A grand jury is charged with determining whether there is sufficient evidence to indict a defendant and pursue a trial .
The grand jury 's proceedings are held in secret , and grand jurors and officers of the court are typically prohibited from divulging what goes on in grand jury sessions .
In a decision that puzzled the five experts hired by the state , New Orleans District Attorney Eddie Jordan never called them to testify before the grand jury .
What remains unclear , because of grand jury secrecy laws , is whether the grand jury even saw the experts ' written reports .
Watch one expert say he does n't think the grand jury saw his report »
" They were n't interested in presenting those facts to the grand jury , " said Dr. Cyril Wecht , the former coroner of Allegheny County , Pennsylvania , and a past president of the American Academy of Forensic Scientists .
" The hard scientific facts are those from five leading experts , [ the patients died ] from massive lethal doses of morphine and Versed .
As far as I know the toxicological findings were not presented to the grand jury and certainly not with quantitative analysis . "
Deplorable conditions at medical center
While the grand jury considered charges in four hospital patients ' deaths , the medical experts ' reports reveal that investigators believed as many as nine patients were victims of homicide .
The documents were released after CNN filed a public records request .
The probe into the deaths of patients at Memorial Medical Center began after witnesses alleged that seriously ill , mostly elderly patients had been euthanized by medical staff as floodwaters rose around Memorial and conditions inside the building became nearly intolerable .
Those originally arrested in the investigation have denied any wrongdoing , and their lawyers have said they should be applauded for staying with patients as conditions inside the hospital worsened .
One of the physicians absolved in the proceedings , Dr. Anna Pou , described post - Katrina conditions at the hospital as " less than Third World . "
Hospital staff went into " reverse triage , " in which the sickest patients would be treated last , Pou told Newsweek in an article published Saturday .
In the interview , she acknowledges sedating the sickest patients -- not to kill them , she said , but to alleviate their pain until medical personnel could treat them properly .
' I think a lot of people are perplexed '
Louisiana Attorney General Charles Foti also questions why Jordan did not call the five experts before the grand jury .
Foti's office conducted the investigation before turning over the evidence to Jordan .
" We 're perplexed .
I think a lot of people are perplexed , " Kris Wartelle , a spokeswoman for Foti , said .
" Those victims ' loved ones are asking what happened .
They want to know what happened .
I think our concern has always been and always will be about them .
Nine people died , according to one of the experts , in a three - hour period ; one of the experts called that beyond coincidence , " she said .
Arthur Caplan , the chair of the Department of Medical Ethics and director of the Center for Bioethics at the University of Pennsylvania , said it 's inconceivable that the case is not going to go to trial .
" I was never called to the grand jury , " said Caplan .
" As far as I know , the grand jury never saw my reports .
As far as I know , none of the reports prepared by these experts , who looked at all the cases , who were independent , and came to the conclusion that massive amounts of drugs were used as the cause of death and that they could n't have been requested [ by the patients ] , they had to be given involuntarily .
That 's evidence that I think a grand jury would want to be familiar with before it made its decision as to whether or not to proceed with an indictment .
" Now you can still get into a dispute about the evidence , " Caplan added .
" You can get into a dispute about the circumstances and all the rest of it , but at face value there is no other conclusion I think that 's possible , other than these people -- or someone -- killed them . "
District attorney says insufficient evidence
Last year , Foti ordered the arrests of Pou and two nurses , Lori Budo and Cheri Landry , on preliminary charges of second - degree murder in the deaths of four of the patients .
Jordan -- who under Louisiana law was responsible for presenting the case to the grand jury -- gave Budo and Landry immunity , in effect ending the state case against them , in exchange for their testimony .
Jordan has refused repeated requests for an interview to discuss his actions in the case .
Last week , he sent an e-mail in response to a question about why he had not called the five experts to testify .
" It is inappropriate to disclose what the grand jury did or did not consider , " said the e-mail .
" The Orleans Parish grand jury concluded that there was insufficient evidence to indict Dr. Poe ( sic ) on any violations of criminal law . "
But all five forensic specialists believe the medical evidence warranted a trial .
All five said that the medical charts , toxicology and autopsy reports they reviewed indicate that deliberate overdoses the pain killer morphine and the sedative Versed led to the deaths of the nine patients .
" The primary and immediate cause of death for each of these patients was acute combined drug toxicity , specifically morphine and Versed , " wrote Wecht .
" The manner of death would be classified as homicide . "
" Large doses of these drugs were present in patients and the administration of the drug was not documented , " wrote James Young , the former chief coroner of the province of Ontario , Canada , who , like Wecht , once served as president of the American Academy of Forensic Sciences .
" Accidental overdoses would need to have occurred nine times between 12 noon and 3:30 p.m. , all on one floor , to every patient who was left on the floor , " Young wrote . " Again , it is noted that morphine was not ordered for seven of the patients and Versed was not ordered for any .
Therefore it seems highly unlikely that nine patients died on the same floor on the same afternoon of accidental overdose . "
Caplan wrote that there was no evidence any patient asked to be given assistance in dying , and no evidence that any consented to be given an overdose of medication to end their lives .
" In reviewing the facts and opinions , my conclusion is that the deaths of the nine persons at Memorial Medical Center in New Orleans are all cases of active euthanasia , " Caplan wrote .
" Each person died with massive doses of narcotic drugs in their bodies . "
Dr. Frank Brescia , a Charleston , South Carolina , doctor specializing in palliative care , wrote that the patients were very ill and the deteriorating conditions in a hospital without air conditioning , electricity and running water contributed to the patients ' declining health .
Still , he wrote , those conditions did not kill them .
Brescia wrote , " I feel that the manner of death in these individuals , especially in four cases , obligates the legal process to consider them as homicides . "
In fact , Brescia wrote in his report that the medical charts showed the patients were " stable , without an immediate or obvious threat of dying . "
Dr. Michael Baden , a forensic pathologist from New York , also concluded that all nine patients died from drug overdoses .
" It is further my opinion that the circumstances surrounding these simultaneous deaths mandate a homicidal manner of death , " Baden wrote .
Wecht was the first expert hired by Foti on the recommendation of New Orleans Parish Coroner Frank Minyard .
When Jordan took over the case , he ordered Minyard to hire additional experts .
Caplan was asked to review the work of Baden , Brescia , Wecht and Young .
Report : Decision made to administer lethal doses
In its executive summary report included with the forensic experts ' findings , the attorney general 's office paints a chilling picture of what its investigators say happened four days after the hurricane hit New Orleans .
The summary cites a number of people -- whose names are blacked out in the report -- as having offered statements through their attorneys and having sought immunity from prosecution .
The summary states that Pou told the nurse executive of Lifecare , the acute care facility on the seventh floor of the hospital that housed the nine patients , that " a decision had been made to administer lethal doses of morphine to Lifecare patients . "
According to the report , none of the nine was a patient of Pou 's and there was no indication she had talked to their doctors before seeing them on the day they died .
The attorney general 's report also said that other medical personnel told Pou that one of the patients , Emmett Everett Sr. , was conscious and alert .
Everett was 61 years old , weighed almost 400 pounds and was confined to a wheelchair .
" Dr. Pou decided ( patient name blacked out ) could not be evacuated .
He could not be taken out by boat because he was not ambulatory and Dr. Pou felt he was too heavy to be evacuated by helicopter , " according to the report .
In a written statement , Pou 's lawyer denied that the combination of morphine and Versed is a " lethal cocktail . "
In addition , Rick Simmons said Pou 's own expert said it is well - known among scientists that blood levels of morphine are " greatly increased " in patients who have been dead for many days .
Read Dr. Pou 's response to attorney general ( pdf )
Pou does not deny giving the patients drugs .
In the days following Hurricane Katrina , floodwaters ran freely through the sweltering , pitch - black hospital , carrying human waste through its corridors , Pou told Newsweek .
Patients were moaning and crying in the halls ; some were being fanned with slats of cardboard , others cooled off with dirty water and ice .
Treatment was being administered under flashlights ,
Pou told the magazine .
" What you have to do when resources are limited , you have to save the people you know that you can save .
And not everybody is going to survive those kind of conditions .
And we knew that , " Pou told Newsweek .
The patients on the seventh floor were among the sickest in the hospital , Pou said .
Pou administered painkillers and sedatives " to help the patients that were having pain and sedate the patients who were anxious , " she acknowledged .
" Basically what we 're trying to do is help the patients .
Let me tell you -- God strike me dead -- what we were trying to do was help the patients , " she told Newsweek .
" Any medicines given were for comfort .
If in doing so it hastened their deaths , then that 's what happened .
But this was not , ' I 'm going to go to the seventh floor and murder some people . '
We 're here to help patients . "
John DiGiulio , attorney for Landry , one of the nurses originally targeted by the state investigation , said he was n't privy to the grand jury testimony .
" But , " he said , " I do n't think any information was withheld from the grand jury . "
DiGiulio said of his client and the circumstances in the hospital : " [ The patients ] were either dead or dying in the early days of Katrina .
[ Landry ] was there to assist in giving comfort and care to the dying . "
Eddie Castaing , attorney for Budo , the other nurse , said the state 's experts ' comments do n't mean anything .
" The grand jury made its ruling of no true bill so it 's not relevant , " Castaing said , adding that he has no concerns about these documents .
" We could get 10 experts to say it 's not homicide , " he said .
" It means nothing . "
Brescia , one of the five medical experts , said the fate of Everett troubled him the most .
" This one case sort of stands out to you and says to you , ' Gee , I 'm not sure what happened , ' " Brescia said .
" And that 's what I said , this particular case , if you want to use the word suspicious or unclear or whatever word you want to use , I 'm not sure why this patient is dead . "
Family conducts its own investigation , says mom was poisoned
Family members of another one of the patients , Elaine Nelson , hired their own forensic expert to explore why the 90 - year - old woman died .
The report alarmed her son , Craig , a New Orleans lawyer .
" It showed that Mom had received on September 1 eight milligrams of morphine , which was four times the amount that she was prescribed by her doctor , and which was a lethal amount that was certainly enough to kill her , " Nelson said .
Nelson said neither he nor his sister Kathy , a registered nurse who was with their mother after Katrina until guards ordered her to leave the hospital , were called before the grand jury .
Their forensic expert was n't called either .
Nelson has filed a lawsuit against the hospital owner and others .
He said he refused a settlement offer because he wants the truth to come out , especially now that Jordan has closed the case .
Nelson said he is disappointed in the way the grand jury was conducted .
" I think they'd want to hear as much evidence as possible to make a well - informed decision , " he said .
But not everyone agrees .
In early August , District Court Judge Calvin Johnson delayed a decision on whether to release more records in the case .
Lawyers for some medical personnel and former hospital owner Tenet Healthcare Corporation are seeking to seal the records from the public .
CNN , along with the New Orleans Times - Picayune , is seeking to get the records .
Johnson indicated he was n't sure people should know what happened .
" What you presented to the grand jury room stayed in the grand jury room .
On one level , I 'll suggest no one should know .
In a way , I do n't want to know , " the Times - Picayune quoted Johnson as telling the court .

People inside Burma have been e-mailing the BBC News website and talking to the BBC Burmese Service about the growing unrest .
Saturday , 29 September Friday , 28 September Thursday , 27 September Wednesday , 26 September Tuesday , 25 September Monday , 24 September SUNDAY , 30 SEPTEMBER
The military junta made assemble in Myitkyina on Saturday morning .
They said that anyone from each house must attend in the assemble .
That 's why everyone have to go there .
Otherwise nobody want to go in assemble .
If not they will put in the jail and they killed the leader of the monks from Myitkyina on Thursday night .
Mi , Myitkyina , Myanmar SATURDAY , 29 SEPTEMBER
I left Burma today .
I have travelled around the country for the past month .
I witnessed and took part in protests in both Mandalay and Rangoon .
I have been walking with the protesters every day this week in Rangoon .
I was reluctant to leave , many people have told me that they would like more foreigners to be there with them to support them .
After the monasteries clampdown there were armed security forces at every gate of every monastery , but still the people bravely went out on the streets to protest .
The Sule Pagoda was like a military camp .
There were boxes of ammunition everywhere .
For the last several days I 've given out flowers to soldiers telling them not to shoot .
I do n't think those soldiers want to do what they are doing .
When I asked them whether they really want to kill people , they shook their heads in silent denial .
There were fewer people protesting , this is because the army as well as firing into the crowd , are taking photos of the protesters .
This scares them more than the bullets , because they know the repercussions .
People are so desperate , they want international armed forces to go there .
They feel helpless and heartbroken .
Karen , Thailand Around 14:00 GMT
I got in touch with a local Burmese .
He told me that the internet is back , but only limited sites are available .
YouTube and blogs are blocked .
So are the proxy - websites .
We messaged each other in a google chat for about 20 minutes , before he got abruptly disconnected .
I was trying to get him to install a proxy software .
This is what he said : " I am risking a lot by talking to you , there are spies among us sent by the military .
There is nobody on the streets now .
The place is like a graveyard , only dogs could be heard barking .
The last time I heard shooting was yesterday around 15:00 . "
Ralph , Vienna , Austria
It seems that the military has shown its power .
The protests have been wiped out easily .
The momentum and the determination of the people is winding down .
The soldiers show no mercy against the people .
Some people have seen soldiers walking into pagodas without taking their boots off .
Obviously , they have no religion .
They worship the military and their gods are the generals .
The soldiers do n't know what they are doing .
I saw a man praying as the soldiers were beating him .
This broke my heart .
We need a leader .
Where was our leader during this revolution ?
The monks were leading but now they are in the hands of the military .
There 's nobody to organise protests now .
There are small crowds now swearing at the troops and causing violence .
This is preposterous .
Bush has tighten the sanctions on us , but it does not help us .
Do you think the generals care ?
The sanctions can only hurt the economy and create more poverty .
The UN needs to act directly through negotiations and pressure .
The Chinese need to be more thoughtful .
If they do n't do anything they are risking the lives of millions of people .
Samson , Rangoon I just received a call from a friend in Rangoon .
He says the army have been using loudspeakers to pass on the message that if anyone is seen running into a house for sanctuary , they are going to demolish the building .
They are also warning people not to look out of their windows .
Neil , UK FRIDAY , 28 SEPTEMBER
I am in regular contact with my family and friends in Burma .
There is a humanitarian crisis happening there at the moment .
Because of the demonstrations , the street vendors and stalls selling vegetables and cooked food are no longer to be found on the streets of Rangoon .
People are scared to go out to buy food .
Most do n't have proper cooking facilities and rely of cheap food sold on the streets .
The mains water is foul and undrinkable and everyone relies on five gallon purified water bottles .
They are not being delivered at the moment .
The curfew is hurting the Muslim population quite badly .
During Ramadan , the myriad street restaurants are thronged in the evening and early in the morning when large extended families would be eating together .
Now they have to cope in their in home with whatever facilities are available .
The increased fuel costs have almost doubled the cost of all essentials .
John , UK Police are everywhere in Yangon ( Rangoon ) .
They are arresting demonstrators on the streets , searching houses and arresting innocent people .
They do n't want the UN envoy to see the truth of the demonstrations in Burma .
The foreign media is not getting the number of deaths right , I am sure that there are many more killed than the BBC is reporting .
Shan , Rangoon People seem to be determined to continue , despite the bullets , beatings and killings .
I hear right now that shooting is still going on near our office .
What we need from the international community is not just discussion on sanction or verbal pressure .
Defenceless citizens are risking their lives simply to make their voice heard to live in a country free of oppression and extreme poverty , which they have been enduring for the past 19 years .
Now is the time for the international community to take action .
Anonymous international resident , Rangoon
A group of more than 50 soldiers and riot police just passed in front of our office .
They are planning something but I do not know what .
About 14:00 I saw a group of protesters - about 30 people - being arrested and prepared to be taken somewhere else by soldiers with green scarfs .
They were also forced to squat with their hands behind their heads like prisoners .
Teargas was used but I heard no gun shots .
One of my colleague just told me that there is a large group of protesters in another part of town .
He said that they were swearing at the riot police .
The internet is down since last night .
People are saying that the government did this to prevent Burmese people sending information to foreign media about what 's going on in the country .
Only a handful of people , including me , have access to the internet as embassies and big companies have their own satelite links for the internet .
Myat , Rangoon
Now all the internet connections and phone lines are cut .
The government worries that we will send evidence of their terrible acts to the outside world .
Our people are sad and angry with this government .
We are all suffering from their terrible rule .
But we do n't have the capacity to do anything against them .
If we do something , we will be killed and our families will suffer .
We do n't have any choice , because we are born in Myanmar ( Burma ) .
We know it will be over one day .
We only wish this day will come soon .
B L , Rangoon Because of the security situation , oficially now non-essential staff are no longer required to come to the office .
I will be leaving the office at 11:00 and I 'll be staying at home until things get better .
The UN special envoy Gambari will leave New York for for Yangon ( Rangoon ) tomorrow to negotiate with the government .
I hope they can work things out though there 's a slim chance they will .
Anonymous Rangoon resident THURSDAY , 27 SEPTEMBER
It is 14:30 now and the riot police and army are trying to disperse the crowds on the street .
At about 12:30 the whole street was filled with demonstrators .
Then the soldiers started to shoot and use tear gas and then they charged with batons and took away some of the protesters .
I heard that one person was killed .
The crowds were yelling at the soldiers " your task is not to kill us citizens " .
At about 14:00 about the soldiers advanced towards the road in front of our office shouting through a loudspeaker at the crowds to disperse .
The demonstrators went away , probably to another part of the town .
There were only about 12 monks leading them .
Similar things are happening in other parts of the town where there are protests .
There are soldiers in almost all strategic parts of the town trying to disperse the crowd .
There is a little restraint still as they give warnings before doing anything and the people have some time to disperse .
I hope that things will get better without more bloodshed .
Anonymous Rangoon resident
They 're beating the crowd in front of Traders Hotel .
Around 2,000 were taking part in a peaceful demonstration .
There were also monks and people sat down to pay respect .
They started the beating as the people sat down to bow .
Tear gas were used again .
Someone saw 20 trucks full of soldiers heading towards downtown .
The junta has begun a full scale war against innocent civilians .
Sai , Rangoon
There are many deaths on the streets of Rangoon .
There were many deaths by gun-shots but the military is taking away the bodies so that they can hide their inhumane violence on civilians .
Now even spectators on the streets , who are not involved in the protests are being shot at .
Wai , Rangoon I live near the Ngwe Kyar Yan monastery in south Okkalapa .
They came to the monastery last night .
Only 20 monks escaped out of 200 .
One monk from this monastery passed away at the demonstration yesterday .
The soldiers came at the middle of the night and beat up the monks .
The head monk and the other 19 escaped .
They beat the monks and loaded them onto a truck like animals .
We could hear gunshots , screams and shouting .
Soldiers shouted that they are not just going to shoot in the air , but also on people .
Anonymous eyewitness , Rangoon
A photo of protesting students sent by a reader From the BBC Burmese Service : ( At a monastery at midnight )
The soldiers ran up to the first floor of the monastery and grabbed the head monk by the neck and dragged him downstairs .
They beat up the other monks with batons and sticks .
They kicked the sleeping novices to wake them up and ask them if any monks are hiding .
The novices are shaking with fear .
It is as if they are raiding a rebel camp .
Anonymous eyewitness , Rangoon
It 's heartbreaking to witness what is happening now .
The military have used some force but not at their full potential .
They want to scare the people by using force and if protesters do n't back down they will step up their actions .
It is very important that we do not back down .
Once the protests fizzle out , the government will have its chance and all will be put in jail .
The state media blames the people for using violence .
Well , we just threw stones at them for beating the monks .
It 's hard to believe that Buddhist solddiers would attack Buddhist monks .
The people are angry and sacred , but hopeful .
The future of Myanmar ( Burma ) depends on China .
I would like China to restate it 's policy of not interfering with internal affairs of other countries .
We are in a difficult position .
We either go to democracy or back to military dictatorship .
Samson , Rangoon From the BBC Burmese Service : ( At around 14:00 local time when soldiers started shooting into the crowd )
They have shot several times into the crowd , one person was injured , they used tear gas .
Now the injured person is being carried into a car to be taken to hospital .
They ( the soldiers ) are using force on us .
Anonymous eyewitness , Rangoon WEDNESDAY , 26 SEPTEMBER
There are a lot of people in the emergency ward in the hospital and people are dying there .
One witness told me that there were three monks that were brought in by a taxi driver and one of the monks died at the table - the other two are in a critical condition .
A lot of other people are severely injured .
Thian , Rangoon
Thian 's account of turmoil in Rangoon
At about 10 o'clock the riot police blocked the road , but the monks pushed through the blockade and climbed the Shwedagon pagoda from the eastern side .
After eating there , they came down from the pagoda about noon , in a line .
At that point they were rounded up and charged with batons by the police .
The monks responded merely by reciting prayers .
People fled from the scene and it was mainly women who were targeted and beaten .
The mob was dispersed and some people were arrested .
Near the eastern stairway , tear gas was used to disperse the crowd .
The monks - together with monks from Thingangyun - are said to march towards downtown .
About thirty monks were badly hurt and hospitalised .
Anonymous eyewitness , Rangoon
Click here to see more readers ' photos I just talked to my sister , who lives in Rangoon .
She knows someone at the local hospital in Rangoon .
They have been treating three monks , who were taken to the hospital by responsible taxi drivers .
The monks had been beaten up with the back of rifles .
One monk had a deep wound exposing his brain , and he has already died .
The other two are being treated under intensive care .
Many more people died today , but there is no information about it .
Many taxi drivers who are at the site of the violence take injured monks to nearest hospitals .
The junta are using dirty tactics - they do n't fire guns , but beat people with the back of their rifles .
The monks defiantly did not fight back , endured the pain and died .
Anonymous Burmese woman
At 13:00 a silent and orderly line of several thousand monks has passed at the bottom of the street where my office is located .
Not a sound from them , a calm and determined march .
Traffic blocks up , buses and taxis open their doors , people stream out and go towards the marchers at an unusually quick pace .
People just leave their cars at the side of the road .
At the same time , while the sun is burning down , there are huge dark - grey clouds in the sky and loud thunder cracks over their heads .
Win , Rangoon From the BBC Burmese Service :
When monks and people reached the mid-level platform of the Shwedagon Pagoda around 12:20 PM , they closed the doors behind and riot police started to chase them and beat them up .
Then about 200 were hauled off onto the trucks and driven away .
About 80 monks were taken away .
Anonymous eyewitness , Rangoon Police were beating monks and nuns in Shwedagon Pagoda this morning and then putting them onto trucks .
There were two prison vans and two fire engines .
More army and police forces are in Kandawgyi park near Shwedagon Pagoda .
Armed forces and plain - clothes police are to be seen in many other important places in Rangoon .
People have been waiting at Sule Pagoda since early in the morning , and there are six army trucks near the City Hall , but I have n't seen any soldiers .
The uniformed and plain - clothes police in front of the City Hall hold photos of monks leading the protests .
We heard that over 50 monks and many students were arrested .
Cherry , Rangoon
Now the military junta is reducing the internet connection bandwidth and we have to wait for a long time to see a page .
Security forces block the route of demonstrations .
Yesterday night , the junta announced to people in Rangoon and Mandalay not to leave their houses 9:00 PM to 5:00 AM .
I think if the junta decides , they will cut off communication such as internet and telephone lines so that no information can be leaked to the outside world .
David , Rangoon Riot police and soldiers are beating monks and other protesters at the east gate of Shwedagon Pagoda .
They are starting a crackdown by all means .
Police forces are stationed at Sule Pagoda as well .
Regardless of this , just after noon , about 1000 monks from a nearby monastery started a march to the Shwedagon Pagoda .
Thila , Rangoon TUESDAY , 25 SEPTEMBER
At 11.30 am , after a few moments of prayer at the Shwedagon Pagoda , the procession started .
The number of marchers quickly swelled as other monks and groups joined having walked from different parts of the city .
Many others formed a human chain on either side of them .
Robert , Rangoon Robert 's account
This is a precious chance to let the world know about what 's inside Burma .
I have n't seen the protests yet .
My family does not allow me to go out when the protests are in progress .
Everything I know I 've heard it from my relatives who live in the town centre .
They have witnessed UN officials , students , foreigners , some Muslim , Chinese and Indian people taking part in the protest .
I saw a truck full of police with guns , which looked like AK47 .
There also is an announcement in every township of Rangoon warning people not to get involved in protests .
We are really motivated by the protests .
I believe in the power of people .
The military junta has been making us miserable for nearly two decades .
Enough is enough .
This really is the right time for the Burmese people to be united .
But most people are still silent .
We need good leadership and a good leader .
Yi , Rangoon Protesters have defied warnings from the military government
We do n't know what will happen today , we are waiting to see how the situation develops .
The junta announced that they will suppress the demonstrations whether by civilians or monks , anyone who disobeys their orders .
We have suffered for a long time under the wicket junta .
We are so afraid of them and cannot say what we think of feel .
We respect our Buddhist monks very much .
Our country has many natural resources but we are very poor .
We are a disgrace in the whole world because of our rulers .
But we hope for a golden future .
We hope for the freedom of Aung San Su Kyi .
Kyi , Rangoon
Today the city is quiet and people go to work as normal .
There are lots of rumours , but for the time being everything is calm .
People are anxious to see what 's going to happen .
According to the government 's warnings , today could be a big day .
China is key .
The US have announced new sanctions , but this is nothing .
Burmese people do not welcome them and do not care about them .
They want help , not sanctions .
If the US wants to make a change here , they should threaten that if China continues its support for the Burmese military , they wo n't take part in the Olympics .
Everything else is a joke .
Michel , Rangoon From the BBC Burmese Service :
The order ( by the regime to people not to come out on the streets ) is not justified .
If it were a just order , we would be ready to abide by it .
But we cannot accept any unjustified laws .
We will resist it .
Student protester , Rangoon From the BBC Burmese Service : About 700 students are taking part in protests today .
Some students are in the middle of exams at this time .
But they have left their exam rooms and come out the streets to joining hands with the public and to fight for the country under the guidance of the monks .
Student protester , Rangoon
This morning , government agents warned people by loudspeakers on the streets not to look , not to follow , not to encourage and not to participate in demonstrations .
But a group of monks and ordinary people came out on the streets in the afternoon and headed towards the Sule Pagoda .
A well - known poet gave a speech to the crowd and they continued their march .
But I think that the participants are half the number they were yesterday .
Some people are worried and they are thinking carefully about the crisis that may be created by a junta response .
Cherry , Rangoon I walked with the monks , nuns and students all the way from Shwedagon to Sule , then to the former Secretariat building , then walked pass Kandawgalay .
Then we went to the Royal Lake and walked pass Aung San bronze statute .
We started at 1 PM and finished at 5 PM at Shwedagon east gate .
It was very moving .
People went all the way and some were in tears .
I was n't worried that there might be a crackdown .
Gradually I got some energy and was just not afraid to proceed .
Win , Rangoon MONDAY , 24 SEPTEMBER
I witnessed the big protests in Rangoon today .
I am really sorry for our country and our people because we are under the control of the wicked junta .
We have n't got arms , we wish for peace , a better future and democracy .
We are hoping that the UN security council will put a pressure on the junta .
Kyi Kyi , Rangoon I saw more than 100,000 monks marching today .
I 'm not sure where the protests will lead to .
This situation could get worse .
We want some changes in Burma , but we want these changes leading to a better future .
Sun , Rangoon
I saw about 40,000 to 50,000 people , including monks , nuns and ordinary people , marching along Prome road .
That was at around 3:30 pm .
The protests will grow bigger day by day and I hope that they are not going to start killing people .
We need help to save our people .
Mr Tun , Rangoon
It is astounding to see such a great mass of people on both sides of the roads , some clapping and some crying , but all demonstrating their support for the monks and those chanting prayers .
It 's for sure that all these people showing their support are willing to be part of the mass protest .
They do not trust the government though and think that they could be crushed , just like it happened in 1988 .
But if we are just bystanders , today 's rare and momentous events might not lead to the fall of the regime .
Kyaw , Rangoon I am not sure where these protests are going to lead to , but I am sure that it 's not at all a good sign .
Many people are expecting that there will be a great change coming soon .
I am not sure if the monks will be joined by students , workers , or even soldiers .
We are very insecure because we do n't know what the government is planning to do .
There are some news in the government - controlled newspapers that the monks are trying to agitate the public .
This can be a big excuse for them to start attacking the monks .
I really want some changes in Burma but I am not sure where the change is going to lead us to .
I hope there wo n't be any blood bath this time like there was in 1988 .
Soe Soe , Mandalay
The current situation can lead to civil war because the junta still holds the power and the opposition might use this opportunity to form an armed struggle .
We want things to change peacefully , not through a civil war .
But if there 's no way to avoid the arms struggle , the people will choose it and the conditions in our poor country may become worse .
The international pressure , including from China and Russia , is very important for the future of Burma at this moment .
Mg Khar , Rangoon
One of the monks who took part in the protests came to us and told us about his experiences .
He said : " We are not afraid , we have n't committed a crime , we just say prayers and take part in the protests .
We have n't accepted money from onlookers although they offered us a lot .
We just accept water .
People clapped , smiled and cheered us . "
The monk seemed very happy , excited and proud .
But I 'm worried for them .
They care for us and we pray for them not to get harmed .

" It 's not what you know , " they say .
" It 's who you know . "
We have all heard this sentiment , and we all reflexively agree with it .
This is because " they " are hard to debate , especially since " they " never seem to be in the room whenever anyone makes reference to them .
Yet they have a secret shame , and it's a shame they can't deny :
They are losers .
They are failures .
They do n't realize that life is �almost without exception �an absolute meritocracy , and everyone who succeeds completely deserves it . *
The only people who disagree with this are people who will never succeed at anything .
You see , " they " want you to believe the passageway to power is all about cultivating allies , so they spend all their time trying to make friends and influence people .
And this is why they fail .
It rarely matters who is on your side ; what matters is who is against you .
Unlike Gloria Loring , you do n't need a friend and you do n't need a lover .
What you need is a ) one quality nemesis , and b ) one archenemy .
These are the two most important characters in the life of any successful human .
We measure ourselves against our nemeses , and we long to destroy our archenemies .
Nemeses and archenemies are the catalysts for everything .
Now , I know that you 're probably asking yourself , How do I know the difference between my nemesis and my archenemy ?
Here is the short answer :
You kind of like your nemesis , despite the fact that you despise him .
If your nemesis invited you out for cocktails , you would accept the offer .
If he died , you would attend his funeral and �privately �you might shed a tear over his passing .
But you would never have drinks with your archenemy , unless you were attempting to spike his gin with hemlock .
If you were to perish , your archenemy would dance on your grave , and then he'd burn down your house and molest your children .
You hate your archenemy so much that you try to keep your hatred secret , because you do n't want your archenemy to have the satisfaction of being hated .
If this distinction seems confusing , just ask your girlfriend to explain it in detail ; women have always intuitively grasped the nemesis / archenemy dichotomy .
Every woman
I 've ever known has had at least one close friend whose only purpose in life is to criticize her actions , compete for the attention of men , and drive her insane ; very often , this is a woman 's best friend .
Every woman also has a former friend ( usually someone from high school with large breasts ) whom she has loathed for years ( and whom she will continue to loath with the intensity of a thousand suns , even if she sees her only once every ten years ) .
This is her archenemy .
Women intrinsically understand human dynamics , and this makes them unstoppable .
Unfortunately , the average man is less adroit at fostering such rivalries , which is why most men remain average .
Males are better at hating things that can't hate them back ( e.g. , lawn mowers , cats , the 1986 Denver Broncos , et cetera ) .
Most men fail to see a world beyond themselves ; if given the choice , they would connect themselves to nothing .
But greatness cannot be achieved in a vacuum , and great people know that .
In the 1980s , Larry Bird 's nemesis was Magic Johnson , and it was always beautiful when they tangled .
But Bird 's archenemy was n't Magic ; it was Isiah Thomas .
When the Celtics played the Pistons , it was a train wreck , and it went deeper than basketball :
In 1987 , Isiah supported Dennis " Rush " Rodman when he claimed Bird was famous only because he was white .
Larry forgave Isiah in public , but he still iced him in the end ; the first thing Bird did after becoming president of the Pacers was fire Zeke as head coach .
Steve Jobs is Bill Gates 's nemesis , but if Gates had only one bullet in his revolver , he 'd shoot David Boies .
J. R. Ewing was at war with nemesis / brother Bobby for twelve seasons ( thirteen if you count the year Victoria Principal dreamed he was dead ) , but Cliff Barnes was the true Minotaur of Southfork .
Jack
White turned Von Bondies singer Jason Stollsteimer 's face into a speed bag , but Stollsteimer barely even deserves nemesis stature ;
White 's archenemy is Ryan Adams ( although he'd be better off if it were Julian Casablancas of the Strokes ) .
The Joker was Batman 's nemesis , but�ironically �his archenemy was Superman , since Superman made Batman seem entirely mortal and generally nonessential .
Nobody likes to admit this , but Batman hated Superman ; Superman is the reason Batman became an alcoholic .
**
This fall , George W. Bush will seek reelection , and whoever the Democrats end up nominating will become Bush 's " nemesis by default " ( although not his true nemesis ; that will always be John McCain ) .
But none of the candidates has a shot at becoming Bush 's archenemy ; that designation is inflexible .
W's archenemy is Bill Clinton ( mostly because Bill beat up his dad in ' 92 ) .
George W. Bush will never face the man he hates most ; this is why George W. Bush will never achieve greatness .
However , when we get to 2008 � when Clinton 's wife faces the little brother of her husband 's archenemy �it will be a bloodbath .
When the families of archenemies collide , skulls get pounded into pulp .
Jeb �Hillary will be like Frazier �Ali III .
I was sitting in the passenger seat of my nemesis 's Buick Skylark when he punched me in 1992 ; I jacked his jaw at a keg party in ' 94 .
These days I mostly just read his blog , although we did have a pressure - packed lunch at the Fargo Olive Garden over Christmas .
Meanwhile , I 've had the same archenemy since eighth grade :
He 's a guy named Rick Helling , and he grew up in Lakota , North Dakota .
Last year , Helling pitched a few innings for the Marlins in the World Series ; in 1998 , he won twenty games for the Rangers .
I went to basketball camp with Rick Helling in 1985 , and he was the single worst person I 'd ever met .
Every summer , I constantly scan the sports section of USA Today , always hoping that he got shelled .
This is what drives me .
I cannot live in a world where Helling 's career ERA hovers below 5.00 , yet all I do for a living is type .
As long as Rick Helling walks this earth , I shall never sleep soundly .
I realize there are those who do n't think it 's necessary ( or even wise ) to consciously create adversaries ;
Will Rogers claimed that he never met a man he did n't like .
But what is Will Rogers famous for , really ?
For telling jokes that do n't have punch lines ?
For wearing a bandanna like an ascot ?
Who wants that for a legacy ?
There is a reason they say , " Keep your friends close , but keep your enemies closer . "
Granted , " they " usually do n't know what they 're talking about , but sometimes " they " get lucky , you know ?
* The exceptions being Dale Peck , MTV on - air personalities who are n't Kurt Loder , Al Franken , and myself .
** This is speculative .
As the accompanying essay makes clear , you 'll need a nemesis and an archenemy if you wish to be successful in this world .
The good news is , it 's entirely possible that you already have each of these entities in your life ; perhaps you just do n't realize it ( or maybe you can't tell them apart ) .
As a public service , here are a few signs .
RECOGNIZING YOUR NEMESIS
� At some point in the past , this person was ( arguably ) your best friend .
� You have punched this person in the face .
� If invited , you would go to this person 's wedding and give him a spice rack , but you would secretly hope that his marriage ends in a bitter , public divorce .
� People who barely know both of you assume you are close friends ; people who know both of you intimately suspect that you profoundly dislike each other .
� If your archenemy tried to kill you , this person would attempt to stop him .
RECOGNIZING YOUR ARCHENEMY
� Every time you talk to this person , you lie .
� If you meet someone who has the same first name as this person , you immediately like him less .
� The satisfaction you feel from your own success pales in comparison to the despair you feel at this person 's triumphs , even if those triumphs are completely unrelated to your life .
� If this person slept with your girlfriend , she would never be attractive to you again .
� Even if this person 's girlfriend was a hateful bitch , you would sleep with her out of spite .

If you 're into DRM - free music , you have a reason to get pretty excited today .
As speculated Amazon has launched the public beta of its new digital music portal called Amazon MP3 , which will feature two million songs from 180,000 artists and 20,000 labels , all without the painful and annoying restrictions of DRM .
The press release claims that the site , which will include EMI and Universal tracks ( take that , Jobs ) , will make separate songs available for $.89 or $.99 , and boasts that all of the " top 100 " tracks will be priced at the former , lower amount .
Albums will range in cost from $ 5.99 to $ 9.99 , with the best selling albums coming in at $ 8.99 .
Of course , since there 's no DRM , users are free to throw the 256 Kbps MP3s on any player they like , as well as burn CDs , copy to MiniDisc , and dump to 8 - track .
Another day , another fuel cell milestone .
This time , it 's sugar at the bio-electrical base .
Unfortunately , the world 's highest output they 're touting is just 50 mW per cell .
Still , if you daisy chain a few together then you 've got enough juice ( literally ) to power a modern Walkman albeit , from a battery roughly 10 x the size of the player .

As interfaces become ever more complex and development schedules seem to get shorter and shorter , you may find it useful to give up your user - interface modeling software for awhile in favor of something simpler .
All you need is paper , pens , scissors , and your imagination .
Article Continues Below
Everyone loves paper#section2
Just as a political party aims to be a “ big tent , ” product development teams should seek input from as many people as possible during the early part of a project ’s design phase .
Though HTML prototypes can be useful , they can also discourage those who are unsure what the medium is capable of .
Paper prototypes , on the other hand , invite people with little - to - no technical background into the design process .
I cannot emphasize enough how important the inclusive quality of paper can be .
Though some people shy away from paper prototypes because they feel they will not be taken seriously , I argue that many people are intimidated by a formal , highly technical design process and that the less “ professional ” nature of paper prototyping is a great way to lighten the mood and engage a more diverse group .
Just offer plenty of paper , pens , scissors , and other materials for anyone to grab and use .
If anyone feels nervous , let them eat the paste .
Easy iterations #section3
Paper prototyping can also help improve the final product : the prototyping stage is the right time to catch design flaws and change directions , and the flexibility and disposability of paper encourages experimentation and speedy iteration .
Instead of “ deleting ” hours worth of layout code you ’ve used to position a column in the right place , you can draw a prototype , throw away the ideas that do n’t work , and move on .
Built for your budget #section4
If you are on a shoestring budget , paper is a great low - cost alternative to many software packages — and if you have a larger budget , you can use products like Post - it notes or tabbed index card dividers to make your paper prototypes more sophisticated .
If it helps your team , you can print full - color objects to use in your prototyping sessions .
You might want a low - quality printer in the meeting room connected to someone ’s laptop for printing out new ideas .
If someone recommends a website they ’ve seen online , just print out a screenshot , tack it to the wall , and start doodling on it .
On the flip side , you can also use paper prototypes to run a technology - free design meeting : turn off your laptops , stop checking your e-mail , and focus on the task at hand .
Easy documentation #section5
Another benefit of using paper is that you can write notes right on the prototype or on the back of each sheet or index card .
While an advanced group might feel comfortable using a wiki for information capture , other teams may find these attached notes a godsend weeks later when they actually start writing code for that pesky dialog box .
Show me the paper#section6
Traditional user interface widgets can be modeled easily with paper .
Here is a set “ tabs ” showing a couple of buttons and what happens when you “ click ” on a drop - down menu :
You can always save a buck or two by using regular index cards and cutting out the tab labels yourself .
Dynamic boxes , common in websites with contextual or personalized information , are possible too .
To “ refresh ” the page , simply swap out the index cards .
Here a username not found in the database triggers an error and on a successful login the box displays the “ my account ” widget :
It is possible to demonstrate problems such as a pop-up windows that block key elements of your interface and potential alternatives to the pop-up :
For every link and button on your mock - ups , be prepared to have a matching sketch ready to display — or have someone take suggestions from your group and sketch a new dialog , page , or window in real time .
Besides the materials mentioned , I recommend a removable glue stick that can be found cheap at an office supply store .
Glue sticks are the “ magic ” that lets you easily put together and take apart a paper interface .
Where does paper prototyping fit into the design process ?
#section7
There are two dominant uses :
The design team uses paper for their presentation to a larger group of people who have a vested interest in the product .
Users run through a set of existing paper mock - ups or are given blank paper and asked to represent a concept by sketching it .
Option two is a great way to “ unplug ” and go directly to people willing to test your interface .
As an example , let ’s look at the ways in which paper can fit into the usability testing process .
Usability testing with paper prototypes#section8
A paper usability - testing session works much like any other usability - testing session .
Begin by selecting a range of testers who represent your expected audience .
Have scenarios ready for the user to perform .
Document the testing sessions with video to review the users ’ emotional state when using your mocked - up interface .
Debrief users afterward to measure interface recall .
With paper , you can also :
Allow users to mock up ideas they think would solve a problem .
Mark on the prototype where a user attempted to “ click ” or otherwise interact with the interface .
Ask users to draw what they expect to happen next .
Keep going even if you do n’t have access to a testing lab or if computers , networks , or high - tech prototypes do n’t work as expected .
While it ’s valuable to measure the success of your interface via time - based benchmarks , the emphasis should be on getting your focus group to be creative .
If you ’d like to read about a real - world experience check out Carolyn Snyder ’s article on a six - day session using paper prototypes with clients and end -users .
When paper is n’t ideal #section9
A major benefit of paper is the user - generated content that comes out of the feedback sessions .
Chances are , a one - person shop will have a hard time reaping the benefits of paper without the collaborative process that occurs in “ using ” the prototype with others .
There are also certain concepts that remain difficult to demonstrate with paper : how long a screen takes to load or refresh , for instance .
Horizontal and vertical scrolling is a common website interface problem that is almost impossible to discover with a paper prototype .
Specific colors , images , and fonts are n’t easily represented on the simplest paper prototypes .
Still , I have used computer print - outs in combination with paper to tackle at least some of these issues .
Earlier in this article , you saw an example with Arabic text that uses material I printed out .
Because Arabic text is written right to left , I wanted to keep this in mind when positioning the main body of text on the interface .
The Arabic font also requires the text be large enough to read diacritical marks .
Be sure to include people in your paper sessions who can explain how advanced interface widgets , graphics , fonts , and embedded multimedia elements might affect the design .
Where do we go from here ?
#section10
If you want to dig deeper , Carolyn Snyder ’s Paper Prototyping is the most recognized work on this subject and is highly recommended .
Paper has seen a resurgence with knowledge workers who aim to organize every aspect of their lives .
The Hipster PDA breathed life into its community and spawned projects such as the DIY Planner , which is based on a set of printable templates for calendars , to - do lists , and more .
Note :
The paper prototyping field might benefit from an open - source library of similar printable widgets , which could be modeled using SVG or provided in a standard format such as PDF .
Online resources such as the GUIdebook and wireframing templates for Visio and OmniGraffle may provide a good start point for generating ideas .
If anyone is interested in creating an open - source printable widget library , I will provide free hosting space for project tools such as a wiki and SVN repository for checking out the latest and greatest templates .
Finally , there are some efforts to merge paper concepts with technology using tablet computing .
Professor James Landay at the University of Washington has been working on a tool called DENIM since the mid-90s that is aimed at creating websites .
DENIM allows you to sketch your ideas , annotate them , and even export a working HTML site suitable for use in demonstrations .
Today I ’m declaring Facebook Bankruptcy in addition to comment bankruptcy .
I ca n’t keep up with the friend requests , the requests to confirm how we know each other , the requests to tell you I like you , the requests to tell you I want your to tell me what movies you want to tell me about , etc .
I ’ve got too many friends torturing me about movies I ’ll never see at this point –I do n’t need you to burden me with the movies you want me to see .
I want to watch my Kurosawa DVDs again !
I want to watch all the Frankenheimer movies I missed … even the bad ones !
Yes , I love Zombies , but no I do n’t want to be turned into one .
Yes , I like fortune cookies , but no I do n’t want a virtual one .
Yes , I ’d love to play Texas Holdem for a couple of hours–but not online .
Frankly I think folks are getting splintered by these social networks .
You spend so much time checking off what you ’ll do that you never do anything .
Why waste your time talking about movies you ’re going to watch when you have n’t even seen the classics , the 20 you have in your Netflix queue , and DVDs you ’ve already BOUGHT ?!?
Also , I ’ve got my own causes that I do n’t have enough time for , so no , I really do n’t need the guilt trip of telling you I do n’t want to be in your group that ’s going to stop the suffering of [ INSERT THE NAME OF YET ANOTHER GROUP OF PEOPLE WHO ARE SUFFERING TOO MUCH ] .
It ’s brutal .
No one human can solve the problems of all humans but based on social networking I ’m going to be presented with just such a challenge .
What ?!?!?!
You are not going to join my group to clean the water , support free culture , stop the killing of INSERTSPECIESHERE , etc .
Frankly , I do n’t understand why all of these startups are spending all their time trying to build inside of Facebook ’s walled garden ….
well , I guess I do understand it : they like the quick hit of watching the apps #s run up .
However , it makes no sense to me to build inside of someone else ’s platform when you have the wide open internet out there to develop on .
I guess if you look at Facebook applications as free marketing maybe .
Feels like everyone who is doing this is the Web 2.0 version of old IPs ( information partners ) at AOL in the pre-web days ….
except there is no $ 4.95 an hour fee to split with Facebook !
Time and the open internet has told us that model is n’t sustainable .
Closed gives to open …. eventually .
Frankly I do n’t know enough about Facebook to make a decision just yet .
I just find it crazy and the pace is so fast that very little of substance is being done .
Folks have just opted in to another out of control inbox ….
I ’m opting out .
Note : I ’m not going to turn comments on ….
so stop asking .
If this is such an important post for your to comment on do it on your blog .
If you do n’t have a blog–which takes 10 minutes to setup–then maybe you ’re not worthy of commenting , or others reading your comments .
If you do have a blog and do n’t want to take the time to fire off a blog post in response to this then , frankly , how valuable is your comment ?
The benchmark for responding to my blog is now starting your own blog and writing a post .
If you do that I ’ll consider linking to you if it is intelligent and interesting .
Those are the new rules ….

In the article entitled “ The Ascendancy of the Scientific Dictatorship ” , we examined the transmogrification of the elite ’s religious power structure into a technocratic oligarchy legitimized predominantly by science .
The history and background of this “ scientific dictatorship ” is a conspiracy , created and micro-managed by the historical tide of Darwinism , which has its foundations in Freemasonry .
In this article , we shall examine the “ scientific dictatorship ” as an enormous project in the re-sculpting of reality itself .
The Technocracy
Freemason Aldous Huxley coined the term “ scientific dictatorship ” and presented an allegorized version of the concept in his famous roman ‘ a clef entitled Brave New World .
Huxley was mentored by Freemason H.G. Wells , who also presented a fictionalized “ scientific dictatorship ” under the appellation of the “ Technocracy . ”
This is an interesting designation for a world government managed by functional elites and scientists .
It is derived from the Greek word techne , which means craft .
Given Wells ’ membership in the Craft of Freemasonry , the synchronicity becomes apparent .
Moreover , the term craft is associated with witchcraft or wicca .
From the term wicca , one derives the word wicker ( Hoffman , 63 ) .
Examining this word a little closer , Michael Hoffman explains : “ The word wicker has many denotations and connotations , one of which is ‘ to bend , ’ as in the ‘ bending ’ of reality ' ” ( Hoffman , 63 ) .
This is especially interesting when considering the words of Mark Pesce , co-inventor of Virtual Reality Modeling Language .
Pesce writes :
“ The enduring archetype of techne within the pre-Modern era is magic , of an environment that conforms entirely to the will of being ” ( Pesce ) .
Techne is also from whence the word technology is derived .
The significance of this fact becomes evident when Pesce opines :
Each endpoint of techne has an expression in the modern world as a myth of fundamental direction — the mastery of matter , and the collection of spirit .
The myth of matter comes to its end as the absolute expression of will as artifact ; in a word , nanotechnology ( Pesce ) .
Herein is the final objective of New World Order … the reconfiguration of reality through the sorcery of technology .
Radical Empiricism : The Epistemological Pretext for Re-Sculpting Reality
As we have established in previous articles , most of contemporary science is predicated upon empiricism .
This is the epistemological stance that all knowledge is derived exclusively through the senses .
Lyndon LaRouche explains the inherent flaws of empiricism :
By the nature of our processes of sense - perception , our direct perception of the world “ outside our skins ” ( so to speak ) does not show us that world “ outside our skins , ” but , rather , the impact of that unperceived real world upon the biology of our mental - sensory processes .
In other words , the shadows on the wall of Plato ’s Cave ( LaRouche ) .
Thus , the world becomes little more than an ever - shifting pliancy of impressions .
All that a percipient surveys is an amorphous amalgam of “ shadows . ”
It comes as little surprise that an exclusively empirical approach relegates causality to the realm of metaphysical fantasy .
The obviation of causality holds enormous ramifications for science .
What is perceived as A causing B could be merely a consequence of circumstantial juxtaposition .
Although temporal succession and spatial proximity are axiomatic , causal connection is not .
Affirmation of causal relationships is impossible .
Given the absence of causality , all of a scientist ’s findings must be taken upon faith .
Ironically , science relies on the affirmation of such cause and effect relationships .
This is all one can deduce while working under the paradigm of radical empiricism .
Thus , the elite merely exchanged one form of mysticism for another .
It comes as little surprise that , within certain occult circles , contemporary science is considered sorcery disseminated on the popular level .
For instance , Satanic high priest Anton LaVey regarded science and technology as “ sanctioned , but ineffectual ‘ occultism ' ” ( Raschke , 214 ) .
In fact , science has become a new form of sorcery for the manipulation of matter .
According to the epistemology of empiricism , reality is little more than a quagmire of impressions .
It is analogous to a holograph , the fabric of which is pliable enough to be manipulated .
Thus , reality becomes the ever - shifting canvas upon which scientists paint whatever they wish .
The scientist ’s role in this reconfiguration of reality was delineated in an esoteric tract entitled The Way of Light .
Authored by Comenius in 1668 , the manifesto was dedicated to the British Royal Society .
Researcher Michael Hoffman elaborates :
In it , Comenius addressed the first formal scientists as “ illuminati ” and outlined their scientific purpose , “ … which is to secure … the empire of the human mind over matter ” [ emphasis added ] ( Hoffman , 23 ) .
Years later , Bertrand Russell would recapitulate the “ illuminati ’s ” ( i.e. , scientists ’ ) role in the establishment of “ the empire of the human mind over matter . ”
Redefining science as an instrument of radical empiricism , Russell wrote :
The way in which science arrives at its beliefs is quite different from that of medieval theology .
Experience has shown that it is dangerous to start from general principles and proceed deductively , both because the principles may be untrue and because the reasoning based upon them may be fallacious .
Science starts , not from large assumptions , but from particular facts discovered by observation or experiment .
From a number of such facts a general rule is arrived at , of which , if it is true , the facts in question are instances …
Science thus encourages abandonment of the search for absolute truth , which belongs to any theory that can be successfully employed in inventions or in predicting the future .
“ Technical ” truth is a matter of degree : a theory from which more successful inventions and predictions spring is truer than one which gives rise to fewer .
“ Knowledge ” ceases to be a mental mirror of the universe , and becomes merely a practical tool in the manipulation of matter [ emphasis added ] ( Russell , 13 – 15 ) .
In other words , science or “ knowledge ” becomes the instrument by which the “ illuminati ” re-sculpts reality .
It also becomes an epistemological weapon against the minds of men , wielded by the proverbial Descartean “ evil demon . ”
This was the central precept of Weishaupt ’s Illuminati and the conceit of the Technocracy today :
God was not in the beginning , but evolved from Man in the end .
According to this conceit , Man could recreate Eden without the God .
It comes as little surprise that sci-fi predictive programmer and British intelligence asset Arthur C. Clarke commented : “ Any sufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable from magic . ”
The Global Holodeck
The technocratic agenda of reconfiguring the “ holograph of reality ” is most clearly delineated by William Sims Bainbridge , sociologist and member of the National Science Foundation .
Citing sci-fi predictive programmer Gene Roddenberry , Bainbridge writes :
An interesting feature of the popular Star Trek universe is that mass - media popular culture is absent from its fictional future world .
Several characters play musical instruments and the preferred styles of music are classical , whether European or belonging to some other high culture .
Perhaps precisely because the characters are living very future - oriented lives , they turn to historical sources like Mozart for their aesthetic recreation .
Presumably , the copyrights have all expired .
Instead of passively watching television programmes and movies , they programme their own “ holodeck ” virtual reality dramas in which they play active roles , often with historical settings .
Government is certainly not in the science fiction business , but government - encouraged research is currently developing the technology to realise the Star Trek prophecies ( Bainbridge , “ Memorials ” ) .
Evidently , government - sponsored research programs are already dedicated to the Technocracy ’s vision of re-sculpting reality .
Bainbridge is certainly no stranger to this vision , as is evidenced by his association with Scientology .
In Religion and the Social Order , Bainbridge presented a mandate for scientists to become “ religious engineers ” in the development of a new world religion ( Bainbridge , “ New Religions , Science , and Secularization “ ) .
This new world religion , which Bainbridge calls a “ Church of God Galactic , ” would find its origins with science fiction literature ( Bainbridge , “ Religions for a Galactic Civilization “ ) .
In the formulation of his “ Church , ” Bainbridge used the scientistic cult of Scientology as a working model :
Today there exists one highly effective religion actually derived from science fiction , one which fits all the known sociological requirements for a successful Church of God Galactic .
I refer , of course , to Scientology ( Bainbridge , “ Religions for a Galactic Civilization ” ) .
In the Scientologist bible , L. Ron Hubbard ’s Dianetics , one finds a reiteration of Comenius ’ mission statement delivered to the “ illuminati ” ( i.e. , scientists ) .
Hubbard states :
Man has something more : some people call it imagination , some call it this or call it that ; but whatever it is called , it adds up to the interesting fact that man is not content merely to “ face reality ” as most other life forms are .
Man makes reality face him .
Propaganda about “ the necessity of facing reality , ” like propaganda to the effect that a man could be driven mad by a “ childhood delusion ” ( whatever that is ) , does not face the reality that where the beaver down his ages of evolution built mud dams and keeps on building mud dams , man graduates in a half century from a stone and wood dam to make a mill wheel pond to structures like Grand Coulee Dam , and changes the whole and entire aspect of a respectable portion of nature ’s real estate from a desert to productive soil , from a flow of water to lightening bolts ( Hubbard , 308 ) .
It is very interesting that Hubbard would cite the Grand Coulee Dam as an instant when man “ made reality face him . ”
Discussing the “ Saturnian - masonic ” era of erecting megalithic structures , Hoffman observes :
Actually , with some crucial exceptions , the rise of the megaliths marked the rise of the Hermetic Academy into its dominant physical phase .
The theory is that the megaliths “ pin down ” natural forces , helping to subdue nature ’s most savage furies .
We marvel today at the Hoover Dam but that symbol laden construction is but a crude parody of the technology of the megaliths which helped to “ dam ” the wildest forces of nature ( Hoffman , 21 ) .
Evidently , men like Hubbard and Bainbridge see something entirely different when they view structures like the Grand Coulee Dam and the Hoover Dam .
They are viewing the “ endpoint of techne — the mastery of matter . ”
It is the Technocracy ’s project in consciously shaping the terrain of the global holodeck .
The “ Hive Mind ”
As was established in the previous article covering this topic , Darwin ’s theory of evolution was cribbed liberally from Freemasonry ’s occult doctrine of “ becoming . ”
According to this doctrine , humanity was gradually evolving towards apotheosis .
The architecture of Masonry ’s evolutionary mythology is a counterpart to the Biblical account humanity ’s expulsion from Eden .
However , there are some major modifications .
In The Meaning of Masonry , W.L. Wilmshurst alleges that :
In all Scriptures and cosmologies the tradition is universal of a “ Golden Age , ” an age of comparative innocence , wisdom and spirituality , in which racial unity [ emphasis added ] , and individual happiness and enlightenment prevailed ; in which there was that open vision for want of which a people perisheth , but in virtue of which men were once in conscious conversation with the unseen world and were shepherded , taught and guided by the “ gods ” or discarnate superintendents of the infant race , who imparted to them the sure and indefeasible principles upon which their spiritual welfare and evolution [ emphasis added ] depended ( Wilmshurst , 173 ) .
However , Wilmshurst contends that a peregrination of human consciousness away from the “ racial mind ” caused humanity to fall from its former glory :
The tradition is also universal of the collective soul
[ emphasis added ] of the human race having sustained a “ fall , ” a moral declension from its true path of life and evolution [ emphasis added ] , which has severed it almost entirely from its creative source , and which , as the ages advanced , has involved its sinking more and more deeply into physical conditions , its splitting up from unity employing a single language into a diversity of conflicting races of different speeches and degrees of moral advancement
[ emphasis added ] , accompanied by a progressive densification of the material body and a corresponding darkening of the mind and atrophy of the spiritual consciousness ( Wilmshurst , 173 ) .
Recall Pesce ’s statement that techne was expressed in the modern world as the “ collection of spirit . ”
This is precisely the objective of Masonry … the “ collection of spirit ” through the facilitation of evolution !
Wilmshurst proceeds to reveal the chief means by which this will be achieved :
Unable to effect its [ Man ’s ] own recovery it required skilled scientific [ emphasis added ] assistance from other sources to bring about its restoration .
Whence could come that skill and scientific [ emphasis added ] knowledge if not from the Divine and now invisible world , from those “ gods ” and angelic guardians of the erring race of whom all ancient traditions and sacred writings tell ?
Would not that regenerative method be properly described if it were called , as in Masonry it is called , a “ heavenly science ” [ emphasis added ] , and welcomed in the words that Masons in fact use , “ Hail , Royal Art ! ” ( Wilmshurst , 175 ) .
Can there be any wonder why Freemasons Aldous Huxley and H.G. Wells were proponents of a “ scientific dictatorship ? ”
It is an intrinsic feature of their Masonic heritage .
This heritage led them to bestow absolute epistemological primacy upon Science , spelled with a “ S ” to denote its divine role in man ’s purported ascent towards apotheosis and the reconstitution of the Masonic “ collective soul . ”
This is scientism .
In a speech before the Royal Institute of International Affairs in 1936 , H.G. Wells succinctly expressed the core precept of scientism :
“ At first the realization of the ineffectiveness of our best thought and knowledge struck only a few people , like Mr. Maynard Keynes , for example …
It is science and not men of science that we want to enlighten and animate our politics and rule the world ” ( qutd . in Keith , Mind Control , WorldControl , 306 – 307 ) .
Wells also wrote about the mythological “ collective soul , ” which he dubbed “ The Mind of the Race . ” W. Warren Wagar elaborates on Wells ’ “ racial mind ” doctrine :
It was at once the capstone and the mortar of his [ Wells ’ ] faith : a belief in the emergence in human evolution of a collective racial being with the collective racial mind , which gathered the results of the individual mental effort into a single fund of racial wisdom and grew gradually toward organic consciousness of itself .
Individuals could escape the frustration inherent in the fact of their individuality and mortality only by consecrating their lives to the service of the Mind of the Race ( Wagar , 100 – 101 ) .
Wells believed that the final coalescence of human consciousness into a “ racial mind ” would result in the emergence not of a mere man , but of perfected Man with a capitalized M ( Wagar , 104 ) .
The M is capitalized to denote the purported divinity that is dormant within humanity .
Wells ’
Weltanschauung remained consistent with the Masonic themes of a “ collective soul ” and man ’s evolutionary ascent towards deification .
In H.G. Wells and the World State , author Warren Wagar elaborates :
But the transcendent reality Wells actually professed to see emerging here and now was the collective being of humanity , rather than any “ God . ”
At the level of the individual the species Homo sapiens might be nothing more than a swarm of unique individuals descended in an unbroken sequence from remote protozoan ancestors ; yet Homo sapiens was more than a name .
At this moment in cosmic time it also denoted a class of similar if not identical individuals , evolving in ceaseless interaction with one another , and through the unique gift of speech able to pool their experiences and so give birth to a higher order of being entirely : a racial memory , a collective mind [ emphasis added ] , the emergent intelligence of an emergent racial being ( Wagar , 104 ) .
According to Wells ’
Weltanschauung , the ecumenical singularity into which humanity was being compressed by evolution would relegate the individual to obsolescence :
As Wells grew older , he tended to look at life more and more from the synthetic level of racial being and less and less from the analytical level of the individual .
At the end of his spiritual pilgrimage he virtually accepted the realist argument that the whole is real and the individual an illusion ( Wagar , 104 ) .
William Sims Bainbridge may prove to be instrumental in the demise of the individual .
In an article entitled “ US report foretells of brave new world , ” journalist Nathan Cochrane examines Converging Technologies for Improving Human Performance , a report edited and contributed to by Bainbridge :
A draft government report says we will alter human evolution [ emphasis added ] within 20 years by combining what we know of nanotechnology , biotechnology , IT and cognitive sciences .
The 405 - page report sponsored by the US National Science Foundation and Commerce Department , Converging Technologies for Improving Human Performance , calls for a broad - based research program to improve human performance leading to telepathy , machine - to - human communication , amplified personal sensory devices and enhanced intellectual capacity ( Cochrane , 1 ) .
Elaborating on this research program , Cochrane explains how this convergent - technologies plan would be instrumental in the unification of mass consciousness :
People may download their consciousnesses into computers or other bodies even on the other side of the solar system , or participate in a giant “ hive mind ” , a network of intelligences connected through ultra - fast communications networks .
“ With knowledge no longer encapsulated in individuals , the distinction between individuals and the entirety of humanity would blur , ” the report says .
“ Think Vulcan mind - meld .
We would perhaps become more of a hive mind – an enormous , single , intelligent entity ” ( Cochrane , 1 ) .
Of course , preparations must be made for the humanity ’s comfortable acclimation to this new “ hive mind . ”
Cochrane writes :
The report says the abilities are within our grasp but will require an intense public - relations effort to “ prepare key organisations and societal activities for the changes made possible by converging technologies ” , and to counter concern over “ ethical , legal and moral ” issues .
Education should be overhauled down to the primary - school level to bridge curriculum gaps between disparate subject areas ( Cochrane , 1 ) .
The “ endpoint of techne ” may be drawing nigh as the Technocracy constructs its global holodeck .

Jon Stewart : ' Republicans have a big tent , you 're just not in it '
Mike Aivaz and Muriel Kane
Published : Tuesday October 2 , 2007
Save This Page
Print This Email This Monday 's Daily Show took up the subject of the GOP 's relationship to minorities .
" If you are a minority or an interest group , " Jon Stewart began , " the Democrats will hold a debate at your house .
Whereas Republicans take a slightly different approach .
They have a big tent .
You 're just not allowed in it . "
Not only have the Republicans skipped forums for gays , Hispanics , and bloggers , but " they 'll even blow off their own base , " said Stewart , pointing out that the Republican front - runners were notably absent last month from a debate sponsored by Evangelical Christians .
" Despite the snub , Evangelicals gave absent candidates plenty of time to not talk , " Stewart noted , showing questions being asked of the empty podiums .
" It must be so hard for Evangelicals to repeatedly ask questions into a void , only to wait in vain for an answer that will never come .
I do n't know how they do it . "
Stewart then turned to the detabe last week on African - American issues , which was avoided by all four front - runners .
" What was going on ?
Where was Mayor 911 ?
Or Oldington Hotwife ?
Or POW McStraighttalk ?
Or the Mormotron 5000 ? "
After taking a few jabs at the second - tier candidates who did show up , Stewart turned to " the Daily Show 's investigative team of Larry Wilmore and John Oliver " for a video report from the debate site .
C. Vernon Gray , a policital science professor at historically - black Morgan State University , where the debate was held , angrily told Wilmore and Oliver , " To suggest at this point that [ the front - runners ] have conflicted schedules is just hogwash . "
" Sure blacks may be getting ignored now , " responded Wilmore .
" But is n't it just getting them warmed up for next year , when they 're really going to be ignored ? "
Gray looked taken back and started to say , " I do n't think they 'll be ignored during the debates ... "
" As a white person , I have to say it is going to happen , " interjected Oliver .
" I 'm struggling to pay attention to you now , " he added , his gaze wandering around the room .
" We 're not going to be ignored , " insisted Gray .
" I think that day has long since passed . "
" Republicans are quick to acknowledge that , " Oliver conceded , offering a clip of Mitt Romney saying , " Of course we care about minority voters .
We 're not entirely brain - dead . "
He then showed footage of where Romney preferred to be on the day of the debate -- greeting all - white supporters at an International House of Pancakes in Sacramento , CA .
Many pancake jokes later , Grey was finally persuaded to take a bite of an IHOP pancake .
" That 's a good pancake , " he admitted .
The following video is from Comedy Central 's Daily Show with Jon Stewart , broadcast on October 1 , 2007
A surprising number of people seem unaware of the boycott of The Sun by supporters of Liverpool Football Club .
Some do n’t seem to know it is boycotted , others do n’t know why .
Some people rather disturbingly know why the boycott exists but still choose to buy it .
If you choose to continue to buy The Sun after reading this article , and the articles it links to , then you ought to stop calling yourself a Liverpool supporter .
Collect any shirts or scarves you have , and hand them in to a charity shop .
In fact you ca n’t really call yourself a football supporter .
The lies printed in The Sun that you will read about below were aimed at Liverpool supporters , people from Liverpool , people from the North of England , football supporters of any club .
If you fall into any of those categories you certainly should n’t be buying , reading , or visiting the website of that newspaper .
If you are a decent human being you will be steering clear of it from now on , even if you ’ve not done so before .
If you buy the paper regularly already , print off all of this information , and save your money tomorrow .
Read these articles instead .
If you still want to buy that paper the following day I would be surprised .
The boycott of The Sun goes back to April 1989 .
At the time of writing that is almost 17 years ago .
On April 15th 1989 a disaster took place which resulted in the deaths of ninety - six Liverpool supporters at Hillsborough , the home ground of Sheffield Wednesday , during an FA Cup semi-final between Liverpool and Nottingham Forest .
Ninety - six people had their lives crushed out of them .
Many more are said to have ended their own lives since as a consequence of that disaster .
A lot of injustices came out of that disaster , far too many to list here .
For more information visit the Hillsborough Justice Campaign website at http://www.contrast.org/hillsborough and please try to support them .
This article concentrates on one piece of injustice that could so easily have been avoided .
That could so easily have been made a little better , if not fixed , in the intervening years .
Lies were printed as fact in a British newspaper , and that newspaper has still not made an unconditional apology for what it printed .
Its editor of the time has never made an unconditional apology in all of that time .
The headlines and sub-headlines on the front page of The Sun newspaper on the Wednesday following the disaster were as follows :
“ The Truth .
Some fans picked pockets of victims
Some fans urinated on the brave cops
Some fans beat up PC giving kiss of life . ”
So just four days after their loved ones had died , four days after they had narrowly escaped death themselves , Liverpool supporters were confronted with those headlines .
People actually believed those headlines .
Those who were there did not believe the headlines of course , nor did those who knew people who had been there .
Unfortunately though a lot of people did believe those headlines ; people who were not Liverpool supporters , perhaps supporters of another team or people who did not follow football at all .
The headlines sewed seeds in so many people ’s minds that the 96 supporters died at the hands of their own kind .
All lies , all proven to be lies , yet never put right by that publication .
For more on the media coverage , visit http://www.contrast.org/hillsborough/history/media.shtm,
http://football.guardian.co.uk and Wikipedia .
The Wikipedia article says : “ The story accompanying these headlines claimed that ‘ drunken Liverpool fans viciously attacked rescue workers as they tried to revive victims ’ and ‘ police officers , firemen and ambulance crew were punched , kicked and urinated upon ’ .
A quote , attributed to an unnamed policeman , claimed that a dead girl had been abused and that Liverpool fans ‘ were openly urinating on us and the bodies of the dead ’ . ”
Read that last bit again , it really was printed in a national newspaper .
Liverpool legend and the manager of the club at the time Kenny Dalglish was greatly affected by the tragedy .
He attended numerous funerals and visited people in hospital , some of whom were in comas ; he spent time with those that had lost their loved ones .
In his autobiography he talks about the Disaster and recalls the media coverage :
“ The press coverage was difficult to comprehend , particularly the publication of pictures which added to people ’s distress .
There was one photograph of two girls right up against the Leppings Lane fence , their faces pressed into the wire .
Nobody knows how they escaped .
They used to come to Melwood every day , looking for autographs , and that photograph upset everyone there because we knew them .
After seeing that I could n’t look at the papers again .
When the Sun came out with the story about Liverpool fans being drunk and unruly , underneath a headline ‘ The Truth , ’ the reaction on Merseyside was one of complete outrage .
Newsagents stopped stocking the Sun. People would n’t mention its name .
They were burning copies of it .
Anyone representing the Sun was abused .
Sun reporters and photographers would lie , telling people they worked for the Liverpool Post and Echo .
There was a lot of harassment of them because of what had been written .
The Star had gone a bit strong as well but they apologised the next day .
They knew the story had no foundation .
Kelvin MacKenzie , the Sun ’s editor , even called me up .
“ How can we correct the situation ? ” he said .
“ You know that big headline – ‘ The Truth ’ ? ” I replied .
“ All you have to do is put ‘ We lied ’ in the same size .
Then you might be all right . ”
Mackenzie said : “ I can not do that . ” “ Well , ” I replied , “ I can not help you then . ”
That was it .
I put the phone down .
Merseysiders were outraged by the Sun . A great many still are .
There is no excuse for buying or reading The Sun .
None whatsoever .
If you read that newspaper , or worse still you buy that newspaper , after reading this article and those other articles that are linked to , then you are not fit to call yourself a Red .
If you support another team , you should still be able to see why that newspaper should be boycotted .
No matter what competitions they are running .
Regardless of any “ exclusives ” they claim to have , even if it is the only paper left in the shop .
Saying you bought it to get some tokens to help your daughter ’s school to buy a new computer is not going to get you off the hook .
It ’s really simple :
Do n’t buy the Sun .

TRACKING THE SURGE ….
AP does its own tracking of violence in Iraq and has just released its report for July .
Here ’s a summary :
The overall death toll is down from its peak , but is still about double the rate from last summer .
A military spokesman differed , saying fatalities are at their lowest level since June 2006 , but “ offered no statistics to back his claim . ”
As nearly everyone predicted , many of the insurgents have simply moved out of Baghdad into other areas : “ Initial calculations validate fears that the Baghdad crackdown would push militants into districts north of the capital … .
In July , the AP figures show 35 percent of all war - related killings occurred in northern provinces .
The figure one year ago was 22 percent . ”
Residents are fleeing : “ The number of displaced Iraqis has more than doubled since the start of the year , from 447,337 on Jan. 1 to 1.14 million on July 31 . ”
Take this for what it ’s worth .
Apparently , violence is down from its peak earlier this year , but since that ’s the normal seasonal pattern it ’s hard to say how meaningful it is .
In any case , it ’s obvious that even the Pentagon is n’t putting any stock in these figures .
In a briefing on Friday , Brig .
Gen. Richard Sherlock warned that “ insurgents might try intensify attacks in Iraq to coincide with three milestones : the sixth anniversary of the Sept. 11 attacks in the U.S. , the beginning of Ramadan and the report to Congress . ”
In others words , they know perfectly well that the recent decline is mostly seasonal and they expect the numbers to go back up later this year .
Bottom line : they ’re simultaneously trying to suggest that the surge is responsible for the recent seasonal decline in fatalities and preemptively insisting that no one should blame the surge when seasonal deaths go back up in the fall .
At least , that ’s how it reads to me .
Your mileage may vary .
ISTANBUL , Oct. 21 — After a call from Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice , Turkish Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan said he would not immediately send his troops into Iraq in response to an ambush by Kurdish separatists that had killed at least 12 Turkish soldiers on Sunday .
Mr. Erdogan said he had told Ms. Rice in a phone conversation Sunday night that Turkey expected “ speedy steps from U.S. ” in cracking down on Kurdish rebels , and according to The Associated Press , he said that she had expressed sympathy and asked “ for a few days ” from him .
The Iraqi government also began a concerted effort to reach out to Turkey .
“ Our anger is great , ” Mr. Erdogan said on national television here before he conferred with Turkey ’s top political and military officials in an emergency security meeting .
“ We have the decisiveness to act on these events in cold - blood , and so we are determined . ”
The early - morning attack , which were condemned by Iraqi officials and the Bush administration , sharply increased the pressure on Turkey ’s government to ignore the wishes of its American allies and send troops into northern Iraq .
The North has long wanted to be removed from the terror list
The foreign ministry statement , carried by the state news agency , follows a meeting in Geneva this weekend between nuclear envoys from both nations .
Washington said the talks resulted in a pledge by the North to disable its nuclear facilities .
Analysts had predicted the North could soon be removed from the list , but the US has so far made no mention of it .
North Korea has long wanted to be taken off the list to improve its standing internationally .
' Clear willingness '
A spokesman for the North Korean foreign ministry said the move was agreed to during the weekend 's bilateral talks .
NUCLEAR TIMELINE 2007 Feb : N Korea agrees to shut down its nuclear programme in return for energy aid and other benefits April : Deadline to " shut down and seal " Yongbyon reactor missed June : Row over N Korean funds frozen in Macau bank resolved July : N Korea shuts down and seals Yongbyon reactor in first phase of deal Sept : N Korea agrees to declare and disable its nuclear facilities by the end of the year
Q&A : N Korea stand - off Timeline : Nuclear crisis
" The US agreed to take political and economic compensation measures such as deleting our country from the list of terror supporting nations and fully lifting sanctions imposed under the law on trading with enemy countries , " he was quoted by the KCNA news agency as saying .
Washington 's chief negotiator Christopher Hill said on Sunday that Pyongyang had agreed to declare and disable all its nuclear facilities by the end of this year .
His comment was backed up by his North Korean counterpart Kim Kye- gwan , who said : " We showed clear willingness to declare and dismantle all nuclear facilities " .
The full details of the agreement are expected to be discussed when the six nations involved in the nuclear negotiations meet in China later this month .
But Mr Hill has so far made no mention of Washington considering taking North Korea off its list of countries it believes support terrorism .
MOSCOW ( Reuters ) - Russia will file a claim to the gigantic mineral wealth of the Arctic seabed with the United Nations by the end of the year , Russia ’s natural resources minister said on Tuesday .

Russia will file a claim to the gigantic mineral wealth of the Arctic seabed with the United Nations by the end of the year , Russia 's natural resources minister was quoted as saying on Tuesday .
REUTERS / Reuters Television
Russia , the world ’s biggest country , says a whole swathe of the Arctic seabed should belong to Moscow because the area is really an extension of the Siberian continental shelf .
Natural Resources Minister Yuri Trutnev told the Russkaya Sluzhba Novostei radio station that Russia would submit its claim with the United Nations this year , according to a transcript of the interview supplied by his ministry .
“ We can hardly start the economic exploitation of this territory , which is beyond Russia ’s borders , without the agreement of other countries , without the agreement of the UN , ” Trutnev told the radio station .
“ The scientists think that the data for submitting a claim is sufficient .
We will fight for Russia ’s right to this plot , ” he said , adding that the bid would be ready by the end of the year .
Russia , already the world ’s second biggest oil exporter after Saudi Arabia , is in a race with Canada , Denmark , Norway and the United States to control the giant reserves of oil , gas and precious metals that would become more accessible if global warming shrinks the ice cap .
Russian officials say the Lomonosov ridge , a vast underwater mountain range that runs underneath the Arctic , is an extension of the Siberian continental shelf .
A Russian expedition under the North Pole this August took samples of the seabed and planted a Russian flag to symbolically stake the Kremlin ’s claim .
Canada , Norway , Russia , the United States and Denmark -- which governs Greenland -- all have a shoreline within the Arctic Circle , and have a 200 - mile economic zone around the north of their coastlines .
Under the United Nations Law of the Sea treaty , any state with an Arctic coastline that wishes to stake a claim to a greater share of the Arctic must lodge its submission with the U.N. ’s Commission on the Limits of the Continental Shelf .
Russia lodged a claim with the UN commission in 2001 .
It responded a year later by recommending Russia make a revised submission with additional research .
Since then , Moscow has been attempting to gather scientific evidence to back its claim .
Russian geologists estimate the Arctic seabed has at least 9 billion to 10 billion metric tons of fuel equivalent , about the same as Russia ’s total oil reserves .
But Trutnev said current Russian official estimates were of up to 5 billion metric tons of hydro - carbon resources .
Asked if there was a struggle for the Arctic , he said : “ More like real competition . ”
( CNN ) -- Conservative Sen. Larry Craig got support from an unexpected source on Monday .
The American Civil Liberties Union filed a brief in court saying the lawmaker 's bathroom bust was likely unconstitutional .
The ACLU filed a brief in court saying Sen. Larry Craig 's arrest was likely unconstitutional .
The ACLU urged a Minnesota District Court to let Craig withdraw his guilty plea .
" Sen .
Craig has not always been a great friend of civil liberties , but you should n't have to endorse the civil liberties of others to keep your own , " said ACLU Executive Director Anthony Romero , alluding to Craig 's history of voting against gay rights .
Craig , R - Idaho , was arrested in June at Minneapolis - St. Paul International Airport in Minnesota after a police officer in a bathroom stall next to him alleged the senator attempted to solicit sex .
Craig pleaded guilty August 8 to one charge of disorderly conduct .
When the case came to light earlier this month , Craig announced his intention to resign September 30 .
But days later , it was announced Craig would fight to overturn his conviction and may not resign .
He filed papers September 10 to withdraw his guilty plea .
The ACLU friend - of - the - court brief was submitted to the Minnesota 4th District Court .
" The real motive behind secret sting operations like the one that resulted in Sen .
Craig 's arrest is not to stop people from inappropriate activity .
It is to make as many arrests as possible -- arrests that sometimes unconstitutionally trap innocent people , " Romero said in a written statement .
Do n't Miss Craig files to withdraw guilty plea
Police must be able to demonstrate beyond a doubt that the sex was going to happen in public , he said .
Regardless of whether it occurs in a bathroom or a bar , solicitation for private sex is protected speech under the First Amendment , the ACLU argues .
If the police really wanted to stop people from having sex in public bathrooms , they " should put up a sign banning sex in the restroom and send in a uniformed officer to patrol periodically , " Romero said .
Patrick Hogan of the Metropolitan Airports Commission said Monday that authorities are prepared to defend the way Craig 's arrest was carried out , as well as at least 41 similar arrests made this year in the same public restroom .
" Engaging in public sex in a bathroom is a crime and most people understand that without putting up a sign , " Hogan said .
" We saw a lot of communication about this particular bathroom on Web sites , and if we make it known that we 're aware of it we can't be expected to enforce the law as effectively . "
Hogan added , " We believe the charges fit the crime and Sen. Craig agreed to the charges as part of plea negotiations . "
Craig has strongly denied he is gay .
In an audiotaped police interview between him and the arresting officer , he repeatedly proclaimed he did nothing wrong .
The officer said Craig tapped his right foot on the floor , which the officer said he recognized " as a signal used by persons wishing to engage in lewd conduct , " according to a police report .
The report alleges Craig then touched the officer 's foot with his foot and the senator " proceeded to swipe his hand under the stall divider several times . "
At that point , the officer said , he put his police identification down by the floor so Craig could see it and informed the senator he was under arrest , before any sexual contact took place .
" Government should make public restrooms safe for all , but it should do so in a manner that is really designed to stop inappropriate behavior , rather than destroying the lives of people who might have no intention of doing anything illegal , " Romero said .
Craig has supported a federal constitutional amendment banning same - sex marriage .
In 1996 , he voted in favor of the Defense of Marriage Act , which denies federal recognition to same - sex marriages and prevents states from being forced to recognize the marriages of gay and lesbian couples legally performed in other states .
Craig has also opposed expanding the federal hate crimes law to cover offenses motivated by anti-gay bias .

1. Gravity is not the same over the surface of the Earth
It turns out that in some places you will feel slightly heavier than others .
A low spot can be seen just off the coast of India , while a relative high occurs in the South Pacific Ocean .
The cause of these irregularities is unknown since present surface features do not appear dominant .
NASA 's [ 2 ]
2. Atmosphere ' escapes '
Due to thermal energy , some of the molecules at the outer edge of the Earth 's atmosphere have their velocity increased to the point where they can escape from the planet 's gravity .
This results in a slow but steady leakage of the atmosphere into space .
Because unfixed hydrogen has a low molecular weight , it can achieve escape velocity more readily and it leaks into outer space at a greater rate . [ 61 ]
For this reason , the Earth 's current environment is oxidizing , rather than reducing , with consequences for the chemical nature of life which developed on the planet .
The oxygen - rich atmosphere also preserves much of the surviving hydrogen by locking it up in water molecules .
3 . The Earth is slowing down
As a result of variation in gravitational forces due to the moon , the sun and other planets in the solar system , displacements of matter in different in different parts of the planets and other excitation mechanisms , the rotational speed of the Earth about it 's axis varies in time .
Recently , days have been getting shorter by hundredths of a second , which implies that the angular velocity of the Earth has been increasing .
The factors causing this increasing in the Earth 's rotational velocity have not been determined .
The rotation data shows oscillations over several different timescales .
The one with the largest variation is seasonal : Earth slows down in January and February . [ 2 ] [ 3 ]
4. Van Allen radiation belt
The Van Allen Radiation Belt is a torus of energetic charged particles ( plasma ) around Earth , held in place by Earth 's magnetic field .
Apollo astronauts who traveled to the moon spent very little time in the belts but probably have a slightly higher risk of cancer during their .
NASA said that they deliberately timed Apollo launches , and used lunar transfer orbits that only skirted the edge of the belt over the equator to minimize the radiation .
Besides , there have been nuclear tests in space that have caused artificial radiation belts .
Starfish Prime , a high altitude nuclear test created an artificial radiation belt that damaged or destroyed as many as one third of the satellites in low earth orbit at the time . [ 2 ]
5 . Moon is moving away from Earth
The reasons why have to do with tides and conservation of energy and angular momentum .
Measurements have been collected now for over 25 years , and it is clear that the Moon 's orbit is slowly growing larger and that the Moon is moving away from the Earth .
The net result is that the Moon is receding from the Earth at about 4 centimeters a year .
However , astronomers have predicted that when the Sun enters the red giant phase in around 5 billion years - during the red giant phase of the Sun - both Earth and Moon will be affected by the Sun 's extended atmosphere and will aproach again .
Then the Moon will swing ever closer to Earth until it reaches a point 11,470 miles ( 18,470 kilometers ) above our planet , a point termed the Roche limit .
The result : Moon will be torn to pieces and will be scattered to form a spectacular 23,000 - mile - diameter ( 37,000 - kilometer ) Saturn - like ring of debris above Earth 's equator . [ 2 ]
6. Moon has a tidal effect on the atmosphere
The Moon have a tidal effect on the atmosphere as well as the oceans .
Theory predicts stronger lunar pressure oscillations in the tropics but their amplitude rarely exceeds 100 microbars or 0.01 percent of the average surface pressure .
Detection of such a tiny signal masked by much larger pressure variations associated with weather phenomena required the development of special statistical techniques and the accumulation of a long series of regular observations .
It is common for atmospheric waves to grow in amplitude with height as the air becomes thinner .
The lunar tide , however , remains weak compared to the solar tide in the upper atmosphere .
7 . The Chandler wobble
The Chandler wobble is a small variation in Earth 's axis of rotation , discovered by American astronomer Seth Carlo Chandler in 1891 .
It amounts to 0.7 arcseconds over a period of 433 days .
In other words , Earth 's poles move in an irregular circle of 3 to 15 metres in diameter , in an oscillation .
The cause is unknown .
On 18 July 2000 , the Jet Propulsion Laboratory announced that " the principal cause of the Chandler wobble is fluctuating pressure on the bottom of the ocean , caused by temperature and salinity changes and wind - driven changes in the circulation of the oceans .
However , on janauary - february 2006 scientist noticed the Chandler wobble had stopped and there was a near six week period in which a significant pause occurred .
This anomaly has been of great interest in gaining a better understanding , but it is not yet known if this has or will cause any catastrophic changes in the overall rotation axis of the planet .
8. Earth electric charge
Since 1917 scientists have known that the earth 's surface is charged with negative electricity , but no one knew for sure what keeps it charged .
In areas of fair weather , an electric current flows between the earth and the air in a direction which would tend to dissipate the charge .
It is not much of a current : only about 1,500 amperes , not much more for the entire earth than flows in a few power lines .
But the electricity taken from the earth must be restored somehow or the earth 's electric charge would soon drain away .
An obvious guess is that thunderstorms somehow restore the lost charge , but no one had proved it .
Three years ago the institution borrowed airplanes from the Air Force and began to measure electrical stirring in the still air above active thunderheads .
Sure enough , the instruments showed a current moving in the opposite direction to the current in fair - weather areas .
The scientists figured that all the thunderstorms going on at one time generate a net current of about 1,500 amperes , just enough to balance the drain and keep the earth 's charge constant .

According to
10 . Earth 's magnetic poles change places
The poles on the Earth have changed places - many times !
We can tell this has happened because the magnetic moment of the rocks that make up the ocean floor have an alternating direction .
Which direction they exhibit depends on which way the poles were oriented when the rocks were being formed at the mid-ocean ridge .
During a reversal , which can take thousands of years , the magnetic poles start to wander away from the region around the spin poles , and eventually end up switched around .
Sometimes this wandering is slow and steady , and other times it occurs in several jumps .

It turns out that in some places you will feel slightly heavier than others .
A low spot can be seen just off the coast of India , while a relative high occurs in the South Pacific Ocean .
The cause of these irregularities is unknown since present surface features do not appear dominant .
NASA 's GRACE twin satellites , launched in March 2002 , are making detailed measurements of Earth 's gravity field which will lead to discoveries about gravity and Earth 's natural systems . [ 1 ]
Due to thermal energy , some of the molecules at the outer edge of the Earth 's atmosphere have their velocity increased to the point where they can escape from the planet 's gravity .
This results in a slow but steady leakage of the atmosphere into space .
Because unfixed hydrogen has a low molecular weight , it can achieve escape velocity more readily and it leaks into outer space at a greater rate . [ 61 ]
For this reason , the Earth 's current environment is oxidizing , rather than reducing , with consequences for the chemical nature of life which developed on the planet .
The oxygen - rich atmosphere also preserves much of the surviving hydrogen by locking it up in water molecules . [ 1 ]
As a result of variation in gravitational forces due to the moon , the sun and other planets in the solar system , displacements of matter in different in different parts of the planets and other excitation mechanisms , the rotational speed of the Earth about it 's axis varies in time .
Recently , days have been getting shorter by hundredths of a second , which implies that the angular velocity of the Earth has been increasing .
The factors causing this increasing in the Earth 's rotational velocity have not been determined .
The rotation data shows oscillations over several different timescales .
The one with the largest variation is seasonal : Earth slows down in January and February . [ 1 ]
The Van Allen Radiation Belt is a torus of energetic charged particles ( plasma ) around Earth , held in place by Earth 's magnetic field .
Apollo astronauts who traveled to the moon spent very little time in the belts but probably have a slightly higher risk of cancer during their .

Besides , there have been nuclear tests in space that have caused artificial radiation belts .
Starfish Prime , a high altitude nuclear test created an artificial radiation belt that damaged or destroyed as many as one third of the satellites in low earth orbit at the time . [ 1 ]
The reasons why have to do with tides and conservation of energy and angular momentum .
Measurements have been collected now for over 25 years , and it is clear that the Moon 's orbit is slowly growing larger and that the Moon is moving away from the Earth .

Carrie Davis Cousar , Miss South Carolina 1992 , sued the pageant and settled a short time later ; the terms were not disclosed .
Last year , the South Carolina secretary of state investigated the Miss South Carolina competition and fined it $ 2,000 in March for not having its financial papers in order .
Pageant organizers and contestants at the local and state levels describe a system plagued by weak oversight and run largely by 100,000 volunteers .
The local competitions , franchised by the 52 state pageants , have no legal ties to the national organization , though they feed contestants into the national pageant , which moved to Las Vegas from Atlantic City last year and will be broadcast on the TLC cable channel in January .
And the local pageants vary in how well they are administered , contestants and administrators say .
Safiya Songhai , Miss Five Boroughs of New York in 2004 , said she struggled to get the $ 1,000 scholarship she won .
“ I had been warned by a girl who won before me that I ’m not going to see that money , ” said Ms. Songhai , who said that in contrast , she had no problem collecting $ 5,000 as a runner - up to Miss District of Columbia in 2001 and 2003 .
She filed and won a case by default in small claims court in Manhattan after the director of the Miss Five Boroughs Scholarship Pageant failed to respond to messages left over five months .
When she still had not received her scholarship , she took her story to a local television station .
She was paid within two days of the broadcast of her account , she said .
The organizer of the now - disbanded pageant did not return calls for comment .
“ Basically , if I had n’t gone after them , I would n’t have gotten my money , ” Ms. Songhai said .
“ There is no real checks and balances to make sure the contestants get their money . ”
She said that competing in Miss Five Boroughs was fun , but added , “ They are disorganized and they are bad with money management . ”

Republicans plot fall offensive
Confronting a dire outlook for next year ’s elections , House Republicans have begun to fight back with a new three - pronged strategy : painting the new Democratic majority as part of an unpopular Washington status quo , forcing Democrats to make unpopular votes on tough issues and locking arms around a new GOP issues agenda .
House Republicans might well be expected to be watching their better - funded , in some cases cocky , Democratic competitors from the fetal position .

Public opinion remains sour about the White House and the war in Iraq , and some House Republicans in tough districts have exacerbated the party ’s weaknesses by deciding to retire , giving Democrats a better chance of picking up some choice swing seats .
Indeed , many strategists in both parties see a likelihood that the GOP minority will lose even more ground in both the House and the Senate come Nov. 4 , 2008 .
The current lineup in the House is 233 Democrats and 200 Republicans , with two GOP seats vacant because of members ’ deaths .
But House Republicans came out punching this week after a slow start to the election cycle , filing a respectable quarterly financial report and vowing to make Democrats ’ lives as miserable as possible .
A crucial aspect of their new offensive : Make Democrats the public face of Capitol Hill at a time when polls show the public is disgusted with Washington in general and Congress in particular .
The new spirit of resistance was on display Tuesday night when the National Republican Congressional Committee , the GOP ’s House campaign arm , seized on a weaker - than - expected showing by Niki Tsongas ( D ) , who won a special election for the Fifth District of Massachusetts , garnering 51 percent to her opponent ’s 45 percent .
The heavily Democratic House seat was once held by her late husband .
She will succeed former Rep. Marty Meehan , who resigned to become chancellor of the University of Massachusetts - Lowell .
In an overstatement that Democrats regarded as laughable , the NRCC blared in a Tuesday night e-mail to supporters : “ THE DEMOCRATIC WAVE BREAKS . ”
The e-mail went on to argue that “ Democrats Wo n’t Get Two ‘ 2006 ’s in a Row , ” and contended : “ In what is clearly shaping up to be a change election , Democrats have reason to worry , as they are no longer seen as the solution to the problem in Washington — Democrats have become part of the problem in Washington . ”
Brian Kennedy , communications director for House Minority Leader John A. Boehner ( R - Ohio ) , said the GOP plans to portray its opponents as “ the same old tax - and - spend Democratic Party people remember from the 1970s . ”
At the same time , Kennedy said , his party is working to “ re-establish the Republican brand ” by using parliamentary maneuvers that require Democrats to take tough votes on problematic provisions that have been added to popular legislation .
Kennedy said Democrats , especially those from conservative districts , have been backed into a corner on immigration and whether to provide government benefits to undocumented aliens , national security , intelligence and taxation — all “ red- meat Republican issues , ” he said .
“ We are increasingly defining the differences , ” Kennedy said .
As a third part of the strategy , Republicans will unveil an agenda after January 2008 that Boehner has described as “ innovative , dynamic solutions to the challenges Americans face every day . ”
However , the GOP leader has yet to spell out exactly what those solutions are , and the promised agenda is already months late in being formulated .
Jessica Boulanger , the NRCC ’s communications director , added that the tight Massachusetts outcome reflected the price Democrats are paying for anti-Washington sentiment , and said the race provides a blueprint “ for how Republicans can win in this environment . ”
“ There really is a light at the end of the tunnel , ” she said .
Democrats chortled at the Republican professions of confidence .
Jennifer Crider , communications director of the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee , accused Republicans of “ trying to use the same playbook ” that Democrats had when they were in the minority .
“ When average Americans think about Washington , they think about George W. Bush , ” Crider said , adding that Democrats would portray their opponents as rubber stamps for the White House .
Asked about the tough votes Democrats had been forced to take , she said : “ Our members are representing their districts , and their votes reflect their districts . ”
Nevertheless , Republicans could smile this week when they reported that their targeted House members had posted strong fundraising numbers in the third quarter .
The 17 GOP members running for reelection on the campaign committee ’s ROMP program , designed to protect vulnerable incumbents , narrowly outraised their Democratic counterparts :
Those incumbents raised an average of $ 274,400 for the quarter , while the 29 members on the Democrats ’
Frontline program raised an average of $ 259,000 .
It was the first bit of good financial news this cycle for the House Republicans , whose campaign committee is nearly broke and has a small fraction of the money that the DCCC has amassed .
The NRCC chairman , Rep. Tom Cole ( R - Okla . ) , met with reporters Wednesday and said he plans a decentralized approach that leaves many key decisions to individual campaigns .
Cole said he believes that the country ’s unabated anger toward Washington makes that the perfect approach this election cycle , since voters are distrustful of anything that smells of the Beltway .
“ We ’re not going to be able to control the battlefield , and it ’s useless to think we can , ” said Cole , a former campaign manager himself .
Money and retirements remain the biggest challenges for House Republicans this cycle , Cole said .
Democratic lawmakers have transferred twice as much money to the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee as Republicans have transferred to the NRCC through the third fundraising quarter of this year .
While fewer GOP incumbents have called it quits this year than during the last Congress , the party is more sensitive to those retirements this time around because some represent unsafe seats and because each departure affects morale in some small way .
Some Republicans welcome the retirements because the party needs new blood , and because a younger member will be willing to work harder than many of the entrenched incumbents who have retired or considered calling it quits .
“ The best time to do it is in a presidential election year , ” said House Minority Whip Roy Blunt ( R - Mo. ) , since candidates will benefit from the high turnout in some of the safer districts .
“ I ’d rather have the retirements this year than in the next cycle . ”
Members laud Cole as a strong recruiter , and the campaign chief often touts his current crop of candidates .
Republicans have scored recruits with varying backgrounds .
Several candidates have been touting their military experience , like retired Air Force Maj.
Gen. Rick Goddard in Georgia ( against Rep. Jim Marshall ) and Naval Reserve Officer Pete Olson in Texas ( against Rep. Nick Lampson ) .
Others , like Chris Hackett in Pennsylvania ( against freshman Rep. Christopher P. Carney ) and Andrew Saul in New York ( against freshman Rep. John Hall ) , have backgrounds in business and the ability to pay for their own campaigns in whole or in part .
Some Republican members — including Boehner — had complained that Cole ’s committee got off to a slow start .
But after Boehner went public with his ire in an unusual public spat with Cole , a House GOP leadership aide says the message was clearly received from the “ kick in the pants . ”
“ There ’s been an uptick in their productivity , ” the leadership aide said .
“ They ’re ratcheting up their fundraising and there ’s a stronger communications output . ”

U.S. HAS MASSIVE OIL RESERVES SHALE REMAINS UNTAPPED AFTER DECADES OF FAILURE By Christopher J. Petherick
There is an estimated 2 trillion barrels of oil buried beneath parts of Colorado , Utah and Wyoming .
Geologists , petroleum companies and the federal government have known about these massive deposits for nearly a century .
The trouble has always been : how do you get at it ?
It is believed that the shale deposits in the Green River region of Colorado , Utah and Wyoming are holding the equivalent of approximately 1.5 trillion to 1.8 trillion barrels of oil .
Called oil shale  or  shale oil ,  according to scientists and petroleum companies , much of it cannot be recovered with current technology due to the costly processing involved and the depth of the deposits buried beneath the Rocky Mountains .
Still , if only half can be extracted , scientists believe the amount is nearly triple the oil reserves of Saudi Arabia .
There has been quite a bit of hype surrounding the shale oil deposits of late .
The problem with this , however , is that the type of oil in the western United States is contained in fine - grained sedimentary rockshence the name  shale oil . 
NOT REALLY OIL
Technically , it is not really oil at this stage , say geologists .
It s kerogen sort of an oil - like substance that , when heated in an expensive , laborious process , can be turned into a lower - grade oil , which can then be used in cars .
Walter Youngquist , a geologist from Eugene , Ore. , published an article on the web site of the World Energy Council which delves into this subject .
Youngquist put it this way :
The term oil shale is a misnomer .
It does not contain oil nor is it commonly shale .
The organic material is chiefly kerogen , and the shale is usually a relatively hard rock , called marl .
Properly processed , kerogen can be converted into a substance somewhat similar to petroleum .
However , it has not gone through the oil window of heat ( natures way of producing oil ) and therefore , to be changed into an oil - like substance , it must be heated to a high temperature .
By this process the organic material is converted into a liquid , which must be further processed to produce an oil which is said to be better than the lowest grade of oil produced from conventional oil deposits , but of lower quality than the upper grades of conventional oil .
There are currently two main processes for refining shale oil , both of which are capital and labor intensive .
In one method , the shale is broken down on - site and heated .
The gases and liquids can then be extracted .
In the second , the shale oil is removed and transported to facilities where it is then heated and refined .
NO SECRET
It is no secret that there is a potential oil bonanza in Colorado , Utah and Wyoming .
The Association of Petroleum Geologists ( APG ) reports that in the 1900s , oil companies began looking into the deposits in this part of the United States .
In fact , in the 1920s , thousands of so - called oil placer claims  were filed on public lands following a rules change by the federal government that allowed private companies to lease government - managed land and extract the natural resources there .
Large deposits of shale oil are also not unique to the United States .
In fact , there are huge reserves of the substance all around the world , from China to Australia to Scotland to South Africa .
But , once again , the problem rests with the expense of getting to it and processing it .
In the mid -to - late 19th century , France and Scotland extracted large deposits and processed it for their own purposes .
For the most part , the shale oil deposits in the United States were ignored in the United States up until the oil crisis of the late 1970s forced petroleum companies to begin thinking about alternative sources of oil .
However , since then , the price of gas has been rock bottom so oil companies motivated by huge profits and not the need to ensure that the United States is energy self - sufficient have been avoiding spending the money to research new techniques for refining shale oil .
Today , as oil prices creep up again , petroleum companies are again looking at shale oil despite its high price tag , evidenced by the fact that the Bureau of Land Management ( BLM ) has requests from multinational oil conglomerates to extract shale oil in the Green River region .
But even with modern technology , the difficulties associated with extracting and processing shale oil have forced even some of the largest oil companies to drop out of the game .
An April 11 article in Colorados daily newspaper , The Rocky Mountain News , noted that the BLM began accepting proposals by companies to develop the shale oil in the Western part of the United States in the summer of 2005 .
But BLM officials , citing various reasons , have already rejected bids put forth by 14 out of 18 companies , including an offer by Exxon Mobil .
The BLM said it dumped Exxon Mobil because it did not appear to be dedicating enough resources to shale oil research .
But Exxon is reportedly notorious in that part of the country .
According to The Rocky Mountain News , many Coloradans still remember  Black Sunday ,  or May 2 , 1982 , when Exxon execs announced the closure of a shale oil processing facility that had been running for decades in western Colorado .
The closure put 2,200 people out of work in that part of the state , resulting in a rash of bankruptcies and foreclosures , which hurt the locals for many years after .
Shell has reportedly been studying ways to extract oil shale on land in Colorado since the 1990s .
The company said it hopes to have a full - blown operation by 2010 .
Two others reportedly still in the running include Chevron and the Texas - based EGL Resources .
Industry experts are optimistic that , with help from the government , new techniques can be developed to economically extract oil from the shale deposits and process it with relative ease .

Preface
Since the publication of " The Unearthing " in April 2007 , the Truth Movement has continued to gain momentum , contrary to everything Truth deniers and obstructionists do and say to try and stop Truth 's exponential surge .
Like the snowball effect , the movement continues to grow in numbers , reaching unprecedented gains , seemingly catapulting expectations and offering proof that the more people see Truth , the greater the hunger for Justice and the search for Change .
The Truth Movement has begun to reach critical mass , in spite of the system 's hurdles and vast propaganda apparatus , in spite of its entrenched censorship and gatekeeping machinery .
Truth , it has now become apparent , cannot be contained , it can not be silenced , it can not be imprisoned .
The subsequent search for Justice , the second quest in our Movement , just like her sister Truth , likewise cannot be squashed .
For Justice for 3,000 murdered victims and for those 9/11 First Responders now dying and suffering is a thirst our species seeks to satisfy .
Attaining Truth and Justice , when both have been hijacked , are principles embedded in every decent human being , for these are part of what makes us what we are , what makes us , though at times primitive , a great species to behold , with so much to offer Earth , with so much potential and universal capacity for good .

Comment below on how you would use these gloves .
Lambda the Ultimate pick out some quotes from a blog post by Ralph Johnson .
The thing that bugs me about [ Armstrong 's ] book ( and about his talks ) is that he make more fuss than he should about the functional language aspect of Erlang and not enough about the OO aspect .
In fact , he denies that it is OO .
As I 've been looking more and more at Erlang it strikes me more and more that there is an object oriented language hiding just below the surface .
Ralph sums it up very well :
“ sequential Erlang ” is a functional programming language … “ concurrent Erlang ” is an object - oriented language .
Whenever I 've thought about this I 've thought that I must be mistaken given Joe Armstrong 's dislike of object oriented systems ( something I 've written about before ) .
Daniel Lyons ' response to my article was interesting , but not as interesting as some of the Erlang he sent me via email to illustrate his points .
As an example he sent this code for a counter service :
- module ( counter ) .
- export ( [ start/ 0 , stop/0 , increment / 0 , decrement / 0 , current_count/0 , counter_server / 1 ] ) . start ( ) -> register ( counter_server , spawn ( ?
MODULE , counter_server , [ 0 ] ) ) .
stop ( ) -> counter_server ! stop. counter_server ( Count ) -> receive increment -> counter_server ( Count+1 ) ; decrement -> counter_server ( Count - 1 ) ; {value , Pid} ->
Pid !
{ value , Count} , counter_server ( Count ) ; stop -> true end .
increment ( ) -> counter_server ! increment . decrement ( ) -> counter_server ! decrement . current_count( ) -> counter_server !
{ value , self ( ) } , receive {value , Count} -> io : format ( " Received value : ~w~n " , [ Count ] ) ; _ -> io :format ( " error~n " ) end .
The counter itself is this bit :
counter_server ( Count ) -> receive increment -> counter_server ( Count+1 ) ; decrement -> counter_server ( Count - 1 ) ; {value , Pid} ->
Pid !
{ value , Count} , counter_server ( Count ) ; stop -> true end .
In essence it is an object which receives one of three messages .
Note that the implementation of the methods is in a functional style , but the counter_server itself is clearly an implementation of an object .
But an implementation in a language which does n't abstract out the object oriented message passing .
This implementation of a message dispatcher - as - switch - statement is familiar to anybody who has written message pumps in GUI applications ( notwithstanding that Erlang 's “ switch statements ” are much smarter than those in most other languages ) .
Here is the same global counter service implemented in Mahlee ( a concurrent message passing language extension to JavaScript ) :
function Counter ( initial ) { this .value = ( initial || 0 ) ; this .
increment = function ( ) { return ++ this.value ; } this .decrement = function ( ) { return -- this.value ; } this .current = function ( ) { return this .value ; } }
Here the message dispatching abstraction is built into the language so the switch statement is gone .
It turns out that this is n't the only advantage though .
Because the construction and object handling is also abstracted out at the language level we do n't need to worry about any of this within the implementation of the counter .
Most importantly , because object oriented languages also abstract out the message passing itself all of the explicit message sending that the Erlang version needs to do is also gone .
There is a subtle point about the difference between using futures and messages to do with deadlocking .
Mahlee supports both idioms so as a developer you are expected to understand these deadlocking issues .
In Erlang you can only return a value via a new message which guarantees there will be no deadlocks , but makes getting values from a method invocation much harder .
It turns out that the Mahlee counter object above is guaranteed to be deadlock free despite the use of futures because the object itself never sends any message to another Mahlee object .
It is this point about how messages are handled that guarantees Erlang is lock free , not anything to do with the functional nature of the object implementations .
The counter is a bit longer , but much simpler to understand .
Critically the implementation scales much better to more complex objects because we are using suitable abstractions to do the heavy lifting of the message dispatching and binding .
Here is some code that uses the object :
function main ( ) { var count_server = Mahlee.create ( Counter ) ; count_server.increment ( ) ; count_server.decrement ( ) ; FHost.echo( count_server.current () .result ( ) ) ; }
Note that the only difference between creating one of these objects to be accessible from all threads in Mahlee and only within one thread in Mahlee ( a Mahlee object , or a normal JavaScript object respectively ) is only in how the object is constructed .
JavaScript already has message passing built into the syntax of the language so Mahlee is able to re-use that abstraction ( it only re-routes the messages to the object in the remote thread ) — although the future requires an extra call to pull out the resulting value .
I have to agree with Ralph , Erlang is an object oriented language , but one where the objects themselves are implemented in a functional language .
Erlang is a lovely language , and the more I study it the more I think of it , but it makes Joe 's attack on object orientation seem even more bizarre than I already thought it was .
I can only assume he was being ironic and I missed it .
[ WARNING :
There are couple of security issues with SSHKeychain that you should be aware of .
Please see my next post for details . ]
SSH , short for secure shell , is a set of tools ( ssh and scp on Unix derivatives ) to securely access and copy files to remote machines .
So often I see tutorials , like this or this , on how to setup SSH to work with no password .
However , these tutorials often advise using a key pair without a passphrase protecting the private key .
Yeah , okay , you can now get into remote machines without typing a password , but so can someone else if they get access to your account .
Leaving your private key unprotected without a passphrase is like not having a PIN on your ATM card .
It ’s just asking for trouble .
You may scoff at my paranoia , but the famous Internet Worm back in 1988 exploited a similar weakness in the then - popular RSH ( remote shell ) set of commands ( rsh , rcp , etc. ) .
It used the password - less mode of RSH as one if its methods to spread itself to other machines and effectively bring down the Internet .
As SSH was written as a secure replacement to RSH , in part to avoid repeat problems like the Internet Worm , I believe private keys should be protected with a passphrase under nearly all circumstances .
Okay , so I understand that you do n’t want to enter your passphrase every time you login or copy files .
The solution ( at least on Unix derivatives , including Mac OS X ) is to use ssh- agent .
It gives you SSH access without a password , but is still very secure .
ssh -agent is a background daemon that holds the private keys in memory for you and automatically uses them to authenticate to remote machines when you try and login .
The typical workflow is that once ssh - agent is started , you add your private key to the agent using ssh- add .
This requires your passphrase to decrypt your private key , but then the agent keeps the private key in memory for future use .
This means you enter your passphrase only once when the key is added , and you can use ssh without a password or passphrase from then on .
It ’s more secure because the private key is unencrypted in memory only .
It ’s still encrypted on disk .
The only issue with ssh - agent is that it ’s traditionally a bit tricky to setup .
When I last used Linux for my desktop OS ( Red Hat 9 was all the rage to give you an idea of when that was ) , you ’d have to jump through some hoops to get it all working .
In the end , you were prompted for your passphrase once at login time , but you could use ssh without a password from then on .
While a huge improvement over typing my passphrase every time , I did find the dialog box at login to be a bit of a pain .
It was especially annoying if I was rebooting or logging out and logging in to try test something .
I hope it ’s gotten easier , but as I have n’t used desktop Linux in a while , I ’m not sure how it ’s progressed .
Fortunately , if you ’re on Mac OS X , there ’s a fantastic open source application called SSHKeychain that makes using ssh - agent really easy .
It takes the ingenious approach of acting as a proxy for the real ssh-agent .
This simplifies a lot of the setup and allows it to do some really cool features that I do n’t think SSH agents on other platforms can do .
The main feature is that it only prompts you for your passphrase when you actually try and use ssh / scp for the first time .
No more annoying dialog box every time I login .
If I do n’t happen to use SSH , I do n’t have to type my passphrase .
Peachy .
But wait , there ’s more !
SSHKeychain hooks into system events and can remove your private key automatically .
For example , it can remove the key when the screensaver kicks in or when you put your machine to sleep .
These are really great features for laptop users or people who do n’t trust their coworkers .
Its security settings are fairly customizable , though , so I ’m sure you can find settings to match your level of paranoia .
Finally , you can store your passphrase in your Apple Keychain if you like .
I ’m too paranoid for that , but it ’s a nice touch .
You ’re better off storing your passphrase in the Keychain rather than using no passphrase at all .
Oh , and while I ’m nitpicking other people ’s tutorials ( it ’s nothing personal guys ) , I usually recommend using RSA instead of DSA for the key pair algorithm ( i.e. ssh - keygen -t rsa ) .
DSA used to be the preferred way , but mainly that was because RSA was covered under patents .
Since the RSA patents have expired , there ’s little reason not to use it .
In fact , I remember reading it was more secure , and even the PuTTY people recommend RSA over DSA .
But to keep security risks in perspective , you ’re much better off using DSA with a passphrase , than RSA without one .
Speaking of PuTTY , if you ’re on Windows and you ’d like to use an SSH agent , the PuTTY equivalent of ssh - agent is called Pageant .
It ’s not as slick as SSHKeychain , but it gets the job done .
For further information , consult the SSHKeychain website , read the ssh - agent ( 1 ) man page , and read the SSH with Keys HOWTO .
UPDATE : Keith Garner gives good advice on how to mitigate the risk of password - less SSH by using source IP and / or command constraints .
NPR recently interviewed psychologist Elliot Aronson , co-author , Mistakes Were Made ( But Not by Me ) .
Aronson worked closely with Leon Festinger back in the 1950 ’s “ designing experiments to test and expand dissonance theory . ”
Here is NPR ’s plug for the interview :
We all have a hard time admitting that we ’re wrong , but according to a new book about human psychology , it ’s not entirely our fault .
Social psychologist Elliot Aronson says our brains work hard to make us think we are doing the right thing , even in the face of sometimes overwhelming evidence to the contrary .
I listened closely to the interview ( you can listen on - line too by visiting the above link ) because this was yet another serious attempt to apply psychology to a critical real - life situations .
Exhibit A during this interview was the President ’s dysfunctional attitude toward to continued U.S. occupation of Iraq .
According to Aronson , cognitive dissonance “ is a drive , like hunger or thirst . ”
It is directed toward the human need to define who we are in a good light in order to reduce dissonance , so that we can “ sleep well at night . ”
It is “ a powerful and unconscious motor ” that smoothes out our mental “ rough edges . ”
We commonly refer to cognitive dissonance as “ justification . ”
Regarding many simple mistakes , it ’s no big deal to spin the incident in a way that deflects blame and embarrassment from one ’s self .
If you spill wine on the carpet , you justify that that it was only white wine , or that the damage was n’t noticeable , rather than thinking about the toxic ( my word ) thought that you were clumsy to spill the wine .
Aronson warns that when we make serious mistakes , reducing dissonance “ keeps us from learning from our mistakes . ”
It makes us do the same mistake over and over again .
In the case of Iraq , cognitive dissonance invites neocons to convince themselves that that it was a good decision ; those who have invested heavily in defending the invasion are thus likely to repeatedly come up with new justifications for invading .
Aronson goes so far as to state that President Bush engages in his specious justifications to allow himself “ to sleep well at night . ”
When cognitive dissonance is at work , ambiguous CIA reports filtered .
“ You only pay attention to the helpful information . ” I would think that those people who have spent the most energy defending the President ’s decision , thereby antagonizing their friends and family , would ( because of cognitive dissonance ) be those who are remain among the 20 % of this country who still support the U.S. invasion .
They are the same people , I would surmise , most likely to claim that the U.S. is in Iraq “ because of Al Qaida . ”
Research shows that if a high investment is required to achieve something , cognitive dissonance will come into play , causing us to reach for justifications ( even wild justifications ) to paint ourselves in a good light .
Aronson discussed one experiment where those subjects who had to go through a severe initiation later claimed that that a boring group was worthwhile ( compared to subjects who did n’t have to go through a strenuous initiation , who rated the group as boring and not worthwhile ) .
The bottom line ?
It is too hard to justify doing a lot of work to get into a boring group .
The solution is to re-evaluate the group as worthwhile .
That is cognitive dissonance in action .
What is the best solution to the damage often inflicted by cognitive dissonance ?
Aronson advises that we need to first become aware of the process .
We need to scrutinize our most important decisions in order to make wiser decisions .
We should consciously surround ourselves with people who do n’t agree with our opinions .
He gives the example of Abraham Lincoln , who appointed some of his staunchest political opponents to his cabinet and listened to them –they came to admire Lincoln .
Another solution is to summon up the courage to engage in contrition .
To issue an apology where warranted .
Perhaps this is too difficult for many people because they are too attached to the frame of presenting themselves to others as “ worthwhile . ”
I ca n’t help thinking , though , that doing the preliminary groundwork of invoking a new frame would make contrition easier .
When one decides that one would rather be known as a person who values an honest , self - critical and therefore functional social network over simply feeling good about one ’s self , contrition will come much more easily .
How else is cognitive dissonance harmful ?
Aronson gives the example that numerous people are languishing in prison even though DNA evidence shows up that they are innocent .
In many such cases , the prosecuting attorneys are refusing to re-opening the cases .
Why ?
Cognitive dissonance .
Those prosecutors have invested too much in the case to clearly see what obviously needs to be done : release these innocent people .
As I listened to this interview , I wondered about the connection between cognitive dissonance and the well - established doctrine of the confirmation bias .
It seems as though the former could be the driving force for the latter , though I wonder whether that is always the case .
Aronson was a bit hesitant to jump in when a caller asked whether cognitive dissonance helped explain the willingness of many people to follow religions that require adherence to beliefs that lacked proof , such as Mormonism .
I would agree with that caller .
Cognitive dissonance would seem to shed light on the true function of all kinds of initiation rites .
What about the rituals , training , tedium , pain and energy one expends to become or remain a member in good standing of all kinds of political and religious clubs ?
It would seem that this wasteful - seeming activity is food for cognitive dissonance , which compels the strangest claims out of the mouths of the faithful , whether it be a President ’s claim we ’re seeing progress in Iraq or a Believer ’s claim that “ Lehi , who , in roughly 600 B.C. , was called by God to lead a group of Jews from Jerusalem to the New World . ”
I 'm fed up with the GOP .
Some here might recollect that I was an Independent my entire life until about 18 months ago when I announced I changed my official registration to Democrat .
I cannot foresee ever voting for another Republican for federal office .
Their mandate was used to ignore , taunt , threaten and manipulate the Loyal Opposition and I will never give those bigots , hypocrites and sexual deviates another vote .
I ’ll not give men like Karl Rove any more chances to subvert our laws and elections .
It may be difficult for some to understand this : but what Rove and Company have done , in my opinion , was a deeper attack upon America than al Qaeda accomplished at the World Trade Center .
Actually the attack was symbiotic , in hindsight .
Osama Bin Laden doing business as al Qaeda and the Bush cabal almost equally desired the dumping of our treasury and surplus into a major invasion of a sovereign nation and all - out war .
The Bush reaction to September 11 was very predictable .
Like I 've said , I grew up in a political family .
We moved to D.C. when I was young .
I know more than most about the inner workings of that town .
The things I know would make most sick and amaze others .
Maybe we 've reached an age where nothing would surprise us .
I resided there 21 years , except for the vacation months spent back in my native state or overseas .
Three clues for everyone to think about :
1. ) Does it strike anyone why no GOP - appointed Justices tendered resignation during Bush 's first term of office ?
2. ) While people drone on about the war on a daily basis , has anyone noticed the more than 50 congressional bills that passed , changing the rights of small businessmen and workers ?
Some of these bills pertain to bankruptcy , others to obligatory filing of more personal information to the IRS beginning in 2008 .
Still others almost totally deregulate the media , allowing mass multi-ownership in single markets , while giving stiff fining powers to the FCC , for the so - called “ offenders , ” who are not cooperative .
( These laws ONLY help media and government become closer , while hurting the other 302.75 million . )
3. ) Not to mention the subversion of Habeas Corpus - which has always been allowable under the Constitution , but rarely used as it has been by these crooks .
And a systematically controlled series of acts covertly joining No Child Left Behind - testing to the reduction of federal funds for high schools in conjunction with cuts in Pell Grants for colleges forcing more minorities into joining the military .
4. ) People chatter about earmarks .
About how corporations are running the nation , which is true .
Even agencies like the FDA are so deregulated that any new medication is like copping dope on Sunset Boulevard .
People analyze the politic need for campaign money .
It sounds sensible , it ’s based it truth - but it is sophomoric and idiotic .
Under the current intentionally crafted system , politicians need R.J. Reynolds and Exxon to give them " campaign " money .
They could pass reform ( for the third time in 12 years ) allowing free campaigns : with no franking ; equal and free access to radio and TV ; $ 100 maximum contributions from any sources , etcetera .
Think Abscam .
Think soft .
The corporate / lobbyist money you see amounts to next - to - nothing as a percentage of pay - for - play .
The reality is before you .
Many just do n't want or ca n’t fathom the facts to believe and understand how ubiquitous and prolific soft money has become .
Think about money in the freezer .
Think about the crooked congressman in San Diego .
Think about Tom DeLay and those whom he associates .
I ’d like to think the GOP is the worst offender - and they are by far - but this disease crosses party lines .
Remember recently when Senators Stevens ( R ) and Byrd ( D ) joined forces to keep expenditures and earmarks off the Internet and remaining indefinately in the shadows of darkness .
At least until those two retire or die .
For those who are totally lost , maybe there is no way to spell it out to everybody in a few paragraphs .

Gordon Brown has yet to decide on an autumn election
A survey has found they are against autumn poll by a margin of two to one .
They cited reasons including voter fatigue and concern over the strength of the SNP .
The survey came as it emerged Labour was said to be recruiting people who would play an integral role in any forthcoming general election campaign .
BBC Scotland spoke to 31 of the 39 MPs who represent Scottish constituencies in the days following Gordon Brown 's speech to the Labour Party conference and asked if they " would advise the prime minister to hold the general election this autumn " .
What 's the rush ?
We only had an election two years ago
Jim Devine
Labour MP
A total of 10 said " yes " and 19 - including a majority of backbenchers - said " no " .
Only two did not know or would not say .
Those against a snap election also worried about turnout on a cold , dark day and the lack of organisation in some local Labour parties .
Those in favour said the Nationalists were more of a threat to the Liberal Democrats in Scotland , claiming opinion polls suggested Gordon Brown had a perfect opportunity to beat David Cameron 's Conservatives and win his own mandate as prime minister .
Jim Devine was among those who wanted Mr Brown to wait .
The Livingston MP said : " I remember the last October election in 1974 .
It is cold , it is dark , we are liable to have a foot of snow from Aberdeen to Aberystwyth .
This is not the time for an election .
" What 's the rush ?
We only had an election two years ago .
I think he should wait at least until next May . "
But David Hamilton said the Gordon Brown should go for it in late October , or at least " before the clocks change " .
" I think he should go quicker rather than later , " said the MP for Midlothian .
" I think it 's important that we make a single issue , that we go to the people with one vote in mind - who runs the country - and it should be Labour .
Mike Weir MP , the SNP's Westminster Campaign Director said : " This is ample proof that Labour is running scared of the SNP in Scotland and confirms why Alex Salmond is right to call for an election now .
" The SNP is up for an election and ready to go with the confidence that we 'll make progress . "
It is a little crazy here
Six years after 9/11 , Congress still has no emergency plan Jason Rhyne
Published : Tuesday September 11 , 2007
Print This Email This Six years after the Sept. 11 , 2001 attacks , lawmakers still do n't have a plan to keep the legislative branch running in the event of a devastating attack on Congress .
" In the time since terrorists brought down the World Trade Center and attacked the Pentagon , " writes Emily Yehle in Roll Call , " the only plans Congress has put in place to ensure its survival call for speedy special elections , a modified quorum and permission to relocate floor proceedings . "
But other specifics of a post attack plan - - macabre details like how to potentially provide rapid replacements for hundreds of dead and injured legislators -- are still unclear .
" I am just as concerned as ever that we 're now six years post Sept. 11 and we still do not have a constitutionally valid plan , " Rep. Brian Baird ( D - WA ) , told Roll Call .
" I still believe the potential for an attack is significant , and the potential for constitutional confusion , even a constitutional crisis , is very real . "
A number of continuity bills were floated by the Republican - led Congress prior to 2005 , but activity slowed after a bill was passed by the House requiring special elections 49 days after more than 100 lawmakers were killed .
The bill still has n't reached the Senate .
" The House also added a rule that gave the Speaker the power to unilaterally reduce the quorum requirement during an emergency , theoretically allowing the quorum to be as few as one Member , " Roll Call reported , adding that " [ s ] everal scholars argued that such a rule was unconstitutional . "
Rising in opposition to the bill during a debate in the House , Rep. Dana Rohrabacher ( R - CA ) said in 2005 that the legislation " focuses on the continuity of the election process rather than the continuity of Congress .
The people who wrote this bill got their priorities all mixed up as to what the purpose of this was supposed to be . "
Rep. Baird hopes
Democrats will be more attentive to the issue than the previous Republican majority , and will introduce a bill in early October which would call for a list of alternate candidates for every member of Congress ; Rep .
Rohrabacher has plans for a separate bill .
Thomas Mann , a Congressional scholar at the Brookings Institution , told Roll Call that one reason legislators are reluctant to act is that it 's unpleasant to plan for their own deaths .
" Beyond just a joke , they 've gotten the heebie - jeebies about this thing , " he said , " but we have a responsibility to get over that . "

MIT Computer Whiz Arrested With Fake Bomb At Logan Airport
MIT student Star Simpson was arrested after she allegedly walked into Logan International Airport with a fake bomb made of lights , wires , and putty strapped to her chest .
A woman arrested Friday for carrying a fake bomb into Boston 's Logan airport is an MIT computer whiz who loves " crazy ideas " and " saving the planet from evil villains , " according to her blog on a Web site hosted by the Massachusetts Institute of Technology .
In her blog , MIT student Star Simpson says she is " currently studying computers and how they work . "
Simpson also participates in MIT 's MITER project , a student run electronics engineering workshop .
Cops arrested Simpson , 19 , on Friday after she reportedly walked into Logan International Airport with a fake bomb made of lights , wires , and putty strapped to her chest .
She was charged with disturbing the peace and perpetrating a hoax .
An MIT spokeswoman on Friday confirmed that Simpson is currently enrolled in the school 's famed computer science program .
The spokeswoman could not say whether the school is contemplating any disciplinary action against Simpson .
" It 's too early to say , " she said .
The spokeswoman said MIT is planning to release a formal statement on the matter .
Simpson 's blog indicates she previously lived in Hawaii .
It reveals a personality that could be described as quirky .
She writes that she previously spent time " traveling the world and saving the planet from evil villains with my delivered - just - in - time gadgets . "
Two of the flights that were hijacked as part of the September 11 terror attacks originated at Logan .
As a result , Boston city officials have little tolerance for terror - related hoaxes .
Earlier this year , two men were arrested for planting bomb - like devices around Boston in an effort to drum up publicity for the cable show Aqua Teen Hunger Force .
We welcome your comments on this topic on our social media channels , or [ contact us directly ] with questions about the site .
We are very rapidly approaching the point where world oil production will likely peak and then start to decline .
The quantities of fuel that will have to be found to replace this gap are not likely to be found in the occasional wind farm , dotted over the landscape , nor in solar panels on the roofs of very profitable corporations .
The alternatives to letting the populace “ freeze in the dark ” are starkly limited .
A significant amount of that power will likely have to come from coal , for a number of different reasons .
I am thinking of calling this the Marie Antoinette Syndrome – she of the “ let them eat cake , ” quotation .
Because there is a reality to life that seems to be beyond the comprehension of writers of this ilk .
George Monbiot refers to the opening of the mine as being a sign of a “ re-entry into the coal age , ” but we never left it .
Coal has been , and is , used extensively around the world as a fuel source , and in the United States produces more than half the electricity consumed .
It is one of the cheapest ( in straight dollars per kWh ) sources of power for a utility .
Solar is currently about five times as expensive as coal power .
Further the coal in place in the UK , even if not at the moment a reserve , still totals more than 45 billion tons .
A short while ago I wrote about my concerns that , with a growing drum roll of articles decrying the use of coal , we might find ourselves short of power , at a time when we have a real need .
The tone of articles written about the mining industry are virtually all negative , with very few counter - arguments being made to demur at the emotive tone of the language used in writing about this subject .
The thought returned today as I read the article in the Guardian that Leanan had highlighted in Wednesday ’s Drumbeat .
The piece , by George Monbiot , bemoans the creation of a new surface mine in Wales .
Partially it is because it is a technology already in place and functioning , one that is not that difficult to scale up to meet increased need ( China being an illustrative example ) .
Partially it is because there is little else on the horizon that has a chance of meeting the need , at an affordable cost .
Oops , there I go touching hot buttons again .
But consider this , politicians do not get elected because they voted to double your electric bill .
There is great concern when bills rise by 10 - 20 % , consider if this was multiplied by a factor of ten to change the mix to more solar , for example .
( The cake analogy ) .
It is not a practical reality .
Yet politicians with a degree of social responsibility recognize that they must do something .
I have no mandate to defend the British Government , nor any great wish to , but it does seem fair to note that they have been working to find future supplies of energy from a variety of sources to meet anticipated future needs .
In this context they cannot just wear rosy glasses but must recognize certain fundamental truths .
One of these is that coal is a part of the energy future .
So now we come to the second part of the discussion – why surface mine the coal ?
The new surface mine is near Merthyr Tydfil , in the South Wales coal field , where there was , for many years a large underground mining tradition .
Part of the new mine will , in the process , apparently clean up some of the mess left ( waste heaps etc ) from some of that era .
The answer also addresses part of the question as to why mountain top mining is allowed in the United States .
The first part of the answer is that we need the coal ( see above ) .
The second part of the answer is that surface mining is a lot cheaper ( in terms of safety as well as dollar cost ) than underground mining .
Now there is an interim cost , in that while the mine is in operation it looks pretty ugly ( you can for example watch the video that accompanied a recent Washington Post article here .
What that video did not show , nor did any of the others I ran quickly through ( Google searching “ Mountain top mining You tube ” ) was the condition of the land after the mining company has finished land reclamation .
Comments about “ moonscape ” relate to what it looks like during mining , it turns out to be quite hard to find photos of reclaimed land in a quick search , but there are some here that suggest that it does n’t end up in the same shape as it is in while mining is going on , but can be more useful and ( since it also includes golf courses ) not wholly unattractive .
Now it could be that the coal could be mined in a less obtrusive way – underground mining is less obvious , and was the traditional way of mining in much of West Virginia and Wales .
But the waste has still to be stored somewhere , and the process is more costly than surface mining in a number of ways .
And so , you might say , why do n’t we develop new technology to help solve these issues .
Well here ’s the rub , there are now only 13 universities in the United States that teach mining , and in total , as a recent article ( ppt file ) showed , there are 69 faculty of whom 29 are anticipated to being going to retire in the near future .
There is one ( 1 ) faculty member under the age of 30 .
As demand for students rise ( and enrollments are increasing ) the amount of time for research declines ( not that there was ever much money to fund it in the first place ) .
So where are these new methods of mining going to come from ?
The last time this happened the Government gave one of the leading engineering / university groups in the US a large chunk of money to find the answer ( they were not a mining school ) .
they reckoned , I suppose , that if you could work out how to put a man on the moon , that mining coal would be a piece of cake .
It turned out about the way you might have expected , right Dave ?
Finding new technologies has not been an imperative for about 25 years or so , and so there is not a whole lot of innovation going around .
And there is still the cost issue – how much extra is the general public going to be willing to pay on their electric bill ( since that is where it ends up ) to develop new methods and then pay for their use .
The historic answer , which has driven the steps to find the cheapest way to produce coal , is not much !
There is also another worry which I thought I might mention , since as Aniya has noted , my reading gets a bit broader about the time I go to Energy Conferences .
( And we have one coming up next week ) .
There was an article on ABC News this week about the growing concerns for Atlanta as it faces the fourth year of a drought .
There are an increasing number of problems that the metropolis faces and it is approaching a point where there will not be enough water , period , without a long and continuous period of major rain .
So , being of that frame of mind , I looked to see what the weather was like back in the Medieval Warming Period and while it was apparently still warmer then up in Newfoundland than it is now , the prospects for further south are not promising .
For example in the Hudson Valley the drought lasted about 500 years .
Aside from views of cattails and blackbirds , the marshes in the lower Hudson Valley near New York City offer an amazingly detailed history of the area 's climate .
Sediment layers from a tidal marsh in the Hudson River Estuary have preserved pollen from plants , seeds , and other materials .
These past remnants allowed researchers from Columbia University , New York , N.Y. and NASA to see evidence of a 500 year drought from 800 A.D. to 1300 A.D. , the passing of the Little Ice Age and the impacts of European settlers .
. . . . .
From the pollen record found in sediments in Piermont Marsh of the lower Hudson Valley , a Medieval Warm period was evident from 800 to 1300 A.D. Researchers know this from the striking increases in both charcoal , a sign of dry vegetation and fires , and pollen from pine and hickory trees .
Prior to this warming spell , there were more oaks , which prefer a wetter climate .
So if we are heading back into that cycle then perhaps water issues may well become evident within the next few years at about the same time as we are looking at finding alternatives to oil , which could make life extremely interesting , as they say .
EverQuest players often joke about the addictive nature of the game – often referring to it as " EverCrack " – but for 21 - year - old Shawn Woolley the game became deadly serious , and his mother is preparing to sue Sony Online Entertainment over his suicide .
The Wisconsin man fatally shot himself on Thanksgiving morning last year , and his mother , Elizabeth Woolley , had the misfortune of finding him .
He was sitting at his computer in his apartment , and the place was strewn with notes related to the game .
But none of them offered any clues as to what drove him to such an end .
When Elizabeth tried to find out what happened in the game to drive her son over the edge , Sony Online Entertainment ( SOE ) balked , she said , citing privacy concerns for other players .
Because EverQuest figures so prominently in the last days of her son's life , Elizabeth said she plans to sue the company to find out what role it may have played .
She also wants to warn players of its potential for addiction .
" One of the things I personally would like is for them to look into his account , " Woolley said .
" He quit his job the week before he did this and played ( the game ) the whole week , and I want to see if there was something that made him do this because he did n't have any major crises in his life . "
Shawn Woolley did have some physical problems .
He was prone to epileptic seizures ; and if he played the game too much , he could and often did have seizures .
The suicide appears to have been planned , though .
Elizabeth said he bought the gun a week before Thanksgiving .
She said she had no knowledge of the purchase beforehand and did n't notice anything odd in his behavior during that week .
That , according to Dr. J. Michael Faragher , dean of the School of Professional Studies at the Metropolitan State College of Denver and co-director of the Center for Addiction Studies , shows planning , not an impulsive act .
" You 'd be hard pressed to say it was an impulsive act when there was some planning going into purchasing the gun , " he said .
He does n't believe Shawn 's seizures and epilepsy would have had anything to do with the suicide .
" I could n't say there 's a cause and effect ( for suicide ) based on seizures , " he said .
However , Faragher does n't think there 's much of a case to be made against SOE for responsibility .
" If it was n't this ( EverQuest ) , it would have been something else , " Faragher said .
" I do n't see a culpability as much as I see a lack of feelings of Sony 's social responsibility .
I do n't think this kid would have played any less if Sony had posted a warning . "
Woolley has n't yet filed suit but has hired Jack Thompson , a colorful Miami attorney and frequent critic of the entertainment industry to represent her .
Thompson was on vacation and unavailable for comment , and SOE declined to comment on the impending suit .
Anything that has the potential to generate significant changes in mood , effect or feeling is potentially addictive to someone , said Faragher , and EverQuest , a game with no end – unlike your typical video game – is no exception .
He defines addiction as having three qualities :
It must by some reasonable definition be harmful , the person 's behavior is apparently out of control , and most important , the addict expects the behavior will lead to feelings that are preferred to those felt before indulging in the activity .
Shawn got involved in the game in 2000 and by 2001 it had consumed his life , Elizabeth said .
He 'd quit his job and played almost non-stop , eventually being evicted from his apartment and moving in with his mother , before leaving her home and then being put in a group home for addictive behavior .
He was diagnosed with depression and a schizoid personality disorder and put on medication .
Residence in the group home was voluntary , however , and he left .
He then rented his own apartment , over his mother 's objections , where he resumed non -stop playing .
His mother , meanwhile , was dismayed by the lack of available resources directly related to online addiction .
" There 's no programs for the family sitting on the sideline , racking their brains , trying to figure out how to get their kids off the computer , " she said .
" I think a treatment program needs to be set up for this that 's just as accessible as Alcoholics Anonymous , because I did n't have anywhere to go for help . "
Sony , meanwhile , has not helped at all , she said .
Elizabeth has no idea on which of the 43 EverQuest servers her son played , who his friends were , or even how to get into his account .
In addition to wanting to know what drove her son over the edge , Elizabeth Woolley wants SOE to provide something for people who are addicted to its game .
" It might be an act of kindness to humankind , " she said .
" If they are making all this money off of well - adjusted people , then we can help people who are not so well - adjusted . "
Faragher agrees with her , pointing out that casinos have finally taken some responsibility for gambling addiction by offering addictive players access to help lines .
" I believe any industry that profits from the behavior of people should be willing to contribute something to the people who end up suffering , " Faragher said .
" They do n't really owe it as much as I believe it 's an ethical thing to do . "
General David Petraeus and Ambassador Ryan Crocker appeared in front of the Senate Armed Services committee to give testimony on the U.S. mission in Iraq and President Bush 's surge and as Hardball host Chris Matthews put it , ran into a bi-partisan buzz saw .
MSNBC 's David Shuster runs down today 's testimony , including Republican Senator Chuck Hagel 's passionate statements and an exchange between Petraeus and Senator John Warner ( R - VA ) which produced this stunning statement which sums up President Bush 's catastrophic failures in Iraq from beginning to end :

Warner : " Does that make America safer ? "
Petraeus : " Sir , I - I do n't know , actually .
I have not sat down and sorted out in my own mind , uh - what I have focused on and been riveted on is how to accomplish the mission of the Multi- National Force Iraq . "
As David Shuster points out near the end of the clip , President Bush will have a hard time combating this statement during his speech later this week , as he 's expected to quote the general frequently .
Four years into this pointless occupation , America should be outraged and disgusted that this is the best answer we can get from our leaders .
Our intrepid reviewer wanted to like this video .
But after three minutes of nihilistic pole dancing , she is left despairing for humanity
It 's not easy making a comeback after a long time out of the charts .
Presently , it 's not easy being Britney .
Then again , it 's not easy being green , either .
And it 's sometimes hard to be a woman .
All in all , there is a lot to contend with .
And so , we enter the difficult comeback video of Her Spearsness in a pensive mood .
Our mood is unlike that of Brits then , as she looks really terribly jolly about it all - and every inch the clean - cut , healthy vision of her younger self .
We are dazzled by a 4000 - watt smile as a blonde Britnavision welcomes us , preparing to hit us , baby , one more time , with the memory of all that was poppishly perfect about her .
Well good on you , B .
This is a good comeback plan !
Having several dozen dirty glasses piled up in front of you , though , is perhaps not such a great comeback plan .
Perhaps , they are symbolic of all the heavy nights we know she 's had of late , and the fact that those are all finished , over with now , as she has returned to a clean middle - American pop-princess sobriety .
Very clever .
Good thinking .
Continuing the theme of introspection , Brit turns her attention to a picture of another Britney .
Britney in a hat .
Britney in a hat is lurking in some shadows and seems to be stockpiling bottles of spirits .
Perhaps this is the Britney that Brit wishes to leave behind .
Evil Britney in a hat .
Evil Britney stands up and starts weaving her way across the room .
To come face - to - face with the Angelic Britney of old , perhaps ?
Ah no .
To come face - to - pole with , well , a pole .
Chaplin hat stuck solidly on her broody head , Evil Britney sports a slick of brown hair stuck rigidly across her kisser , like a long evil false moustache stuck on squiffy and pathetically uncurled .
Damn fake hair .
Britney starts pole dancing .
In an odd little outfit : some big butch tattoos , a waistcoat with what looks like a giant sequined lobster in an evening dress on the breast , a bowler hat , and some little pinstripe almost - shorts .
Like Liza Minnelli with all the water sucked out .
Or a city worker in a cheap suit who 's been put through a very hot wash .
Perhaps this is a metaphor for Brit 's dissatisfaction with The Business .
Or perhaps with her management , or ... I have no idea .
She 's pole dancing .
With her new hair now loose , she tries to answer some of her Video Music Awards critics by hiding behind the pole as proof of her thinness .
It does not work , as we can still see her .
It is only a pole , after all .
And we watch her as she goes on , in dogged pursuit of the perfect comeback .
The perfect comeback through pole dancing .
Ooh , that 's not a good look .
Perhaps this is Britney saying " Come on , you all loved it when I shed my clean image and turned into sex -Britney in the video for Oops , I Did It Again with the latex and the suggestive imagery and all that jazz ?
Well , I am doing the same thing !
You like it ? "
( And saying that through the medium of pole dancing . )
No , Brit .
You can't keep heading in the SAME direction and expect to surprise people .
You keep heading off that direction every time you want to make an impression and eventually you 'll fall off the edge of " a bit naughty " and have your eye out with a dildo .
Britney has been joined by some pole - dancing friends .
Now they are ALL pole dancing .
The camera work is jittery , low quality , and keeps being infused with tinges of colour - blue , green , red .
It 's approximately the same quality of work you might see on an advert at 3 am on ITV4 with a booming voiceover suggesting that you call NOW to chat to hot single babes in YOUR local area !
Perhaps that 's what she 's going for .
Perhaps it 's a shrouded satirical comment on the manufactured availability of a certain stereotype of sexualised femininity in modern society .
Or perhaps she just likes grinding against mirrors .
It 's either / or , really .
Could be both .
Whatever it is , it 's all done with a clean - cut yet terrifyingly manic Brit- eating grin .
It 's like she wants to reassure everyone that she 's the same all - American Mickey Mouse Club kid she always was .
She just happens to have her baps out and spend her free time grinding against poles ...
... or watching herself grinding against poles .
There 's a slightly odd thing about this video .
Though it 's ostensibly a pole - dancing club , we only really see one man in the video , and then only for a couple of short shots .
The rest of the video concentrates on Britney 's girl 's night out , enjoying the spectacle of Britney 's angelic / sleazy pole - dancing troupe .
Which is fine , but ...
Oh whatever .
I give up .
Here 's Britney 's arse .
And then , suddenly , the camera flips around and we see that this whole thing has been taking place in the back room of a fast food joint !
The whole thing is ACTUALLY a brilliantly biting satire of consumerism , fast food and sexual appetites and ...
No , it 's no good .
I 'm lying .
Nothing changes .
It all stays the same .
And there 's some more pole dancing .
And that 's it .
I honestly sat here watching it over and over , racking my brain , burning my imagination at both ends , trying to find something salvageable , something positive and lovable and redeeming about this video for what is , after all , not THAT bad a pop song .
I wanted to be a dissenting positive voice , not just another jabberer against a beleaguered , vulnerable young woman ... but I just can't .
She had full editorial control of this video .
Let 's just start again .
Hello !
It 's Britney 's new video !
What a lot of arse !
" Gimme more " ?
Seriously , the only way she 's going to give us more right now is if she disembowels herself live on film .
THE END
You can watch it here .
You may have to sign in and confirm your age .
This does n't seem to be because of the presence of any rude bits .
Probably more so that you can confirm that you 're big enough and tough enough to handle the resultant soul - crushing disappointment , slight taste of sick - burp and loss of will to live .
Thanks .
Next week : something good !
Spiel " Shadow of the Colossus " Ein stilles Meisterwerk
Es geschieht nicht oft , dass ein Videospiel die Herzen von Spielern und Kritik so im Sturm erobert wie " Shadow of the Colossus " .
SPIEGEL ONLINE erklärt , warum das Spiel das vielleicht letzte große Kunstwerk für die Playstation 2 ist , ein Meisterwerk aus Stille , Licht und Melancholie .
The Massachusetts National Guard soldier from Quincy who died in Afghanistan Friday was found with a single bullet in her head lying near her church on a secure military base , her family said yesterday after a briefing from Army officials .
The Department of Defense said in a statement yesterday that Ciara Durkin 's injuries came from a " non-combat related incident " that is under investigation .
The statement contradicts a Sunday statement from the Massachusetts Army National Guard that said Durkin , an Army specialist , was killed in action .
A guard spokesman said the term was meant to imply that Durkin was deployed in Afghanistan at the time of her death .
" We 're completely in the dark , " said Pierce Durkin , the soldier 's 28 - year - old brother .
" Patience is probably dissipating . "
Family members , who are pushing for more information from Army officials , are girding for the possibility that Ciara ( pronounced Kee-ra ) Durkin was killed by a fellow service member , intentionally or accidentally , at the Bagram Airfield .
They said they are confident that she did not commit suicide .
" The family has been going over this several times , " Pierce Durkin said .
" There is nothing to indicate that it could have possibly been self - inflicted . "
The unusual case is drawing intense interest from Ireland , where Durkin , 30 , and most of her family were born and where three siblings live .
Her family is appealing to the Irish government , in addition to American congressmen , for additional help in clearing up the details of her death .
A US Central Command spokesman in Afghanistan , reached by telephone yesterday , did not provide further details to a reporter .
Pierce Durkin said his family is hoping that the military will " speed up and that they will deliver a very thorough and very honest and very fact - based and sincere report . "
Inconsistent stories surrounding the injury to Army Private Jessica Lynch and the death of former professional football player - turned - Army Ranger Pat Tillman have increased the family 's skepticism , Durkin said .
" We understand that military relations are so much connected to public relations concerns , " he said .
" Therefore , if it was something that was unfavorable it would be handled from a public relations mindset not a principled one . "
The vast majority of deaths in Iraq and Afghanistan have been combat - related .
The US military reported yesterday that 3,100 of 3,799 deaths in Iraq and 252 of 438 deaths in Afghanistan were classified as combat deaths .
Deaths listed by the military as nonhostile include injuries from car crashes and other logistical accidents , as well as suicides .
Durkin's unit , which handled financial accounts on the base , was not involved in combat .
Shooting deaths on a secure base are " very , very rare , " said Ted Oelstrom , a retired lieutenant general who directs the National Security Program at Harvard 's Kennedy School .
" There has been probably a handful of these incidents over time . "
Pierce Durkin was the last member of his family to hear from his sister .
She left him a birthday greeting on his voicemail at 1 a.m. Friday .
" She was saying , ' Pierce , I love you .
I can't wait to see you . '
And she started singing ' Happy Birthday , ' " he said .
The siblings were close , the two youngest in a family of nine children .
When she was on leave in Quincy for two weeks last month , she and her brother made plans to pool their money to buy a home so they could quit paying rent .
She wanted to go to school to study information technology or finance , her brother said .
" I do n't think anyone could have gone from such a jovial mood on the 14th [ of September ] to such a 180 " degree turn toward suicide , Pierce Durkin said .
Ciara Durkin may have been on her way to or from church when she was killed , according to her sister Fiona Canavan .
Military officials told the family she was nearby when she was found .
" We know they had very frequent concerns about snipers over there , " Canavan said .
" But she was in a secure area . . . which , even though the investigation is not complete , leads the family to believe it was what is called ' friendly fire . ' "
Military officials told Durkin family members the investigation could take as long as eight weeks .
Durkin's wake will take place from 4 - 9 p.m. Friday at the Dennis Sweeney Funeral Home in Quincy .
Her funeral will be held at 10 a.m. Saturday at St. John the Baptist Catholic Church in Quincy .

I was playing bridge with some of my friends at the State Department and I told them I was planning to remodel my place .
I do it every couple of years , mostly out of boredom .
So when they recommended the contractors at Blackwater , I figured , sure , why not , I ’ll look into them .
Turns out it was n’t such a good idea .
After getting an estimate from them they automatically started to bill me .
I was n’t ready to decide , I was waiting on a few more bids , but then Blackwater ’s guy called me to tell me that this was a no - bid process .
I had n’t heard of no - bid contracting before , but since my friends at the State Department were so keen on these guy it seemed reasonable .
Their handiwork is somewhat questionable .
Instead of nail guns , they like to use gun guns , which is really rough on the sheet rock .
They broke all the windows to create a ‘ defensible position ’ .
But I live in a cul - de-sac !
Their philosophy is best summed up as measure once , cut twice , and shoot some neighbors .
Then there was the loss of equipment .
They ordered the new whirlpool for my back deck at least six different times , and somehow they lost each one .
And then they invoiced me for the missing Jacuzzis .
Plus some 8000 rounds of ammunition and a helicopter gunship I do n’t even want .
The last straw was when they called me at work to tell me they ’d fired my plumber .
I ’d been working with this guy for years — he ’d seen me through every previous remodel .
He was always prompt and fair .
I ask them where he is .
Turns out not only had he been fired .
He ’d been fired upon and in the hospital now .
In the contract , there ’s nothing about terminating the agreement .
I called my lawyer and asked him if I can do anything , and it turns out there ’s a federal law prohibiting me from ending my Blackwater contract .
Even worse , if I stop paying them , they reserve the right to blow up the house and start over , which means delays .
But they have no incentive to do a good job , because as soon as the house is fixed , they ’re unemployed .
It ’s a vicious cycle , and my missing Jacuzzi is in the middle of it .
And I did n’t even want a Jacuzzi !
NO ONE IS GOING TO STEAL YOUR BRILLIANT IDEA .
May 11 , 2007
I get emails occasionally from one - person - software - companies , and those who are thinking of creating small software companies .
( Micro - ISV 's we call them )
And i give help where i can , positivity where - ever possible .
i do n't give much time , of course .
But i give everything i can .
( Oh , And i'd love to hear from you , of course !
i've always got a positive word or ten ! )
But one thing i hear again and again is this :
how can i get started , when my idea is so clever that the first time i utter it , i fear someone will steal it ?
This is such a common fear !
And boy , I have had that fear !
I know it so damn well .
Yet -- it 's utterly misguided !
please believe me !
no one is gonna steal your idea ....
It 's amazing how reluctant people are to use your brilliant ideas .
This point is brought up again and again in literature around business creation .
We all fear that everyone will steal our idea the entire time -- no one does .
The hard bit -- the hardest bit of all -- is getting people to even listen to our idea .
There 's a famous saying about this :
" Do n't worry about people stealing an idea .
If it 's original , you will have to ram it down their throats . "
( quoted here , http://www.rexruff.com/content/philosophy.php, for example -- but lots of variations exist too )
There 's so much truth in this .
I always just put my ideas out on my blog , and no one steals them .
( Damn you all !
Except you , Atli .
You rock of course ;-) )
So repeat after me ( and keep repeating until you believe it )
NO ONE
IS GOING
TO STEAL
YOUR BRILLIANT
IDEAS .
It 's almost sad , really .
But do n't let this discourage you , either .
Because , over time ... eventually ... once you get to a stage where nice , ordinary people have begun to except your idea ... ( this might blow you away right now )
they 'll actually
pay you
money
for your
implementation
of it .
Weird huh ?
And yet it is a verifiable fact .
Best of luck !

Financial and insurance contracts do not sound like promising territory for functional programming and formal semantics , but in fact we have discovered that insights from programming languages bear directly on the complex subject of describing and valuing a large class of contracts .
We introduce a combinator library that allows us to describe such contracts precisely , and a compositional denotational semantics that says what such contracts are worth .
We sketch an implementation of our combinator library in Haskell .
Interestingly , lazy evaluation plays a crucial role .
A revised and updated version of this paper appeared as How to write a financial contract , a chapter in “ The Fun of Programming ” , ed Gibbons and de Moor , Palgrave Macmillan 2003 .
Anton van Staten has a written a self - contained , well - documented Haskell library of composable contracts , which looks like a great resource if you want to try executing some contracts .

The topic of disinformation is a very complicated one .
Essays , lengthy papers and whole treatises have been written on the subject .
But the very length of most discussions overwhelms people , so that they never get an accurate picture of what disinformation looks like .
So I thought I 'd take a crack at a verydefinition of disinformation , something that is short enough to read in two minutes .
Disinformation is :*
Repeating the same factual claims over and over even when people have proven that such claims areto the evidence ( for example , the claim that no planes hit the Twin Towers ) *
Spending more energy causing in - fighting and disruptions then helping to promote the truth , and causing dedicated activists to waste time rebutting obviously false claims and theories *
Unnecessarily alienating large sections of the population by attacking victims ' families , certain religious or ethnic groups , or political parties with no reason *
Calling someone names instead of addressing that person 's theories or claimed facts *
Making knowingly false statements about someone *
Threatening people or their families with violence , job loss , or other forms of intimidation or harassment *
Acting as provocateurs to disrupt peaceful groups or gatheringsPeople whodo one of the above things even after people have pointed out what they are doing , are spreading disinformation -- consciously or unconsciously .
Indeed , because disinformation may be an unconscious activity , I prefer to call it " disruption " .
These actionsthe ability to spread 9/11 truth and to obtain justice against all of those who carried out the attack .
No matter how much seemingly good 9/11 truth work someone has done in the past , if someone starts causing more disruption than good , than he or she shouldbe followed any more .
This is especially true if people have pointed out that person 's disruptive behavior , but he or she has carried on disrupting 9/11 truth work anyway .
Sadly this is not the case .
The public record shows that senior civil servants at the UK 's permanent joint HQ were still debating in May 2004 whether to comply with the ban from the Heath government from 1972 on hooding and stressing .
The head of Army Legal at the start of the war , Lt Col Nicholas Mercer , complained bitterly to all concerned about 40 Iraqis " kneeling in the sand , cuffed behind their backs , in the sun with bags over their head ... " .
From this point onwards , it was clear that agents of the UK state were routinely engaged in hooding and stressing in Iraq .
There are two possible explanations as to why this was allowed to continue up to the end of the occupation .
The first is that it was not thought that hooding and stressing in conditions of 60 degrees centigrade is within the legal definition of " torture " at all .
The second is that it was and is the government 's position that the UN convention against torture does not have extraterritorial effect .
What a sad state of affairs that we , as a nation , remain indifferent to what our senior civil servants and politicians sanctioned as policy in Iraq .

The post - nuclear apocalypse drama Jericho was canceled by CBS earlier this year , but the network relented and renewed the show for seven more episodes after disappointed fans sent 25 tons of peanuts to CBS in protest .
It 's a great story of grassroots fan support .
Now that they 've got seven more episodes to get it fired up again , some of the show 's talent is speaking up about what they think hurt their ratings .
Speaking with OnMilwaukee , actor Brad Beyer answered suggestions that the plot of the show was too slow by saying that the real problem with Jericho is that viewers were n't watching it as it was broadcast .
" The biggest problem with our show is that so many people were watching it on the Internet or Tivo ( which does n't count toward Nielsen ratings ) , so I think the fans are now aware to watch it when it 's on , " he said .
This is n't just Beyer 's personal view , however .
Nina Tassler , the president of CBS Entertainment , told the New York Times that if fans want the show to live , they need to watch the broadcast because that 's how the money gets made .
Stressing that live viewing is " of primary importance , " Tassler said that " We want them to watch on Wednesday at 8 o'clock ... and we need them to recruit new viewers who are going to watch the broadcast . "
According to internal research at CBS , 8 percent of Jericho 's viewers were recording the show and watching it later , amounting to some 700,000 households .
The implication is that such a small slice of DVR usage can hurt a struggling show .
The question : is CBS full of it ?
According to Nielsen , DVR users added 32 percentage points of commercial viewership when factored into the results , so the notion that DVR users do n't watch ads is n't entirely true .
By our rough estimates , it 's about half the normal rate for live viewers .
There 's a degree to which CBS is still making decisions based off of traditional valuations of viewers .
Yet , the networks all say that advertisers believe that the only viewers worth paying for are those that watch ads live .
After all , Crazy Eddie 's sales are " going on now , " not " going on 3 - 5 days from now . "
Of course , as far as ratings are concerned , Jericho often ran head - to - head with American Idol , as the OnMilwaukee interview casually mentions .
Something tells me that ( * blu - buh - blu -* ) Blake ( * wiki- wiki * ) and Jordin Sparks had more to do with Jericho 's ratings than did TiVo .
Is it really any surprise that Jericho had ratings problems running up against the most popular show on TV ?
I 'd wager that this fact alone accounts for the higher percentages of DVR and Internet viewership CBS witnessed as compared to other programming .
Nevertheless , this " woe is the DVR " din is only going to get worse , and I 've talked to more than a few people in the TV biz who are convinced that DVRs are eroding advertisers ' willingness to pay top dollar for commercial spots .
I 've been told that the problem is particularly vicious for shows that have a high " geek quotient , " like Stargate SG - 1 .
DVR recording of that show is also quite high , but one must again ask : should Sci-Fi expect anything different considering that they run the new episodes on Friday nights ?
Meanwhile , advertising dollars are leaving the TV realm and heading for the Internet in ever - increasing amounts .
The DVR can't be blamed for that , and surely it 's a sign of a more significant shift in the way people are spending their entertainment time : namely , online .
And just why is that ?
I think there 's one very simple explanation : the Internet is always " on demand . "
You use it when you want , how you want , and it's ( almost ) always there .
CBS is swimming upstream by pleading with users to tune in on a specific day and a specific time .
The day is most certainly coming when such scheduling obsessions are a thing of the past .
The Associated Press has produced an extensive report on the potential risks of RFID devices , which have been approved for use in humans .
The report cites a range of animal studies that have linked similar devices to cancers in experimental animals , such as mice and rats .
The report is generally well prepared and raises both scientific and ethical issues .
The ethical questions focus on the initial approval of these devices , which occurred while Tommy Thompson was in charge of Health and Human Services , a parent department of the FDA .
The AP reports that five months after Thompson left government service , he joined the board of the company that produces the RFID devices .
That position came with a substantial number of shares in the company .
Attempts to obtain the safety information on the device that went into the approval process produced no documents .
Does relevant information exist ?
Absolutely ; in fact , a company that produces similar devices intended to track research animals provides a list of references ( scroll to the bottom ) that includes a number of studies that link the use of implants to the development of cancers at the site of the implant .
Although the development and progression of cancer in mice has some differences compared to humans , mice still remain the primary model system for understanding cancer .
The rates seen in these studies ( typically only a percent or two ) should certainly have been relevant to the approval of human RFID implants .
It 's important to emphasize that those studies are not necessarily sufficient to view these implants as known hazards .
The data suggest that the devices foster cancer by causing inflammation of the tissues that encapsulate them .
There is a large amount of scientific literature linking cancer and inflammation ( the National Cancer Institute has some information on the matter ) .
RFID tags turn out not to be the only form of animal tagging that causes cancer through inflammation ; standard metallic ear tags can do so as well .
That paper also notes that there have been a number of case reports where human prosthetic implants have induced cancers in the surrounding tissues .
Given that there 's a known mechanism for these implants to foster cancer by irritating their surrounding tissues and that humans appear to suffer from these sorts of cases , there is clearly reason for concern .
Still , it is possible that different RFID designs may have a greater or lesser tendency to induce irritation ; more detailed studies are clearly needed .
These should include more animals beyond mice and rats ( RFID tags are used for pet identification purposes ) and a detailed examination of whether those people who have received tags so far have signs of inflammation .
Should the FDA have approved the devices , given the animal data ?
Probably not without some basic studies of their potential to cause inflammation in humans .
Although the animal reports are relatively obscure — the AP report quotes a variety of cancer researchers as being completely unaware of them — it 's the FDA 's job to find relevant research .
Clearly , they dropped the ball here .
Finishing Your Novel
“ A writer is someone who finishes . ”
-- Thomas Farber
This section is for you if :
You ’ve started a novel but are having trouble finishing it , or
You want to start a novel but are n’t sure you ’ll be able to finish it .
I ’ve been writing novels ( and teaching about writing novels ) for twenty years , and one thing I ’ve learned is how to finish .
I ’d estimate that 98 % of all the novels people begin are never completed .
Every person who abandons a book feels that he or she has a good reason , but my experience suggests that most of those books could have been finished – the writer just came up against something he or she could n’t handle .
This section is about how to handle those things .
It ’s about starting with a good idea , developing it , and moving your story ahead until you reach the end .
Finishing a novel ( or any kind of writing project ) is a transformational experience .
I know , because it ’s happened to me .
I want it to happen to you , too .
HOW I LEARNED TO FINISH – THE HARD WAY
A long time ago , something funny happened to me .
I thought I was a writer .
I thought I was a writer because I had begun three novels over the course of a few years , noodling on each of them every time inspiration struck , which was n’t often .
( More about inspiration later . )
But still , I thought of myself as a writer – all I had to do was finish one of those books .
And then my house burned down .
Naturally , I had backups of all my unfinished novels , and naturally , they were all in the house .
I had a life - changing revelation :
If I had finished those books , they 'd probably exist somewhere – in print , or at a publisher , or in a box in the garage .
And then I had a second revelation : whatever I was , I was n't a novelist , because I had n't finished a novel .
So I made some notes on the book I remembered best , flew to Thailand , and wrote the whole thing in seven weeks .
And it got me an agent , and then a three - book contract , which led to another three - book contract , etc .
In other words , finishing the book turned me into a writer .
This area of the site is based on what I 've learned since then .
Here 's what you 'll find on it .

On whatstarted as a normal Saturday night one week ago , residents of a small , remotePeruvian town saw a bright light streak across the sky , heard a resounding bangand suddenly found themselves at the center of a media frenzy .
Initial suspicionsof an airplane crash quickly spiraled into widespreadreports that a meteorite had plummeted to Earth and left a smoking , boilingcrater whose supposedly noxious fumes were reported to have sickened curiouslocals who went to peer at the hole .
Despitedoubts expressed by geologists that the crater was actually caused by ameteorite and firm explanations that a meteorite would not even emit fumes andthat the " sickness " was likely a case of mass hysteria , numerousonlookers far and wide were fascinated by the idea that this event could besome real - life " Andromeda Strain " ( the 1969 novel by MichaelCrichton ) , where a mysterious rock falling to Earth from outerspace made anyonewho went near it ill .
So what isit about things falling from the sky that fills us with such fear that we canmake ourselves sick with panic ?
Masshysteria
Mediareports of the number of locals afflicted by a " mysterious disease " ?
withsymptoms such as nausea , headaches and sore throats ? after visiting the crater figuredin every news article about the Sept. 15 event , with some reporting that as manyas 600 people had fallen ill .
But doctorswho visited the site told the Associated Press they found no evidence that thecrater had actually sickened such a large number of people .
If noxiousfumes did emanate from the crater , they were most likely the result of ahydrothermal explosion that could have actually formed the crater , or werereleased from the ground when the meteorite struck , if infact one did , according to many geologists .
Arsenic isfound in the subsoil in that area of Peru and often contaminates the drinkingwater there , according to Peruvian geologists quoted on Sept. 21 by NationalGeographic News .
Arsenic fumes released from the crater could have sickenedlocals who went to look , said one geologist who examined the site .
Some healthofficials suggest that the symptoms described by the locals , the large numberof people reporting symptoms , and the apparently rapid spread have all thehallmarks of a case of mass hysteria .
" Thosewho say they are affected are the product of a collective psychosis , " Jorge Lopez Tejada , health department chief in Puno , the nearest city , told the Los Angeles Times .
Thispsychosis could have begun as a result of fear of the meteorite and themysterious " disease " on the part of the residents and spread asofficial and media reports seemed to confirm it and give it credence .
" The Peruvian event seems to be a rare case where we may be witnessing collectiveanxiety that is approaching near hysteria , " said Benny Peiser , a socialanthropologist at John Moores University in England .
" The major [ ity ] ofthe affected Peruvian town hinted that some of the mass anxiety is due to fearof imminent impacts and psychological stress which is not surprising given thepremature speculation and media hype . "
Fear ofouter space
Fear of ameteorite impact is nothing new ?
humans have long looked to the heavens with awary eye .
" Thefear of cosmic disaster , in particular cometary impacts , has existed in allcultures for millennia , " Peiser told SPACE.com
But thespace age revealed just howmany dangers , including comets , meteors , asteroids , and cosmic rays , awaitus in the final frontier .
" Onlysince the late 20th century , humankind has become aware of the risk posed byasteroids and comets , " Peiser said .
" Unfortunately , this risk hasbeen wildly exaggerated by popular culture . "
Ourcuriosity and fear of impact events has increased their coverage by the worldmedia , Peiser says , which in turn has increased the number of meteorite impactreports , even when the evidence does n't point that way .
" Inrecent years , there have been numerous cases where alleged meteorite falls werelinked to mysterious explosions on the ground ? only to be proven wrong , " Peiser said .
" One of the main reasons for the significant increase of suchclaims is almost certainly due to the growing media interest in the cosmicimpact risk .
It is part of human nature ?
and extremely tempting for the newsmedia ?
to hype any event that initially looks mysterious . "
While thisfear is normal and understandable , it 's been blown out of proportion so thatthe public thinks that impact risks are higher than they are , Peiser argues .
" Mostpeople are simply not aware that we are making enormous progress in finding andidentifying the population of Near Earth Objects and that the impact risk isthus diminishing year by year , " Peiser said .
And when meteoriteshave struck , they have never carried any hint of some mysterious spacedisease .
" Idon ? t know of any known record of a meteorite landing that emitted odors sonoxious that people got sick from it , " said geologist Larry Grossman ofthe University of Chicago .
So much forthe Andromeda Strain .
WASHINGTON ( Reuters ) - China , which makes 70 percent of the world ’s lightbulbs , has agreed to phase out incandescent bulbs in favor of more energy - efficient ones , part of a push by a leading world environmental funding agency .

The transition could be made in the next 10 years , said Monique Barbut , chief executive officer of the Global Environment Facility .
“ We are starting a world campaign to ban all inefficient lightbulbs , ” Barbut said at the Reuters Environmental Summit in Washington .
“ And China has just agreed . ”
China ’s program will be formally announced in December at a meeting of climate negotiators in Bali , Indonesia , she said .
The switch to more efficient bulbs from traditional incandescent ones could mitigate 500 million tonnes of the greenhouse gas carbon dioxide annually , equal to about half the climate - warming emissions of Germany , she said .
China is the first developing country to agree to join this program , and the facility will invest about $ 25 million for the Chinese program alone .
Other countries -- including Mexico , Indonesia , Venezuela and Costa Rica -- may join in future , Barbut said .
“ If we decide and if countries really agree , it is something that could be done in the next 10 years , ” she said .
ENERGY EFFICIENCY FOR THE POOR
The Global Environment Facility is one of the richest and least - known environmental funding agencies worldwide .
With a current trust fund of about $ 3.2 billion , the Washington , D.C. - based agency is the financial arm for international intergovernmental agreements on biodiversity , climate change and persistent organic pollutants .
It also supports agreements on international waters , ozone and desertification .
As the lightbulb switching program goes forward , the environment facility is working to develop a fund to get these more efficient bulbs into the hands of the poor
.
“ An efficient lightbulb costs four times more than an inefficient lightbulb -- it lasts 10 times longer but it ’s four times more ( expensive ) -- and for many very poor people ... the problem is that they ca n’t afford the four times more at one time , ” Barbut said .
Compact fluorescent lamps use between a quarter and a fifth of the energy of incandescent bulbs producing the same light .
Among rich countries , Australia has already decided to phase out incandescents by 2010 , Barbut said , and the facility is working with the Australian government to help with the China project .
The matter is being discussed by countries in the European Union and the United States , she said , adding that China is ahead of the United States in this respect .
The backing of the Global Environment Facility is likely to produce an international market benefit , according to Barbut .
Because the program will be worldwide , it could reduce the number of types of lightbulbs from 30 or so to four or five , thus reducing the cost of manufacturing equipment .
“ We think ( this ) will bring the price down very much of these lightbulbs , ” Barbut said .

When presidential candidate Ron Paul appeared on The O'Reilly Factor Monday , host Bill O'Reilly repeatedly pressed Paul to agree that Iran is a dangerous enemy which will pose an imminent threat if the US leaves Iraq , meanwhile interrupting every one of Paul 's attempts to explain his own views on the negative results of US policy in the Middle East .
" Do you fear Iran intruding on the whole Persian Gulf if the United States -- as you asked for in the debate last week -- left the region ? "
O'Reilly demanded .
" I fear that they might want to do that , but I think our policy is leading to that , " Paul replied .
" Our policy is doing everything conceivable to enhance Iran .
Just the whole invasion of Iraq has helped Iran . "
" That may or may not be true , " retorted O'Reilly .
" We have to assume that Iran is an aggressive nation , that it wants to injure the United States , and it 's going to use surrogates to do it .
...
When a country 's seeking a nuclear weapon that 's a danger to the USA ... and you want to withdraw from the theater , that gives them carte blanche to do what they want , does it not ? "
" I think you 're concerned about the wrong country right now , " Paul responded , citing both the Saudi origins of al Qaeda and Pakistan 's possession of nuclear weapons .
" I 'm talking about Iran , Congressman , " O'Reilly broke in curtly .
" I 'm not talking about Pakistan .
...
You 're not directly answering the question , sir . "
" No , I do not fear them as you do , " responded Paul directly .
" This has been the plan by the neoconservatives , to have this major overhaul , this revamping of the whole Middle East -- precisely the reason the al Qaeda is growing .
...
Our national security is threatened because of our policy . "
" I see the Iranians as acting logically and defensively , " Paul went on .
" We 've been fighting the Iranians since 1953 .
We overthrew their government .
...
We were allies with Saddam Hussein in the 1980's and we encouraged him to invade Iran ... "
" We do n't need a history lesson , " O'Reilly broke in .
" I just want to get this on the record .
You do n't fear Iran , even though it can start a war , which it did last summer with its Hezbollah surrogates , and it 's stated that it wants to do damage to Israel ... and is developing a nuclear weapon .
You do n't fear them ?
...
It 's policy in Iran to wipe out Israel , to attack USA . "
" It 's our policy of preemptive deliberate invasions of foreign countries and occupying these countries that has jeopardized our safety , " Paul said once again .
" This blowback principle is what caused 9/11 and we have to come to realize it .
If you keep living in this dreamland of saying that they attack us because we 're free and prosperous , believe me , we 're never going to ... "
" If you think that if we withdraw off the Gulf , if we get our people out of there , there 's not going to be any more terrorism , then you 're living in a dreamland , " O'Reilly broke in again " You did n't even want to go into Afghanistan and punish those people , did you ? "
" You 're wrong on that .
I voted for that .
So you be careful on your quotes , " said Paul , pointing out that his complaint about Afghanistan is that the US did n't capture bin Laden but got bogged down in nation - building instead .
Rep. Ron Paul has recently taken on a growing role as a spokesman for principled right - wing opposition to the occupation of Iraq and to pro-war conservatives like O'Reilly , and media sources report that CBS 's 60 Minutes is planning a segment on the congressman .
The following video is from Fox 's O'Reilly Factor , broadcast on September 10 .
Transcript : BILL O'REILLY :
The top story tonight , another view of this .
Joining us from Washington , Republican Congressman and presidential candidate Ron Paul .
Do you fear Iran intruding on the whole Persian Gulf if the United States , as you asked for in the debate last week , left the region ?
Do you fear that ?
REP .
RON PAUL , GOP PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE :
Well , I fear that they might want to do that , but I think our policy is leading to that .
Everything that we do enhances the Ahmadinejad crowd in Iran .
There is a dissenting force in Iran .
And everything we do to undermine that government  we have our own CIA over there now trying to undermine that government .
In doing that , we bring all their people together .
So the ones who wanted to dissent and oppose him , are - you know , they lose their power to do so .
So I would say our policy is doing everything conceivable to enhance Iran .
Just the whole invasion of Iraq has helped Iran .
O'REILLY : Well , that may or may or not be true .
PAUL : They 're the ones - well ...
O'REILLY : It may or may not be true .
PAUL : ... I think it 's true .
O'REILLY : I mean , it 's a debatable issue .
I 'm not going to say it is n't true , but it 's a debatable issue .
But look , as we saw in the summer war last year , Iran can arm and finance a force like Hezbollah and cause a lot of trouble .
And the United States did n't have anything to do with that at all .
So I think that in our national security situation , we have to assume that Iran is an aggressive nation , that it wants to injure the United States , and it 's going to use surrogates to do it .
Now if you have an Iran actively seeking nuclear weaponry , as you do , and if you have the ability of that country to hand it off to a Hezbollah or an al Qaeda or anybody else , you withdraw from the region , you give them carte blanches to do what they want , do you not , congressman ?
PAUL : See , I think you 're concerned about the wrong country right now because more than half of the al Qaeda that are committing suicide in Iraq right now are Saudis .
And nobody even talks about it ...
O'REILLY : OK , look , I 'm concerned about all the things ...
PAUL : Please let me answer .
O'REILLY : But they 're seeking a nuclear weapon , when a country 's seeking a nuclear weapon that 's a danger to the USA , a stated danger , and you want to withdraw from the theater , that gives them carte blanche to do what they want , does it not ?
PAUL : Well - well first off , you know , you have Pakistan .
And they 're not exactly the most pro Western ...
O'REILLY : Yes , but I 'm talking about Iran , congressman .
I 'm not talking about Pakistan at this point .
PAUL : Well , why do n't you ever let me , you know , answer the question ?
O'REILLY : Because you 're not directly answering the question , sir .
PAUL : Because  no , I do not fear them as you do , as many do , because they want another war .
They want to spread this war .
This has been the plan by the neo conservatives to have this major overall  this revamping of the whole Middle East , precisely the reason the al Qaeda is growing .
The al Qaeda is growing because of our policy .
Our national security is threatened because of our policy .
And it makes it much worse .
So I see the Iranians is acting logically and defensively .
We 've been fighting the Iranians since 1953 .
We overthrew their government through the CIA in 1953 .
We were allies with Saddam Hussein in the 1980's .
And we encouraged him to invade ...
O'REILLY : All right , so I just want to  we do not need a history lesson .
But I do want to get this on the record .
PAUL : You have to understand .
O'REILLY : I do understand the ...
PAUL : You have to understand .
O'REILLY : But we do n't time to do the history lesson tonight .
I just want to get this on the record .
You do n't fear Iran , even though Iran has demonstrated it can start a war , which it did last summer with its Hezbollah surrogates ?
PAUL : Bill ...
O'REILLY : And it stated that it wants to do damage to Israel , wipe it off the face of the earth .
PAUL : OK .
O'REILLY : And he 's developing a nuclear weapon .
And you do n't fear them ?
PAUL : Yes , I worry about it , I 'm concerned about it .
But what I 'm saying is the very policy that you advocate is encouraging that .
What I 'm saying , Bill , is this , that put it in perspective .
They do n't have a weapon .
They 're not likely to get one in 10 years , according to our CIA .
O'REILLY : That 's not true .
PAUL : Just think about ...
O'REILLY : That 's not true .
I mean , everybody says it 's five years or less .
And without us in the theater , it 's going to happen a lot quicker .
PAUL : How come we got through the Cold War when the Soviets had 40,000 of them ?
O'REILLY : Because it was a mutual destruction .
PAUL : I was in the Air Force ...
O'REILLY : It was mutual destruction .
Now you can handle any weaponry or any kind of thing to surrogates , who will do your killing for you .
Look , if you do n't think Iran is sponsoring terrorism , you 're living in the land of Oz , congressman .
PAUL : Well , so is Saudi Arabia .
What are you going to do about Saudi ?
What are you going to do with Pakistan ?
O'REILLY : It 's not a government policy in Saudi Arabia .
It 's just a failure to do any effective policing .
It 's a policy in Iran to wipe out Israel ...
PAUL : It 's our policy ...
O'REILLY : ... to attack USA .
PAUL : It 's our policy of preemptive , deliberate invasions of foreign countries and occupying these countries that has jeopardized our safety .
This blowback principle is what caused 9/11 .
And we have to come to realize it .
If you keep living in this dream land of saying that they attack because we 're free and prosperous , believe me , we 're never going to get ...
O'REILLY : Well , if you think that we  if we withdraw off the Gulf , if we get our people out of there , there 's not going to be any more terrorism , then you 're living in the dream land .
You did n't even want to go into Afghanistan to punish those people , did you ?
PAUL : You 're wrong , Bill , you 're wrong on that .
I voted for that .
So you be careful on your quotes .
I mean ...
O'REILLY : Well , in the debate you said you do n't want to be there  you do n't want to be in Afghanistan .
PAUL : Well , they did n't do what we were supposed to .
We were supposed to go after Osama bin Laden .
We let him go into Pakistan .
O'REILLY : We did n't let him go anywhere .
He escaped in there .
That 's war .
PAUL : Yes .
O'REILLY : That 's what happens in war .
PAUL : I know .
But what did we do ?
We went in to doing exactly what Bush said he would n't do , into nations ...
O'REILLY : All right , let me  I only got  I got one more question .
We 're in Afghanistan now trying to have that country stem back the Taliban tie .
Are we doing the wrong thing there ?
PAUL : Right now , we 're doing the wrong things because we did n't do what he was authorized to do ...
O'REILLY : All right .
PAUL : ... as president , ignored going after Bin Laden .
And we do n't need to be a nation , Bill .
We need to defend this country and defend our national security .
And our national security interests are not served by the policy that we 're following in the Middle East .
O'REILLY : All right .
PAUL : It 's undermining our national security .
O'REILLY : That 's what we got to ...
PAUL : We have to come to realize it .
O'REILLY : We got it .
And we appreciate the lively debate .
Thanks for appearing tonight .

Did the IG uncover the drug connection ?
Why
Not just prisoners :
The flights may also have been used for smuggling .

The captured Skyway coke jet .
Argyll previously arranged for a $ 17 million loan to a Mexican businessman , who in turn provided " significant capital " to a
“ Chilean narcotics trafficker " named Manuel Vicente Losada , arrested in the Chilean capital of Santiago after being “ linked to a shipment of five tons of cocaine which U.S. drug enforcement officials in Miami intercepted over six years ago on the vessel Harbour , as it headed toward Guantanamo Bay . ” " Guantanamo Bay " ?
asks Hopsicker .
The implications hang in the air .
Hopsicker lists a few other indicators that Argyll may have a shady history .
No less a figure than Patrick Fitzgerald investigated allegations that Argyll played a role in a scheme to defraud a hedge fund administered by the mother of actor Vince Vaughn .

just
Based on the above , I posit -- but cannot prove -- that Inspector General John Helgerson has been looking into the links between " renditions " and smuggling .
after
Never before has a CIA Director investigated an Inspector General .
Why now ?
( Note : I 've substantially rewritten this piece since original publication . )
The most recent incident involved a Gulfstream II that went down mysteriously in Mexico , after the pilot and passengers had bailed out .
Authorities found over three tons of cocaine on board .
( See here and here . )
In the 2003 -2005 period , that same aircraft was under the control of -- though not technically owned by -- the CIA - linked firm Richmor aviation .
During that time , the jet made a series of " rendition " flights .
Just before the recent coke transport flight , the plane was transferred from one mysterious " owner " to another at a dizzying clip .
( This is common .
When attempting to track the history of CIA aircraft , one should expect to encounter confusing ownership flips and an endless number of on - paper front companies . ) I would ask readers to note the chronology .
Richmor 's routine use of the jet for " prisoner " flights stopped -- when IG John Helgerson started to look into renditions .
This blog has devoted quite a few posts to last year 's remarkable capture , on a Mexican tarmac , of a jet laden with five tons of coke .
( Here and here and here , and that 's for starters . )
Although the plane was surrounded by police , the pilot somehow " got away . " ( Compare his fate to that of the Gulfstream II pilot :
He bailed , was captured , and then tried to bribe his way out of custody .
I do n't know if the bribe worked ; no further news reports have mentioned him . )
The Skyway jet was owned by a noted con artist who , in exchange for protection , allowed " his " plane to be used for various nefarious activities .
Although this aircraft underwent the usual rapid ownership transfers just before the bust in Mexico , it still bore the Skyway logo , which strongly resembles the Homeland Security logo .
Skyway was a fake firm associated with In - Q - Tel , a shadowy investment group begun by CIA personnel .
Although Skyway head Brent Kovar was a notorious scamster , he has never faced a judge , and his aviation undertaking somehow attracted investment from two very real corporations :
The defense giant Titan and Argyll Equities of Boerne , Texas .
According to investigator Daniel Hopsicker , , I fear , is a tale for another time .
Right now , let us stay focused on the eye - popping allegation that Is Guantanamo being used as a drug transshipment point ?
Consider :
The recently - crashed Gulfstream II made a number of trips to Gitmo .
Why ?
To transport prisoners ?
No : News accounts have made clear that the prisoners there were brought in viacraft ..
Evergreen airlines is the most famous CIA - linked aviation company ; indeed , it is difficult to say where Evergreen stops and the Agency begins .
Oddly enough , Evergreen had employed Russell DeFreitas , who was arrested last June for an alleged attempt to blow up JFK airport .
In an earlier post , I argued that DeFreitas was involved with a drug ring while he worked at JFK airport .
News accounts link him with the Triniad - based nationalist organization Jamaat Al Muslimeen , which controls much of the organized crime in that part of the world .
Do you believe that Evergreen -- which is to say , the CIA -- wouldhire a man connected to a criminal syndicate ?
Evergreen is a major player in the " rendition " scandal .
Evergreen aircraft were used to transport " prisoners .
" And perhaps notprisoners .
The pattern is difficult to explain away :
In each of the three episodes listed above , the scenarios changed after 2005 -- the IG began to investigate renditions .
After 2005 , the Gulfstream II underwent a series of weird and hard - to - follow ownership transfers .
So did the Skyway jet .
DeFreitas left Evergreen to work as a " baggage handler " at JFK ( where Evergreen has a presence ) -- an interesting gig for someone associated with drug thugs and spooks .
After two days of prickly confrontations with critics at Columbia University and the United Nations , President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad of Iran held a friendly , even warm , exchange yesterday with Christian leaders from the United States and Canada convinced that dialogue is the only way to prevent war .
The session , held under tight security at a chapel across the street from the United Nations , was a reminder that Mr. Ahmadinejad is a religious president of a religious nation who relishes speaking on a religious plane .
He spent his 20 allotted minutes at the start of the two - hour meeting recounting the chain of prophets central to Judaism , Christianity and Islam , and the commonality of their messages .
He took questions from a panel that included a Quaker , a Catholic , an Anglican , a Baptist and a representative of the interfaith World Council of Churches , some of whom separately said they had been criticized by other religious leaders for sitting down with the Iranian president .
Given the furor over Mr. Ahmadinejad ’s earlier appearances , there was no advance publicity .
The gathering , which included an audience of about 140 other religious leaders , was organized by the Mennonites and Quakers , churches known for their commitment to pacifism .
The 15 - year - old boy who scrawled graffiti on the window of a bus carrying Mayor Antonio Villaraigosa made headlines because he was photographed in the act .
But the vast majority of taggers roam the streets with impunity -- prompting police and community leaders to fight back with new high - tech tools that go well beyond cans of paint and roller brushes .
In Los Angeles , cleanup crews removed 27 million square feet of graffiti last year , up from 21 million square feet in 2004 , officials said .
In other areas of Los Angeles County , 13 million square feet of walls and other surfaces were cleaned , up from 9 million the previous year , according to county public works records .
And officials are finding graffiti in new and unexpected places .

“ My staff goes to Compton all the time , but now we ’re going to Malibu , ” said Valerie Hill , manager of the county Department of Public Works ’ graffiti abatement program .
“ There ’s a ton up in Altadena , the San Gabriel Valley area ... the Covinas , the Glendoras .
We never saw that before . ”
Santa Clarita increased its cleanup efforts last fall in response to a surge in graffiti , while several Inland Empire communities have started offering rewards in hopes the public will turn taggers in .
The city of Orange has seen a significant jump as well , with the cost of removing graffiti jumping nearly 40 % over the last year , said Lyman Otley , Orange ’s building and facilities superintendent .
“ In the last three or four months , it ’s been horrible , ” said Riverside City Councilman Ed Adkison .
“ I suspect it runs in cycles , and for whatever reason people are out tagging right now . ”
Why graffiti is on the rise is a mystery , although some police officials believe it is tied to a surge in gang - related crime over the last year .

“ As the gang problem seems to be increasing , so does the gang graffiti , ” said Paul Racs , director of Los Angeles ’ Office of Community Beautification , adding that the city has seen surges in Venice , Pacific Palisades and other parts of the Westside .
Much of the tagging is home - grown , from teens and tagging crews in these neighborhoods .
“ These are n’t kids that are coming from some other part of the city and coming out to the Palisades to tag , ” he said .
“ For the most part , people are staying in their own communities and tagging them up . ”
Whatever the reason , police are looking for new ways to attack the problem .
They are using global positioning systems , mass data storage and digital photography to track graffiti vandals .
The sophisticated tools allow police to amass evidence and build stronger cases against culprits than just a few years ago .
Sheriff ’s detectives are logging on to MySpace.com to catch taggers who use the social networking site to brag about their exploits .

“ The technology five years ago was n’t what it is today , ” said Tim Kephart , founder of Graffiti Tracker Inc. , which has contracts with 13 Southern California cities .
His system uses a camera fitted with a global positioning device to photograph and record the location of graffiti .
Usually , a police officer or other city worker will take a picture of the tagging .
A Graffiti Tracker analyst reviews the markings and categorizes them based on whether they appear to come from a gang or an individual tagger .
The information is then uploaded into an Internet database that police can search to determine patterns of graffiti incidents .
After two months of tracking graffiti on walls and lampposts , Sheriff ’s Det. Scott Wolf of the department ’s Carson station caught the tagger who called himself “ Pakr , ” one of the area ’s leading graffiti vandals .

Driving in a dark - colored sedan on a chilly night , Wolf spotted the 15 - year - old loitering outside a house .
At first , the teen denied tagging , but after Wolf and Kephart confronted him with the evidence -- images of graffiti stored on Kephart ’s hand - held computer -- Pakr admitted to 13 felony counts of graffiti vandalism , Wolf said .
For decades officials have battled graffiti , which has long been a marker for gangs .
The vandalism surged in the early 1990s with the rise of “ tagging crews ” that were not associated with gangs but roamed the streets at night , leaving their marks on as many walls as possible .
Governments responded by hiring crews to promptly paint over graffiti and boosting night police patrols .
Caltrans placed barbed wire and barriers on freeway signs to deter taggers .
Those efforts reduced tagging -- for a while .
Many officials said the old way of fighting graffiti -- quickly painting over it -- is a failed strategy .

“ The only result it has [ is ] if you get rid of graffiti right away , is you get rid of graffiti right away , ” Kephart said .
“ The tagger will say , ‘ What ’s the worry , nobody ’s tracking it , there ’s no intelligence and no one ’s coming after me . ’
It makes them bolder . ”
Tagging used to be a fairly anonymous criminal activity , with vandals striking by night with obscure monikers whose meaning was lost on most passersby .
But that has changed with the proliferation of Internet communities .
For months , a 17 - year - old who used the nickname “ 4mulaOne ” bragged on his MySpace page about all the MTA trains and buses he had tagged across Los Angeles .
He posted photographs of himself spray - painting buses under the headline : “ I HIT UP WHILE YOU SLEEP . ”
As his postings continued , he revealed more information -- including the nicknames of several fellow taggers -- and eventually let slip that he attended Belmont High School .

He also attached his tagging moniker and the name of his tagging crew .
After a trip to the dean ’s office at Belmont , Sheriff ’s Det.
Kiley Hayden was able to determine the tagger responsible for $ 5,000 in damage to MTA property in four incidents .
A 17 - year - old was arrested on suspicion of vandalism .
Hayden ’s department also investigated the vandalism last Monday of an MTA bus that Villaraigosa was using for a media event .
With thousands of vehicles moving through the region every day , the MTA is hard - hit by graffiti .
The agency ’s annual cleanup costs total $ 20 million .

Hayden is tracking at least half a dozen suspected taggers whose vital statistics were culled from MySpace pages .
There is “ Fame , ” a Manual Arts High School student whose distinctive tags the detective has linked to many cases of bus vandalism .
The Sheriff ’s Department has 31 open cases on a tagger calling himself “ Maze , ” who also has a page on MySpace .
His markings have been found on the Red , Blue and Green lines and on buses in downtown Los Angeles .
( Authorities released the monikers publicly because they did not believe it would harm their investigations . )
Hayden , with the sheriff ’s Transit Service Bureau , realized last April that the Internet could be used to hunt down taggers after an off - duty MTA bus driver spotted a picture of “ 4mulaOne ” on MySpace and alerted authorities .
The driver , who requested anonymity out of fear of retribution , was scrolling through the site in search of former Belmont High classmates when he came upon the photograph .
“ I said , ‘ Boy , that ’s a bus , ’ ” he said .
“ And the background page was cans of spray paint . ”
The 40 - year - old driver confronted the tagger via e-mail .
Advertisement
“ Do you think this is right , what you ’re doing ? ” the driver recalled asking the teenager .
When the boy responded with an expletive , the driver went to his superiors .
“ This is an illegal activity , ” the driver said , noting that he recently kicked a teenager off his bus because the boy was using markers to tag .
“ They ’re looking for notoriety and recognition .
We ca n’t have that .
Not on my bus . ”
But now , it seems , taggers are getting wise to detectives ’ online sleuthing .

“ Every body run ... it ’s the cops , ” a 16 - year - old warned on a tagger ’s message board .
“ Heads up , everyone , this is an alert , we ’ve got the Feds checking our myspaces out ! ... TO ALL TAGGERS = COPS ON MY SPACE !!!!!! ”

The only reason the Democrats did so well in 2006 is that Democrats actually won by margins of 6 - 8 % greater than the official results showed .
I ran through the list of close races where Republicans won and there was only one race ( Tennessee Ford ( D ) vs. Corker ( R ) ) on the Senate side , however in the House , at least 15 races were within 6 % , meaning that the Dems probably should have won an additional 15 seats or so in the House if the Republicans had n't rigged the system this year , assuming that the error is in the official results ( not the exit polls ) and that the bias was a fairly uniform 6 % nationwide .
These are , of course , very rough estimates .
And alarming too .

By adopting a uniform ( white robe and hood ) , as well as by their techniques of intimidation and their conviction that violence was justified in the cause of their group 's destiny , the first version of the Klan in the defeated American
South was arguably a remarkable preview of the way fascist movements were to function in interwar Europe .
( Paxton : 2004 )
... it proposed women 's suffrage and the vote at 18 , abolition of the upper house , convocation of a constituent assembly to draft a new constitution for Italy ( presumably without the monarchy ) , the eight - hour workday , worker participation in " the technical management of industry , " the " partial expropriation of all kinds of wealth " by a heavy and progressive tax on capital , the seizure of certain Church properties , and the confiscation of 85 percent of war profits .
( Paxton : 2004:5 )
, and a towering figure in " relatively mainstream " American journalism , wrote an editorial for Harpers , titled , Welcome to American Fascism
The notion that America is now a fascist state is pretty widespread among dissident types , mostly on the left , but some also on the right .
Various lists have been floating around that try to define what qualities make for a fascist state ; the general implication being that the United States , under Bush , qualifies .
One popular idea is that Mussolini reduced fascism down to corporatism .
In point of fact , Mussolini 's vision seems to have been of a highly disciplined martial society — a culture of spiritual warriors that does n't readily equate with a corpulent culture where most " fascists " are happy to dial up Fox News on the remote and leave the discipline and self - sacrifice to a small , underpaid sector of the underclass .
I thought it would be interesting to ask a few folks representing a variety of views whether they think America is now a fascist state .
Somewhere in the back of my mind , was the auxiliary question , " Does it matter ? "
In other words , certain levels of repression and intolerance are being manifested in various public , political , and legal spheres .
If we can legitimately label it all fascism , will that help to generate a successful opposition ?
I always wonder when I see some protester carrying one of those ( relatively rare , actually ) " Bush = Hitler " protest signs :
How do they think that 's helping ?
Do they think somebody walking down the street who is sort of neutral is going to see this sign and say , " Oh , Bush equals Hitler !
Why did n't you say so ?
I 'm going to revolt now .
" OK , some people are easy targets of ridicule , but the question that I emailed to our panelists : " Do we live in a fascist state ?
Why , or why not ? " is a serious one .
Let 's see what they have to say about it .
( NOTE : Many of these answers were written before the recent mid-term elections . )
Featuring ( click to jump to their answers ) : Campaign consultant for Michael Badnarik , 2004 Libertarian Party Presidential Candidate and 2006 candidate for Congress in Texas ; Libertarian Party activistDo we live in a fascist state ?
Are you kidding ?
Yes .
Absolutely , and very unfortunately , yes .
Let 's analyze the Dictionary.com definition of fascism .
It begins with " a governmental system led by a dictator having complete power . "
George Bush and his administration are assuming vast powers not delegated to them by the Constitution .
President Bush has developed a habit of issuing " signing statements , " declaring what portions of legislation he chooses to enforce or ignore .
Fascism , " forcibly suppress[es ] opposition and criticism . "
There is growing concern and mounting evidence that the 2000 and 2004 presidential election results were manipulated using electronic voting machines and physical intimidation .
As the 2004 Libertarian Presidential nominee , I joined with Green Party nominee , David Cobb , to challenge the vote totals in Ohio .
One precinct in Ohio recorded 4,000 votes for George Bush , 2,000 votes for John Kerry , in a precinct with only 600 registered voters .
There are numerous reports of people being handcuffed and escorted away from George Bush 's campaign events simply because they wore pro-Liberty t- shirts , or asked the President embarrassing questions .
Fascism includes " regimenting all industry , commerce , etc. " which can be summed up nicely by mentioning NAFTA , GATT , and the " Free Trade Area of the Americas " ( FTAA ) .
Our government has been subsidizing the oil and automotive industry for nearly a century , and now the pharmaceutical companies are getting blatant assistance in a vast array of regulations that put smaller drug companies out of business .
If patients in the United States are not allowed to purchase drugs from Canada because " they 're not safe , " then why did American companies sell the drugs to Canada in the first place ?
The definition ends with , " emphasizing an aggressive nationalism and often racism . "
How many times does George Bush have to say , " You 're either with us or against us , " before people realize that anyone critical of our government is now viewed by the administration as a potential terrorist ?
The government already controls and manipulates our health care system .
The National Animal Identification System ( NAIS ) will soon give the government control over most of our food supply by requiring Radio Frequency Identification ( RFID ) tags on all farm animals .
The REAL ID Act has already been passed , and will require every drivers license and passport to contain an RFID chip as early as 2008 .
In my book , Good To Be King : The Foundation of Our Constitutional Freedom , I analyze the ten planks of the Communist Manifesto and draw the disturbing conclusion that the United States is already a communist country , a position that I have held for over a decade .
Keep in mind that fascism and communism are philosophical twins , both of them emphasizing collectivism over individualism .
People need to understand that there is no such thing as " community rights " because communities are abstract collections of individuals .
Every individual in the community has rights , but no more or less simply because they are alone or surrounded by others .
The good news is that the government is growing so fast , and taking so much control over people 's lives , that discontent with the status quo is growing even faster .
The real question is not whether the United States has a fascist government , but whether enough people will be willing to stand against it , potentially risking their lives to assert their individual independence .
Only time will tell .

" Yeah , for sure we do .
I 'm actually just starting a book on this subject .
The weirdest part , though , is that it 's not all bad .
That 's what 's so pernicious about it .
The corporatism envisioned by Ford and Mussolini came to pass , but without the starkness of the racial purity sought by Hitler .
It 's more of a Borgification — assimilation of all .
Even the work of folks like us who call it what it is .
Adorno saw it clearly , as did Walter Benjamin .
But if we 're really going to understand it , I think we have to analyze it from pop culture up , rather than from the halls of the White House down .
They 're just players in this game — not the true rule - makers .
The rules for this particular game scenario were written back in the 1500s .
Or better , look at the article I wrote the month before Lewis Lapham 's , saying basically the same thing : Digital culture legend ; author of The Virtual Community and Smart Mobs I do n't think that it is useful to reduce complex issues to simple answers .
I certainly see that the elements of fascism — centralization of authoritarian power over policy , close coordination with private industry , divisive propaganda , criminalization of dissent , extensive state surveillance — are being put into place .
Who could deny that ?
Extreme conservatives like Bob Barr and Richard Armey as well as ex-generals and ex-intelligence managers have said as much .
Books have been written about it .
I do n't see the slide toward fascism , accelerated by this administration , as inevitable .
I believe it can be stopped and reversed .
It 's not too late yet .
I 've contributed dollars and hours to the mid-term Congressional elections .

Is the first gust of wind from a hurricane itself a hurricane ?
It is not .
And like a hurricane , this storm of right - wing extremism may " change direction " and pass us by , blow itself out .
But also like a community in the path of a hurricane , we 're in serious danger .
The right to have opposition parties which can be voted into power is not characteristic of fascism .
Before the recent midterm election I was quite worried about the GOP stealing the vote , which to me is a precursor to a fascist state — and I 'm still worried about it .
According to Marc Baber of Truth in Voting
So the GOP will try again , with more voting fraud , in 2008 — just more broadly , more desperately , more emphatically .
We could still lose democracy .
And that would leave us with something like fascism .
There 's still a good deal of freedom of speech in this country — even though it was revealed recently that the Pentagon is monitoring antiwar email , because it's " subversive " and might represent a danger , e.g. , the dangerous , scary Quakers they 've been monitoring .
Freedom of speech is not characteristic of fascism .
Right now , we 're in a borderline theocracy , a near - theocracy cynically manipulated by our real overlords , the pharmaceutical companies , the oil companies , big business in general .
They spend hundreds of millions on lobbyists on K Street , pulling the strings on Congress , consolidating their control .
We 'll see if it changes in the next few years — the national will is there to make it change .
If it does n't , we will find ourselves in an early stage of the 21st century version of a fascist state : a country with few freedoms , controlled by multinational corporations .
West Coast Bureau Chief , Wonkette Fascism is such a twisted , loaded and abused word .
We need a completely new term .
Humorless liberals yell " Fascist ! " at anything they do n't like : NASCAR , Wal - Mart , or especially somebody enjoying a nice hamburger .
The Neocons have made the bizarre decision that Fascism is actually a 1,400 - year - old Semitic religion from Arabia , even though that religion is virtually indistinguishable from the monotheistic Semitic religions they claim to follow .
Of course , the Neocons are the closest thing to a purely Fascist party in America .
And my beloved libertarians have the bad habit of believing Fascism is a mom asking grandpa not to blow cigar smoke on the babies , or the cops asking some target shooters to point away from the pre-school .
So what the hell is Fascism in 2006 ?
Russia provides a pretty good example : Media directly controlled by the Kremlin , ethnic minorities literally deported by the military ( re : Georgians ) , oil companies nationalized ( and their executives jailed ) , official skinheads attacking farmers markets , faux - terrorist apartment bombings in Moscow used to justify aggressive wars against bordering ethnic states , and the murder of investigative journalists .
It is n't so obvious in the United States .
There are only a few hundred people in America ( that we know of ) being tortured and jailed forever due to alleged " terrorist " activities .
A handful of powerful government / corporate insiders are assassinated each year — see Philip Merrill — and the corporate media ignores these murders because it 's just too horrifying to go down that bloody path .
But the laws have changed since 9/11 , and those laws were drawn up before 9/11 .
Today , even a U.S. citizen can be locked up and sodomized forever by a robot just for turning up on some government list .
Yet the multi-ethnic character of America 's urban elite makes it tough to lock up all the Asians or Mexicans or Muslims or Negroes or Homosexuals or Presbyterians or Atheists — old - school Fascism needs an internal ethnic enemy .
Habeas corpus is gone .
Military tribunals have been officially authorized to sentence those who go against White House policy .
Much of the news media is either directly owned or covertly financed by the Not So Secret Elite .
Idiots and Jesus Freaks are paid to stir up the yokels .
Election machines are increasingly owned and operated by the GOP interests , and vote stealing is all but ignored .
American culture has intentionally become idiotic , as American education has become both widespread and anti-intellectual .
Today 's college graduate is much dumber than an 8th grader from the 1940s .
New passport laws restrict even going across the Mexican and Canadian borders .
Proposed " homeland security " laws will make it impossible for any dissident to travel by sea or air to other nations .
It 's not fascism , yet .
And it 's unlikely that the USA 's post - 9/11 dystopia will ever be called Fascism by future historians .
It will never become outright Fascism if enough of us take our guns to D.C. and clean house .
During a photo op in New Orleans during the Katrina debacle , Ben Marble was heard on national TV saying , " Go Fuck Yourself , Mr. Cheney .
Go Fuck Yourself , Asshole . "
He is also a doctor , a punk rock musician and a writer .
Yes !
The U.S.A. is now ruled by a Dictator .
His name is Dicktator Cheney .
We all know the delusional optimist , Dubya Gump , is the world 's most famous cheerleader , i.e. , the cheerleader - in - chief who is sent out to raa raa the BUSHEEP .
Surely you can't tell me with a straight face that you honestly believe that Dubya Gump is the real decision maker in this administration ?
If you believe that I have some water front property on the moon I want to sell you !
So yes , The Dicktator Cheney is the " real " president .
His most esteemed advisers are Karl " Sweet Cheeks " Rove , Ronald Donefailed , [ ed : written before Rumsfeld 's departure ] and Condhoeasy Rice .
So how is this consortium of circus freaks fascist ?
Well let 's look at the definition of " fascism " : a.
A system of government marked by centralization of authority under a dictator , stringent socioeconomic controls , suppression of the opposition through terror and censorship , and typically a policy of belligerent nationalism and racism .b.
Oppressive , dictatorial control .
Well for those who do n't understand , they should realize that we have a rare situation in U.S. history on our hands in that these assholes control all three branches of the U.S. government ( executive via the presidency , legislative via the majority in Congress , and judicial via Dubya Gump 's lame Supreme Court appointments ) .
[ ed : written before recent election ]
So there is no question that the Dubya Gump administration is a dictatorship !
Also for those doubters , I would encourage them to look into Dubya Gump 's " signing statements . "
A signing statement is where the president chooses to not follow the law and writes a statement explaining why he is not going to follow the law .
It turns out that Dubya Gump has more signing statements than all other presidents combined !...
No other president has abused power in this way before .
Only those in denial ( BUSHEEP go " baaaa " ) would argue against what is so obvious to the rest of the world , i.e. , the entire power of the U.S. government is in the hands of the Dubya Gump administration .
Who can forget how , after 091101 , the entire world was on our side ?
Well , Dubya Gump made the entire world forget by taking his eye off of the ball in Afghanistan and invading Iraq .
Now the entire world loathes us much the same way people loathed Nazi Germany .
These asses have wiped their holes with the bible , the American flag , and the U.S. constitution over and over .
It is truly amazing that they still have some die - hard followers and maintain an unbelievable amount of support via the BUSHEEP .
Yes they do have some really powerful brainwashing techniques .
I personally blame the " duopoly " for this problem .
Because in the U.S.A. we have the PSEUDO - CHRISTIAN BUSHEEP MINORITY running the Republican party and the PC UTOPIAN FASCIST MINORITY running the Democratic party .
So with MINORITY EXTREMIST agendas controlling both sides of the duopoly , the MAJORITY of Americans were forced to vote for the " lesser of two evils " in 2004 , giving us the re-election of the single worst president in the history of our nation , and proof that the DUOPOLY is a miserable failure ... Perhaps by 2008 we shall have a viable 3rd party that is willing to compromise instead of sticking to extremist minority agendas , and shall represent the MAJORITY OF AMERICANS , i.e. , THE REAL PARTY Media critic ; founding member of Fairness and Accuracy In Media ( FAIR ) , a left - liberal media watchdog organization ; author , War Made Easy : How Presidents and Pundits Keep Spinning Us to Death ( Wiley , 2005 ) No , " we " — residents of the United States — are not living in a " fascist state . "
There are elements of fascism in our midst , including the Bush administration 's largely successful efforts to undermine habeas corpus .
But elements of fascism do not necessarily add up to fascism .
As I write , in October 2006 , we have significant elements of democracy — which does n't make us " a democracy " any more than the existing elements of fascism make the USA a " fascist state . " ( Lewis Lapham 's essay a year ago , " We Now Live In A Fascist State , " is disappointing .
It conveys more look - down - the - nose elitist anger than persuasive analysis .
I 'm angry too , and I 've been actively working against militarism in the United States since the mid/late 1960s .
I do n't see how the essay helps us understand clearly where we are and what we need to do . )
Founder and Editor of Tikkun ; progressive Jewish activist ; author ; National Chair of The Network of Spiritual Progressives ( NSP ) If you are talking about " we " as the people of the U.S. , then no , we are not living in a fascist society yet , though we are not far from it and are on a slippery slope in that direction .
But if the " we " is the people of the world , under the global economic and military system ruled by the U.S. with the other G8 countries as major lieutenants , then yes , there is much of the world that is in fact already living in a fascist society , and we cannot separate ourselves from them and say , " no , we are not in a fascist society , " because in fact their fate is imposed by the indifference , ignorance , fear , and sense of futility that characterizes many of the people living in the U.S. today .
Inside the U.S. , the similarity to fascism is in the power of corporations to control government , media , universities , and the economic lives of most of our citizens .
Plus the massive power of these institutions working together and through the mass media to shape a world view and filters in the individual consciousness of many Americans .
That is massive power , beyond anything that has ever existed in the history of the human race before .
It would be best to have a different name for this massively oppressive reality , rather than to use a term developed to describe a different reality in the first half of the twentieth century , a reality whose memory gets invoked in the hope of making people tremble at how bad the current reality is .
But it would be far more impactful if we simply described this reality and did not seek to draw historical comparisons which may shake and rattle the consciousness of historians and intellectuals but which are increasingly irrelevant to people born after 1960 and who do not have the same associations with this word .
The truth is that if we lived in a fascist society as it used to be , we'd be trembling at having this conversation and having our names attached to it , knowing that we might be subject to prison for even raising this topic .
The fact is that America retains much of its democratic and human rights for most ( not all ) of its citizens , and that is more than we can say for many of the countries on earth .
Such a society cannot be fascist .
Yet we can be on the path .
The recent torture bill was a significant step , and the failure of Democrats to wage a filibuster against it once again demonstrates to those who would move more quickly in the direction of a full - scaled fascism that their opponents have no backbone and hence are not to be worried about .
It seems unlikely that the Democrats in power will revoke that bill .
Some have invented the term " friendly fascism " or " soft fascism " to describe the contemporary reality .
Well , perhaps .
But if you want to use that term , you want to because you want to milk the remaining negative energy toward the word " fascism " while in fact acknowledging that the situation is qualitatively different .
When a full - scale fascism arrives in all its authenticity , you will know it by its deeds and there will not be an argument among progressives about whether it is here or not .
Chances are great that instead we will be locked up in some modern style concentration camp , or possibly even subjected to torture .
I 'm not looking forward to such a period — I was sent to prison by the Nixon White House for my role as a national leader of the anti-war movement at that time , and it was n't fun , and yet it was easy compared to what we may face when fascism fully arrives .
Meanwhile , I 'm building a Network of Spiritual Progressives precisely to speak to people who can yet be won away from the tendencies toward fascism .
It is that conversation that is deeply needed in the contemporary Moment — check it out by reading my book The Left Hand of God : Taking Back Our Country from the Religious Right and by joining our network at www.spiritualprogressives.org.Director of Research , Walter Benjamin Research Syndicate ; taught courses at New College of California including , " From Berlin Bohemia to Hitler : The Weimar Republic 's Crisis Democracy & The Emergence of German Fascism " and " The Virulent Phoenix : The Theory and Practice of Fascism . " HAS THE U.S. GONE [ email protected ] $ %!?&$*?!!!!
Serious theorists and intellectuals have posed this question for quite some time .
Writing a review in 1942 of Franz Neumann 's classic analysis , " Behemoth : The Structure and Practice of National Socialism , " C. Wright Mills wrote the following Seven years prior to this , Sinclair Lewis had written a novel , a bad one , entitled , " It Can't Happen Here , " a rather thinly veiled reference to the MacGuire Affair , i.e. , the 1934 attempt by the DuPonts , J.P. Morgan , the Remingtons , and others to enlist Gen. Smedley Butler in a coup d'etat .
Lewis made the comment that when fascism came to America , it would come draped in the flag and carrying a bible .
Prescient words .
In his The Anatomy of Fascism , Robert Paxton considers the Ku Klux Klan to be perhaps the first example of " the earliest phenomenon that can be functionally related to fascism ...
" There have long been fascistic elements alive and well in the United States .
Depending on who you are , your ethnicity and your class , you may come into contact with these elements more often than other people .
For a poor and uneducated illegal immigrant , for a poor black kid in the ’hood , the U.S. remains Amerikkka , and the Klan are still in power .
But a privileged upper - middle class white woman shopping in Needless Markup might not have any idea what you 're talking about because she can do whatever she wants .
If you 're an Arab Muslim man getting ready to board an airplane in Los Angeles , you wonder whether fascism has come to America when you 're told that you will not be allowed on the plane , etc .
And what about all these American Arabs who have simply disappeared over the past few years ?
In my opinion , however , this word " fascism " is used much too recklessly .
All too often " fascism " and " fascist " is simply invective .
It has come to mean " violent , intolerant , racist reactionary . "
That 's not good enough .
The Italian communist theoretician Togliatti warned against confusing the word as a theoretical term with its use for " agitational purposes .
" Was the Roman Sejanus a " fascist " ?
He certainly instituted a police state in Rome replete with sophisticated surveillance system , like the Gestapo .
Everybody was ratting on everybody else .
Unfortunately , precious few people have any idea what " fascism " is .
More and more , it is equated with very simplistic formulae : a merger of the state and corporations .
Were that the basis of fascism , as a generic category in political science , one would still have to account for all the horror associated with it .
How many people know what the platform of Mussolini 's first Fascist Movement stood for ?
Let 's take a look :
The problem is that particular examples of what is generically called " fascism , " such as Mussolini's Partito Nazionale Fascista ( PNF ) and Hitler 's NSDAP , continually redefined themselves : on the road to power , in power , and at war .
When faced with this question of whether the U.S. has " gone fascist , " commentator Bill Mandel a few years ago answered in the negative .
He was of the opinion that the essential paramilitary element was totally missing here .
I completely agree with him .
What about the Black Shirts ?
Mussolini 's paramilitary squadristis .
What about all that castor oil and truncheon action ?
Hitler 's Sturm Abteilung ?
Where 's the parallel here ?
Can you name paramilitary squads on that scale at play in the U.S.A .?
I defy anyone reading this to point to a threat like that .
Yes , there are plenty of small groups like the Michigan Militia and Dominionist types .
Yes , Battle Cry is scary .
But , get real .
No real parallel ... at all .
Could we have this discussion if the U.S. were a fascist totalitarian dictatorship ?
Could I write what Cheney & Co. would consider " subversive " emails all day long in such a regime ?
Could I do my radio show on KPOO in San Francisco ?
Would the Democrats , whatever you think of them , have ousted the Republicans from Congress under a fascist dictatorship ?
Would Rumsfeld have been forced out ?
There has been a tendency for far too long to equate generic fascism with the last rung on the ladder , the very worst , a synonym for kakistocracy , " the rule of the worst .
" I suggest that it would be possible for the US to outdo the Nazis in their atrocities without being fascist .
The U.S. is not a fascist state , but there are fascistic elements alive and well in our society .
The U.S. is , for want of a better definition , a neo-liberal , plutocratic National Security State .
The " authoritarian personality " investigated by Theodor Adorno and earlier by Wilhelm Reich ( Mass Psychology of Fascism ) , however , can be found throughout the United States today .
Abu Ghraib prison and the ongoing torture atrocities being practiced in state and privatized penitentiaries are an area for investigation here .
These infernal regions also need to be seen within the context of the explosion of heterosexual and homosexual BD / SM pornography all over the world , but mostly emanating from the USA .
I think Hans - Juergen Syberberg was quite correct in seeing a link between sado - masochist pornography and Nazism .
The image of the inflatable plastic " fuck - me " doll with open mouth in his film " Hitler : A Film from Germany " and the narrator 's words " Hitler , here is your victory " accompanying this image , is pure brilliance .
By reducing love and affection to disposable kitsch , we are mass producing sociopaths out of our soldiers , and inculcating what I believe to be the real essence of a fascist personality structure .
My own provisional definition of fascism , a mere paraphrase of Wilhelm Reich and Roger Griffin , is the following : Fascism is the progressively all - inclusive and martial re-organization of society according to a violent re-assertion of masculine stereotypes through symbols of nationalism and ethnicity .
Fascists call for a re-awakened virility to rejuvenate the nation .
This assertion of " virility " is the reaction to what fascists fear : everything feminine .
Historian Roger Griffin has written that the fascist reality is " a radical misogyny or flight from the feminine , manifesting itself in a pathological fear of being engulfed by anything in external reality associated with softness , with dissolution , or the uncontrollable .
"
The avenue of research for this subject should follow the lead of Klaus Theweleit ( " Male Fantasies " , 1977 ) and Dagmar Herzog ( " Sex After Fascism " , 2005 ) .
And people serious about pursuing this subject must stop being afraid to look at and refer to internet pornography for their evidence and proof .
It 's ubiquitous and taboo at the same time , and scholars act as if it did n't exist .
The Road from " sexandsubmission.com " to Abu Ghraib may be a tortuous stretch , but it is not a long one .
SexpertMy response would be , " it 's a reasonable question to ask . "
It 's not hysterical .
Does one understand that something is definitively " fascist " these days only in retrospect ?
What would it mean to use the term in a descriptive , accurate way today ?
In terms of the recent legislation we 've seen , the post - 911 shredding , the constitution , particularly the first amendment and the right to a fair trial , have been gutted .
Our elections are rigged , our Supreme Court is stacked ... what alternative are we left with ?
And yet Americans are still so complacent , apathetic , and invested in the middle class American dream — regardless if it has an economic basis or not — that they have n't notice there 's no THERE THERE anymore .
But ultimately they will .
I do have one concern about my objectivity , and that is my age and the perhaps innocent naive I bring with it .
I can remember interviewing older folks who suffered under the worst of McCarthyism , or Japanese Americans who were sent to internment camps .
I have family and friends who saw the most frightening elements of the Kennedy / MLK assassinations or watched the high circus of the Chicago 8 trial and Mayor Daley 's thugs in Chicago .
And if we looked back at our grandparents ' and our great - grandparents ' histories , similar disgrace and outrage would continue to be cataloged .
Was our constitution any stronger when " pioneers " were shooting Indians on sight like vermin ?
Were the Depression and the violent attacks on the early labor movement some shining hour for the Bill of Rights ?
Just open your history book and pick a bloody page .
Maybe , as Byrne once sang , " it 's same as it ever was , " and I 've just finally reached the age where I can't take it anymore .
Or maybe it's because I WAS a child of the 60s and saw such a remarkable , progressive renaissance .
This nation has always been about violence and prejudice and hypocrisy .
What was unusual was the moments when it was SOMETHING ELSE , when peace , love , and compassion were celebrated and practiced .
I was in the New Left and everyone was constantly running around with their history books trying to decide the precise SECOND when you could say that fascism was officially in motion .
Nixon had a lot of people shook up , that 's for sure .
Now I tend to see history in motion with the worst of authoritarianism always in play , always aggressive .
Global capitalism without a leash does n't amount to anything else .
The more interesting question to ask is , " Is there anything to counteract it ? "
( CNN ) --
When Maggie Sorrells looks at her husband , Andy , she does n't see the man she married .
In fact , most days , she does n't even recognize herself .
Maggie and Andy Sorrells weighed 440 pounds and 505 pounds , respectively , at their heaviest .

Before the Franklin , Tennessee , couple met online , both had endured lifelong struggles with weight and emotional overeating .
Together , they had a combined weight of nearly 1,000 pounds .
Maggie , who had a family history of heart disease and diabetes , had been warned by her doctor at the age of 27 that she would n't live to see 30 .
But her real moment of truth came when she visited her mother in the hospital .
" The biggest shock of my entire life was stepping on a hospital scale and realizing I weighed 440 pounds , " she recalls .
Until that moment , Maggie says she never knew how much she weighed , because she was too heavy to register on a household scale .
Andy , like Maggie , tried countless diets but failed to keep the weight off .
At his heaviest , he was 505 pounds and had to have most of his size 64 clothing made by his mother to fit his 6 - foot - 3 - inch frame .
See before - and - after photos of CNN.com I - Reporters »
Obesity took an emotional and physical toll on the couple .
Andy says people constantly teased him about his weight and he eventually withdrew .
He battled depression and took anti-depressants for seven years .
Maggie , on the other hand , tried to conceal her misery by making other people laugh .
" I was so depressed and so miserable .
I was always the funny fat girl , but on the inside I was miserable , " recalls Maggie .
" It held me back in many ways and I started to accept it as being genetic and felt this was just the way I was going to be . "
Though she never let her obesity keep her from traveling or socializing , it had affected her quality of life .
Maggie had to use a seatbelt extension on airplanes and was once asked to get off a roller - coaster at an amusement park .
In August 2002 , the couple was married and they soon made a decision that would forever change their lives .
Before getting married , a friend introduced Maggie to The Weigh Down Workshop , a faith - based weight loss program , which teaches people to conquer their addiction to food , as well as other substances and vices , by turning to God .
Maggie says she was never consistent or committed enough to stick with the program .
But shortly after their wedding , the couple started packing on the pounds and while Andy tried another diet , Maggie gave Weigh Down another try .
" At the end of 2002 and the beginning of 2003 , I called Weigh Down and started taking the classes , " says Maggie .
" My whole life , I had always wanted somebody to [ lose weight ] with me .
But I knew if I wanted it bad enough , I would have to do it alone . "
She began to lose weight .
" I ate whatever I craved , but only when I was truly hungry and then I ate a lot more slowly , so I could tell when to stop , " Maggie says .
In February 2003 , after seeing his wife 's results , Andy stopped counting calories , gave up the low - fat foods and reduced his portion sizes .
Fifteen months later , he had lost 257 pounds .
" Once I started this program , it changed my outlook on my entire life .
I realized that being happy is a choice .
I can either be filled with hate and despair or I can be happy , " says Andy , who realized he no longer needed the anti-depressants .
Maggie 's weight loss was more gradual .
Shortly after starting the program , Maggie became pregnant with the couple 's first child .
Sadly , she lost the baby when she was seven months pregnant .
" Many of our family members were afraid that we would turn back to food after we lost our first daughter , since we had turned to food to solve our problems our whole lives , " remembers Maggie .
Faith , she says , helped her overcome the loss and continue on the program .
Three years later , she had not only lost 300 pounds but she also gave birth to another daughter , Lily .
Last week , the couple welcomed their son , Jacob .
How has the weight loss changed their lives ?
Maggie , who now weighs 140 pounds and wears a size six , and Andy , who weighs 220 pounds and wears a size 36 , say they had no idea their lives could be this good .
" It blows my mind that we look the way we do , " says Maggie .
The couple shares their success and strategy for weight loss by leading online classes for Weigh Down .
Maggie believes if just one person 's life can be changed by her story then her struggle will have been worth it .
" I want people to know there is hope .
I looked for hope my whole life , " says Maggie .
" I want that person who is just like the old me to look at where I am now and know that you want to be here ! "

If you 're a cheater or an online trouble - maker in Halo 3 , Bungie has it in for you .
Last Friday they posted a message — more of a threat , really — saying that they know who you are , and they 're not happy .
There are those of you doing things you should n’t be in Halo 3 .
Some of you have gotten a little too famous for your own good .
This ai n’t a church and there is no redemption or salvation once you have been judged .
Apologies are now officially too late to save you .
The storm approaches .
Love , Bungie
The tongue - in - cheek message is clearly meant to send the online community into a frenzy of terrified squeals , but what 's really going on ?
A member of the Ars Technica forum community who happens to work at Bungie chimed in with what the message means saying that they 're " almost done dialing in the Banhammer , and a few people who helped us test Phase One are about to help us test Phase Two . "
What are they looking for ?
Network attacks , by and large .
Hard to prevent , easy to detect , but
we 've had to wait and make sure there were no game issues that could be
confused for abusive behavior .
Banning a false positive is worse
than missing several legitmate bridgers , DDoS'ers , and their ilk .
So
our process has been pretty methodical so far .
You can't run , you can't hide , and your accounts are forfeit .
The reckoning is coming .
Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid made the following statement today in response to Senator Pete Domenici ’s call for a new U.S. military strategy in Iraq :
“ Senator Domenici is correct to assess that the Administration ’s war strategy is misguided .
But we will not see a much - needed change of course in Iraq until Republicans like Senators Domenici , Lugar and Voinovich are willing to stand up to President Bush and his stubborn clinging to a failed policy – and more importantly , back up their words with action .
Beginning with the Defense Authorization bill next week , Republicans will have the opportunity to not just say the right things on Iraq , but vote the right way too so that we can bring the responsible end to this war that the American people demand and deserve .
“ As evidence mounts that the ‘ surge ’ is failing to make Iraq more secure , we cannot wait until the Administration ’s September report before we change course .
President Bush and the Iraqis must move now to finally accept a measure of accountability for this war , implement the Iraq Study Group recommendations , transition the mission for our combat troops and start bringing them home from an intractable civil war . ”
UPDATE : Pelosi weighs in too .
A new moon of Saturn has been discovered , bringing the planet 's satellite tally to 60 .
Initial measurements suggest the new moon , which is still unnamed , is about 1.2 miles ( 2 kilometers ) wide , and lies between the orbits of Mehone and Pallene , two Saturnian moons discovered by NASA ’s Cassini spacecraft in 2004 .
The newfound moon is about 1.09 million miles ( 1.76 million kilometers ) from Saturn and could be part of a larger group of still undiscovered moons around the ringed planet .
The moon was observed by Cassini on May 30 , 2007 .
Saturn has the second largest tally of moons in the solar system next to Jupiter , which has 63 .
However , like the definition of “ planet , ” there is an ongoing debate about what size a satellite must be and how it must behave to qualify as a moon .
If very small and as - yet unfound objects are ultimately included , the moon tallies could soar into the hundreds or even thousands .
I do n't know about you , but I came away from seeing " Pirates of the Caribbean : At World 's End " feeling that Disney and director Gore Verbinski had squandered an opportunity .
The strength of the series ' first film – apart from Johnny Depp 's enjoyably cracked performance as Capt .
Jack Sparrow – was that it was about early 18th century pirates , as intriguing an inspiration as a fantasy - monger could ask for .
It was a classic swashbuckler 's tale , spiced up with just enough supernatural hocus - pocus to make it refreshing , and give the special effects guys something to do .
My gripe with the movies that followed , particularly the latest , was that they largely dispensed with the pirates and their real - world nemeses in favor of computer - generated underworlds , villains , and goddesses .
I say , let well enough alone :
What better material to draw inspiration from than the real pirates of the Caribbean ?
Of course , I 'm biased , having just published a book detailing the exploits of the latter , " The Republic of Pirates : Being the True and Surprising Story of the Caribbean Pirates and the Man Who Brought Them Down . "
Two years poring through microfilm and faded parchment on both sides of the Atlantic revealed a story I find every bit as compelling as any pirate fiction – Mr. Verbinski 's included .
Virtually all of our pirate imagery comes from a single circle of pirates who knew one another , shared a common base in the Bahamas , and operated for a very brief period : 1715 to 1725 .
This gang – including Blackbeard , Sam Bellamy of Whydah fame , the female pirates Mary Read and Anne Bonny , and the gentleman pirate Stede Bonnet – provided the inspiration for the great pirates of fiction , from Long John Silver and Captain Hook to Captain Blood and Jack Sparrow .
Pirates have been around since ancient times , and remain today , attacking container ships off Indonesia and cruise liners off East Africa .
But the Bahamian pirate gang was different from the rest in motivation and degree of success .
At their zenith , Blackbeard and his colleagues had not only disrupted the commerce of three empires , they 'd graduated to terrorizing warships and the colonies themselves .
Britain 's Royal Navy went from not being able to catch the pirates ( who initially favored swift , agile sloops ) to being afraid to encounter them at all ( after they captured large , heavily armed vessels capable of overpowering any frigate stationed in the Americas at the time ) .
In May 1717 , the captain of the 22 - gun HMS Seaford reported having abandoned a patrol of the British Leeward Islands because he was " in danger of being overpowered by the pirates . "
By then , even the harbors were unsafe .
While the Seaford cowered in Antigua , Sam Bellamy 's men occupied Virgin Gorda , seat of the deputy governor of the Leeward Islands , where they caroused , repaired their vessels , and kept the authorities in a state of fear .
Later that year , Blackbeard burned Guadeloupe 's main settlement to the ground and destroyed much of the shipping at St. Kitts even in range of the guns of the king 's fort .
The pirates repeatedly blockaded Charleston , S.C. and the approaches to Philadelphia and the Chesapeake Bay .
They were motivated by more than simple banditry .
Indeed , many were former sailors who saw themselves in a social revolt against shipowners and captains who'd made their lives miserable .
Bellamy 's crew referred to themselves as Robin Hood 's men .
" They vilify us , the scoundrels do , when there is only this difference :
They plunder the poor under the cover of law ... and we plunder the rich under the cover of our own courage , " Bellamy told a captive .
On seizing a vessel , they turned its government upside down .
Instead of using whips and other violence to enforce a rigid , top - down hierarchy , the pirates elected and deposed their captains by popular vote .
They shared their treasure almost equally , at a time when captains aboard privateers ( private , legally sanctioned warships ) typically got 14 times more than a crewman , according to surviving ship contracts .
Many pirate crews did n't allow the captain his own cabin – he had to share it with the crew .
" This is a time when the distribution of income , land , and power is becoming increasingly concentrated , yet the pirates organized themselves very democratically , " notes Ken Kinkor of the Expedition Whydah Museum in Provincetown , Mass .
Most surprising : Popular opinion was on the pirates ' side .
Authorities regularly complained to their superiors in London that many of their subjects regarded the pirates as heroes .
Virginia Gov. Alexander Spotswood fumed that his citizens had " an unaccountable inclination to favor pirates , " while his counterpart in South Carolina weathered a pro-pirate riot in which Charleston narrowly avoided being burned to the ground .
" They were figures of popular folklore while they were still alive , " says Marcus Rediker a University of Pittsburgh maritime historian .
" They were breaking the law , and yet they were not seen as criminals by a majority of the population . "
Their allies sometimes included the authorities themselves .
In 1718 , Blackbeard came ashore here in Bath , North Carolina 's sleepy village capital at the time .
In an effort to suppress piracy , King George I had offered a pardon for pirates who turned themselves in .
Blackbeard – a former British privateer also known as Edward Thatch or Teach – took the pardon from Gov. Charles Eden and then appears to have set himself up as a sort - of Tony Soprano figure , directing an underground piracy operation under the governor 's protection .
When Royal Navy officers eventually came to apprehend the arch - pirate , they reported that Governor Eden 's administration was distinctly uncooperative .
The reason became clear when , during a search of the Collector of Customs ' barn , a large parcel of pirated goods was discovered under a pile of hay .
Not all pirates were impoverished sailors .
Indeed , some were quite respectable , including Paulsgrave Williams , son of Rhode Island 's attorney general , and Stede Bonnet , scion of an influential Barbados family .
There 's considerable evidence that these pirates had a secret motivation of their own : to depose George I and restore the House of Stuart to the British throne .
Some pirates from the Bahamas even sent a letter to the court of the would - be Stuart King in exile in France offering their services .
A remarkable number of pirates were of African or native American origin , according to accounts of captives and pirates brought to trial .
The pirate vessels were among the few places in European America where they could be free .
There were more than 30 Africans in Bellamy 's crew , and as many as 60 in Blackbeard 's , which would have made them the majority .
These crewmen – all probably born in the Americas – appear to have been treated as equals .
( Not so those Africans found in the holds of inbound slave vessels , who the pirates appear to have generally regarded as cargo , rather than potential recruits . )
The Disney series draws on these influences , from their inclusion of Africans in the pirate 's crew to the cross-dressing antics of Elizabeth Swann .
If a fourth movie is made , perhaps its writers will dig deeper and find they wo n't need quite so much of the supernatural to carry the plot along .

Risk is a classic board game that introduced many players to the genre of war games .
Despite its start as a traditional board game , the game has gained popularity in recent years on popular websites like Reddit .
The roll of the dice determines a lot in Risk , but so do strategy and intelligent tactical decisions .
This strategy board game was created in 1957 and requires two to six players .
Players are required to have skills in strategy , tactics , and negotiation .
Gameplay can take anywhere from one to eight hours .
This game of diplomacy allows players to form alliances throughout the game on a political map consisting of territories and continents .
11 Winning Strategies
Risk is not a team game .
Alliances , if they exist at all , are always temporary .
It is imperative that you do not spread yourself too thin because other players could sweep through and capture all of your one - army countries quite easily .
This blog led me to a premiere :
My first letter written with TeX .
Guess whom I sent this letter ?
Don Knuth , inventor of TeX and author of The Art of Computer Programming .
His answer looks like this :
He corrected my use of the quotes and then goes on to reply to my question “ what are the most important problems in computer science ? “ , inspired by a talk of Richard Hamming .
I admire Dick Hamming enormously , but I disagree that his first question is “ good ” .
Everybody knows famous , unsolved , “ big ” problems , which tend to be thought important because of their fame .
And perhaps those problems are indeed important … although when they are finally resolved ( like the question of deciding equivalence of deterministic languages )
I find to my surprise that I do n’t get very excited by the result , rather by the method used to get there I firmly believe that computer science advances by thousands of people solving small problems , which go together and create a massive edifice .
Every year that goes by , hardly anything is done that appears to be a milestone worthy of mass attention ; yet after five or ten years pass , the whole field has changed significantly .
So I ’m no fan of “ top ten ” problem lists .
Let ’s hear it for the people who work on and solve small problems based on their judgement of peer pressure .
Like for example Hamming .
I agree that the progress in year seems insignificant , but I do n’t want to agree that we ca n’t see where we ’re heading with computer science .
This blog is my try to get an overview , to get a form stand on the shoulders of the giants and see a littler further .
Web 2.0 is not only over hyped , but innovators add features to web applications to improve the user experience .
Are these extra bells and whistles really improving our lives and making things easier ?
To me , the answer to this question is a resounding no .
I do n’t fault people for wanting to be diverse .
I do n’t fault innovators for wanting to innovate .
However , I think that a narrower focus is better for survival in the long run .
Interestingly enough , I had this conversation with a close friend who inspired me to blog about a year ago .
Blogging on broad topics , he said , was not ideal .
Focus on one area ; do n’t go in different directions .
Capture your audience first .
Initially , I did n’t think his advice was that sound .
I think blogs can go all directions .
After all , Darren Rowse said that your first 10,000 blog posts are always the worst .
He ’s right about that .
But your first 10 blog posts are probably worse than your latter 90 , and you improve as you go along .
Brian Clark summed it up nicely by urging bloggers to write .
You gain experience with every post , every comment , and every ounce of feedback .
But I digress .
My concern is not so much about blogs .
I still think some of the best blogs go many different ways , anyhow .
Aaron had a point that does n’t hold so much for bloggers as it does for web applications and sites .
Two examples stand out in my mind :
The microblogging phenomenon :
In July , I was super - ecstatic about Pownce .
In fact , after reviewing its features , Pownce came out above Twitter .
Since I used to tweet pretty often , this was a conflicting issue for me , and I was faced with a dilemma : where do I focus my attention ?
Here ’s a site with a good load of features , and here ’s a site with a whole lot of users .
Would the users go to Pownce for more features , or would they stick with Twitter ?
Instead of letting my Pownce judgment get in the way , I decided instead to stay with both Twitter and Pownce and give equal attention to both .
Now , three months later , I am addicted to neither , but when it comes down to it , Twitter is the winner .
Why ?
The bottom line is that the extra features that Pownce offered started getting in the way of making Pownce a desirable microblogging application .
Yes , replies are a wonderful addition to microblogging , and it would be nice to include that in Twitter , but Pownce ’s extra features can simply be summed up as clutter .
I do n’t need clutter .
The social news networking phenomenon :
The second issue would certainly be one that is close to my heart .
I speak of nothing else but Digg .
On day one , I evaluated the new changes and I did n’t like it .
It ’s now four weeks into this mess and I still do n’t like it .
Digg succeeds as a social news site , or at least it did .
It does not fare so well as a social news - Facebook hybrid site .
Shouts are easily construed as spam , and when I was gone for the holidays two weeks ago , I notated in my profile that I ’d be away and that I do n’t want shouts .
I was even kind enough not to disable shouts .
When I returned , I had nearly 50 shouts from people asking me to Digg their stories .
( Thanks for listening . )
Needless to say , I ’ve since turned off shouts , and apparently other Diggers are catching on .
Earlier , I observed that it ’s hard to even pick out good stories from Digg ’s upcoming list because there are posts there that are so easily gamed through shouts .
Digg is no longer being a social news network of providing quality news .
Rather , Digg is becoming a network that can be easily manipulated where preference goes to those stories that are thrown in front of people ’s faces when many clearly do n’t want them .
I disabled shouts for two reasons : it detracts from the social news experience ( I want my news , I want to vote on my preferred news with that decision being mine and mine alone , and I want to comment within the stories that interest me ) , and unnecessary information ( read : spam ) is being sent to me without me opting in .
Again , it ’s an issue of the attention economy and whether or not these features are really enhancing users ’ experience .
I certainly feel that these features killed usability and did nothing to benefit the user unless it Digg is advocating spam or wants to emulate a social network that it clearly is not .
A recent note posted ( ironically ) on Pownce got me wondering about what works .
I think there ’s a real problem when there are so many social networks begging for our attention .
Worse , it is awful when you see three of your friends flocking to one social network while four of your other friends choose another one .
What is the best , and why ?
Should diversity prevail ?
There ’s certainly a tug - of - war of social sites that are calling for my attention nowadays and I do n’t know where to go .
I think , however , that there ’s one easy answer : simplicity wins .
Zhejiang Satellite TV‘s Citizens Take Action 《 绿原公民行动 》 has uncovered the most extraordinary story of a woman , Wang Xiaocui ( 王晓翠 ) who has been rescued from an underground hole in Lin County , Lu Liang District , Shanxi Province .
Barely 2 square meters in area , the hole was home for Wang , and this was where she would eat , drink , sleep and take care of ALL her bodily functions everyday for six long years .
As it turned out , Xiaocui was bought by her husband , Guo Runxiao ( 郭润小 ) from someone else for RMB6,700 .
In his youth , Guo was marked an Outstanding Person by the Shanxi Province for academic excellence , but was eventually imprisoned 13 years for rape .
By the time he was released , he was already 45 and no woman would marry him .
Hence he decided he would buy someone to marry and have children with .
Guo saw that Wang was highly educated , smart , good in foreign languages , but she was also mildly mentally disturbed .
Nevertheless , he married her and even went on to have two children with her – a 6 year old son and a 4 year old daughter who was born in the hole .
But as her mental condition worsened over the years , Wang would start breaking everything at home and hit her children , and it became apparent to Guo that he would have to house her elsewhere .
With the help of the local police , the news crew eventually rescued Wang out of the hole , but not without much coaxing since she had stayed in the hole for six years .
They put clothes on her and cleaned her up .
At first , even her children would not even come close to her but over the course of the next few days , she had the chance to hug them for the very first time .
On hearing of the heart - wrenching news of her daughter , Wang ’s 70 - year old mother broke down and cried .
She said she was the smartest of her kids , was very introverted , and would not say much to people around .
However , Wang suffered a severe setback when she did n’t make it to the university .
She was eventually diagnosed with schizophrenia , and her family went around borrowing up to RMB80,000 to pay the doctors to get their favourite daughter well again .
To cut the long story short , Wang was married to several men one after the other and even had children with some of them , but was eventually divorced or sold away because of her relapse .
This was how she ended up with Guo Runxiao .
This is the first of a 5 - part documentary of the rescue of Wang Xiaocui .
Parts 2 , 3 , 4 and 5 can be found here , here , here and here .
Wang is currently receiving psychiatric treatment at the Kangfu Hospital in Shanxi Province ’s Luliang City .

WHO , WHAT , WHY ?
The Magazine answers ...
Nan Goldin , the artist whose picture has been seized by police
The seized artwork
The picture , Klare and Edda belly - dancing , is part of a 139 - image collection by the American photographer Nan Goldin .
It had been on display in the Baltic Centre for Contemporary Art in Gateshead and shows young girls , one of them naked .
Removed from the gallery by police , it is up to the Crown Prosecution Service ( CPS ) to decide whether to prosecute .
If it were to press charges , it would be under the 1978 Protection of Children Act which prohibits showing " indecent " photographs of children .
THE ANSWER Context is key
If it 's a picture of a child , age matters Has the child been exploited ?
Sir Elton owns ' porn probe ' photo
The controversy resurrects a familiar debate about censorship : does the context of an image determine whether or not it breaks the law ?
In other words , does it matter that a photograph of a naked child is in a respectable art gallery - rather than in a seedy magazine or on an illegal website ?
Or is explicit child nudity - which is how many would categorise Goldin 's picture - unacceptable and illegal , per se ?
As might be expected opinions in the argument are divided .
Gut instinct
Just because an image is located in a respectable location does n't make it automatically immune from the law , says a spokeswoman for the anti-child pornography group , the CEOP Centre .
WHO , WHAT , WHY ?
A regular part of the BBC News Magazine , Who , What , Why ?
aims to answer some of the questions behind the headlines
" People who have sexual interest in children come from all walks of life , " she says .
" You can't tell who is in your gallery and why they are looking at images . "
Gut - instinct , she added , was also crucial .
" There are some images which just do n't feel right .
What is important is the lasting impression you get once you have viewed the image .
If it leaves you with the lasting impression that what you are viewing is child abuse , then it probably is . "
But campaigners for artistic freedom disagree .
Mary Hayward of the Campaign Against Censorship says the gut instinct of one person is " entirely subjective " .
She calls for a statutory defence of " artistic merit " to be made available to people prosecuted under the 1978 Act .
And Ms Hayward argues the wider context of an image should always be taken into account when it was being judged as illegal pornography . "
Two main questions
" What matters is not only where the picture is being exhibited , but who took it ; why they took it ; and all the circumstances surrounding it .
WHAT DOES THE LAW SAY ?
It 's an offence to take , or permit to be taken or to make , any indecent photograph of a child
It 's also an offence to distribute or show such indecent photographs
However , the question of whether Goldin 's picture breaks the law rests with lawyers .
A leading criminal barrister says the decision will come down to two main questions :
does the prosecution have a realistic chance of success ?
is prosecution in the public interest ?
John Cooper QC says the public interest test looks at a number of factors .
" In the case of photographs of children it 's important to look at the circumstances surrounding the images , " says Mr Cooper .
" For instance : how old is the child ?
Have the photos been taken in vulnerable circumstances - in other words was there an element of exploitation involved ?
" Sometimes it 's relevant whether there is a whole series of photographs of children .
The police might press for prosecution on the grounds that they might want to make an example of the offender .
" Another factor could be what kind of photographer took the pictures .
If they are known to have a good reputation then this will be relevant too . "
North Korea has already shut down its main reactor at Yongbyon
Christopher Hill said details of the deal would be discussed at six - party talks in China , later in September .
North Korea tested a nuclear device last year , but has since agreed a deal to shut down its programme in return for economic and other aid .
It has already shut down its main nuclear reactor at Yongbyon .
Slow process
Mr Hill was speaking after meeting North Korea 's top nuclear negotiator , Kim Kye - gwan , for two days in Geneva .
FEBRUARY DEAL N Korea to " shut down and seal " Yongbyon reactor , then disable all nuclear facilities
In return , will be given 1 m tons of heavy fuel oil N Korea to invite IAEA back to monitor deal Under earlier 2005 deal , N Korea agreed to end nuclear programme and return to non-proliferation treaty N Korea 's demand for light water reactor to be discussed at " appropriate time "
Q&A : N Korea stand - off Timeline : Nuclear crisis
Mr Hill said the talks were " very good and very substantive " .
" One thing that we agreed on is that the [ North ] will provide a full declaration of all of their nuclear programmes and will disable their nuclear programmes by the end of this year , 2007 , " he said .
Mr Hill had earlier said there could be no normalisation of US - North Korea ties without a nuclear agreement .
But he said : " To the extent that we can move quickly to de-nuclearisation , we can move quickly to normalisation . "
Mr Kim said : " We made it clear , we showed clear willingness to declare and dismantle all nuclear facilities . "
The six - party negotiations involve the two Koreas , China , Russia , the US and Japan .
The North agreed in principle to halt nuclear work in return for economic and diplomatic benefits two years ago but the process has been slow and fraught with difficulties .
US envoy Christopher Hill said the talks were " very good "
Problems continued even after a more concrete agreement was reached in February this year .
A wrangle over North Korean funds frozen in a bank in Macau held up the closure of Yongbyon .
The issue was finally resolved and the reactor shut .
The North then received 50,000 tons of heavy fuel oil from South Korea .
A further 950,000 tons is dependent on ending all nuclear programmes .
Observers suggest Washington now seems prepared to remove North Korea from its list of countries backing terrorism , but it has yet to make its conditions clear .
The practice of female infanticide still occurs in rural areas
The baby , who had apparently never been fed , was discovered by a farmer near a village some 150 km south of Hyderabad .
He said he only spotted her because her tiny hand was sticking out of the soil .
Police say they have arrested the baby 's grandfather , 52 - year - old Abdul Rahman , after he confessed to trying to kill the newborn by burying her alive .
" I am yet to marry off four daughters and cannot take responsibility for a fifth one , even when she is only a granddaughter , " Mr Rahman was quoted as telling police .
It was not immediately clear whether Mr Rahman 's daughter , the mother of the baby , had given her consent for her child to be taken away .
The baby , who has not yet been named and weighs just 1.7kg , is being treated in a nearby hospital .
The practice of female foeticide and female infanticide does occur in some rural areas .
A girl child is often viewed as inferior to a boy and a bride 's dowry can also cripple a family financially .
Government figures suggest that around 10 million girls have been killed by their parents - either in the womb or immediately after birth - over the past two decades .
The Revolutionary Guards are thought to control a third of Iran 's economy Iran has responded defiantly to new sanctions imposed by the US targeting Iran 's Islamic Revolution Guards Corps and three state - owned banks .
The Iranian foreign ministry said the sanctions were doomed to failure .
US Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice says the measures are to " confront the threatening behaviour of the Iranians " .
But both China and Russia criticised the sanctions .
Russian President Vladimir Putin likened the US move to " mad people wielding razor blades " .
Earlier , US Assistant Secretary of State Nicholas Burns criticised Russia for selling weapons to Iran and China for investing in the country .
He told the BBC : " It 's very difficult for countries to say we 're striking out on our own when they 've got their own policies on the military side , aiding and abetting the Iranian government in strengthening its own military . "
' Doomed to failure ' Iran 's foreign ministry condemned the sanctions .
REVOLUTIONARY GUARDS
Officially the Islamic Revolution Guards Corps ( IRGC ) , or Pasdaran Formed after 1979 revolution Loyal to clerics and counter to regular military Estimated 125,000 troops Includes ground forces , navy , air force , intelligence and special forces Also has political influence : dozens of ex-guard sit as MPs Iran President Ahmadinejad is a former member Source : Globalsecurity.org
Profile : Revolutionary Guards US turns heat up on Iran Send us your comments Spokesman Mohammad Ali Hosseini said : " The hostile American policies towards the respectable people of Iran and the country 's legal institutions are contrary to international law , without value and , as in the past , doomed to failure . "
The head of the Revolutionary Guards , Mohammad Ali Jaafari , said the corps was ready to defend the ideals of the revolution more than ever before .
Correspondents in Tehran say the sanctions could be very damaging for Iran as the Revolutionary Guards are thought to control a third of the country 's economy and foreign firms may now be deterred from dealing with them .
Mr Putin 's comment came ahead of an EU - Russia summit in Mafra , near the Portuguese capital Lisbon .
BBC Europe editor , Mark Mardell , says that behind the president 's colourful language , diplomatic sources say there is a real Russian irritation , a belief that new sanctions are the wrong approach and only make Iran less likely to give up its nuclear programme .
Russia is helping Iran construct a nuclear reactor .
On Friday , China 's foreign ministry said Beijing was " opposed to imposing sanctions too rashly in international relations " , saying it " can only make the situation more complicated " .
Western nations suspect Iran is trying to build nuclear weapons , although Tehran says its programme is purely peaceful .
Military strike Ms Rice tried to play down any rift with Russia , saying neither wanted a nuclear - armed Iran .
" After all , Moscow is a lot closer to Iran than the United States , " she said .
Dick Cheney is thought to be pressing for a military strike
She strongly defended the sanctions , saying : " The international community can not just sit idly by ...
A nuclear weapon in the hands of the Iranian regime would be deeply destabilising in the world 's most volatile region . "
Mr Burns said that despite differences with both Russia and China the US still hoped that the UN Security Council would approve a third resolution imposing new sanctions this November .
The US has repeatedly accused Iran of destabilising Iraq and Afghanistan , blaming the Revolutionary Guards for supplying and training insurgents .
The BBC's Justin Webb in Washington says Condoleezza Rice continues to be committed to finding a diplomatic resolution to the crisis .
However , he says Vice - President Dick Cheney is widely believed to be pressing for a military strike on Iran before the Bush administration 's term is over , and if these sanctions have no effect , Ms Rice may well have to give way to his strategy .

I recently came across this rather cool user interface for a music sequencer called the ReactOgon .
Looking like something you ’d find on the deck of the Starship Enterprise , the instrument uses a large tabletop multi- touch interface to create music sequences in real time .
The creators of the ReactOgon call it a “ chain reactive performance arpeggiator ” , which dynamically shifts its patterns and sequences based on coded discs placed on the flat - panel interface .
Each hexagonal cell on the surface represents a fixed note on the harmonic table .
The placement of the discs influences the whether or not a note is played , as well as its placement in the sequence .
By stringing together a number of directional discs , an entire musical sequence can be created .
Special discs can also initiate multiple sequences , for more complex patterns .
A bank of touch - sensitive sliders are then used to change volume , timbre and rhythm of the notes .
There ’s no word on if or when the developers of this technology plan on commercializing the concept .
First , the situation for both borrowers and investors looks increasingly dire .
A new report from Congress ’s Joint Economic Committee predicts that there will be two million foreclosures on subprime mortgages by the end of next year .
That ’s two million American families facing the humiliation and financial pain of losing their homes .
At the same time , investors who bought assets backed by subprime loans are continuing to suffer severe losses .
Everything suggests that there will be many more stories like that of Merrill Lynch , which has just announced an $ 8.4 billion write - down because of bad loans — $ 3 billion more than it had announced just a few weeks earlier .
Second , much if not most of the subprime lending that is now going so catastrophically bad took place after it was clear to many of us that there was a serious housing bubble , and after people like Mr. Gramlich had issued public warnings about the subprime situation .
As late as 2003 , subprime loans accounted for only 8.5 percent of the value of mortgages issued in this country .
In 2005 and 2006 , the peak years of the housing bubble , subprime was 20 percent of the total — and the delinquency rates on recent subprime loans are much higher than those on older loans .

So , once again , why was nothing done to head off this disaster ?
The answer is ideology .
In a paper presented just before his death , Mr. Gramlich wrote that “ the subprime market was the Wild West .
Over half the mortgage loans were made by independent lenders without any federal supervision . ”
What he did n’t mention was that this was the way the laissez - faire ideologues ruling Washington — a group that very much included Mr. Greenspan — wanted it .
They were and are men who believe that government is always the problem , never the solution , that regulation is always a bad thing .
Every sixth Saturday or so , dozens of young software developers flock to a small mansion somewhere in Silicon Valley to share technical tips , collaborate on the coding of pet projects , and knock back a few beers while debating the data - models underlying popular start - ups like Facebook and Twitter .
This informal gathering that ’s open to the public flows from 2 p.m. to 2 a.m. with free alcohol , energy drinks and innovative ideas .
It ’s a tech party known as SuperHappyDevHouse , and it ’s lured rank - and - file employees of Google , Oracle and still - nameless entrepreneurial endeavors .
It ’s this robust swapping of ideas and sharing tricks - of - the - trade across company lines that has given Silicon Valley an innovative edge since the ’70s .
SuperHappyDevHouse has codified that collaborative culture for a new generation of inventors .
DevHouse organizers say they ’re trying to “ resurrect the spirit of the Homebrew Computer Club , ” the legendary ’70s garage gathering of hobbyists Steve Jobs , Steve Wozniak and other founders of computer companies .
Today ’s reincarnation , which has been attracting throngs of techies by word of mouth for two years , bills itself as “ a party for hackers and thinkers . ”
It ’s a haven for passionate programmers who modify software with creative and sometimes kooky code , as opposed to crackers who break into computer systems .
This 12 - hour programming party was the brainchild of now 21 - year - old Web developer Jeff Lindsay , who by passed college because he was eager to tackle real - world tech problems rather than sit in classrooms solving problem sets .
While Silicon Valley is cluttered with tech clubs , DevHouse is unique in that attendees churn out technical projects rather than just swap business cards .
Its most successful creation has been PBwiki , an online template for creating Wikipedia - type collaboration Web sites .
It received $ 2 million from Mohr Davidow Ventures in February .
Lindsay said Microsoft offered to host the party at its Mountain View campus , but he turned it down : working in walled - off cubicles would ruin the fun , collaborative atmosphere .
But DevHouse did recently accept a food fund from Mohr Davidow Ventures that covers the $ 500 tab each party racks up buying beer , Red Bull and snacks to fuel the programmers through the night .
The next party , No. 18 , is scheduled for this Saturday in Hillsborough .
Expect to see more than five men for every woman .
Most are in their 20s and 30s , although a teenage girl has shown up as well as a man with a full head of gray hair .
Hackers hailing from as far as as Dublin , Ireland , plunk their laptops down at DevHouse when they ’re in town on vacations or business trips .
Some of the regulars relocated here from places like Pittsburgh , Penn. , and Lexington , Ky .
“ I moved down here because of stuff like this , ” said Matt Rubens , a 25 - year - old software engineer who worked at Amazon.com and then established a start - up in Seattle .
He ditched that in April for Silicon Valley ’s scene .
DevHouse has been mimicked in Boston , Mass. , Zurich , Switzerland ; and Cologne , Germany .
Each city hosted its first party in the past six months , but none has offered an encore .
Lindsay and DevHouse co-founder David Weekly are helping programmers elsewhere in the world plan their own open - house hacker parties .
“ Silicon Valley is the progenitor of this culture , ” Weekly , 28 , said as the most recent weekend coding party wrapped up at 1:59 a.m .
A party tour
The last SuperHappyDevHouse , also known as SHDH , drew about 95 people who swung by for various stages of the 12 - hour event .
Here ’s how the party played out on May 5 :
2:15 p.m. , study hall : Sixteen programmers quietly clack on their laptops while sitting on plush couches that have been pushed against the family room walls so there ’s more floor space where later arrivals can sit .
The studious air makes you want to whisper .
A few guys get up to graze the spread covering the kitchen counter : burritos wrapped in corn or flour tortillas , chile verde with pulled pork that ’s been simmering for eight hours , and chocolate - chip bundt cakes laced with Godiva liquor .
Barbara Harrison , whose 25 - year - old live - in son , Tom , is hosting this SHDH , has been in the kitchen cooking since 4 a.m .
And she ’s still at it , checking on the casserole and whipping up Rice Krispie treats .
The 58 - year - old mother already warned neighbors surrounding their one - acre Los Gatos property that the coding party would go on until twilight .
But these guests rarely get drunk or rowdy .
“ People stake out a spot and do their little nerdy thing , ” she says .
3:28 p.m. , syncing up :
Three laptop - toting strangers sitting around a table on the sun deck strike up a conversation about quiblz.com , a social - networking polling start - up that is in test mode .
“ How are you planning on monetizing it ? ” asks Sven Strohband , a 33 - year - old partner at Mohr Davidow Ventures .
The SHDH newbie , who stayed past midnight , came to code an application to manage the venture capital firm ’s deal flow but spent almost as much time discussing other attendees ’ projects .
Adam Thorsen , a 28 - year - old co-founder of the polling start - up , tosses out his ideas and gives a quick tour of the Web site .
“ Pretty cool , ” chimes in developer Khang Tran .
Then Tran offers a demo of his start - up ’s social - networking photo site , which is in alpha testing .
“ I want to get some feedback .
Do you mind if I show you guys ? ”
They scoot closer .
4:37 p.m. , tech toys : Usually the Legos are a big hit with this crowd of Internet construction workers .
But those go untouched this time .
Perhaps because partiers are busting out cool tech toys .
All of a sudden , Martin Bogomolni , who is starting a company making electric cars , zips through the kitchen on the latest model Segway .
A dozen programmers leap up to take snapshots with their cameras and phones .
Some immediately upload their images to Flickr.com , boasting to the world what a riot they ’re having .
And perhaps enticing more people to swing by .
5:03 p.m. , scouting talent :
Not all the attendees are software wonks .
Lori Guidos is n’t , so she ’s dropping in to find one .
The executive director of www.disabledcommunity.org wanders the party looking for a whiz at drupal – a free content management framework – who can help her build a database .
Guidos wants pro-bono work .
But lots of developers have snagged paid gigs at SHDH .
Jesse Andrews , a 28 - year - old research fellow at a Palo Alto - based incubator of Internet initiatives , says by talking shop with techies here , “ you can know if they ’re competent really quickly .
I already told a couple people today , ` Hey , if you ’re interested , come into CommerceNet .
We ’re looking for prototype engineers . ’ “
6:59 p.m. , more tortillas : Serial entrepreneur Joel Harrison returns home after logging nine hours at the office .
While en route , his son had sent him to the grocery store to buy 35 more flour tortillas .
Soon after the 59 - year - old eases into a chair , engineers half his age excitedly chat with him about what they ’re working on .
Some do n’t realize they ’re swapping stories with a man who co-founded hard - disk drive maker Quantum in 1980 .
Or that they ’re pursuing pet projects , which one day might make them millionaires , in the custom - designed house built with the riches Harrison reaped from that company .
Harrison , now on his seventh start - up , tries to pass as just another techie interested in hearing “ fresh ideas . ”
“ I came home tired , ” Harrison says , “ but this has invigorated me . ”
9:11 p.m. , lightning lectures : A white king - size bed sheet hangs over the living room window as a makeshift projector screen for the night ’s six - minute technical talks .
More than 50 people cram onto the couches and carpet , lean against the walls , and strain to hear from the hallway during the 1 1/2 hours of programming presentations .
“ Do n’t promote your company , ” warns moderator Joe( uml ) l Franusic , a 24 - year - old network technician in San Luis Obispo .
“ We want cool hacker tips . ”
He shows how to create “ the poor man ’s VPN , ” which can come in handy for WiFi coffee - shop customers who “ do n’t want people like me watching your chats . ”
The presenters are pulled from the podium after precisely six minutes , even if they are n’t done explaining the technology .
Sometimes questions arise from the audience .
Applause always erupts .
11 p.m. , the hot tub : Seven or so partiers unwind in the outdoor pool and hot tub , giving their brains a break from the buzz .
After an hour or so , they towel off .
“ Longer than that , and I risk my fingers over - pruning , ” wisecracks 23 - year - old electrical engineer Mike Lundy , “ and that would make it hard to type . ”
12:41 a.m. , hard - core hacking :
All 10 chairs in the staid dining room are occupied by techies who are concentrating .
Larry Halff , 36 , is coding a Web site on which programmers can publish their work so it ’s available for others to mash up .
Chris Messina , 26 , is debating with Twitter ’s lead developer about the finer points of adding microformats to the popular service that delivers instant updates on what people are up to .
In the family room , the Musik. funky Internet radio stream from Germany is pulsing loud enough that collaborators need to raise their voices a bit and lean in .
Weekly , who founded PBwiki.com as a result of the first SHDH , is writing a Windows drop - box application that instantly posts Microsoft Word documents online .
His start - up was prepared to shell out a couple hundred bucks for a programmer in Ukraine to spend the next two weeks writing that .
But Weekly has finished the job in five hours – and for free .
2:05 a.m. , coffee to go : Barbara Harrison turns off the music and announces it ’s time to clean up .
She offers coffee that the remaining 35 late - nighters can drink now or take in to - go cups .
As the remaining attendees pull the furniture back into place and pack up the 18 power strips scattered throughout the house , 30 - year - old Nathan Schmidt alludes to the data tool he wrote that night as he marvels , “ It occurred to me that Facebook ’s 60 kilohertz MemCache request is probably primarily driven by the lack of this data structure . ”
Five other geeks keep gabbing as they inch toward the front door .
“ How are you going to allow your restricted code to access a socket ? ” one asks .
After 75 minutes of tidying up , the Harrisons are ready for bed .
But others do n’t want to call it quits .
Six wide - eyed hackers – including SHDH co-founder Lindsay – hop in their cars so they can continue discussing action scripts , Twitter adapters and theoretical Web services at Denny’s .
The Fed garnered attention last week by adding billions of dollars to the money market to relieve upward pressure on interest rates .
How do these operations work ?

Have your cake and eat it , too , with STL extensions .
In this chapter extract from his latest book , Matthew Wilson shows you how to take full advantage of the STL Iterator abstraction , without sacrificing block - transfer efficiency of Scatter / Gather I /O memory .
Introduction
Do n't ever let anyone tell you that STL is nice and abstract and all that , but it just does n't perform well .
I poke holes in that myth in several places in this book ( Extended STL , Volume 1 : Collections and Iterators , Sections 17.1.1 , 19.1.1 , 27.9 , 36.2.2 , and 38.2.1 ) , but this chapter blows it clean out of the water .
The subject matter of this chapter is Scatter / Gather I/O ( also known as Scatter I/O ) , which means the exchange of data between application code and ( usually kernel ) I/O routines in the form of multiple blocks per action .
Its primary intent is to allow client code to manipulate application - level packet headers separately from the payloads , but it can also be turned to other cunning ends , and can yield considerable performance benefits .
The cost is that it complicates the manipulation of data when logically contiguous data is spread over physically discontiguous blocks .
To aid in handling such cases , we may use classes that ( re ) linearize the data back to an acceptably manipulable abstraction .
Since this is a book about extending STL , the abstraction we will seek is that of an STL collection ( Section 2.2 ) and its associated iterator ranges .
But as we will see , there is a cost in such abstractions , so we will go further and examine how we might optimize the transfer of information without diluting the power of the abstraction .
This will lead us into looking into the rules regarding overriding functions in the std namespace and how we may accommodate one with the other .
Scatter / Gather I/
O
Scatter / Gather I/O involves the exchange of information between an I/O API and client code in a physically discontiguous form .
In all cases I 've come across , this discontiguous form involves a number of separate memory blocks .
For example , the UNIX readv( ) and writev ( ) functions act like their read ( ) and write ( ) siblings , but , rather than a pointer to a single area of memory and its size , they are passed an array of iovec structures :
struct iovec { void * iov_base ; size_t iov_len ; } ; ssize_t readv( int fd , const struct iovec* vector , int count ) ; ssize_t writev ( int fd , const struct iovec* vector , int count ) ;
The Windows Sockets API has an analogous structure and corresponding functions :
struct WSABUF { u_long len ; char * buf ; } ; int WSARecv( SOCKET s , WSABUF * lpBuffers , DWORD dwBufferCount , . . . // And 4 more parameters ) ; int WSASend ( SOCKET s , WSABUF * lpBuffers , DWORD dwBufferCount , . . . // And 4 more parameters ) ; int WSARecvFrom ( SOCKET s , WSABUF * lpBuffers , DWORD dwBufferCount , . . . // And 6 more parameters ) ; int WSASendTo( SOCKET s , WSABUF * lpBuffers , DWORD dwBufferCount , . . . // And 6 more parameters ) ;
You might wonder why people would want to perform I/O in such a fashion , given the obvious complication to client code .
Well , if your file or network data has a fixed format , you can read one or more records / packets in or out without any need to move , reformat , or coalesce them .
This can be quite a convenience .
Similarly , if your records / packets have variable format but a fixed - size header , you can read / write the header directly to / from a matching structure and treat the rest as an opaque variable - size blob .
And there 's a third reason : performance .
I once created a network server architecture using Scatter / Gather I/O that used a multithreaded nonlocking memory allocation scheme .
( Suffice to say , it was rather nippy . )
But however much Scatter / Gather I / O may help in terms of performance , when dealing with variable - length records / packets , or those whose payloads contain elements that are variable - length , the client code is complicated , usually low on transparency , and bug - prone .
An efficient abstraction is needed .
Scatter / Gather I/O APIs
Linearizing with COM Streams
The challenge with Scatter / Gather I/O is that using memory scattered over multiple blocks is not a trivial matter .
On projects ( on Windows platforms ) in the 1990s , I tended to use a custom COM stream implementation from my company 's proprietary libraries , which was implemented for a different task some years previously .
Permit me to talk about the COM stream architecture for a moment .
( I know I promised in the last chapter there would be no more COM , but there is a point to this , even for UNIX diehards .
Trust me , I 'm a doctor ! )
A COM stream is an abstraction over an underlying storage medium having much in common with the file abstractions we 're used to .
Essentially , it has access to the underlying medium and defines a current point within its logical extent .
A stream object exhibits the IStream interface ( shown in abbreviated form in Listing 31.1 ) , which contains a number of methods , including Seek ( ) , SetSize ( ) , Stat ( ) , and Clone ( ) .
There are also methods for acquiring exclusive access to regions of the underlying medium .
The IStream interface derives from ISequentialStream ( also shown in Listing 31.1 ) , which defines the two methods Read ( ) and Write ( ) .
You can implement a stream for a particular underlying medium directly by deriving from IStream and providing suitable definitions for its methods .
Listing 31.1 Definition of the ISequentialStream and IStream Interfaces
interface ISequentialStream : public IUnknown { virtual HRESULT Read( void* p , ULONG n , ULONG * numRead ) = 0 ; virtual HRESULT Write ( void const * p , ULONG n , ULONG * numWritten ) = 0 ; } ; interface IStream : public ISequentialStream { virtual HRESULT Seek ( . . .) = 0 ; virtual HRESULT SetSize ( . . .) = 0 ; virtual HRESULT CopyTo( . . .) = 0 ; virtual HRESULT Commit ( . . .) = 0 ; virtual HRESULT Revert ( . . .) = 0 ; virtual HRESULT LockRegion ( . . .) = 0 ; virtual HRESULT UnlockRegion ( . . .) = 0 ; virtual HRESULT Stat ( . . .) = 0 ; virtual HRESULT Clone ( . . .) = 0 ; } ;
COM defines another stream - related abstraction , in the form of the ILockBytes interface ( shown in abbreviated form in Listing 31.2 ) .
It abstracts arbitrary underlying mediums as a logically contiguous array of bytes .
It does not maintain any positional state .
Hence , it has ReadAt ( ) and WriteAt ( ) methods rather than Read ( ) and Write ( ) .
Listing 31.2 Definition of the ILockBytes Interface
interface ILockBytes : public IUnknown { virtual HRESULT ReadAt ( ULARGE_INTEGER pos , void * p , ULONG n , ULONG * numRead ) = 0 ; virtual HRESULT WriteAt ( ULARGE_INTEGER
pos , void const * p , ULONG n , ULONG * numWritten ) = 0 ; virtual HRESULT Flush ( ) = 0 ; virtual HRESULT SetSize ( . . .) = 0 ; virtual HRESULT LockRegion ( . . .) = 0 ; virtual HRESULT UnlockRegion ( . . .) = 0 ; virtual HRESULT Stat ( . . .) = 0 ; } ;
It is a relatively simple matter to implement a COM stream in terms of ( an object that exhibits ) the ILockBytes interface .
All that 's required is an ILockBytes * and a position .
My company has just such an entity , accessible via the CreateStreamOnLockBytes ( ) function :
HRESULT CreateStreamOnLockBytes( ILockBytes * plb , unsigned flags , IStream ** ppstm ) ;
Obviously , the next question is , " How do we get hold of an ILockBytes object ? "
Again , there 's a function for that , CreateLockBytesOnMemory ( ) :
HRESULT CreateLockBytesOnMemory( void* pv , size_t si , unsigned flags , void* arena , ILockBytes ** pplb ) ;
This supports a whole host of memory scenarios , including using a fixed buffer , using Windows " global " memory , using a COM allocator ( IAllocator ) , and so on .
One of the many flags is SYCLBOMF_FIXED_ARRAY , which indicates that pv points to an array of MemLockBytesBlock structures :
struct MemLockBytesBlock { size_t cb ; void * pv ; } ;
I 'm not going to bang on about this much more , as hindsight is a harsh judge of things such as opaque pointers whose meanings are moderated by flags .
The point I want to get across about this stuff is that I was able to take a set of memory blocks containing the scattered packet contents and get back an IStream pointer from which the packet information can be extracted in a logical and linear manner .
Such code takes the following simple and reasonably transparent form .
( Error handling is elided for brevity . )
The ref_ptr instances are used to ensure that the reference counts are managed irrespective of any early returns and / or exceptions .
std::vector<WSABUF > blocks = . . . size_t payloadSize = . . . ILockBytes * plb ; IStream * pstm ; SynesisCom:: CreateLockBytesOnMemory( &blocks [ 1 ] , payloadSize , SYCLBOMF_FIXED_ARRAY | . . . , NULL , &plb ) ; stlsoft::ref_ptr<ILockBytes > lb( pbl , false ) ; // false " eats " the ref SynesisCom :: CreateStreamOnLockBytes( plb , 0 , &pstm ) ; stlsoft::ref_ptr<IStream > stm( pstm , false ) ; // false " eats " the ref . . . //
Pass off stm to higher - layer processing
The stream can then be wrapped by a byte - order - aware Instance Adaptor class that works in partnership with a message object Factory , to complete the mechanism for efficient translation from TCP packet stream segments to instances of higher - level protocol ( C++ ) objects .
The high efficiencies obtainable by such a scheme result from there being no allocations of , and no copying into , memory that does not constitute part of the final translated message object instances .
This is a powerful basis for a communications server model , one that I 've used several times , albeit in different guises .
In the case described earlier , a number of characteristics of the approach might incline you to search , as I have done , for better , less technology - specific solutions .
First , the major downside of the described mechanism is that , being COM , the server code is effectively Windows - specific .
Second , many developers ( incorrectly ) consider COM , as they ( equally incorrectly ) do C++ and STL , to be intrinsically inefficient , and it can be hard to disabuse them of that notion even with hard facts .
Finally , add in the type - unsafe opaque pointers and the fact that the stream and lock - bytes classes were hidden proprietary implementations , and it all leaves something to be desired .
platformstl::scatter_slice_sequence — A Teaser Trailer
An alternate representation is to be found in a new , and still evolving , component in the PlatformSTL subproject : scatter_slice_sequence .
This Facade class template maintains an array of slice structures describing a set of I/O buffers and provides methods for invoking native read / write functions on the set of buffers , in addition to providing STL collection access ( in the form of begin ( ) and end ( ) methods ) .
The class works with both iovec and WSABUF by abstracting their features with attribute shims ( Section 9.2.1 ) get_scatter_slice_size , get_scatter_slice_ptr , and get_scatter_slice_size_member_ptr , shown in Listing 31.3 .
Listing 31.3 Attribute Shims for the iovec and WSABUF Structures

scatter_slice_sequence currently provides for readv( ) / writev( ) on UNIX and WSARecv( ) / WSASend ( ) and WSARecvFrom ( ) / WSASendTo( ) on Windows .
Listing 31.4 shows an example that uses an iovec specialization of the class template to read the contents from one file descriptor into a number of buffers , processes the content in an STL kind of way , and then writes the converted contents to another file descriptor .
Listing 31.4 Example Use of scatter_slice_sequence with readv( ) and writev ( )
int fs = . . . //
Opened for read int fd = . . . //
Opened for write for ( ; ;) { const size_t BUFF_SIZE = 100 ; const size_t MAX_BUFFS = 10 ; char buffers [ MAX_BUFFS ] [ BUFF_SIZE ] ; const size_t numBuffers = rand ( ) % MAX_BUFFS ; // Declare an instance with arity of numBuffers platformstl:: scatter_slice_sequence<iovec > sss(numBuffers ) ; //
Set up each slice in the sequence , which may be of // different sizes in reality { for ( size_t i = 0 ; i < numBuffers ; ++i ) { sss.set_slice( i , & buffers [ i ] [ 0 ] , sizeof ( buffers [ i ] ) ) ; }} if ( 0 != numBuffers ) //
In real scenario , might get 0 buffers { size_t n = sss.read ( :: readv , fs ) ; // Read from fs using :: readv( ) if ( 0 == n ) { break ; } // " Process " the contents std::transform ( sss.payload( ).begin( ) , sss.payload( ).begin( ) + n , sss.payload( ).begin( ) , :: toupper ) ; sss.write ( :: writev , fd , n ) ; // Write n to fd using :: writev( ) } }
Obviously this example is very stripped down , but I trust your abilities to imagine that fs and fd might represent sockets , that the buffers shown here would be obtained from a shared memory arena ( which may not have any to spare at a given time ) , and that the " processing " would be something less trivial than setting the contents to uppercase before ( re ) transmission .
The sequence 's payload ( available via payload ( ) ) provides random access iterators over the contents of its memory blocks .
Just as with std :: deque , it 's important to realize that these iterators are not contiguous ( Section 2.3.6 ) !
Pointer arithmetic on the iterators is a constant - time operation , but iterating the range is not a linear - time operation .
The scatter_slice_sequence is still a work in progress , and its interface might evolve further before it 's released into the PlatformSTL subproject proper .
( It is on the CD . )
But what it clearly provides is the ability to represent a given set of data blocks as an STL sequence ( Section 2.2 ) , along with adaptor methods read ( ) and write ( ) that take a file / socket handle and a Scatter / Gather I/ O function and apply them to the blocks .
This is the logical equivalent of the COM stream object created via CreateLockBytesOnMemory ( ) + SYCLBOMF_FIXED_ARRAY and CreateStreamOnLockBytes ( ) .
The one apparent disadvantage is that its contents have to be traversed one element at a time , something that may have performance costs .
( Hint : This is a clue about something interesting to follow .

Adapting ACE_Message_Queue
The main subject of this chapter covers my efforts to adapt the memory queues of the Adaptive Communications Environment ( ACE ) to the STL collection concept , to serve the requirements of one of my recent commercial networking projects , a middleware routing service .
To use the ACE Reactor framework , you derive event handler classes from ACE_Event_Handler ( overriding the requisite I /O event handler methods ) and register instances of them with the program 's reactor singleton .
When the reactor encounters an I / O event of a type for which an instance is registered , it invokes the appropriate callback method on the handler .
When used with TCP , the Internet 's stream - oriented transport protocol , the common idiom is to handle received data into instances of ACE_Message_Block and queue them in an instance of ( a specialization of ) the class template ACE_Message_Queue , as shown ( with error handling omitted for brevity ) in Listing 31.5 .
Listing 31.5 A Simple Event Handler for the ACE Reactor Framework
class SimpleTCPReceiver : public ACE_Event_Handler { . . . virtual int handle_input( ACE_HANDLE h ) { const size_t BLOCK_SIZE = 1024 ; ACE_Message_Block * mb = new ACE_Message_Block ( BLOCK_SIZE ) ; ssize_t n = m_peer.recv(mb-> base ( ) , mb->size ( ) ) ; mb->wr_ptr(n ) ; m_mq.enqueue_tail( mb ) ; return 0 ; } . . . private : // Member Variables ACE_SOCK_Stream m_peer ; // Connection socket ACE_Message_Queue<ACE_SYNCH_USE > m_mq ; //
Message queue } ;
The ACE_Message_Queue class acts as an ordered repository for all blocks , thereby faithfully representing the data stream .
But ACE_Message_Queue is strictly a container of blocks ; it does not attempt to provide any kind of abstracted access to the contents of the blocks .
To access the contents of a message queue , you can use the associated class template , ACE_Message_Queue_Iterator , to iterate the blocks , as shown in Listing 31.6 .
The ACE_Message_Queue_Iterator :: next ( ) method returns a nonzero result and sets the given pointer reference to the block if a next block is available ; otherwise , it returns 0 . The advance ( ) method moves the current enumeration point to the next block ( if any ) .
Listing 31.6 Example Code That Uses ACE_Message_Queue_Iterator
void SimpleTCPReceiver:: ProcessQueue( ) { ACE_Message_Queue_Iterator<ACE_NULL_SYNCH > mqi(m_mq ) ; ACE_Message_Block * mb ; for ( ; mqi.next ( mb ) ; mqi.advance ( ) ) { { for ( size_t i = 0 ; i < mb->length ( ) ; ++i ) { printf ( " %c " , i[ mb ->rd_ptr ( ) ] ; }} mb->rd_ptr(mb->length ( ) ) ; //
Advance read ptr to " exhaust " block } }
Obviously , if you want to process a set of blocks as a logically contiguous single block , it 's going to be a bit messy .
We need a sequence to flatten the stream for STL manipulation .
acestl::message_queue_sequence , Version 1
The ACESTL subproject contains a number of components for adapting ACE to STL ( and for making ACE components easier to use ) .
acestl:: message_queue_sequence is a class template that acts as an Instance Adaptor for the ACE_Message_Queue .
Since this component 's got quite a kick , I 'm going to play my usual author 's dirty trick of presenting you with a progression of implementations .
Thankfully , unlike some material covered in other chapters , the changes between the versions are entirely additive , which should help keep me under 40 pages for this topic .
Listing 31.7 shows the definition of the first version .
Listing 31.7 Definition of message_queue_sequence
//
In namespace acestl template < ACE_SYNCH_DECL > class message_queue_sequence { public : // Member Types typedef char value_type ; typedef ACE_Message_Queue<ACE_SYNCH_USE >
sequence_type ; typedef message_queue_sequence<ACE_SYNCH_USE >
class_type ; typedef size_t size_type ; class iterator ; public : // Construction explicit message_queue_sequence( sequence_type > mq ) ; public : // Iteration iterator begin( ) ; iterator end ( ) ; public : // Attributes size_type size ( ) const ; bool empty ( ) const ; private : // Member Variables sequence_type& m_mq ; private : // Not to be implemented message_queue_sequence ( class_type const& ) ; class_type& operator =( class_type const& ) ; } ;
Given what we 've seen with previous sequences , there 's little here that needs to be remarked on ; the interesting stuff will be in the iterator class .
Note that the value type is char , meaning that size ( ) returns the number of bytes in the queue , and [ begin ( ) , end ( ) ) defines the range of bytes .
No methods pertain to message blocks .
31.4.2 acestl::message_queue_sequence::iterator
Listing 31.8 shows the definition of the acestl::message_queue_sequence::iterator class .
Again , a lot here should be familiar based on prior experience .
( I hope by now you 're building a familiarity with these techniques , recognizing their similarities and identifying the differences between the different cases of their application .
Naturally , it 's my hope that this stands you in great stead for writing your own STL extensions . )
The iterator category is input iterator ( Section 1.3.1 ) .
The element reference category ( Section 3.3 ) is transient or higher ; in fact , it 's fixed , with the caveat that no other code , within or without the defining thread , changes the contents of the underlying message queue or its blocks ( in which case it would be invalidatable ) .
The iterator is implemented in terms of a shared_handle , discussed shortly .
I 've not shown the canonical manipulation of the shared_handle in the construction methods since we 've seen it before in other sequences ( Sections 19.3 and 20.5 ) .
Listing 31.8 Definition of message_queue_sequence::iterator
class message_queue_sequence <. . .>:: iterator : public std::iterator>std::input_iterator_tag , char , ptrdiff_t , char* , char& > { private : // Member Types friend class message_queue_sequence <ACE_SYNCH_USE > ; typedef ACE_Message_Queue_Iterator<ACE_SYNCH_USE >
mq_iterator_type ; struct shared_handle ; public : typedef iterator class_type ; typedef char value_type ; private : // Construction iterator ( sequence_type& mq ) : m_handle ( new shared_handle ( mq ) ) {} public : iterator ( ) : m_handle ( NULL ) {} iterator ( class_type const& rhs ) ; // Share handle via AddRef( ) (+) ~iterator ( ) throw ( ) ; // Call Release ( ) ( -) if non-NULL class_type& operator =( class_type const& rhs ) ; // (+ ) new ; ( -) old public : // Input Iteration class_type& operator ++( )
{ ACESTL_ASSERT ( NULL != m_handle ) ; if (! m_handle ->advance ( ) ) { m_handle -> Release ( ) ; m_handle = NULL ; } return * this ; } class_type operator ++( int ) ; // Canonical implementation value_type& operator *() { ACESTL_ASSERT ( NULL != m_handle ) ; return m_handle -> current ( ) ; } value_type operator *() const { ACESTL_ASSERT ( NULL != m_handle ) ; return m_handle -> current ( ) ; } bool equal ( class_type const& rhs ) const { return lhs.is_end_point( ) == rhs.is_end_point ( ) ; } private : // Implementation bool is_end_point ( ) const { return NULL == m_handle || m_handle ->is_end_point ( ) ; } private : // Member Variables shared_handle * m_handle ; } ;
The iteration methods are implemented in terms of the methods of shared_handle .
The endpoint state is identified by either a NULL handle or a handle that identifies itself as being at the endpoint .
The preincrement operator advances by calling shared_handle : : advance ( ) and releases the handle when advance ( ) returns false .
The dereference operator overloads are implemented in terms of the current ( ) overloads of shared_handle .
Note that the mutating ( non-const ) overload returns a mutating reference , whereas the nonmutating ( const ) overload returns a char by value .
The main action lies in the shared_handle .
Listing 31.9 shows its implementation .
I 'm going to invoke another low author tactic now and not explain the fine detail of the algorithm .
I 'll leave it as an exercise for you to figure out .
To be fair , though , I will note that it skips empty ACE_Message_Block instances , which is how its endpoint condition can be so simple .
Listing 31.9 Definition of shared_handle
struct message_queue_sequence<. . .>:: iterator:: shared_handle { public : // Member Types typedef shared_handle class_type ; public : // Member Variables mq_iterator_type m_mqi ; ACE_Message_Block * m_entry ; size_t m_entryLength ; size_t m_entryIndex ; private : sint32_t m_refCount ; public : // Construction explicit shared_handle( sequence_type& mq ) : m_mqi(mq ) , m_entry ( NULL ) , m_entryLength(0 ) , m_entryIndex (0 ) , m_refCount ( 1 ) { if ( m_mqi.next ( m_entry ) ) { for ( ; ;) { if ( 0 != ( m_entryLength = m_entry -> length ( ) ) ) { break ; } else if ( NULL == ( m_entry = nextEntry ( ) ) ) { break ; } } } } private : ~ shared_handle ( ) throw ( ) { ACESTL_MESSAGE_ASSERT
(
" Shared handle destroyed with outstanding references ! " , 0 == m_refCount ) ; } public : sint32_t AddRef ( ) ; // Canonical implementation sint32_t Release ( ) ; // Canonical implementation public : // Iteration Methods bool is_end_point ( ) const { return m_entry Index == m_entryLength ; } char& current ( ) { ACESTL_ASSERT( NULL != m_entry ) ; ACESTL_ASSERT(m_entryIndex != m_entryLength ) ; return m_entryIndex[m_entry ->rd_ptr ( ) ] ; } char current ( ) const { ACESTL_ASSERT ( NULL != m_entry ) ; ACESTL_ASSERT(m_entryIndex != m_entryLength ) ; return m_entryIndex[m_entry ->rd_ptr ( ) ] ; } bool advance ( ) { ACESTL_MESSAGE_ASSERT( " Invalid index " , m_entryIndex < m_entryLength ) ; if (++ m_entryIndex == m_entryLength ) { m_entry Index = 0 ; for ( ; ;) { if ( NULL == ( m_entry = nextEntry ( ) ) ) { return false ; } else if ( 0 != ( m_entryLength = m_entry -> length ( ) ) ) { break ; } } } return true ; } private : // Implementation ACE_Message_Block* nextEntry ( ) { ACE_Message_Block * entry = NULL ; return m_mqi.advance ( ) ? ( m_mqi.next ( entry ) , entry ) : NULL ; } private : // Not to be implemented shared_handle ( class_type const& ) ; class_type& operator =( class_type const& ) ; } ;
31.5 Time for Some Cake
I hope you 'll agree that being able to treat a set of ACE_Message_Block communications stream fragments as a logically contiguous stream eases considerably the task of dealing with such streams .
In our middleware project , this enabled us to unmarshal the high - level protocol messages as objects , by the combination of another Instance Adaptor and a message Factory .
Permit me a small digression about the protocol .
Standards Australia defines a protocol for the exchange of electronic payment implementation , called AS2805 .
This is a very flexible protocol , with a significant drawback .
The messages do not contain any message - size information in their fixed format header , and each message can contain a variable number of fields , some of which are of variable size .
This means that you can't know whether all of a message has been received from the peer until the message has been fully parsed .
Consequently , being able to easily and efficiently deconstruct a message is critical .
This was achieved by applying another Instance Adaptor to the acestl : : message_queue_sequence instance to make it be treated as a streamable object , similar to how the logically contiguous ILockBytes instance was turned into a streamable object with CreateStreamFromLockBytes ( ) .
The streamable object is used by the message Factory , which understands how to read the message type from the packet header and then uses that type to dispatch the appropriate unmarshaling function to read the remainder of the message contents and create a corresponding message instance .
If insufficient data is available , the Factory invocation fails benignly , and the queue contents remain unchanged until the next I /O event .
Only when a full message is retrieved is the requisite portion of the head of the queue removed and released back to the memory cache .
If the message parsing fails for bad contents , the peer has sent bad data , and the connection is torn down .
But Captain , I Canna ' Mek Her Goo Any Fastah !
So , we 've got some nice abstractions going — some of which have seen service in large - scale deployments , which is never to be sniffed at — but you may have been receiving portents from your skeptical subconsciousness .
We 're manipulating a number of blocks of contiguous memory , but the nature of the acestl: : message_queue_sequence :: iterator means that each byte in those blocks must be processed one at a time .
This has to have an efficiency cost .
And it does .
Before we proceed , I want to trot out the received wisdom on performance , namely , to avoid premature optimization .
More precisely , although it 's something of a simplification , you 've usually got only one bottleneck in a system at a time .
Inefficiencies usually make themselves felt only when a greater inefficiency has been resolved .
In none of the applications in which I 've used message_queue_sequence has it been associated with the bottleneck .
However , I tend to be a little efficiency obsessed —
What 's that ?
You 've noticed ?— and since STLSoft is an open - source publicly available library , the message_queue_sequence component might find itself being a bottleneck in someone else 's project , and that would never do .
So , I want to show you how to have your cake and eat it too , that is , how to linearize data block contents in an STL sequence and yet have block - like efficiency .
acestl::message_queue_sequence , Version 2
First , we need to identify when a block transfer is valid .
The ACE libraries define opaque memory in terms of char , that is , the pointers are either char const * or char* , presumably to make pointer arithmetic straightforward .
I do n't hold with this strategy , but that 's irrelevant ; it is what it is .
When transferring contents between STL iterators of type char * or char const * and acestl: : message_queue_sequence::iterator , we want the sequence 's contents to be block transferred .
In other words , the following code should result in 2 calls to memcpy ( ) , rather than 120 calls to shared_handle : : advance ( ) :
ACE_Message_Queue<ACE_NULL_SYNCH > mq ; // 2 message blocks , 120 bytes char results [ 120 ] ; acestl::message_queue_sequence<ACE_NULL_SYNCH> mqs( mq ) ; std::copy(mqs.begin( ) , mqs.end ( ) , &results [ 120 ] ) ;
We want the same efficiency when transferring from contiguous memory into the message queue sequence , as in the following :
std :: copy( &results[0 ] , &results [ 0 ] + STLSOFT_NUM_ELEMENTS( results ) , mqs.begin( ) ) ;
The first thing we need for this is to define block copy operations for message_queue_sequence .
Listing 31.10 shows the definition of two new static methods for the sequence class , overloads named fast_copy ( ) .
Listing 31.10 Definition of the message_queue_sequence Algorithm Worker Methods
template < ACE_SYNCH_DECL > class message_queue_sequence { . . . static char* fast_copy ( iterator from , iterator to , char* o ) { # if defined ( ACESTL_MQS_NO_FAST_COPY_TO ) for ( ; from != to ; ++ from , ++o ) { *o = * from ; } #else /* ?
ACESTL_MQS_NO_FAST_COPY_TO */ from.fast_copy ( to , o ) ; #endif /* ACESTL_MQS_NO_FAST_COPY_TO */ return o ; } static iterator fast_copy ( char const * from , char const * to , iterator o ) { # if defined ( ACESTL_MQS_NO_FAST_COPY_FROM ) for ( ; from != to ; ++ from , ++o ) { *o = * from ; } #else /* ?
ACESTL_MQS_NO_FAST_COPY_FROM
*/ o.fast_copy ( from , to ) ; #endif /* ACESTL_MQS_NO_FAST_COPY_FROM
*/ return o ; } . . .
I 've deliberately left in the #defines that suppress the block operations , just to illustrate in code what the alternative , default , behavior is .
These #defines also facilitate tests with and without block copying enabled .
( Anyone sniff a performance test in the near future ? )
The block mode code uses new iterator : : fast_copy ( ) methods , shown in Listing 31.11 .
Listing 31.11 Definition of the iterator Algorithm Worker Methods
class message_queue_sequence <. . .>:: iterator { . . . void fast_copy ( char const * from , char const* to ) { if ( from != to ) { ACESTL_ASSERT ( NULL != m_handle ) ; m_handle -> fast_copy ( from , to , static_cast < size_type >( to - from ) ) ; } } void fast_copy ( class_type const& to , char* o ) { if ( * this != to ) { ACESTL_ASSERT ( NULL != m_handle ) ; m_handle->fast_copy ( to. m_handle , o ) ; } }
Tantalizingly , these do very little beyond invoking the same - named new methods of the shared_handle class , shown in Listing 31.12 .
For both in and out transfers , these methods calculate the appropriate portion of each block to be read / written and effect the transfer with memcpy ( ) .
Listing 31.12 Definition of the shared_handle Algorithm Worker Methods
struct message_queue_sequence<. . .>:: iterator::shared_handle { . . . void fast_copy ( char const * from , char const * to , size_type n ) { ACESTL_ASSERT( 0 != n ) ; ACESTL_ASSERT ( from != to ) ; if ( 0 != n ) { size_type n1 = m_entryLength - m_entryIndex ; if (n <= n 1 ) { ::memcpy(&m_entryIndex[m_entry->rd_ptr ( ) ] , from , n ) ; } else { ::memcpy(&m_entryIndex[m_entry ->rd_ptr ( ) ] , from , n 1 ) ; from += n 1 ; m_entry = nextEntry ( ) ; ACESTL_ASSERT ( NULL != m_entry ) ; fast_copy ( from , to , n - n 1 ) ; } } } void fast_copy ( class_type const * to , char* o ) { size_type n1 = m_entryLength - m_entryIndex ; if ( NULL != to && m_entry == to -> m_entry ) { ::memcpy(o , &m_entryIndex[m_entry ->rd_ptr ( ) ] , n 1 ) ; } else { ::memcpy(o , &m_entryIndex[m_entry ->rd_ptr ( ) ] , n 1 ) ; o += n 1 ; m_entry = nextEntry ( ) ; if ( NULL != m_entry ) { fast_copy ( to , o ) ; } } } . . .
31.5.3 Specializing the Standard Library
So far so good , but no one wants to write client code such as the following :
ACE_Message_Queue<ACE_NULL_SYNCH > mq ; // 2 locks ; total 120 bytes char results [ 120 ] ; acestl::message_queue_sequence<ACE_NULL_SYNCH> mqs(mq ) ; acestl::message_queue_sequence<ACE_NULL_SYNCH>::fast_copy(mqs.begin( ) , mqs.end ( ) , &results [ 120 ] ) ;
We want the invocation std :: copy ( ) to pick up our fast version automatically when the other iterator type is char ( const ) * .
For this we need to specialize std::copy ( ) .
For a number of reasons , defining partial template specializations in the std namespace is prohibited .
This proves inconvenient in two ways .
First , and most importantly , because message_queue_sequence is a template , we want to cater to all its specializations and so would want to do something like that shown in Listing 31.13 .
( For brevity I 'm omitting the namespace qualification acestl from each message_queue_sequence < S >:: iterator shown in this listing and the next . )
Listing 31.13 Illegal Specializations of std::copy ( )
//
In namespace std template < typename S> char* copy ( typename message_queue_sequence <S >:: iterator from , typename message_queue_sequence <S >:: iterator to , char* o ) { return message_queue_sequence <S>:: fast_copy( from , to , o ) ; } template < typename S > typename message_queue_sequence <S >:: iterator copy ( char * from , char* to , typename message_queue_sequence<S>::iterator o) { return message_queue_sequence<S>:: fast_copy( from , to , o ) ; }
Since we may not do this , we are forced to anticipate the specializations of message_queue_sequence and ( fully ) specialize std::copy ( ) accordingly , as in Listing 31.14 .
Note that separate char * and char const * specializations are required for the char - pointer - to - iterator block transfer , to ensure that copying from char * and char const* uses the optimization .
Listing 31.14 Legal Specializations of std::copy ( )
// In namespace std template <> char* copy ( typename message_queue_sequence <ACE_NULL_SYNCH>::iterator from , typename message_queue_sequence <ACE_NULL_SYNCH >::iterator to , char* o ) { return message_queue_sequence <ACE_NULL_SYNCH>::fast_copy( from , to , o ) ; } . . . //
Same as above , but for ACE_MT_SYNCH template <> typename message_queue_sequence<ACE_NULL_SYNCH
>::iterator copy ( char * from , char* to , typename message_queue_sequence <ACE_NULL_SYNCH>::iterator o ) { return message_queue_sequence <ACE_NULL_SYNCH>::fast_copy( from , to , o ) ; } . . . //
Same as above , but for ACE_MT_SYNCH template <> typename message_queue_sequence<ACE_NULL_SYNCH
>::iterator copy ( char const * from , char const * to , typename message_queue_sequence <ACE_NULL_SYNCH>::iterator o ) { return message_queue_sequence <ACE_NULL_SYNCH>::fast_copy( from , to , o ) ; } . . . //
Same as above , but for ACE_MT_SYNCH
Fortunately , ACE offers only two specializations , in the form of ACE_NULL_SYNCH ( a #define for ACE_Null_Mutex , ACE_Null_Condition ) and ACE_MT_SYNCH ( a #define for ACE_Thread_Mutex , ACE_Condition_Thread_Mutex ) , yielding only six specializations .
But there 's more .
If , like me , you avoid like the plague the use of char as a substitute for C++'s missing byte type , you probably instead use signed char or unsigned char , both of which are distinct types from char when it comes to overload resolution ( and template resolution ) .
Passing these to an invocation of std:: copy ( ) will not succeed in invoking the optimized transfer methods .
So , with heads bowed low , we need to provide another six specializations for signed char and six for unsigned char , yielding a total of eighteen specializations , for what we'd like to have been two , or at most three , were we able to partially specialize in the std namespace .
Thankfully , all this effort is worth the payoff .
Before we look at that , I just want to answer one question you might be pondering :
Why only std::copy ( ) ?
In principle there is no reason to not specialize all possible standard algorithms .
The reason I 've not done so is twofold .
First , the sheer effort in doing so would be onerous , to say the least ; to avoid a lot of manual plugging around we'd be pragmatically bound to use macros , and who likes macros ?
The second reason is more , well , reasoned .
The whole reason for this optimization is to facilitate high - speed interpretation of data in its original memory block and high - speed exchange of data into new storage .
In my experience , both of these involve std::copy ( ) .
I should admit one exception to this in our middleware project that required copy_n ( ) .
The copy_n ( ) algorithm was overlooked for incorporation into the C++-98 standard ( but will be included in the next version ) and so appears in STLSoft .
There are specializations of it , this time in the stlsoft namespace , in the same fashion as for std : : copy ( ) .
Hence , there are a total of 36 function specializations in the < acestl/ collections/message_queue_sequence.hpp > header file .
Performance
Now that we 've examined the optimization mechanism , we 'd better make sure it 's worth the not inconsiderable effort .
In order to demonstrate the differences in performance between the optimized block copying version and the original version , I used a test program that creates an ACE_Message_Queue instance to which it adds a number of blocks , copies the contents from a char array using std : : copy ( ) , copies them back to another char array ( again with std : : copy ( ) ) , and verifies that the contents of the two arrays are identical .
The number of blocks ranged from 1 to 10 .
The block size ranged from 10 to 10,000 .
The times for copying from the source char array to the sequence , and from the sequence to the destination char array , were taken separately , using the PlatformSTL component performance_counter .
Each copying operation was repeated 20,000 times , in order to obtain measurement resolution in milliseconds .
The code is shown in the extra material for this chapter on the CD .
Table 31.1 shows a representative sample of the results , expressed as percentages of the time ( in milliseconds ) taken by the equivalent nonoptimized version .
As we might expect , with the very small block size of 10 , the difference is negligible .
For a buffer size of 100 , there 's an advantage with the optimized form , but it 's not stunning .
However , when we get to the more realistic buffer sizes of 1,000 and 10,000 , there 's no competition - the optimized form is 40 - 50 times faster .

Summary
This chapter has looked at the features of Scatter / Gather I/O , whose APIs present considerable challenges to STL adaptation .
We 've examined an adaptation , in the form of the scatter_slice_sequence component , and have seen that such sequences must have genuinely random access iterators ( i.e. , not contiguous iterators ) , for which the identity &*it + 2 == &*( it + 2 ) does not hold ( see Section 2.3.6 ) .
Notwithstanding , we 've seen how we can take advantage of their partial contiguity in order to effect significant performance improvements , something that is particularly important given their use in file and / or socket I/O .
With minimal sacrifice of the Principle of Transparency , we 've made big gains in the Principle of Composition ( and also served the Principle of Diversity along the way ) .

5 tips for writing timeless content Daniel
Some time ago I wrote that bloggers should focus on timeless content .
Quoting the post “ Blogs that are focused on news or current events die as soon as the articles stop coming on a consistent basis .
If you write timeless content , on the other hand , people will still be reading your blog for months or years after you stop writing as long as the content has some value for them . ”
Below you will find 5 practical tips for making your content more timeless , regardless of the topic you are writing about :
1. Avoid words that bring the idea of time : whenever you are writing about a particular topic try to avoid words like today , yesterday , recently or expressions like this week or this month .
If someone comes across those words while reading your blog posts it is very likely that he will associate the article with a specific time frame , say “ the summer of 2005 ″ Â .
The problem is that the reader might think that the content is not fresh and therefore no longer valuable .
2 . Put dates at the bottom of posts : the standard design of many blog templates and WordPress themes feature the date at which the post was published right below the title .
Many readers get discouraged to read a certain post if they see that it was written long ago .
A good way to prevent this is to move the date to the end of the post .
Do not remove the date altogether because a minimum time reference is useful .
3 . Get rid of the calendar : if you wander through the blogosphere you will notice the enormous quantity of calendars on the sidebars .
This feature could be useful if you write content that is dependent on time .
Someone writing about his journey across the Sahara desert , for instance , would need to have a calendar so that readers would be able to track posts in a chronological order and find posts of a specific day .
Most bloggers , however , write about topics that are not dependent on time .
The first question you need to ask yourself is : “ Will my readers benefit from having a calendar where they can click on a particular day and check what I have written on that day ?
”
Â
4 . Get rid of the monthly archives : the same reasoning of the calendar applies to the monthly archives .
Unless it makes sense for your readers to search blog posts by month ( for example if you are blogging about a long journey or about the World Cup ) you should avoid using monthly archives .
5 . When blogging about news or current events make sure to add value : every blog will mention a certain news or an interesting event once in a while .
When you do post something that could not be relevant a couple of months ahead make sure to add some value to it so that a future reader will not lose his time completely by reading it .
Value could be added through your opinion on the matter , a deeper analysis , a cross reference and the like .

Tips timeless content is good content type , but although i understand the theory but we still must learn to improve our ability
Bang Kritikus Great article , thanks for your guides !!
Wakish Hey Daniel ..
One thing which I do n’t agree is the “ remove the date of post ” or “ to make it less obvious ” .
I think the reader is quite conscious enough of what he is looking for and hene he will know if a content is timeless or not .
Most of the time as a reader , I want to see the date of the post , a “ time / date ” means and can convey a lot of things .
And if your article is valuable , anyone will read it whatever the time frame !
Cheers !

This is a great post .
when I read it sometime back I did n’t think much but now I see the value of it .
I guess that is the beauty of timelessness ?
This post itself is a perfect example of timeless content .

An extra tip – keep your categories list lean .
Somewhere between 10 and 15 is a good number for most sites .
If you get too many you risk your users not being able to find what they are looking for .
If you have too many now
Gaje Master
Not bad .
These are really good ideas .
I did notice that my readers were no longer reading the pages in my older post that was located in the archives .
I took the archives off and they started reading again .
Daniel Sylt , its on the todo list !
Also I wanted to leave the data open while the blog is on the initial phase so that people get an idea about my posting frequency .
Once some months pass I will definitely bring the date to the bottom of posts .
Thanks for stoping by .
Sylt Hey , it ’s March 2007 and the Date is still on top of your Blog 😉
johnc Excellent site , added to favorites !!
Fanatyk Personally I use both 😉
Bes Fanatyk , you can always have an archives page or a sitemap that many bots these days , including Google , will follow .
Fanatyk I can sday
You ’re right about the calendar , but I disagree about monthly archives .
Maybe they ’re not very useful for users but I think they ’re useful for bot -crawlers .
Bes Good explanation of the previous topic you had posted .
I ’m going to implement # 2 above myself , moving the dates down .
That should also go along with your “ simple ” post , uncluttering the main interface a bit .
About your point number 1 , I had been thinking about something similar for a while but you hit the nail nicely , and now it ’s clearer .
I guess we can say “ once ” or something similar when using an example and want to associate some kind of a time frame to it .
Daniel yeah thanks for that , I guess the title did not pass under a proof reading …

Hey , nice tips , but should n’t it be timeless and not timesless ?

At first glance , the photographs seem innocuous enough .
Men and women in uniform lie back in deckchairs , listen to accordion music , decorate a Christmas tree .
The happy men and women are Nazi officials enjoying time off from the business of genocide , their images collected by Karl Hoecker , an adjutant to the camp commander .
His unique album of 116 photographs was found in Frankfurt in 1946 by a US intelligence officer , who kept it to himself for six decades before showing it to the US Holocaust Memorial Museum last year .
Museum archivist Rebecca Erbelding , who has helped to put album online , believes the very ordinariness of the scenes captured is what makes them so chilling .
It 's shocking because it's a reminder that they were human beings , that they were n't red-eyed monsters
Rebecca Erbelding
US Holocaust Memorial Museum
" But I think it 's shocking because it 's a reminder that they were human beings , that they were n't red-eyed monsters , that they had pets and children and lives , and yet could do this to other people . "
The find has significantly increased the number of photographs available to historians of Auschwitz - Birkenau before its liberation in January 1945 .
Previously , only about 320 images were known , many of them in the so - called Auschwitz Album , which shows the arrival of Hungarian Jews at the camp in May 1944 .
Hoecker 's album includes the only known pictures of Dr Josef Mengele - notorious for the medical experiments he conducted on Auschwitz inmates - taken within the camp 's confines .
Not a single prisoner appears in any of the images .
Gas chambers
Ms Erbelding says the album seems to have been created very much as a personal keepsake .
The photographs show SS officers but no Auschwitz prisoners
Many of the pictures were taken at Solahuette , a little - known SS resort near Auschwitz where the camp 's guards were periodically sent as a reward for hard work .
Hoecker himself is a regular fixture , decorating a Christmas tree in one photograph , going hunting or playing with his dog in others .
A series of images dated 22 July 1944 shows him eating blueberries with a group of female SS auxiliaries , one of whom pretends to cry as she holds her now - empty bowl upside - down .
On that same day , the museum 's researchers found , 150 prisoners , Jews and non-Jews , arrived on a transport to Auschwitz .
The SS selected 21 men and 12 women for work and killed the rest in the gas chambers .
Another image shows
Hoecker enjoying a sing - along with senior SS officers , identified by the museum as Dr Mengele , former Auschwitz Kommandant Rudolf Hoess , gas chamber supervisor Otto Moll and Birkenau Kommandant Josef Kramer .
' Innocent ' claim
Despite Hoecker 's apparent closeness to those in charge , he is a relatively little - known figure in Nazi history .
A page is devoted to Hoecker and SS women eating blueberries
After World War II , he went into banking and was only tracked down by Nazi hunters in 1961 .
He faced charges at the Frankfurt Auschwitz Trial in 1963 but prosecutors were unable to find any witnesses or evidence directly linking him to the killings at Auschwitz .
Hoecker protested he was innocent , yet the photographs in his album show him socialising with those most closely involved .
" It strains credulity to suggest he would have been unaware of their crimes , " is the museum 's verdict .
He was sentenced to seven years in prison and released on parole in 1970 .
He returned to his banking job and eventually died in Germany in 2000 , aged 88 .
Modern parallels
Dr Stephen Feinstein , director of the Center for Holocaust and Genocide Studies at the University of Minnesota , said the photographs reveal the disconnect between the people and their actions .
What is says to me is that anybody is capable of committing genocide under the right circumstances
Dr Stephen Feinstein
" These people were trying to have a normal life while they were killing people , " he said .
" What it says to me is that anybody is capable of committing genocide under the right circumstances , and what we have to figure out is what makes that possible . "
He draws a parallel between what happened in Nazi Germany and more recent events in Rwanda and Bosnia , where people who had lived side - by - side for years ended up killing each other .
He also sees an echo in the scandal at Abu Ghraib prison in Iraq , where American men and women " raised as good citizens " were guilty of abusing Iraqi prisoners in their charge .
Visitors ' book
But Dr Robert Rozett , director of the libraries at the Yad Vashem Holocaust Centre in Israel , said this is not a surprise to those familiar with the history of the Holocaust .
Yad Vashem 's own archives include a visitor 's book kept by camp commandant Rudolf Hoess , where guests thank him for their lovely stay , he pointed out .
" What the pictures are is a very graphic visual illustration of what was going on there , and so are very important in helping us understand who the murderers were , that they often saw themselves as ordinary human beings .
" And in some ways they were - but they had an ideology of hate and engaged in mass murder .
" But they divorced themselves from that , would go home , listen to classical music , host their friends , have a good time . "
' Offensive '
For the time being , the US Holocaust Memorial Museum intends only to show the photographs online .
We were concerned about how people would take the pictures
Rebecca Erbelding
" We were concerned about how people would take them because , if you take it out of context , it very much seems like a vacation album , of fun times he had , " she said .
" We were very careful to include that context and it seems that most people are understanding the point we were trying to make - that the perpetrators were human beings and that it was n't a nameless , faceless people who did this . "
A lot of Holocaust survivors find the album itself and the fact it was ever created very offensive , she said , but even so " understand how important it is in terms of a reminder " .

Scientists used the microlensing technique to find the new planet
The new planet has five times the Earth 's mass and can be found about 25,000 light - years away in the Milky Way , orbiting a red dwarf star .
The discovery , reported in the journal Nature , was made using a method called microlensing , which can detect far - off planets with an Earth - like mass .
The planet 's cold temperatures make the chance of finding life very unlikely .
The planet , which goes by the name OGLE - 2005 - BLG - 390 Lb , takes about 10 years to orbit its parent star , a red dwarf which is cooler and smaller than Earth 's Sun .
It is in the same galaxy as Earth , the Milky Way , but is found closer to the galactic centre .
Albert Einstein
The scientists say it probably has a rocky core and perhaps even a thin atmosphere , but its large orbit and cool parent star mean it is a very cold world .
Predicted surface temperatures are minus 220 degrees Celsius ( - 364 F ) , meaning that its surface is likely to be layer of frozen liquid .
It may therefore resemble a more massive version of Pluto .
" This is very exciting and important , " said Professor Michael Bode from Liverpool John Moores University , a principal investigator for the RoboNet project which collaborated on this research .
" This is the most Earth - like planet we have discovered to date , in terms of its mass and the distance from its parent star , " he told BBC News .
" Most of the other planets that have been discovered are either much more massive , much hotter or both . "
The microlensing technique used to find this planet was first predicted by Albert Einstein in 1912 .
Microlensing occurs when a massive object in space , like a star , crosses in front of another more distant star .
As it passes , the gravity from the foreground object bends the light coming from the background star , temporarily making it look brighter .
This usually lasts for about a month .
How can we prove there is life on a distant planet when we have problems seeing if there is life on Mars ?
Dr Martin Dominik , University of St Andrews
If the foreground star has a planet orbiting it , it will distort the light even more , and will make the star behind it look even brighter .
But this effect lasts for a much shorter period , giving astronomers just hours or days to detect it .
Dr Martin Dominik from the University of St Andrews is a co-leader of the PLANET collaboration , one of the microlensing networks used to detect the new planet .
" We first saw the usual brightening reaching a peak magnification on 31 July 2005 .
On 10 August , however , there was a small ' flash ' lasting about half a day , " he said .
" By succeeding in catching this anomaly with two of the telescopes of our network and with careful monitoring , we were able to conclude that the lens star is accompanied by a low - mass planet . "
Life on Earth
The discovery was the joint effort of three microlensing campaigns , PLANET / RoboNet , OGLE and MOA , and involved researchers from 12 countries .
So far , about 160 planets have been found outside our Solar System , but only three of them have been located using the microlensing technique .
Recent simulations of planet formation suggest that bodies with an Earth - like mass are abundant .
Scientists are attempting to discover more new worlds using this technique and are looking for ways to refine it further .
Dr Nicholas Rattenbury , from Jodrell Bank Observatory in Cheshire , a member of the MOA microlensing collaboration , points out : " We could take this research forward by building a network of bigger telescopes around the world to make us more efficient at detecting these Earth - like planets . "
If planets are found with conditions similar to our own planet , then the next step would be to begin the search for life , but this might not prove easy .
" To prove there is life on a far - off planet would be difficult , " Dr Dominik told the BBC News website .
" How can we prove there is life on a distant planet when we have problems seeing if there is life on Mars ? "
WASHINGTON ( Reuters ) - Deepening unhappiness with President George W. Bush and the U.S. Congress soured the mood of Americans and sent Bush ’s approval rating to another record low this month , according to a Reuters / Zogby poll released on Wednesday .
President Bush speaks on the economy and budget in Rogers , Arkansas , October 15 , 2007 .
REUTERS / Jason Reed
The Reuters / Zogby Index , which measures the mood of the country , also fell from 98.8 to 96 -- the second consecutive month it has dropped .
The number of Americans who believe the country is on the wrong track jumped four points to 66 percent .
Bush ’s job approval rating fell to 24 percent from last month ’s record low for a Zogby poll of 29 percent .
A paltry 11 percent gave Congress a positive grade , tying last month ’s record low .
“ There is a real question among Americans now about how relevant this government is to them , ” pollster John Zogby said .
“ They tell us they want action on health care , education , the war and immigration , but they do n’t believe they are going to get it . ”
The dismal assessment of the Republican president and the Democratic - controlled Congress follows another month of inconclusive political battles over a future path in Iraq and the recent Bush veto of an expansion of the program providing insurance for poor children .
The bleak mood could present problems for both parties heading into the November 2008 election campaign , Zogby said .
“ Voter turnout could still be high next year , but the mood has turned against incumbents and into a ‘ throw the bums out ’ mindset , ” Zogby said .
The national telephone survey of 991 likely voters , conducted October 10 through October 14 , found barely one - quarter of Americans , or 26 percent , believe the country is headed in the right direction .
The poll found declining confidence in U.S. economic and foreign policy .
About 18 percent gave positive marks to foreign policy , down from 24 percent , and 26 percent rated economic policy positively , down from 30 percent .
A majority of Americans still rate their personal financial situation as excellent or good , although the number dipped slightly this month to 54 percent from 56 percent .
In August , 59 percent rated their finances as excellent or good .
“ Americans are still feeling good about a number of things in their lives , but not about the government ’s leadership , ” Zogby said .
“ They are giving up on this government . ”
The Index , which made its debut last month , combines responses to 10 questions on Americans ’ views about their leaders , the direction of the country and their future .
Index polling began in July , and that month ’s results provide the benchmark score of 100 .
A score above 100 indicates the public mood has improved since July .
A score below 100 shows the mood has soured , and a falling score like the one recorded this month shows the nation ’s mood is getting worse .
The RZI is released the third Wednesday of each month .
In the 2008 White House race , Sen. Hillary Clinton of New York tightened her grip on the top spot in the Democratic nomination race with the support of 46 percent , up from 35 percent last month .
Her top rival , Sen. Barack Obama of Illinois , was at 25 percent , moving up slightly from last month ’s 21 percent .
Former Sen. John Edwards of North Carolina was third with 9 percent , and about 12 percent of Democratic voters were unsure of their choice .
Among Republicans , former New York Mayor Rudy Giuliani expanded his lead over Fred Thompson , the former senator and Hollywood actor .
Giuliani led Thompson 28 percent to 20 percent , compared to last month ’s 26 percent to 24 percent .
Former Massachusetts Gov. Mitt Romney jumped from 7 percent to 14 percent and moved past Arizona Sen.
John McCain into third place .
McCain fell from 13 percent last month to 8 percent .
More Republicans , 18 percent , said they had not made up their mind , leaving room for more shifts in the field .
“ We still have one in five Republicans undecided .
That race is really up in the air , ” Zogby said .
A majority of voters asked about former Vice President Al Gore said he should not run for the White House in 2008 despite winning the Nobel Peace Prize .
About 51 percent said he should not enter the race and 40 percent said he should .
The Nobel award on Friday came halfway through the polling period .
The Gore question was asked of 485 likely voters with a margin of error of plus or minus 4.5 percent .
The rest of the national survey had a margin of error of plus or minus 3.2 percentage points .

GOP presidential hopeful Rudy Giuliani greeted supporters at a rally in Wilmington , Del. , two weeks ago .
Campaign analysts say his repeated references to Sept. 11 can make or break him .
( Matt Rourke / Associated Press ) Giuliani watchers wonder if he will overplay 9/11 card WILMINGTON , Del. -- Rudy Giuliani was just six seconds into his speech when he played his campaign trump card : the memory of the Sept. 11 attacks .
" I 'll tell you the reason I wear this flag , " the former New York City mayor told supporters at a recent rally here , pointing to the American flag pin on his lapel .
" Before September 11 , I only wore this flag rarely .
But I started wearing it right after September 11 .
I wear it every day now .
Each time I wear it , it reminds me of September 11 . "
For Giuliani , the attacks of Sept. 11 , 2001 , and his response to them have become his strongest campaign pitch , as the GOP presidential candidate reminds voters again and again of the role he played when terrorists crashed two airliners into the World Trade Center towers , killing nearly 3,000 people .
It is a message that appears to be resonating among Republicans .
They have put the blunt - speaking former mayor at the top of a crowded GOP field in most polls , and his campaign said Tuesday that he raised more money in the second quarter than any other Republican candidate .
Political analysts say Giuliani's pitch is a powerful message to an electorate worried about another assault on US soil , especially after the recent attacks in Britain .
At the same time , many of these analysts question whether Giuliani can ride the anti terror train all the way to the White House .
They say Giuliani risks being tagged as a single - issue candidate for his Sept. 11 performance just when his handling of the attack and its aftermath is drawing increasing criticism from his home city of New York .
" He really defined leadership in the aftermath of 9/11 , and that is something that is uniquely his own , " said John Zogby , an independent pollster based in upstate New York .
" But he does need a second act , possibly even a third act .
This is where we get into uncharted waters . "
The former mayor has recently sought to expand his campaign résumé , speaking more in recent weeks about other issues , especially the need for fiscal discipline in Washington .
But his campaign is still largely centered on protecting America .
He peppers his speeches and debates with references to keeping the nation " on the offense " against " the Islamic terrorists , " manning the borders against illegal immigrants who might pose a threat or by helping local communities prepare to handle a terrorist attack .
Giuliani's Sept. 11 experience is helping him among Southern voters who otherwise might be turned off by his pro-abortion rights stance or three marriages , said Merle Black , a political scientist at Emory University in Atlanta .
Further , emphasizing the Sept. 11 theme allows Giuliani to make a strong national security argument without focusing on the war in Iraq , a far more politically divisive issue , Black noted .
Giuliani's supporters lavish him with praise for his handling of 9/11 .
At a recent Giuliani event , many said they could not recall any specific thing Giuliani did the day of the attacks .
But , they say , Giuliani 's very presence in the streets of Manhattan after the attack -- a stark contrast to President Bush , who was absent from public view for hours after the tragedy -- displayed strong leadership and courage .
" He took control , " said Carolyn Mercadante , 70 , a Delaware voter who came to see Giuliani speak .
" Just the fact that he was such a presence there " in New York the day of the attacks , said 67 - year - old Bill Uranko of Middleton , Del. , when asked to explain what impressed him about Giuliani 's Sept.11 performance .
" You could see he was visibly moved by what happened . "
Richard Henry , a firefighter from Anne Arundel County , Md. , said that among the candidates Giuliani stands out as someone who would protect the nation .
" We need a person who is going to take on the terrorists .
It 's not just a bumper sticker .
It 's a real thing , " Henry said .
In New York City , however , Giuliani 's reputation is not as positive as in the rest of the country , where many retain the image of Giuliani as " America 's mayor , " said Tony Fabrizio , a GOP pollster .
Many firefighters , some police officers , and family members of the victims of Sept. 11 have castigated Giuliani for what they say was poor emergency planning before the attack and a failure to protect workers from poisonous air pollution at the site during the rescue and clean up operation , a charge the Giuliani campaign denies .
A New York firefighters ' website , fdnyrant.com , brims with vitriolic comments against Giuliani .
The International Association of Firefighters pointedly refused to invite Giuliani to speak with other presidential candidates at the group 's annual conference this year , then relented .
But , Giuliani did n't attend .
Pat Lynch , president of New York City 's Patrolmen 's Benevolent Association , told NY 1 TV in May that Giuliani " does n't deserve to be president " because he did n't take care of the police officers who defended the city on Sept.11 .
" Everybody bought into the myth " about Giuliani after Sept. 11 , said Sally Regenhard , whose firefighter son was killed that day .
" All of us , Americans or whomever else , we all want heroes , we all want to be saved by someone -- by Superman , by Moses , by Jesus , " she said , adding that Giuliani appeared to be such a savior on the day of the attacks .
But " he 's a fraud .
What did he do on 9/11 ?
He walked around , " said Regenhard , who said she voted twice for Giuliani for mayor .
The Giuliani campaign called the accusations baseless and revisionist .
" Every effort was made by Mayor Giuliani and his staff to ensure the safety of all workers at Ground Zero in the aftermath of this unprecedented act of terror , " the campaign said in a statement .
Representative Dave Reichert , Republican of Washington state , and state chairman of Giuliani 's campaign , said Giuliani 's strong anti terrorism message would drown out those who criticize his performance on Sept. 11 .
" When they see your star rise , there 's a tendency to try to tarnish that star a little bit , " Reichert said in an interview .
" The mayor may have more credibility in this [ antiterrorism ] area than some of the other candidates .
He has the experience to back up his comments . "
Fred Siegel , a history professor at Cooper Union and author of a book on Giuliani , said some of the public employee union members were upset about other matters , such as Giuliani 's refusal to support pay raises for them .
" Giuliani governed against the grain .
He alienated every interest group in New York , which is why he accomplished so much , " said Siegel , author of " Prince of the City : Giuliani , New York and the Genius of American Life . "
Lee Miringoff , an independent pollster with the Marist Institute for Public Opinion in Poughkeepsie , N.Y. , predicted there would be a spillover of the anti-Giuliani sentiment in New York City that could infect the former mayor 's national campaign .
" Now , he 's America 's mayor trying to be America 's president " by running a campaign heavy with emotional references to 9/11 , Miringoff said .
But " that gets tarnished after awhile , " he added .
Even among Republicans , the attraction to Giuliani may fade as more voters examine his full history as well as issues other than Sept. 11 , said Fabrizio , whose national polling shows Giuliani leading the other nine announced candidates and two possible GOP contenders .
Now , Republican voters " see a guy who 's tough on terrorism .
He takes no crap , " Fabrizio said .
But , he added , " it may not hold . " © Copyright 2007 Globe Newspaper Company .

In latest twist , former Bush spokesman blames Carter for Iran David Edwards and Muriel Kane

Print This Email This MSNBC's Joe Scarborough conducted a phone interview on Thursday morning with former white House press secretary Ari Fleischer , who heads a group that is running an ad campaign to convince Congress to continue funding President Bush 's Iraq War .
" When we see all the missteps [ in Iraq ] ... it makes it harder , does it not , for the American people to trust this administration moving forward ? "
Scarborough asked Fleischer .
" Look at the other side , " Fleischer answered .
" I could blame Jimmy Carter for creating the mullahs and the ayatollahs in Iran . "
" But Jimmy Carter 's not president right now , " said Scarborough .
" Jimmy Carter 's not saying ' Trust me . '
George Bush is . "
" You have to make decisions today based on events today , " insisted Fleishcher .
" Do the politicians switch their votes , where last year and the year before they supported fully funding the war against terror ?
Well , they 've switched their votes now and cut and run .
That 's the current debate . "
Scarborough remarked that when he hears reports that things are going well militarily in Iraq , " I start thinking , well , you know what , maybe , maybe they 're right , maybe we need to even send more troops over there .
And suddenly then , it hits me , we do n't have the troops .
...
Troop rotations are such that we 're going to begin drawing down regardless .
Right ? "
" Troop rotations is one of the strings Congress is trying to attach to the troops , " complained Fleishcher , " where Congress is trying to pretend they 're all generals and they decide how much rotation should be , how long troops should be home , how long troops should be abroad .
...
What we 're saying is , this fall is not the time for Congress to meddle , to cut and run , or to make troops ' mission impossible . "
" We do n't have the troops to continue fighting through next summer , do we ? " Scarborough asked again .
" That 's a military judgment whether they do or they do n't , and it 's amazing what the military can do when they say we must do it , " Fleischer declared .
" They usually are pretty flexible , and they can -- they types of changes they need to make on the ground , that 's what requires the sacrifice from the forces and their families . "

I 'm a big fan of dual - core systems .
I think there 's a clear and substantial benefit for all computer users when there are two CPUs waiting to service requests , instead of just one .
If nothing else , it lets you gracefully terminate an application that has gone haywire , consuming all available CPU time .
It 's like having a backup CPU in reserve , waiting to jump in and assist as necessary .
But for most software , you hit a point of diminishing returns very rapidly after two cores .
In Quad - Core Desktops and Diminishing Returns , I questioned how effectively today 's software can really use even four CPU cores , much less the inevitable eight and sixteen CPU cores we 'll see a few years from now .
To get a sense of what kind of performance improvement we can expect going from 2 to 4 CPU cores , let 's focus on the Core 2 Duo E6600 and Core 2 Quad Q6600 processors .
These 2.4 GHz CPUs are identical in every respect , except for the number of cores they bring to the table .
In a recent review , Scott Wasson at the always - thorough Tech Report presented a slew of benchmarks that included both of these processors .
Here 's a quick visual summary of how much you can expect performance to improve when upgrading from 2 to 4 CPU cores :
The results seem encouraging , until you take a look at the applications that benefit from quad - core -- the ones that are n't purely synthetic benchmarks are rendering , encoding , or scientific applications .
It 's the same old story .
Beyond encoding and rendering tasks which are naturally amenable to parallelization , the task manager CPU graphs tell the sad tale of software that simply is n't written to exploit more than two CPUs .
Unfortunately , CPU parallelism is inevitable .
Clock speed can't increase forever ; the physics do n't work .
Mindlessly ramping clock speed to 10 GHz is n't an option .
CPU vendors are forced to deliver more CPU cores running at nearly the same clock speed , or at very small speed bumps .
Increasing the number of CPU cores on a die should defeat raw clock speed increases , at least in theory .
In the short term , we have to choose between faster dual - core systems , or slower quad - core systems .
Today , a quad - core 2.4 GHz CPU costs about the same as a dual - core 3.0 GHz CPU .
But which one will provide superior performance ?
A recent Xbit Labs review performed exactly this comparison :
3.0 GHz
Dual Core 2.4 GHz
Quad Core improvement
2 to 4 cores PCMark05 9091 8853 - 3 % SysMark 2007 , E - Learning 167 140 - 16 % SysMark 2007 , Video Creation 131 151 15 % SysMark 2007 , Productivity 152 138 - 9 % SysMark 2007 , 3D 160 148 - 8 % Quake 4 136 117 - 15 % F.E.A.R. 123 110 - 10 % Company of Heroes 173 161 - 7 % Lost Planet 62 54 - 12 % Lost Planet " Concurrent Operations " 62 81 30 % DivX 6.6 65 64 0 % Xvid 1.2 43 45 5 % H.264 QuickTime Pro 7.2 189 188 0 % iTunes 7.3 MP3 encoding 110 131 - 16 % 3ds Max 9 SP2 4.95 6.61 33 % Cinebench 10 5861 8744 49 % Excel 2007 39.9 24.4 63 % WinRAR 3.7 188 180 5 % Photoshop CS3 70 73 - 4 % Microsoft Movie Maker 6.0 73 80 - 9 %
It 's mostly what I would expect -- only rendering and encoding tasks exploit parallelism enough to overcome the 25 % speed deficit between the dual and quad core CPUs .
Outside of that specific niche , performance will actually suffer for most general purpose software if you choose a slower quad - core over a faster dual - core .
However , there were some surprises in here , such as Excel 2007 , and the Lost Planet " concurrent operations " setting .
It 's possible software engineering will eventually advance to the point that clock speed matters less than parallelism .
Or eventually it might be irrelevant , if we do n't get to make the choice between faster clock speeds and more CPU cores .
But in the meantime , clock speed wins most of the time .
More CPU cores is n't automatically better .
Typical users will be better off with the fastest possible dual - core CPU they can afford .

washington -- Retired Army Lt. Gen. Ricardo S. Sanchez , who led U.S. forces in Iraq for a year after the March 2003 invasion , accused the Bush administration Friday of going to war with a “ catastrophically flawed ” plan and said the United States is “ living a nightmare with no end in sight . ”
Sanchez described the current troop increase in Iraq as “ a desperate attempt by the administration that has not accepted the political and economic realities of this war . ”
“ The administration , Congress and the entire interagency , especially the State Department , must shoulder the responsibility for this catastrophic failure , and the American people must hold them accountable , ” Sanchez told military reporters and editors .
“ There has been a glaring unfortunate display of incompetent strategic leadership within our national leaders . ”
Sanchez lashed out specifically at the National Security Council , calling officials there negligent and incompetent , without offering details .
He also blasted war policies over the last four years , which he said had stripped senior military officers of responsibility and thrust the armed services into an “ intractable position ” in Iraq .

“ The best we can do with this flawed approach is stave off defeat , ” Sanchez said in a speech to the Military Reporters and Editors ’ annual conference in Arlington , Va .
“ Without bipartisan cooperation , we are destined to fail .
There is nothing going on in Washington that would give us hope . ”
He faulted the administration for failing to “ communicate effectively that reality to the American people . ”
Sanchez offered little advice about fixing military problems in Iraq .
Efforts generally need more resources and skill , he said .
“ From a catastrophically flawed , unrealistically optimistic war plan to the administration ’s latest surge strategy , this administration has failed to employ and synchronize its political , economic and military power , ” Sanchez said .
Sanchez led Combined Joint Task Force 7 in Iraq beginning on June 15 , 2003 .
Under his command , an insurgency erupted in Iraq , and he and other top officers were slow to respond to it , in part because of the reluctance of then - Defense Secretary Donald H. Rumsfeld and other Bush administration officials to recognize its existence .

Some officials thought the anti-U.S. attacks would fade away after Saddam Hussein was captured in December 2003 , but the insurgency intensified , with pitched battles the next spring in Najaf and Fallouja .
Some analysts have argued that Sanchez had little feel for strategy and permitted commanders to use tactics that helped intensify opposition to the U.S. presence in the country .
Sanchez might be remembered most as the top general in Iraq during the period when the Abu Ghraib prisoner abuses occurred and were later revealed .
Photographs of Iraqi detainees being humiliated shocked many , and provoked a reevaluation of the U.S. presence in Iraq .
Some enlisted troops and Army Reserve officers were charged in the scandal , but in legal proceedings and official reviews no top commanders were deemed responsible .
Sanchez retired after officials decided not to give him a fourth star ; they feared a public confirmation hearing would go badly in light of Abu Ghraib .
He is now a senior mentor at the military ’s Joint Warfighting Center .
SILVER SPRING , Maryland ( Reuters ) -
The makers of “ What Would Jesus Buy ? ” have a problem -- how do you sell a film documenting performance artist Rev. Billy and his Stop Shopping Gospel Choir on a guerrilla U.S. tour against consumerism ?
The film follows the white - suited , big - haired Rev. Billy and his 35 - member choir as they hit the road in two biodiesel - fueled buses in December 2005 .
They invade shopping malls , megastores and Starbucks coffee shops with a message preached in mock - religious fervor that there is evil -- a looming “ shopocalypse ” -- at the heart of U.S. consumer culture .
Rev.
Billy tries to “ exorcise ” discount chain Wal - Mart ’s home office in Arkansas .
He is arrested in Disneyland on Christmas Day after marching with his red-robed choir and denouncing the Walt Disney Corp. for outsourcing merchandise production .
In an outlet of lingerie shop Victoria ’s Secret , known for its blizzard of catalog promotions , Rev. Billy exhorts , “ O Victoria , we know your secret -- we do n’t need a million catalogs a day to have our sexual fantasies . ”
The movie has received early praise and has solid credentials , including executive producer Morgan Spurlock , who scored big with “ Super Size Me , ” a movie targeting McDonald ’s fast food .
But director Rob VanAlkemade said the movie ’s message makes it a tough sell to potential distributors .
“ Major distributors have backed away because Wal - Mart pushes half of their DVDs , ” VanAlkemade said after a sold - out screening of the movie on Sunday at the Silverdocs documentary festival near Washington .
Starbucks -- a frequent target of Rev. Billy which got a court order to keep him out of its California stores -- pulled out as a sponsor of Silverdocs .
The festival is presented by the American Film Institute and the Discovery Channel .
Festival spokeswoman Jody Arlington said Starbucks expressed discomfort with the movie and raised security issues , but it let Silverdocs keep the sponsorship money even as it withdrew its logo .
Starbucks Mid-Atlantic manager Carter Bentzel denied the decision was linked to the movie and said Starbucks wanted instead to be involved with a Latin American festival of the American Film Institute .
NO T-SHIRTS
Rev. Billy ’s partner , Savitri Di , said The Church of Stop Shopping organization also tries to restrain the commercialization of its own activities .
Although happy to sell books and other “ content , ” they draw the line at T - shirts .
“ That ’s just advertising , ” she said .
An exasperated Di wonders in the movie whether Rev. Billy ’s crusade will ever make an impact .
On Sunday she said supportive e-mails from all over the world have given her hope .
“ That ’s definitely a kind of change and it ’s positive , ” she said .
Rev. Billy in real life is Bill Talen of New York .
He said his message has a serious spiritual component despite the satire .
“ The multinational corporations have a fundamentalist religion going , ” he said .
“ They ’ve got as much control over us as the Roman Catholic Church in the 1300s .
“ We ’re trying to break that .
We ’re finding another thing , ” he said .
VanAlkemade pledged that the movie will find its way to audiences despite the marketing challenges .
“ Talks are ongoing and we ’re going to save Christmas from a shopocalypse this Christmas one way or another , ” he said .
“ Or maybe someone shot this screening today and we ’ll see it on YouTube tonight .
It ’s worldwide distribution .
It ’s instantaneous . ”
If the op - ed page of the New York Times has often served as the first battleground in America ’s wars , where the arguments and counter - arguments for intervention are debated , then the past week or so has certainly brought this institutional tradition to the fore : last week , we had Michael O’Hanlon and Kenneth M. Pollack averring that it ’s too early to sing a dirge over the " surge , " which has been cited by the War Party as proof positive that " victory " is at hand  or , at any rate , is at least possible .
These two Brookings Institution scholars , who spent a total of eight days in Iraq recently , have come back to tell us the " surge " is working , " morale is high , " and Gen .
Petraeus will save us .
Their article has been touted by the administration and its amen corner in the media as the answer to the rising tide of public discontent over the war .
Aside from the content of their arguments  anecdotes , really  we are told that these two are " harsh critics of the war , " when the reality is that both supported it .
Pollack wrote an entire book , The Threatening Storm , that was instrumental in mobilizing Democratic Party leaders to lend their support to the invasion .
Indeed , in the article , the authors describe themselves as " two analysts who have harshly criticized the Bush administration ’s miserable handling of Iraq " ( emphasis added ) .
On the other side of the barricades , we have an article signed by seven soldiers in Iraq , who describe the political debate in Washington  where O’Hanlon and Pollack can get away with being called " war critics "  as " surreal . "
They write :
" To believe that Americans , with an occupying force that long ago outlived its reluctant welcome , can win over a recalcitrant local population and win this counterinsurgency is far - fetched .
As responsible infantrymen and noncommissioned officers with the 82nd Airborne Division soon heading back home , we are skeptical of recent press coverage portraying the conflict . "
In other words , the much - touted " success " of the " surge " is a fraud .
These guys are on the ground in Iraq , with the famed 82nd Airborne , and they ’re telling us  and Bill Kristol , Rich Lowry , and Messrs .
O’Hanlon and Pollack  that it is n’t working .
No one questions American military superiority over the insurgents , but , they say , this has not brought about success , by any measure .
Instead , we find ourselves confronted with a proliferating array of " actors who do not fit neatly into boxes : Sunni extremists , al - Qaeda terrorists , Shi’ite militiamen , criminals , and armed tribes .
This situation is made more complex by the questionable loyalties and Janus - faced role of the Iraqi police and Iraqi army , which have been trained and armed at United States taxpayers ’ expense . "
The details of this " Janus - faced role " are bloodcurdling .
The seven describe an incident in which the Iraqi army and police helped ambush U.S. units , causing one American death and two critical injuries : " Iraqi police and army officers escorted the triggermen and helped plant the bomb . "
Yet how can this be ?
Are n’t we in Iraq precisely to support the very army and police units these soldiers say are killing Americans ?
It makes no sense , unless one takes into consideration what Seymour Hersh calls " the redirection " of U.S. strategy in the region , which is geared to the next target of the neocons ’ " regime change " agenda : Iran .
The redirection requires a sudden and radical shift in our alliances , sundering our ties with the Shi’ites and taking up the cause of the defeated Sunnis  with Saudi Arabia , our primary regional satrap , standing behind them .
Those ambushed soldiers were caught in the shifting currents of the American about - face , and they will not be the only ones to suffer severe whiplash .
The seven authors of " The War as We Saw It " recognize this new turn yet seem bewildered by it :
" Sunnis , who have been underrepresented in the new Iraqi armed forces , now find themselves forming militias , sometimes with our tacit support .
Sunnis recognize that the best guarantee they may have against Shi’ite militias and the Shi’ite - dominated government is to form their own armed bands .
We arm them to aid in our fight against al - Qaeda .
" However , while creating proxies is essential in winning a counterinsurgency , it requires that the proxies are loyal to the center that we claim to support .
Armed Sunni tribes have indeed become effective surrogates , but the enduring question is where their loyalties would lie in our absence .
The Iraqi government finds itself working at cross purposes with us on this issue because it is justifiably fearful that Sunni militias will turn on it should the Americans leave . "
What they do n’t see is that this is part of a larger anti-Shi’ite , anti-Iranian strategic turn  that Washington is already fighting the next war , as the invasion and occupation of Iraq merges seamlessly into an armed conflict with Iran .
Their lack of comprehension as far as this issue is concerned is shared by Sen.
Carl Levin , who has lately taken up the Sunni cause and is now demanding that the Maliki government step down .
Has there ever been a more blatant expression of America ’s imperialistic arrogance ?
Usually , as in the case of Vietnam  e.g. , the toppling of President Ngo Dinh Diem  this sort of thing is done sub rosa .
However , in a fit of irrational exuberance  perhaps unwarranted  the latest bearers of the White Man ’s Burden are openly talking about exercising their imperial prerogatives .
Added to this vulgar display is the spectacle of Iyad Allawi  formerly the CIA ’s favorite candidate for prime minister  trying to make a comeback , not in Iraq but in the editorial pages of the Washington Post , where he calls for " change at the top of the Iraqi government . "
It is n’t clear if he ’s asking to be installed in office by force of U.S. arms , but if he is n’t , he ’s coming awfully close .
What is very interesting about all this is the new confluence of Democratic rhetoric and administration policy when it comes to measuring " success " in Iraq : Sen .
Levin is essentially demanding that the Bush people implement the " redirection " faster , and harder .
As one blogger reported :
" Barbour , Griffith & Rogers LLC , the registered lobbyists working on behalf of Ayad Allawi , sent out Levin ’s statements to their mailing list , from the account of DrAyadAllawi@allawi-for-iraq.com
" I wonder if the lobbyists canvassed Levin before he made his remarks , thereby influencing his views .
" Do n’t reporters find this odd : Ayad Allawi has lobbyists running around D.C. peddling him as Maliki ’s replacement , probably influencing Democratic thinking on Iraq , and consequently shaping Democratic strategies for the upcoming U.S. presidential elections .
Does n’t this count as news ? "
Well , yes , it does , but , aside from merely reporting this news , there is the question of what it means .
Rather than the assessment advanced by the aforementioned blogger  the " surge " is working , and Levin is simply grasping at another partisan straw 
I would suggest another explanation entirely .
A Levin-Allawi-Sunni alliance amounts to the Democratic leadership helping to write the next chapter in the history of America ’s conquest of the Middle East  indeed , if , as is widely expected , the Democrats take the White House in ’ 08 , they ’ll be the primary authors of that bloodstained and thoroughly wretched saga .
While this odd alliance presents the Sunni " moderate " case in terms of stabilizing Iraq to the point where our presence is no longer required 
Allawi calls for aiming at a U.S. withdrawal two years from now  the revival of the Democrats ’ call for " benchmarks " is just a cover story for a darker , deadlier narrative .
The tempo of events is increasing as we approach the much - touted September report on " progress " in Iraq , in which Gen .
Petraeus is expected to note the " gains " we have supposedly made by allying with our former Sunni enemies , while targeting the Iranians as the real obstacles to lasting success .
There are increasing reports of border incidents , and we are very close , I believe , to a major confrontation between U.S. and Iranian forces .
By taking up the Allawi lobby , the Democrats are helping to set the stage for a disaster that will dwarf our present predicament in Iraq by several degrees of magnitude  war with Iran .
NOTES IN THE MARGIN
I‘ll be a speaker at the upcoming 18th annual meeting of the John Randolph Club , " Speaking Truth To Power , " Sept. 21 - 22 , 2007 .
I ’ll be discussing the bipartisan " consensus " on the alleged necessity of interventionism .
Go here for details .
Cancer patients do n't have time to waste .
Many go through several different treatments , however , to find one that is more effective against their particular type of tumor .
Thus , an algorithm that could help rapidly sort molecular information about a patient 's particular tumor and could help match this information to the right drug treatment would be a breakthrough of enormous value .
Dan Theodorescu , M.D. , Ph.D. , a University of Virginia oncologist and cancer biologist , and Jae Lee , Ph.D. , a computational biologist and bioinformatics statistician , have pioneered just such a system .
This work involved collaboration with colleagues at the National Cancer Institute , GeneLogic Inc. and the University of Virginia Computer Sciences Department .
Using a panel of 60 diverse , human cancer cell lines from the National Cancer Institute ( NCI - 60 ) , the researchers devised and tested an algorithm designed to match the best potential treatment (s ) for a particular tumor in a particular patient .
Previously , the NCI - 60 cell lines were used to screen more than 100,000 chemical compounds for their anticancer activity .
These drug responses , however , were not definitely linked to clinical effectiveness in patients .
Another issue is that the 60 cell lines did not include all important cancer types ( for example , certain bladder cancers , lymphomas , and small cell lung cancers were not among the 60 lines studied ) .
The researchers investigated whether the drug sensitivity data of the 60 cancer cell lines could be extrapolated into useful information on other tumors or cancer cell lines .
In fact , they found that their " coexpression extrapolation ( COXEN ) system " could be used to accurately predict drug sensitivity for bladder cancer cell lines to two common chemotherapies , cisplatin and paclitaxel .
" Even though this NCI cell set was n't an exhaustive encyclopedia of cancer cells , we found we could use the available data to draw conclusions about other cell types we were exploring .
The algorithm is a Rosetta stone for translating from the NCI - studied drugs to any other cell line or human tumor , " says Dr. Theodorescu , director of the UVa Paul Mellon Prostate Cancer Institute and senior author of the study .
" We believe we have found an effective way to personalize cancer therapy . "
The UVa research team was able to predict the clinical responses of breast cancer patients with treated with commonly used chemotherapies , docetaxel and tamoxifen .
The most exciting aspect of this research is that in addition to predicting patient responses to therapy , the COXEN algorithm can be used to discover effective compounds in any form of cancer .
By the nature of the algorithm , which examines both cancer cells and drug activity at the molecular level , these newly discovered drugs should be effective in patients .
This pre-screening for effectiveness using COXEN should greatly lower the failure rate of clinical trials testing new compounds .
Likewise , as the drug discovery times are decreased in research laboratories , the cost of drugs also will come down .
Basically it brings the chemists making the drugs much closer to the clinic , saving time .
Because the NCI - 60 set of cells has been used to screen thousands of chemically defined compounds and natural extracts for anticancer activity , " we were able to make significant predictions about what compounds might work on real patients who might have other types of cancer , " Theodorescu said .
The researchers used the COXEN to screen 45,545 compounds , and they identified a several new compounds that have activity against human bladder cancer .
To share this exciting capability with the scientific community , Dr. Lee is leading the development of a web - based COXEN system where investigators with genomic profiling data from cancer cells or patient tumors can obtain chemosensitivity prediction results on FDA - approved chemotherapeutic compounds .
Dr. Theodorescu is planning clinical trials for the new compounds against bladder cancer .
Another planned clinical trial would examine patients with a variety of cancers receiving COXEN personalized , second - line drug combinations to beat their cancers , using FDA - approved agents .
Many new and exciting discoveries remain to be made , even more quickly and at lower costs .
The results have been published the week of July 23 in the Early Edition of the Proceeedings of the National Academy of Sciences .

Under new rules proposed by the Transport Security Administration ( TSA ) ( pdf ) , all airline passengers would need advance permission before flying into , through , or over the United States regardless of citizenship or the airline 's national origin .
Currently , the Advanced Passenger Information System , operated by the Customs and Border Patrol , requires airlines to forward a list of passenger information no later than 15 minutes before flights from the US take off ( international flights bound for the US have until 15 minutes after take - off ) .
Planes are diverted if a passenger on board is on the no-fly list .
The new rules mean this information must be submitted 72 hours before departure .
Only those given clearance will get a boarding pass .
The TSA estimates that 90 to 93 per cent of all travel reservations are final by then .
The proposed rules require the following information for each passenger : full name , sex , date of birth , and redress number ( assigned to passengers who use the Travel Redress Inquiry Program because they have been mistakenly placed on the no- fly list ) , and known traveller number ( once there is a programme in place for registering known travellers whose backgrounds have been checked ) .
Non-travellers entering secure areas , such as parents escorting children , will also need clearance .
The TSA held a public hearing in Washington DC on 20 September , which heard comments from both privacy advocates and airline industry representatives from Qantas , the Regional Airline Association , IATA , and the American Society of Travel Agents .
The privacy advocates came from the American Civil Liberties Union and the Identity Project .
All were negative .
The proposals should be withdrawn entirely , argued Edward Hasbrouck , author of The Practical Nomad and the leading expert on travel data privacy .
" Obscured by the euphemistic language of ' screening ' is the fact that travellers would be required to get permission before they can travel . "
Hasbrouck submitted that requiring clearance in order to travel violates the US First Amendment right of assembly , the central claim in John Gilmore 's case against the US government over the requirement to show photo ID for domestic travel .
In addition , the TSA is required to study the impact of the proposals on small economic entities ( such as sole traders ) .
Finally , the TSA provides no way for individuals to tell whether their government - issued ID is actually required by law , opening the way for rampant identity theft .
ACLU 's Barry Steinhardt quoted press reports of 500,000 to 750,000 people on the watch list ( of which the no- fly list is a subset ) .
" If there are that many terrorists in the US , we 'd all be dead . "
TSA representative Kip Hawley noted that the list has been carefully investigated and halved over the last year .
" Half of grossly bloated is still bloated , " Steinhardt replied .
The airline industry representatives ' objections were largely logistical .
They argued that the 60 - day timeframe the TSA proposes to allow for implementation from the publication date of the final rules is much too short .
They want a year to revamp many IT systems , especially , as the Qantas representative said , as no one will start until they 're sure there will be no further changes .
In addition , many were concerned about the impact on new , convenient and cash - saving technologies , such as checking in at home , or storing a boarding pass in a PDA .
One additional point , also raised by Hasbrouck : the data the TSA requires will be collected by the airlines who presumably will keep it for their own purposes – a " government - coerced informational windfall " , he called it .
The third parties who actually do much of the airline industry 's data processing , the Global Distribution Systems and Computer Reservations Systems , were missing from the hearing . ®
Second , EEStor has completed the initial milestone of certifying purification , concentration , and stability of all of its key production chemicals — notably the attainment of 99.9994 % purity of its barium nitrate powder .
EEStor , the developer of a new high - power - density ceramic ultracapacitor ( the Energy Storage Unit — EESU ) , has broken a long public silence and announced reaching two key production milestones .
First , its automated production line has been proven to meet the requirements for precise chemical delivery , purity control , parameter control and stability .
The independent 3rd party chemical analysis was completed by Southwest Research Institute , Inc. located in San Antonio , Texas under contract with EEStor , Inc .
With these milestones completed , EEStor is now in the process of producing composition - modified barium titanate powders on its automated production line , and is moving toward completing its next major milestone of powder certification .
The company anticipates that the relative permittivity of the current powder will either meet and / or exceed 18,500 , the previous level achieved when EEStor produced prototype components using it engineering level processing equipment .
The EEStor ESU is projected to offer up to 10 x the energy density ( volumetric and gravimetric ) of lead - acid batteries at the same cost .
In addition , the ESU is projected to store up to 1.5 to 2.5 times the energy of Li-Ion batteries at 12 to 25 % of the cost .
According to the company ’s initial patent , the EESU is based on a high - permittivity composition - modified barium titanate ceramic powder .
This powder is double coated with the first coating being aluminum oxide and the second coating calcium magnesium aluminosilicate glass .
The EESU alternates multilayers of nickel electrodes and the high - permittivity powder .
The resulting parallel configuration of components has the capability to store electrical energy in the range of 52 kWh , according to the document , with weight for a unit of that capacity in the range of 336 pounds ( 152 kg ) .
According to EEStor , the EESU will not degrade due to being fully discharged or recharged , and also can be rapidly charged without damaging the material or reducing its life .
The cycle time to fully charge a 52 kWh EESU would be in the range of 4 to 6 minutes with sufficient cooling of the power cables and connections .
The first commercial application of the EESU is intended to be used in electric vehicles under a technology agreement with ZENN Motors Company .
( Earlier post . )
EEStor says that it remains on track to begin shipping production 15 kWh Electrical Energy Storage Units ( EESU ) to ZENN Motor Company in 2007 for use in their electric vehicles .
The production EESU for ZENN Motor Company is designed to function to specification in operating environments as severe as - 20° to +65° degrees Celsius , will weigh less than 100 pounds , and will have ability to be recharged in a matter of minutes .

Vodafone , the Central Office of Information and Virgin Media were just some of the large companies who withdrew their advertising campaigns from Facebook .
Why ?
Because their ads were being shown alongside the profile of a far - right , British political party , the BNP .
Even the British government stepped in , banning all advertising on Facebook .
" We were n't entirely prepared for it or we would have taken action to try to resolve it before it even got to the press , " said Owen Van Natta , Facebook 's chief operating officer .

TMZ has obtained an audio tape of O.J. Simpson 's confrontation with a sports memorabilia dealer that led to his arrest on felony robbery charges .
In it , you hear someone say , " You against the motherf * ****g wall . "
The tape was recorded by Thomas Riccio , who co-owns the auction house Universal Rarities .
Riccio met up with Simpson just before the confrontation at the Palace Station Casino on Thursday night .
We 're told Riccio was on hand to help Simpson prove certain memorabilia being auctioned by Alfred Beardsley was ill - gotten .
Riccio says he believed Simpson was going to confront Beardsley in the hotel room to give him an ultimatum -- either hand over the goods or Simpson would call the cops .
Riccio turned his Olympus digital voice recorder on before the group entered the room -- a group that included Simpson and four other men .
Almost immediately , Simpson went wild , hurling profanities at Beardsley and another memorabilia dealer , Bruce Fromong .
The confrontation lasts six minutes .
It is graphic and telling .
Simpson is clearly the ringleader .
Simpson repeatedly says , " Think you can steal my s**t and sell it ? "
To hear much more of the confrontation , watch TMZ TV tonight .
We 're told Riccio also recorded the police interview with Beardsley and Fromong .
Riccio also claims he has audio of Beardsley and Fromong conceding they did n't have a right to the memorabilia .
Riccio also says he has audio of Bruce Fromong saying he helped Simpson hide money in offshore accounts .
And there 's this : Riccio 's partner , Jeff Woolf , says Simpson left a message on Riccio 's cellphone trying to convince him that there was no gun involved in the robbery .
Under the system , the United States government buys the goods from American agribusinesses , ships them overseas , mostly on American - flagged carriers , and then donates them to the aid groups as an indirect form of financing .
The groups sell the products on the market in poor countries and use the money to finance their antipoverty programs .
It amounts to about $ 180 million a year .
Neither the Bush administration nor members of Congress are looking to undo the practice , which has gone on for more than a decade .
In fact , some of the nonprofit groups say it has worked well and are pressing for sharp increases in the amount of American food shipped for sale and distribution to support development programs .
The Christian charity World Vision and 14 other groups , which call themselves the Alliance for Food Aid , say that CARE is mistaken ; they say the system works because it keeps hard currency in poor countries , can help prevent food price spikes in those countries and does not hurt their farmers .
Not least , they argue , it also pays for their antipoverty programs .
But some people active in trying to help Africa ’s farmers are critical of the practice .
Former President Jimmy Carter , whose Atlanta - based Carter Center uses private money to help African farmers be more productive , said in an interview that it was a flawed system that had survived partly because the charities that received money from it defended it .
Agribusiness and shipping interest groups have tremendous political influence , but charitable groups are influential , too , Mr. Carter said , because “ they speak from the standpoint of angels . ”
Diagram of the system for tethering an astronaut to an asteroid using circumferential ropes .
Graphic / Ian Garrick - Bethell
Using a tether system devised by MIT researchers , astronauts could one day stroll across the surface of small asteroids , collecting samples and otherwise exploring these rocks in space without floating away .
The ability to visit asteroids could also be invaluable for testing equipment for a mission to Mars by humans .
Further , knowing how to tether an asteroid could be helpful if one needs to be towed away from a potential collision course with Earth , says Christopher Carr , a postdoctoral associate in MIT 's Department of Earth , Atmospheric and Planetary Sciences .
Carr and Ian Garrick - Bethell , a graduate student in the department , describe their system in an upcoming issue of the journal Acta Astronautica .
Walking on an asteroid is much more difficult than walking on a planet because asteroids have so little gravity .
An astronaut who tried to step onto one would likely fly off or hover above the surface .
Now Carr and Garrick - Bethell say that tying a lightweight rope completely around an asteroid could solve that problem .
Once the rope was in place , astronauts could attach themselves to it and maneuver or possibly even walk along the surface .
That would allow an in - depth exploration of the composition and history of asteroids , which could shed light on some of the big questions about our solar system , such as how the planets formed , said Carr .
" This is an innovative approach to a task nobody has spent much time thinking about , " said former astronaut Jeffrey Hoffman , an MIT professor of aeronautics and astronautics who sponsored the paper .
" NASA has taken a brief look at a human visit to a Near Earth Object , and it may be something we can do long before going to Mars .
Clever ideas will be necessary to allow people to do useful work near objects on which you cannot ' land , ' but only ' dock . ' "
An asteroid 's gravity varies depending on its density and size , which can range from a speck of dust to hundreds of kilometers .
On an asteroid that has a diameter larger than eight kilometers , an astronaut who jumps will probably come back to the surface , Carr said .
But if the asteroid is smaller than that , the astronaut may float away .
Even if an asteroid has enough gravity to keep an astronaut on the surface , it would be difficult to move around or collect samples .
" You could n't touch anything without sending yourself on a new trajectory or spinning yourself around , " said Garrick - Bethell , who is the first author of the Acta Astronautica paper .
Some people have suggested that astronauts could bolt themselves directly to the asteroid , but the granular material covering the asteroids could prevent this .
" It would be like trying to bolt yourself to a pile of gravel or sand , " Garrick - Bethell said .
The MIT researchers envision deploying their system with an astronaut or a remote - controlled rocket that unwinds a spool of rope while flying around the asteroid .
When the craft reaches the starting point , a loop is formed and tightened .
Astronauts could then be held to the asteroid using one or more ropes , permitting them to work on the surface .
One unknown is whether the rope would cut into the granular surface of an asteroid , hindering the system 's effectiveness .
But even if the rope does not allow astronauts to walk on the surface , it could at least give them something to hold onto as they pull themselves along the asteroid without floating away , said Carr .

TWO men will soon stand trial in Los Angeles in a murder case that does not involve white cops , a sportsman or a music producer .
As a result , the trial is unlikely to receive minute - by - minute coverage on cable TV .
Yet it will reveal as much about the edgy state of race relations in Los Angeles as the cases of Rodney King or O.J. Simpson .
Perhaps more so , since it involves the two groups between which there is most tension .
The accused men , Ernesto Alcarez and Jonathan Fajardo , are Hispanic .
The victim , 14 - year - old Cheryl Green — who , prosecutors say , died in a racially motivated attack — was black .
In the rarefied world of national politics ( and in America 's even more other - worldly universities ) blacks and Latinos tend to be lumped together in what Nicolás Vaca , a California lawyer , calls a “ presumed alliance ” .
Last month Barack Obama , a Democratic presidential candidate whose father was Kenyan , assured a Hispanic conference that such a bond existed .
Quoting Martin Luther King , he called the two groups “ brothers in the fight for equality ” .
On the streets of America 's cities , however , rather less lofty attitudes are apparent .
“ We 're being overrun , ” says Ted Hayes of Choose Black America , which has led anti-immigration marches in south - central Los Angeles .
“ The compañeros have taken all the housing .
If you do n't speak Spanish they turn you down for jobs .
Our children are jumped upon in the schools .
They are trying to drive us out . ”
Not , Mr Hayes emphasises , that he has anything against illegal immigrants personally , or against Mexicans who are in America legally .
Indeed , he says , in that useful old phrase , he is friendly with many of them .
Last year Pew , a pollster , found that one - third of blacks believe immigrants take jobs from Americans — more than any other group .
Yet in some ways their views were benign .
Blacks are less likely than whites or even Hispanics to believe that immigrants end up on welfare or commit crimes .
Latinos , on the other hand , appear to make no such concessions .
One survey of Durham , in North Carolina , found that 59 % of Latinos believed few or almost no blacks were hard - working , and a similar proportion reckoned few or almost none could be trusted .
Fewer than one in ten whites felt the same way .
Fifteen years ago such prejudices hardly existed in Durham , for the simple reason that there were hardly any Latinos .
Like much of the South , the city was biracial , with roughly equal numbers of blacks and whites .
Then came a building boom that drew workers from Mexico , many of them illegal .
By 2000 one in 12 residents of Durham was Latino — up from one in 80 a decade earlier .
By 2005 , one in eight was .
Mauricio Castro , a local activist , says the change has hit the city like a storm .
That storm has broken most heavily on the poorest parts of Durham , which happen to be black .
It is in largely black neighbourhoods that wooden shacks have been converted into call centres and carnicerias ( and it is , inevitably , often blacks who have robbed new arrivals of their weekly wages ) .
In this , Durham is typical .
By 2000 blacks in all ten of America 's biggest metropolitan areas were more mixed in with Hispanics than with whites .
In Los Angeles , former ghettos such as Watts are now biracial .
In poor areas , closeness often means conflict .
Los Angeles tallied more than 400 racial hate crimes last year — the most , as a proportion of all hate crimes , for at least a decade ( see chart ) .
Blacks fared worst : they comprise just 9 % of the population of Los Angeles County but were the victims of 59 % of all race - hate crimes .
Seven times out of ten , their persecutors were Latino .
Hispanics , who make up almost half the population , were victimised by blacks eight - tenths of the time .
These numbers greatly understate the violence .
They do not , for example , include the victims of a dozen interracial prison riots last year , which left two dead .
Gangs tend to be held responsible for such outrages , which is only partly fair .
The 204th Street gang , which is alleged to be behind the murder of Cheryl Green , has a reputation for attacking innocent blacks .
And gang members who have done time in California 's racially divided jails often develop especially sharp attitudes .
Yet gangs often express broadly held views , though in a violent way .
Besides , says Robin Toma , the head of the county 's human relations commission , gangs can affect the views of law - abiding folk .
When bullets start flying , a turf war can easily turn into a broader racial conflict .
The powerless majority
One reason blacks and Latinos have failed to form an alliance is philosophical .
The black civil - rights struggle , in the South at least , was mostly about asserting legal rights and demolishing barriers to voting by those who were , in theory , already enfranchised .
The Latino struggle is quite different .
Its goal is often the selective or non-enforcement of the law , particularly on immigration .
A common demand , for example , is for local police not to co-operate with federal immigration agents .
And , whereas blacks in the 1960s demanded power in proportion to their numbers as adult citizens , Hispanics want rather more .
Thanks partly to their youth and partly to the fact that many are not citizens , Latinos are not nearly as powerful as their numbers might suggest .
In Durham , where they are more than 13 % of the population , the Latino vote is negligible .
Even in historically Hispanic California they comprise more than a third of the population but cast only about a fifth of the votes .
The imbalance between numbers and power irks many Latinos .
And since they increasingly live in areas where political power is held by blacks , it often sharpens racial resentments .
In Compton , an independent city in south Los Angeles , Latinos are now 58 % of the population — and rising quickly .
Yet the mayor and all the members of the council are black .
“ They got here first , took over from the whites , and now it 's difficult for them to let go , ” says Alex Leon , a local pastor .
Sensing the future tsunami of Latino political power , Compton 's mayor has begun to cultivate Hispanics .
It may be too late .
In the next - door city of Lynwood , Hispanics were largely kept out of power until they became a majority .
After seizing control of the city council in 1997 they demolished the black political machine .
Such ethnic squabbles , which are almost inevitable in the zero- sum game of urban politics , can shape attitudes .
And they may help to explain one of the most striking features of the 2008 presidential race : the lack of Latino support for Mr Obama .
In June a Gallup poll showed that black Democrats were evenly divided between Mr Obama and Hillary Clinton , while whites gave Mrs Clinton a 16 - point lead .
Among Hispanics , however , the senator from New York led by a crushing 46 points — despite Mr Obama 's impeccably liberal line on immigration .
So far , rivalry between blacks and Hispanics has been a mostly working - class affair .
But Earl Ofari Hutchinson , who is writing a book on black - Latino relations , reckons that is likely to change .
Latinos are already so entrenched in some manual trades that it is hard to see how they can become more dominant .
In construction , for example , they account for a quarter of the national workforce and outnumber blacks almost five to one .
The next citadels to be stormed will be white - collar , largely female preserves such as public administration , education and health .
In Los Angeles the struggle for such jobs is well under way .
Every month the Los Angeles County Chicano Employees Association produces a newsletter illustrating the shortage of Latinos in the top ranks of yet another government office .
These reports nearly always show that blacks are over - represented .
In the department of children and family services , for example , some 36 % of managers are black , 29 % are white and just 20 % are Hispanic .
Yet the reports also show that , over time , Hispanics have steadily taken high - level jobs from both blacks and whites .
If blacks and Hispanics are not brothers in the fight for equality , nor are they locked in a titanic struggle like the one between blacks and whites in the mid-20th - century South .
Thankfully , there is far less violence .
And the fact that leaders on both sides talk of a common cause probably helps .
Yet one thing is the same : the group on top wants to stay there .
Indeed , power hard - won from whites may be even more difficult to give up .
As parts of Durham begin to resemble south - central Los Angeles , tensions between blacks and Latinos can only increase .
Ever wondered why sleeping on a problem works ?
It seems that as well as strengthening our memories , sleep also helps us to extract themes and rules from the masses of information we soak up during the day .
Bob Stickgold from Harvard Medical School and his colleagues found that people were better able to recall lists of related words after a night ’s sleep than after the same time spent awake during the day .
They also found it easier to recollect themes that the words had in common – forgetting around 25 per cent more themes after a waking rest .

Top Judiciary Democrat : Justice Department is being run in ' third world ' style Michael Roston
Published : Friday May 18 , 2007 Print This Email This Last year , Rep. Linda Sánchez took the stage of a DC comedy club and was awarded for being the " Funniest Celebrity in Washington . "
But in 2007 , the wisecracking Congresswoman from California is spending less time writing new jokes and more time sending subpoenas to Bush administration officials involved in the firing of US Attorneys by the Justice Department .
" Right now , the lack of confidence that people have in [ the Department of Justice ] , the lack of morale at the DOJ , the way it seems to be running seems so third world .
It 's third world in the way they 're doing it , " she told RAW STORY on Thursday .
The California Democrat spoke with RAW STORY in an exclusive interview at the Judiciary Committee in the House of Representatives , where she is the Chair of the Subcommittee on Commercial and Administrative Law .
In that position , Rep. Sánchez is initiating many of the major moves on behalf of the full committee in pressing the investigation into the US Attorney firings .
At 38 , the Congresswoman is one of the youngest members of Congress to be helping to head up an investigation as weighty as the probe of the firing of eight US Attorneys by the Bush administration .
She is also one of the only women to be sitting in such a position .
" In a word , no , " she laughed , when asked if she thought she'd be spending her third term in Congress engaged in this kind of investigation .
She added , " When I became the chair of the [ Commercial and Administrative Law ] subcommittee , it was sort of this sleepy little committee .
Nobody really thought it'd have sexy issues coming through it and , bam , the biggest issue this Congress so far , it 's smack dab in the middle of the controversy . "
The Congresswoman , who says on her website that she is the first woman of Latin descent to serve on the Judiciary Committee , worried that it would be hard to cure the " political virus " she said had " infected the Department of Justice . "
" Really , the big change will come when the Bush administration is no longer in power , " she said .
Still , she said it was important to press on with the investigation .
" There are some ways that I think that we can legitimately address some of the concerns that we have seen come up .
And part of that will be also continuing the investigation and enforcing any laws that may have been broken against the people that were involved . " she argued .
Rep. Sánchez was also adamant that it was time for Attorney General Alberto Gonzales to step down from office .
" The guy should be fired , " she said .
" I just think it 's ridiculous that somebody who heads up one of the most powerful departments in the United States , one of the cornerstones of our democracy , which is the enforcement of the laws of this country , can't answer simple questions about who is running what or making decisions .
It 's just incompetent . "
The full transcript of the interview can be read below .
# RAW STORY : Is dealing with the US Attorneys controversy how you expected to be spending the 110th Congress ?
Rep. Linda Sánchez : [ Laughter ]
In a word , no .
When I became the chair of the [ Commercial and Administrative Law ] subcommittee , it was sort of this sleepy little committee .
Nobody really thought it'd have sexy issues coming through it and , bam , the biggest issue this Congress so far , it 's smack dab in the middle of the controversy .
We have dedicated quite a bit of time and attention and resources to the investigation , and that 's going to be ongoing , and it's not exactly how I envisioned the CAL subcommittee would be spending its time .
RAW STORY : So how does it feel ?
From my review it seems like you 're one of the only women , and one of the youngest Members of Congress to be helping to lead an investigation of this scope , so what 's that been like so far ?
Rep. Sánchez :
It was , obviously because being a chairman was new , a steep learning curve at the beginning .
I think I found my footing very quickly with help from my colleagues that serve on that subcommittee , and John Conyers has been very supportive and backed me up on a lot of things that we wanted to do , including issuing the subpoenas to the US Attorneys to come testify .
I 've had a lot of support from colleagues and I think I 'm actually doing a pretty good job of feeling my way around this issue , which is a substantial and weighty issue .
I want to handle it in a way that 's fair , but also thorough .
That 's sort of the balance that I 'm trying to strike , hey , we want the investigation to go forward , and we need the information that we need , we need to be firm on getting the information that we need , but we want to be fair as well .
So it 's sort of a balancing act .
RAW STORY :
What 's the steepest thing you 've had to learn so far ?
Rep. Sánchez :
That 's a good question .
I guess the biggest thing that we try to do now , and this is something I have n't given a lot of thought to , is trying think two to three steps ahead about what the next move is .
It 's sort of like chess in that respect .
You know , you have to be aware every time you take a step forward , you have to have alternate paths for achieving your ultimate goal .
You have to be thinking two or three steps ahead of each move .
RAW STORY : The Washington Post today says that we 're up to 26 Attorneys that they wanted to toss out on their behinds .
What do you think is the implication of that news coming out ?
Rep. Sánchez :
It 's really interesting because although they may have at some point considered 26 , the fact of the matter is that the investigation we 're looking at is the particular 8 that were sent packing , and we still have not been able to get the information from anybody , current or former members of the DOJ that should have been in on this discussion about performance and who was performing or not .
We still have n't been able to figure out who made the list , how names got added to the list , why names got added to the list , nobody has taken responsibility for that .
That is the fundamental question at the heart of this investigation .
To me , it 's interesting that there 's a broader universe .
And I think the implications are that various factors obviously came into play in recommending certain people for the chopping block .
But what were the motivations for the people that actually got sent packing ?
That 's what I want to know .
RAW STORY :
In terms of how this list was put together , you heard from the Attorney General one day , and then the next day he had this press conference where he said it 's pretty much all Mr. McNulty , the Deputy Attorney General .
Do you think that 's credible ?
Rep. Sánchez : I do n't , and l'm going to give an example .
I think several of the US Attorneys , the rationale was that they were poor managers of their departments , they delegated too much authority , were n't involved in the day - to - day .
[ We pause while the Congresswoman checks on the progress of a vote on the House floor . ]
So Gonzales says , " Well I take responsibility for the list . "
He can't say who made the list or why .
He sort of said that it was input from different people .
He 's delegating hiring and firing authority to young , inexperienced staff members and if that does n't show a lack of ability to manage the DOJ and oversee the inner workings of the DOJ , that tells me that the guy should be fired .
I reserved judgment on that as long as I could because I wanted to hear the evidence and I wanted to be able to make up my own mind .
But if that was the rationale for firing some of these US Attorneys , then apply the same rationale to Gonzales , and he should go .
I just think it 's ridiculous that somebody who heads up one of the most powerful departments in the United States , one of the cornerstones of our democracy , which is the enforcement of the laws of this country , can't answer simple questions about who is running what or making decisions .
It 's just incompetent .
RAW STORY :
That 's interesting because you 've made this statement that you think there 's not a lot of competence there .
And it seems like in the Senate , a lot of the Republicans on that Judiciary Committee said let 's get out of here , it 's time to move on and get a new Attorney General ...
Rep. Sánchez :
And I give them a lot of credit .
The Republican Senators who recognize that the department basically does n't have effective leadership , that partisan politics has been injected in many different levels of that , that it 's sort of been twisted as a way to help one party gain elections , and that there needs to be accountability , I give them credit for standing up and saying if there 's one department in this country that should not be politicized , it 's the Department of Justice .
Kudos to them for recognizing that our system of justice should be above that .
By the same token , House Republicans show none of that .
And I 'm sort of amazed and befuddled as to why they would n't want to stand up and say , hey , our system of enforcing the laws needs to be above reproach .
Because right now , the lack of confidence that people have in the DOJ , the lack of morale at the DOJ , the way it seems to be running seems so third world .
It 's third world in the way there doing it .
And it does n't seem to trouble my colleagues on this side of the aisle on the House side .
RAW STORY :
Why do you think that is ?
Do you think they 've been whipped into political line ?
Rep. Sánchez : I do n't know .
They seem to be saying there 's no evidence of wrongdoing because you have n't caught us yet .
My response is , we 're still doing the investigation , the evidence that emerges seem to be more and more damaging .
Every day there 's more and more revelations .
And , " Oh , there 's no credible evidence . "
I think the most compelling evidence was when the US Attorneys themselves testified , as to receiving political phone calls pressuring them on their investigations .
That to me is extremely troubling , and if it's not troubling to my Republican counterparts here , I think there 's something seriously wrong with the way they 're looking at this whole issue .
RAW STORY : How are your constituents reacting to this ?
I know how this sounds in Washington and other places that follow inside politics very closely , but way out in California , far away from a lot of this ...
Rep. Sánchez :
Well , I think the nuances or the day - to - day happenings are very much inside the beltway .
But people back in my district get that they do n't want to be , you do n't want somebody who has the full weight of prosecutorial discretion in this country being able to target people based on their political ideology or affiliation .
They get that that 's really really bad , and they do n't want any part of it .
They want to see that end .
They do n't want to feel like one party is manipulating our government to help one party stay in power , or to help them win elections .
They 're very much troubled by the voter fraud allegations , the fact they seem to have wanted to go in a direction despite some career people saying these were not credible cases , some US Attorneys saying I can't bring cases , there 's no evidence .
And then , disregarding that , replacing people and pushing forward on these allegations of voter fraud where there was not criminal , or it was de minimis and not a big problem .
That was a message to create the cynicism in the electorate , I think , to suppress voting .
There 's very clear rules about not announcing indictments or cases just prior to elections and they disregard that and went ahead anyway .
RAW STORY :
Are they connecting this , are they asking questions about the US Attorney in your district ?
Rep. Sánchez : Not so much .
The Yang stuff , there are some things that need to be scrutinized in terms of her departure and then going to work of course for the firm that is representing Mr. Lewis in the investigation they have ongoing .
But I think overall , people have a sense of unease that the department is being mismanaged and that it 's being politicized , this political virus has infected the DOJ , and that 's not good .
RAW STORY : Some people are saying we 're at the point that the Justice Department can't really function any more .
What changes do you think the Justice Department is going to need to make going forward ?
Is this something where we 're just going to have to run the clock down on the Bush administration , or is it something that can be fixed now ?
Rep. Sánchez : I think there are some legislative steps that we can take .
There are a number of fixes that we have attempted with respect to the provision that was inserted in the PATRIOT Act for unconfirmed US Attorneys .
There 's also some legislation that was addressed , that US Attorneys being selected from the districts in which they will represent , there 's a geographic requirement .
There are some legislative fixes that we can do .
But really , the big change will come when the Bush administration is no longer in power .
But there are some ways that I think that we can legitimately address some of the concerns that we have seen come up .
And part of that will be also continuing the investigation and enforcing any laws that may have been broken against the people that were involved .

RELEASE : 07-178
NASA and Internet Archive Team to Digitize Space Imagery
WASHINGTON - NASA and Internet Archive of San Francisco are partnering to scan , archive and manage the agency 's vast collection of photographs , historic film and video .
The imagery will be available through the Internet and free to the public , historians , scholars , students , and researchers .
Currently , NASA has more than 20 major imagery collections online .
With this partnership , those collections will be made available through a single , searchable " one-stop - shop " archive of NASA imagery .
" Making NASA 's important scientific and space exploration imagery available and easily accessible online to all is a service of tremendous value to America , and we 're pleased to partner with the experts at Internet Archive to accomplish this effort , " said Robert Hopkins , chief of strategic communications at NASA Headquarters , Washington .
NASA selected Internet Archive , a nonprofit organization , as a partner for digitizing and distributing agency imagery through a competitive process .
The two organizations are teaming through a non-exclusive Space Act agreement to help NASA consolidate and digitize its imagery archives using no NASA funds .
"
We 're dedicated to making all human knowledge available in the digital realm , " said Brewster Kahle , digital librarian and founder of Internet Archive .
" The educational value of the images NASA has collected during the course of its five decades of scientific discovery is unprecedented .
Digitizing NASA 's imagery is a big step in Internet Archive 's ongoing efforts to digitize a vast spectrum of content and make it freely accessible to the public in an easily searched online destination .
" Under the terms of this five - year agreement , Internet Archive will digitize , host and manage still , moving and computer - generated imagery produced by NASA .
In the first year , Internet Archive will consolidate NASA 's major imagery collections .
In the second year , digital imagery will be added to the archive .
In the third year , NASA and Internet Archive will identify analog imagery to be digitized and added to this online collection .
In addition , Internet Archive will work with NASA to create a system through which new imagery will be captured , catalogued and included in the online archive automatically .
To open this wealth of knowledge to people worldwide , Internet Archive will provide free public access to the online imagery , including downloads and search tools .
The imagery archive also may include other historically significant material such as audio files , printed documents and computer presentations .

ED #63 : Intel BoneTrail Release Imminent !
The Intel DX38BT " BoneTrail " motherboard had been delayed to a Q4 launch from its original scheduled launch in Q3 due to technical issues .
It even missed the planned October 10 launch .
But now , our sources say that its release is imminent .
The BoneTrail will finally see the light of day .
For those who are wondering what the fuss is all about , the BoneTrail is armed with the new Intel X38 Express chipset will finally allow users to run two PCI Express 2.0 graphics cards at full X16 speeds , without resorting to an NVIDIA or ATI motherboard .
However , enthusiasts who have been waiting for this motherboard may want to wait a little longer because Intel will be launching their X48 Express chipset and the " BoneTrail 2 " motherboard within 10 weeks of the BoneTrail 's launch !
The Intel X48 Express chipset and the Intel BoneTrail 2 motherboard will be the first Intel chipset and motherboard to officially support the 1600 MHz FSB .
So , it might not be a good idea to buy the BoneTrail when the BoneTrail 2 is coming so soon after .

Washington Monthly put its
October cover story online today , and it is fantastic .
( And not just because I ’m quoted . )
I ’ll comment on it and excerpt it briefly , but really , go read the article .
Back ?
Okay .
The author , Andrew Tilghman , is a former reporter for Stars and Stripes , an independent military - focused newspaper , and spent nine months in Iraq in 2005 and 2006 .
It was clear to me when we spoke that he had an excellent basis of knowledge about the conflict , and he asked all the right questions to get at the specifics of the topic .
And he got fascinating answers from a variety of sources , which he weaved into a solid and damning assessment of the hyping of al Qaeda by military and administration leaders for political and / or careerism aims .
To wit :
With disproportionate resources dedicated to tracking AQI , the search has become a self - reinforcing loop .
The Army has a Special Operations task force solely dedicated to tracking al - Qaeda in Iraq .
The Defense Intelligence Agency tracks AQI through its Iraq office and its counterterrorism office .
The result is more information culled , more PowerPoint slides created , and , ultimately , more attention drawn to AQI , which amplifies its significance . . .
[ T ]he bar for labeling an attack the work of al - Qaeda can be very low .
The fact that a detainee possesses al - Qaeda pamphlets or a laptop computer with cached jihadist Web sites , for example , is at times enough for analysts to link a detainee to al - Qaeda .
“ Sometimes it ’s as simple as an anonymous tip that al - Qaeda is active in a certain village , so they will go out on an operation and whoever they roll up , we call them al - Qaeda , ” says Rossmiller .
“ People can get labeled al - Qaeda anywhere along in the chain of events , and it ’s really hard to unlabel them . ”
Even when the military backs off explicit statements that AQI is responsible , as with the Tal Afar truck bombings , the perception that an attack is the work of al - Qaeda is rarely corrected .
The author actually talked to regional and intelligence experts — not to be confused with “ political ” or “ military ” commentators — including names you probably recognize , like Juan Cole , Pat Lang , and Larry Johnson , as well as some you wo n’t but should , like Malcolm Nance , a twenty - year intelligence veteran and Arabic speaker .
Nance is also the author of The Terrorists of Iraq , which is easily the best book written on the Iraq insurgency and a must - read for anybody seriously interested in the issue .
The size and impact of al Qaeda in Iraq is hugely overblown by the media , elected figures , and military officials .
Further , and perhaps even more importantly , its purported strength is essentially the only security - related reason claimed by the administration for maintaining our occupation .
Political manipulation by government and military leaders — combined with a lack of knowledge of situational specifics on the part of commentators and the public — results in a profound general misunderstanding of the facts on the ground .
Incidentally , according to General Petraeus the surge is aimed at al Qaeda , a group about which he is severely deluded .
It ’s all such a debacle .
The rise of news aggregator websites like Digg and Reddit has become a surprisingly helpful asset to online activism for drug policy reform .
These sites allow participants to submit links with their own description , at which point other users vote to determine which stories make it to the coveted main page .
Digg , for example , directs so much traffic from its front page that users have coined the term " digg effect " to describe the inevitable server crash that occurs when Digg links a site with insufficient bandwidth .
StoptheDrugWar.org first experienced " the digg effect " in August with the " Marijuana Dealers Offer Schwarzenegger One Billion Dollars " story .
Once linked at Digg , the blog post and accompanying press release generated over 100,000 hits , crashing our server repeatedly for over 12 straight hours .
It was a bittersweet triumph since few visitors were actually able to view the content due to website malfunctions ( and we could n't receive donations ! ) .
Nonetheless , the message about marijuana policy reform was clearly resonating with a massive new audience .
Between Digg and Reddit , we 've now had several stories take off , pulling in unusually high traffic and pushing the drug policy debate beyond the self - selected audience of seasoned reform activists .
The rising tide has lifted other boats as well , generating massive attention to Pete Guither 's " Why is Marijuana Illegal ? " and SSDP 's " End the Drug War Draft ! "
Just last week , a front page Digg hit left Mitt Romney 's presidential campaign reeling when video of his rude treatment of a medical marijuana patient went viral .
Perhaps it 's not so surprising that the new era of user - generated content and internet video would favor ideas that have for too long been relegated to the fringe by the mainstream press .
We 're witnessing the burial of the antiquated notion that only anti-drug scare stories will sell , and it 's long overdue to say the least .
The stigma of the " legalization " label , along with the brute force of the law itself , has silenced so many would - be drug war critics , yet the anonymous and democratized realm of online political debate now rages without regard to the philosophical prejudices of the past .
Of course , winning the vote in an artificial internet democracy is n't going to end the war on drugs .
But it certainly proves the demand for balance in the drug war debate .
As the mainstream media continues to struggle with even the most basic realities about drugs and the terrible war on their users , the truth has to find a home somewhere .
Update :
To my great surprise , this post has made it to the front page of Digg .
Imagine that .
You can vote for it here .
What fun .
Update II : There 's 300 + comments on this post over at Digg .
I have n't finished reading them , but here 's my favorite so far :
Look , from someone who has never smoked anything in their life , I 'm fine with legalization , but please do n't act like assholes with it like everyone in my damn school does .
All they do is brag about it , and its funny because I tell my friends I 'd do it if it was legal and they say they would stop doing it if it was .
The " stoner " stereotype is a complete product of the drug 's illegality , it 's true .
If we 're sick of rebellious potheads , let us take the wind out of their sails by changing the one law they have the nerve to break , thereby turning them into law - abiding dorks .
A couple of times this week I have seen great stories get buried on Digg .
It happens and it sucks .
The thing is we all tend to think our own story is worthy of getting votes .
But in many cases I think the people who complain about getting buried the most secretly know they were trying to game the system .
If you have to ask every person online you know for a vote that is probably a good sign that you are pushing quite hard .
Digg is actually a lot fairer than people might believe , lousy stories get the same treatment but the authors still complain about the bury - brigade or auto - bury or whatever .
Ask yourself this ; if you had never seen the article before , would you voluntarily vote for it ?
If the answer to that question is a firm “ no ” then why should anyone else Digg it , stumble it or del.icio.us it ?
Here is the secret to Social Media success …
… Social Media is a popularity contest .
It ’s a lot like high school really .
Being nice is great , but being popular and having lots of friends is far more important .
I know some of you will disagree with me but I see “ evidence ” , or what I regard as evidence , might be just a misfiring of neurons , all the time .
To even get a story seen you need votes .
Hardly anyone looks in the dark and hidden corners of social media sites where new and unnoticed stories live .
The popular pages get all the attention , followed by “ about to become popular with a little push ” .
Who hangs out with the “ brand new and unlikely to become popular unless a miracle happens ” pages ?
So you need a bunch of friends to give you a kick start .
The more the better .
That ’s ok because Digg and such give you tools to allow you to send a story to your friends to get them to vote on it .
Even better if some of your friends are really popular and successful .
If you hang out with the cool crowd your stuff will get far more attention .
So through your friends and adoring fans you get your stuff noticed .
Most of the work is done .
In fact that can be all that is required .
Sometimes though people see through the charade and point out that the Emperor has no clothes and buries it .
The thing is we really should n’t be at all surprised when that happens if the article really does n’t have any substance .
Unfortunately , just like high school , there is a ruling class clique with their own likes , dislikes and prejudices .
Being popular is not enough if you break the unwritten rules .
When you are looking to use Social Media , hang out and observe .
Look at what gets popular , what hangs around long term and what gets to the front page then disappears just as fast .
Most people will tell you what works on Digg tends to have some relationship with Apple , Linux , Ron Paul , etc .
Things that probably wo n’t do well are anything that seems to be third hand ( submit the original not a livejournal writeup of a copy and pasted story ) , overly commercial or overly self promotional .
Basically , unlike high school , it is the young male geeks who rule the roost .
Remember the AV club ?
Yup , they control what gets to the front page , and they have a lifetime of bitterness to get out of their system .
The same old advice applies here as much as anyone else ; consider the audience first over what you want .
What will they enjoy and get value from ?
How best to deliver it ?
What do you need to do to appeal ?
If getting on Digg is so important to you and it means sexing up your story and making Star Wars references , so be it .
Personally , I am still happy when I get the ego boost from a front page digg story but now I focus on my actual audience rather than trying to please everyone .
Probably why I was never that popular in school 😉
Each Medicare plan has a list of preferred drugs , known as a formulary .
Under federal law , patients can request coverage of other drugs that may be medically necessary .
But many insurers do not have procedures to handle such requests , auditors said .
John H. Wells , the compliance officer at Bravo Health , defended the company ’s record , but he said : “ The appeals and grievance process is very complex .
It is very difficult for any plan to be fully compliant .
In many cases , the government ’s guidance is unclear , so it ’s impossible for a business to know what to do . ”
These findings were typical of the deficiencies described in Medicare audit reports :
¶ UnitedHealth , which serves more than six million Medicare beneficiaries , did not have an “ effective program ” to supervise its marketing representatives , agents and brokers .
In some cases , United improperly denied claims without giving any explanation to beneficiaries .
Peter L. Ashkenaz , a company spokesman , said , “ We terminated a few agents and brokers for misrepresenting our products . ”
¶ WellPoint , one of the nation ’s largest insurers , had “ a backlog of approximately 354,000 claims ” at certain Medicare plans offered through its UniCare subsidiary .
The company ’s call center took an average of 27 minutes to answer phone calls from its members and 16 minutes to answer calls from health care providers .
More than half the callers hung up before speaking to a company representative .
Karen Brown , a spokeswoman for WellPoint , had no immediate comment .
¶ In March , Sierra Health Services ended drug coverage for more than 2,300 Medicare beneficiaries with H.I.V./ AIDS , saying they had not paid their premiums .
In many cases , the premiums had been paid , and beneficiaries had canceled checks to prove it .
Sierra initially refused to reinstate them , but eventually agreed to do so after repeated requests from federal officials .
Peter O’Neill , a vice president of Sierra , said this particular drug plan , which attracted people with very high drug costs , would not be offered in 2008 .
¶ Humana , which covers more than 4.5 million people on Medicare , promised to investigate every complaint about its marketing practices , but it received so many complaints that it could not keep up .
Many beneficiaries said they had received incorrect information from Humana agents .
Medicare officials said some agents had not been adequately trained or supervised .
Thomas T. Noland Jr. , a senior vice president of Humana , said the company had taken “ corrective action to improve the situation . ”
¶ Humana did not always tell beneficiaries about changes in its list of covered drugs .
In some cases , Humana did not explain its reasons for denying claims and did not inform beneficiaries of their appeal rights .

I am presently researching a biography on David Rockefeller .
An overview of the book will soon be sent to a New York City agent for circulation among all the major publishing houses .
Among the topics that will be covered is the role of British USA Round Table member Rep. Wayne Hays ( Demo - Ohio ) in " killing " the Reece Committee investigation of tax - exempt foundations , the disappearance of the research on the Rockefeller - funded Kinsey studies and the " disposal " threats made to Reece Investigator Norman Dodd by a lobbyist for the Anti-Defamation League ( ADL ) .
In 1986 , Hoover scholar Antony C. Sutton published his " magnum opus " - AMERICA'S SECRET ESTABLISHMENT : AN INTRODUCTION TO THE ORDER OF SKULL AND BONES .
In his preface Sutton said he had been given an eight - inch batch of documents which was " nothing less than the membership lists of an American secret society .
Glancing through the sheets it was more than obvious -- this was no ordinary group .
The names spelled Power with a capital P. "
Throughout the book Sutton hinted at even deeper revelations he would make in books to come .
However , the full list never was published by Sutton .
In making inquiries of those who knew Sutton , I was told that he had become exiled in his own country .
For months I searched the Web looking for a list of the members of Skull and Bones .
At long last , a notebook was given to me which required the use of a magnifying glass to make out the names .
So , the following semi-final list is about 97 % accurate .
It opens the door to the Bones realm at a time that one of their own is now hitting the campaign trail for the Republican presidential nomination .
For about the past ten years I have been studying secret elite groups .
The average person has almost no knowledge of them and there are very few sources of information .
These secret groups include the Bilderbergers , the Council on Foreign Relations , The Knights of the Garter , The Knights of Malta , The 33rd Degree Masons , the Rhodes Scholars , The Skull and Bones and the Trilateral Commission .
What is needed is a historical roster of the membership of each of these groups .
The list that follows is only the first of an upcoming series of historic exposes of these secret societies .
If you have any biographical information on any of these individuals , your sharing will be appreciated and reciprocated .
Any suggestions or corrections appreciated .

By Eric Samuelson , J.D. janeric@concentric.net I am presently researching a biography on David Rockefeller .
An overview of the book will soon be sent to a New York City agent for circulation among all the major publishing houses .
Among the topics that will be covered is the role of British USA Round Table member Rep. Wayne Hays ( Demo - Ohio ) in " killing " the Reece Committee investigation of tax - exempt foundations , the disappearance of the research on the Rockefeller - funded Kinsey studies and the " disposal " threats made to Reece Investigator Norman Dodd by a lobbyist for the Anti-Defamation League ( ADL ) .
In 1986 , Hoover scholar Antony C. Sutton published his " magnum opus " - AMERICA'S SECRET ESTABLISHMENT : AN INTRODUCTION TO THE ORDER OF SKULL AND BONES .
In his preface Sutton said he had been given an eight - inch batch of documents which was " nothing less than the membership lists of an American secret society .
Glancing through the sheets it was more than obvious -- this was no ordinary group .
The names spelled Power with a capital P. "
Throughout the book Sutton hinted at even deeper revelations he would make in books to come .
However , the full list never was published by Sutton .
In making inquiries of those who knew Sutton , I was told that he had become exiled in his own country .
For months I searched the Web looking for a list of the members of Skull and Bones .
At long last , a notebook was given to me which required the use of a magnifying glass to make out the names .
So , the following semi-final list is about 97 % accurate .
It opens the door to the Bones realm at a time that one of their own is now hitting the campaign trail for the Republican presidential nomination .
For about the past ten years I have been studying secret elite groups .
The average person has almost no knowledge of them and there are very few sources of information .
These secret groups include the Bilderbergers , the Council on Foreign Relations , The Knights of the Garter , The Knights of Malta , The 33rd Degree Masons , the Rhodes Scholars , The Skull and Bones and the Trilateral Commission .
What is needed is a historical roster of the membership of each of these groups .
The list that follows is only the first of an upcoming series of historic exposes of these secret societies .
If you have any biographical information on any of these individuals , your sharing will be appreciated and reciprocated .
Any suggestions or corrections appreciated .

People should wipe the hard drive before they give away their old PC Bank account details belonging to thousands of Britons are being sold in West Africa for less than £ 20 each , the BBC's Real Story programme has found .
It discovered that fraudsters in Nigeria were able to find internet banking data stored on recycled PCs sent from the UK to Africa .
The information can be found on a PC's hard disk , which is easy to access if the drive is not wiped before sending .
Anti-fraud expert Owen Roberts said simply deleting files was not enough .
It is surprising how easy it is to obtain documents people leave on their computers
Owen Roberts , CPP Group
Beating Nigeria 's scammers
Users should instead use a programme to wipe their hard drive before they sell or give away their PC , a process which over - writes what is already contained on the drive .
Alternatively , people should remove their hard drives before they give away their computers , he said .
' Surprisingly easy ' " It is surprising how easy it is to obtain documents people leave on their computers , " said Mr Roberts , who is head of identity fraud at CPP Group .
SAFE PC RECYCLING
If possible , remove hard drives from PCs before recycling Use commercial erasing software , Examples include McAfee QuickClean , Acronis Drive Cleanser or ISafeguard Freeware Sign - up for a recycling service run by your PC manufacturer Some hard drive manufacturers also offer separate recycling programs
BBC Webwise - Deleting hard drives Real Story found that second - hand computers from all over the developed world could be found in virtually every PC market in Nigeria 's commercial capital of Lagos .
It said that while there was a genuine market for second - hand PCs in West Africa , identity fraud was a real problem .
Many of the PCs it found on sale in Lagos had come from UK council recycling points .
People are still being urged to give away their old PCs , but only after they have wiped the hard drive - not just to remove any bank details but also other personal information such as home addresses .
The Information Commissioner 's Office , the UK government 's regulatory office dealing with data protection , said companies had a legal requirement to delete people 's personal information from their computers when it was no longer needed .
" It is essential that companies have appropriate procedures in place to ensure that personal records on computer hard drives are rendered unrecoverable when they dispose of computer equipment , " said Assistant Commissioner Phil Jones .
" Under the Data Protection Act companies have a duty to store personal information securely and delete it when it is no longer required . "
Real Story 's investigation into the risk of identity theft from old PCs is broadcast on BBC 1 at 19:30 on Monday , 14 August .
