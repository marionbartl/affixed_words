I had to bribe them .
What other choice did I have ?
My lecture at Princeton had just ended with smiles and enthusiastic questions .
At the same time , I knew that most students would go out and promptly do the opposite of what I preached .
Most of them would be putting in 80 - hour weeks as high - paid coffee fetchers unless I showed that the principles from class could actually be applied .
Hence the challenge .
I was offering a round - trip ticket anywhere in the world to anyone who could complete an undefined “ challenge ” in the most impressive fashion possible .
Results plus style .
I told them to meet me after class if interested , and here they were , nearly 20 out of 60 students .
The task was designed to test their comfort zones while forcing them to use some of the tactics I teach .
It was simplicity itself : contact three seemingly impossible - to - reach people — J Lo. , Warren Buffett , Bill Clinton , J.D. Salinger , I do n’t care — and get at least one to reply to three questions …
Of 20 students , all frothing at the mouth to win a free spin across the globe , how many completed it ?
Exactly … none .
Not a one .
There were many excuses : “ It ’s not that easy to get someone to … ” , “ I have a big paper due , and … , ” “ I would love to , but there ’s no way I can … ”
There was but one real reason , however , repeated over and over again in different words : it was a difficult challenge , perhaps impossible , and the other students would out - do them .
Since all of them overestimated the competition , no one even showed up .
According to the default - win rules I had set , if someone had sent me no more than an illegible one - paragraph response , I would have been obligated to give them the prize .
This result both fascinated and depressed me .
The following year , the outcome was quite different .
I told this cautionary tale and six out of 17 finished the challenge in less than 48 hours .
Was the second class better ?
No .
In fact , there were more capable students in the first class , but they did nothing .
Firepower up the wazoo and no trigger finger .
The second group just embraced what I told them before they started , which was …
Doing the Unrealistic is Easier Than Doing the Realistic
From contacting billionaires [ here ’s how one reader did it ] to rubbing elbows with celebrities — the second group of students did both — it ’s as easy as believing it can be done .
It ’s lonely at the top .
99 % of the world is convinced they are incapable of achieving great things , so they aim for the mediocre middle - ground .
The level of competition is thus fiercest for “ realistic ” goals , paradoxically making them the most time - and energy - consuming .
It is easier to raise $ 10,000,000 than it is $ 1,000,000 .
It is easier to pick up the one perfect 10 in the bar than the five 8s .
If you are insecure , guess what ?
The rest of the world is too .
Do not overestimate the competition and underestimate yourself .
You are better than you think .
Unreasonable and unrealistic goals are easier to achieve for yet another reason .
Having an unusually large goal is an adrenaline infusion that provides the endurance to overcome the inevitable trials and tribulations that go along with any goal .
Realistic goals , goals restricted to the average ambition level , are uninspiring and will only fuel you through the first or second problem , at which point you throw in the towel .
If the potential payoff is mediocre or average , so is your effort .
I ’ll run through walls to get a catamaran trip through the Greek islands , but I might not change my brand of cereal for a weekend trip through Columbus , Ohio .
If I choose the latter because it is “ realistic , ” I wo n’t have the enthusiasm to jump even the smallest hurdle to accomplish it .
With beautiful , crystal - clear Greek waters and delicious wine on the brain , I ’m prepared to do battle for a dream that is worth dreaming .
Even though their difficulty of achievement on a scale of 1 - 10 appears to be a 2 and a 10 respectively , Columbus is more likely to fall through .
The fishing is best where the fewest go , and the collective insecurity of the world makes it easy for people to hit homeruns while everyone else is aiming for base hits .
There is just less competition for bigger goals .

Case Study : The Eco-Bounty Hunter Competition
Two months ago , I issued a challenge to all readers of this blog and others with the help of Treehugger and Gizmodo :
Get a committal response from CEOs [ of carriers or manufacturers ] on why they would or would n’t test a [ cell phone recycling ] solution such as this in 2008 / 2009 .
“ We ’ll take this under review , ” “ we ’re constantly seeking eco- friendly options , ” and other vacuous corporate blow - offs do n’t cut it .
Get the CEO or someone of that level to respond with his or her verdict on the solution and whether or not they ’ll test it and when .
If there are problems they see , ask them to name them .
The grand prize electric Tres Terra motorcycle / bicycle was claimed by Adrian Reif , and the runner - up Strida folding bicycle was claimed by Christian Paredes .
The Strida
Here ’s the interesting part : neither of them completed the challenge .
Both attempted , and based on that effort and their reporting of results ( or lack thereof ) , they were entitled to the prizes .
Showing up was more than just half the battle — it was the single deciding factor .
Does this mean that the challenge was ineffective ?
Not at all .
Media mentions of the challenge were enough to expedite internal review of recycling proposals at several major manufacturers , whose project leads contacted me via e-mail from the original post .
Several million people were exposed to the damages of cell phone disposal and alternative options in the comments of more than 50 related posts , including two on Technorati top - 20 blogs .
The objective was to elicit progress towards an improved solution , not to get dozens of responses from CEOs .
Here ’s how it works :
The former as the end , the latter was the means to produce a competition that would result in dozens of blog mentions on high - traffic sites and lead to offline media , which would then reach executives at the target companies via corporate communications departments who watch LexisNexis in addition to Google Alerts .
It only takes a few to show up to make a difference .
Strive to be one of the few .
It ’s easier than it looks .

NEW YORK ( CNNMoney.com ) --
The housing finance crisis and spiraling energy costs will remain a drag on the U.S. economy for the rest of the year , Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke told lawmakers in a gloomy presentation about the economic outlook .
" The economy continues to face numerous difficulties , including ongoing strains in financial markets , declining house prices , a softening labor market , and rising prices of oil , food , and some other commodities , " Bernanke told the Senate Banking Committee early Tuesday .
The nation 's top central banker warned " many financial markets and institutions remain under considerable stress , in part because the outlook for the economy , and thus for credit quality , remains uncertain . "
The Senate panel was meeting to hear from Bernanke about the economy and to consider the crisis at mortgage finance giants Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac , as well as growing fears about bank failures .
Shares of Fannie and Freddie on Tuesday continued the recent slide that has prompted the Treasury Department and Fed to step in and offer support .
Shares of Fannie ( FNM , Fortune 500 ) plunged 27 % on Tuesday , leaving them 64 % lower this month .
Freddie ( FRE , Fortune 500 ) shares tumbled 26 % , leaving them down 68 % in July .
Both have lost more than 80 % of their value since the start of the year .
Bernanke : " Financial headwinds '
Bernanke said the financial sector 's problems are not the only problems facing the economy .
" The financial headwinds on spending and economic activity have been compounded by rapid increases in the prices of energy and other commodities , " he warned .
The combination of rising commodity prices and tighter credit " has sapped household purchasing power even as they have boosted inflation , " Bernanke said .
Bernanke added that spending has held up better than expected , helped by the Treasury 's economic stimulus program , which has so far pumped $ 92 billion into the economy .
At the same time , he warned that spending by consumers " seems likely to be restrained over coming quarters " and that businesses also are likely to be cautious with spending plans .
He also expressed concerns about rising inflation risks due to high commodity prices , suggesting that the Fed might not be able to take steps to support economic growth because of the risk that they would feed inflation pressures .
Despite Bernanke 's gloomy outlook - his most pessimistic since he took office in 2006 - he said the Fed had raised its forecast for overall economic growth .
It is now looking for 1 % to 1.6 % growth for all of 2008 , up from its April forecast of 0.3 % to 1.2 % growth .
While the forecast did not break down the growth by quarter , he said he did not expect any robust growth over the next six months .
Bernanke said the revision in the full - year forecast was caused by stronger - than - expected growth in the first two quarters of 2008 , helped by the stimulus checks that goosed spending in the second quarter .
Three weeks ago , the Fed left interest rates unchanged for the first time in nine months as it said the risks of an economic slowdown appear to have diminished .
But his comments about the economy in the second half of the year seemed much more bearish than suggested in that Fed statement .
Bernanke said that while he believed there would be second - half economic growth , he thought it would be weak .
His comments helped feed a sell - off in oil prices Tuesday , as traders started pricing in lower U.S. consumption of oil in the second half of the year .
Bernanke 's testimony came as part of his regularly - scheduled semi-annual testimony on the state of the economy .
The committee was set to joined by Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson and Christopher Cox , chairman of the Securities and Exchange Commission , for a second hearing Tuesday about Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac .
Mortgage market in cross-hairs
Mortgage finance giants Fannie and Freddie are a key source of funding for banks and other home lenders .
Their ability to provide that funding is seen as a key to any recovery in housing and the economy as a whole .
The companies were set up by Congress , but they are owned by shareholders , who have fled the firms ' stock recently on fears that continued problems in housing and rising mortgage defaults will force them to seek significantly more capital , a move that would dilute the value of existing shares .
Problems in the banking and home lending sectors were further highlighted by the failure of IndyMac , a California bank that was taken over by the federal government Friday evening in what could end up being the most costly bank failure in U.S. history .
Stocks of many major regional banks plunged Monday on concerns over more failures .
IndyMac had been a major provider of mortgage loans that did not demand lenders to provide full or any documentation of their income .
There are likely to be questions about the state of banking and the risk of more failures at Tuesday 's hearings .
Sunday evening Paulson announced a proposal by Treasury to have Congress raise the $ 2.25 billion it is allowed to loan the two firms , and even open the door for the federal government to buy shares in the two companies if needed .
The Fed announced it stood ready to loan money to the firms if they needed access to funds ahead of congressional actions .
Bernanke , in response to a question from Sen. Richard Shelby , R - Ala. , said he felt that IndyMac " was particularly weighed down with low - quality mortgages .
In that respect its failure , barring acquisition by another firm that did n't occur , was inevitable . "
But he added that the banking system is well capitalized .
" My concerns have turned less on the solvency of the institutions and more on their ability to provide credit necessary to keep the economy growing . "
Bernanke said he believed that home building was likely to finally end its slide later this year or early next year , but that the decline in housing prices could continue longer than that , although he said he could n't predict when , or at what level , they will find a bottom .
The PC gaming industry pulled in $ 10.7 billion in 2007 , with only 30 percent of that coming from retail sales , the president of the PC Gaming Alliance said today .
Speaking at the Games Convention Developer 's Conference in Leipzig , Rand Stude said that online PC gaming was the top revenue earner in 2007 for PCs , pulling in $ 4.8 billion , nearly double the worldwide retail sales for PC games .
Digital distribution sales approached $ 2 billion , while advertising revenues from websites , portals , and in - game ads accounted for $ 800 million .
" Our analysis clearly shows incredible growth in online PC gaming , proof that this industry is far stronger than anyone has reported , " said Stude .
" Today 's consumers shop where they live - online . "
These numbers , I think , will be much more meaningful next year when we have something to compare them to .
Hit the jump for the full release .
PC Gaming Alliance Illuminates State of PC Gaming Worldwide with Release of Horizons Report Exclusive PCGA Study Shows PC Gaming a $ 10.7B Industry , Reveals Explosive Online Growth LEIPZIG , Germany — ( BUSINESS WIRE ) — The PC Gaming Alliance ( PCGA ) today unveiled the key findings from its first " Horizons " Report , an exclusive research study of the PC gaming industry worldwide .
Speaking at the Games Convention Developer 's Conference in Leipzig , PCGA president Randy Stude announced that PC gaming was a $ 10.7 billion industry during the year of 2007 , with retail sales accounting for just 30 percent of total revenues .
According to the report , growth was largely driven by online revenues from Asia , the world 's largest market , which is approaching half of total worldwide sales .
Online PC gaming revenue led the way in 2007 with $ 4.8 billion , nearly double the worldwide retail sales numbers for PC games .
Digital distribution sales approached $ 2 billion , while advertising revenues from websites , portals , and in - game ads accounted for $ 800 million .
Both are expected to grow substantially as major developers and publishers begin to adopt formal strategies to take advantage of new online opportunities .
" Our analysis clearly shows incredible growth in online PC gaming , proof that this industry is far stronger than anyone has reported , " said Stude .
" Today 's consumers shop where they live - online . "
According to DFC
Intelligence , there is even more room for growth as the broadband market matures .
" By pioneering new business models , the PC has quietly remained the single leading platform for games , not only in terms of consumer usage , but revenue generation , " said David Cole , an analyst with DFC Intelligence .
" The most fascinating thing about PC gaming is its ability to attract such a diverse audience , both demographically and geographically .
The real key has been the rapid growth in penetration of broadband - connected PCs in all markets around the world .
Broadband - connected PCs are the key driver of growth for PC gaming .
DFC
Intelligence estimated that by the end of 2007 less than one - third of households in the top 20 markets for games had a high - speed Internet connection .
That clearly indicates that there is still plenty of growth to come .
The initiatives of the PCGA will be a key enabler of growth as they will help the industry identify key trends and opportunities in this rapidly emerging market . "
Updated bi-annually , the full Horizons Report is available to all PCGA members .
It encompasses sales from every region around the world , and from every part of the PC gaming industry compiled by the PCGA from internal resources through a third party .
This includes retail , online gaming , digital distribution , and online advertising .
Those interested in joining can find membership details and additional information about the PCGA and its role as the voice of the PC gaming industry at www.pcgamingalliance.org.
Anyone interested in the state of the PC gaming industry will also be able to see Randy Stude present the key findings of the Horizons report during NVISION 08 in San Jose , Calif . on August 25 in the San Jose Hilton adjacent to the convention center at 3:30 p.m. in San Carlos rooms 1 & 2 .

This post was last updated : Friday , November 8 , 2013 at 10:10 AM , Central European Time ( CET )
I ’ve written previously on how the print newspaper is a dying breed , and how web clips are worth far more than print clips .
Today I ’d like to go into why traditional newspaper operations still have much to learn about the web and why they will have to adapt in order to survive .
Anyone reading this is already well aware newspapers are making the ( slow ) transition to digital , and just like the preferred format of music has moved from CD to mp3 , newspapers will eventually move from print to entirely web - based / RSS operations .
It ’s just so much better and more efficient way of receiving information .
Print is still hanging around but it wo n’t last .
Unfortunately newspaper
Web sites , on the whole , are still playing by the old rules of the Web and are not nearly as nice as professional blogs to read and follow .
A few things I ’ve noticed from this perspective that are especially frustrating :
Taking down stories / changing link structure
Some papers get it and do n’t change links on us or take down old stories , but I ’ve seen plenty of sites take down stories after 30 days or so , or change the link structure to archive a story somewhere .
The Internet is not the same as print media , it is not a broadcast medium , it is a communications medium .
A story should n’t disappear after 30 days , it should remain up there as bloggers and social media types love to do research , piece things together and remix news as they see fit .
Linking to a story only to find a few weeks later it ’s down is about the most frustrating thing a news site can do , and will ensure I do n’t like to that site again .
Not linking to external sources to reference things
Newspapers are still clinging to the old way of things .
They still have the attitude of “ if we print , it , it ’s true and does n’t need to be sourced . ”
That ’s actually false – if you have a source on something , link it for us to check it out .
It makes a site far more credible .
A side note ,
The New York Times is one of the few sites that actually gets the web , does tons of external linking and is even developing a brand new API .
Should be neat to see what this looks like , they could set a good example for the industry .
Forcing users to login to view stories
Do n’t news sites want more readers and subscribers ?
The easiest way to discourage this is to force users to create a username / password , fill out a profile , then check their email address to activate that profile before they can view a story .
It leaves a bad taste in most people ’s mouths , and they are losing readership by doing this .
If you ’re going to play by the new rules , go in all the way and do n’t cling to forcing people to fill out forms before they can access content .
Relegating comments to separate pages
If you ’re going to have comments on your site , make it quick and easy for users to add comments and list them directly below the story .
Having them on another page entirely just proves you are n’t fully embracing having conversation and discussion on your site .
Ease of use , search , RSS subscriptions by section , etc .
Why is it I visit my favorite webzines and blogs and it ’s so easy to search for articles , find articles by topic , author or date , and everything is so simple and streamlined .
Yet your daily newspaper Web site mimics the complexity and disorganization of its print counterpart .
There are such amazing sorting , searching and tagging options now available for publications , yet newspapers barely embrace the depth and usability features now available to them .
Newspaper
Web sites to me still suffer from superfluous content and bloat .
They are trying to do too much not well enough and are failing .
For example , why would I ever need to read the technology section in my local online newspaper site when I can read better , deeper reporting on technology from hundreds of other sites whose main focus is technology .
Same goes with book reviews – do we really need local book reviewers when people are reading the same books and posting those reviews nationally ?
There seems to be plenty of overlap occurring .
A focus on local news / people stories and things not already covered by the Internet seems like the best way to go .
Do we really need to see the same AP story we already read earlier today published word for word on our local newspaper site ?
I think not .

WASHINGTON  With Congress at an impasse over the government ’s spy powers , Congressional and intelligence officials are bracing for the possibility that the government might have to revert to the old rules of terrorist surveillance , a situation that some officials predict could leave worrisome gaps in intelligence .
That prospect seemed almost inconceivable just a few months ago , when Congressional negotiators and the White House promised a quick resolution to a bruising debate over the government ’s surveillance powers .
But the dispute has dragged on .
Though both sides say they are hopeful of reaching a deal , officials have been preparing classified briefings for Congress on the intelligence “ degradation ” they say could occur if there is no deal in place by August .
The deadline is considered critical because of a series of secret one - year wiretapping orders that were approved last August under a controversial temporary wiretapping law .
The law allowed the National Security Agency to use blanket court orders to focus on groups of suspected Qaeda terrorists based overseas .
But those orders are growing staler by the day , officials said , and will begin to expire this August if nothing is done .
( Wiretaps intended for Americans already require individual warrants issued by a secret court , known as the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act court , or FISA court . )

Skynet 5 is the latest iteration of a global communications system deployed by the British Armed Forces .
The final satellite in the system was launched this week , and will allow high - bandwidth telecommunications between British forces located anywhere in the world .
In addition to voice communications , it will allow data transfer and the remote control of robot airplanes , one of which is called " The Reaper . "
One of the manufacturers was quoted by BBC News as saying :
So , computers can talk directly to computers .
Are you terrified yet ?
It gets better .
The system is actually privately owned and developed - the British Armed Forces are only promised a portion of the bandwidth as part of the contract .
The one reassuring aspect is that the company is not called Cyberdyne .
Seriously , what the hell ?
Is it British humor to name something like this Skynet , or bureaucratic idiocy ?
Might as well get to work on the self - awareness chip and the " really angry at humans " algorithm .

Modelling the Steady State Prices of an Economy Using the Leontieff Model
The due date is November 22 .
You will need to be familiar with material in sections 9.1 - 9.8 of " Introduction to Maple 8 " by D. I. Schwartz .
The economy of a country or a group of countries can be modelled by thinking of each sector of the economy as a producing and consuming unit .
This leads to the idea an input and output matrix which was first studied by Vasily Leontieff in the 1930's .
Consider the general problem where we have n manufacturers making n products ( makes ) .
In one year we assume that makes exactly one unit of , and that all of the is consumed in that year in the manufacturing of the other products ( including ) .
Thus , let be the amount of product consumed in the manufacturing of .
Then .
Suppose that the system is closed :
In other words , there are no products leaving or entering the system , and suppose that all the goods produced are consumed during the period under consideration , say one year .
Then , since the total production of is 1 ,
It turns out that it is possible to predict the prices of goods in this economy assuming stability of prices ; in other words , assuming no producer is forced to raise prices because production costs are higher than income .
Let be the price of product ( for one unit ) .
Assuming that no manufacturer makes or loses any money , what are the prices of the products ?
Since pays for product , the total cost in producing product is
But 's income must be , if there is no loss or profit .
Thus , equating expenses with income , we get
Let , and .
Then this equation reduces to
A is called the exchange matrix , since it describes the exchange of goods between the manufacturers .
We must find a solution which satisfies this equation , and that will be the prices of the products .
One can argue that we should really require that no manufacturer is making a loss : .
However , it can be proven that this implies that .
In other words , no manufacturer can make a profit without another making a loss .
( This is what is known as a zero - sum game .
The following table describes the exchange of goods in a small economy which includes a wheat farmer , a milk farmer , a wine producer , a tailor , a cotton grower , a baker and a yoghurt maker .
Make a Leontief closed model from this data , and solve for the prices of the products using Maple .
Observe that the columns do not add up to 1 .
Therefore , in oorder to agree with our formulation you will need the transpose of the matrix .
The stable prices correspond to a non-trivial eignenvector of the exchange matrix .
There are two ways to find such an eigenvector .
One is to use use Maple 's LinearAlgebra package .
The other is to start with a potential price vector an iterate applying the exchange matrix to this vector .
Why should this yield an eignevector ?
Do the two method yield the same result .
If not , why not ?

A number of the responses were interesting and thought provoking , while others were so full of FUD and misinformation I could n't help but wonder if they were serious .
I 'll admit that I was surprised by some of the negative backlash against DVCS .
I have explained it to many former users of centralized systems , and it simply never struck me as a very controversial technology .
I do n't want to just completely ignore the criticism , however .
This post is an attempt to respond directly to some of the more common criticisms , and hopefully convince some of the skeptics that even if DVCS is n't the solution for you , at least it wo n't start your computer on fire .
DVCS Myth # 1 : You must change your workflow to adopt DVCS
Many descriptions of DVCS focus on the new and interesting workflows it enables .
Indeed , this is a key feature of distributed version control , but it has a tendency to give the implication that DVCS is only useful if you really need to change your workflow .
This is entirely untrue .
DVCS is flexible , and can be implemented in some very interesting and unique ways .
However , it can also act just like your centralized system , and its advantages are no less significant .
At our company , for example , we switched from Subversion to Mercurial without changing our model at all , at least initially .
We kept the same branch structure , used the same server , and did things in generally the same way .
As our team has grown and diversified , our needs have as well , so we 've leveraged some of the strengths of the DVCS model to match our workflow .
The key is that DVCS works with your desired workflow rather than dictating it .
If your desired workflow is similar to or identical to the " central server " model , that 's a perfectly acceptable use case for applying DVCS .
DVCS Myth # 2 : Workflows enabled by DVCS are less natural than the centralized workflow
For long - time users of centralized systems , this is an understandable belief .
Indeed , the workflow mandated by a centralized system may in some cases be the most natural .
In these cases , DVCS offers the best implementation of the centralized workflow I 've found .
It 's in cases where the centralized model is not the most natural workflow , however , that the unique properties of DVCS really shine .
As a specific example , DVCS has enabled me to manage changes to my home directory much more naturally than in a centralized system .
I keep the contents of my home directory ( dot files , elisp , etc. ) under version control .
I was using Subversion prior to discovering DVCS .
With Subversion , I ran the server on my home development workstation , which I left powered on during the day so it was accessible from work ( forcing me to pay otherwise unnecessary power costs ) .
In addition , I paid $ 5 per month to my ISP for a static IP ( dynamic DNS was unfortunately not an option due to the NAT configuration of my fiber - to - home service ) .
Despite these costs , the workflow in this setup was extremely unnatural .
When I would make an update to the repository on the bus , I would have to leave the files in a modified state .
Upon arriving at work , I would then have to open the laptop , connect to the network , then either make a bulk checkin with all of the changes or manually partition the modified files into the proper groups for changesets .
If , on the other hand , I made changes on my work computer and wanted to check them in while my home server was down ( because of a network outage , or simply because I forgot to turn it on in the morning ) , I would have to manually generate patches from the repository ( again , forcing myself to later reassemble them into logical changesets ) .
Of course , accessing source control over the Internet is never ideal from a performance perspective , even when the server is always up .
This is particularly true when using a strained corporate connection to talk to a server on an upload limited consumer line .
This was an annoying process , to say the least , and while it was a huge improvement over manually copying my home directory around , it left much room for improvement .
With DVCS , all of the annoyances of the previous model are gone .
I can make commits from the bus without network access , and these commits are properly organized into the appropriate changesets as opposed to a giant single patch .
I can easily pull these changes into my work computer 's repository when I get to work , or I can leave the laptop in the bag and merge them another time .
The changes I make on my work computer , meanwhile , need to make it back to my home machine .
However , with my DVCS - powered workflow I now keep my machine turned off during the day ( making DVCS the green SCM choice ) .
I have also canceled my static IP service , saving myself $ 5 a month .
In the absence of direct access to my home repository , I use a variety of mechanisms for sharing changes .
Most commonly , I transfer changesets to my home machine via my laptop 's repository .
In other cases , I will export a handful of changesets and transfer them with a USB thumb drive or via email .
In general , I use the most convenient option available , though I have used all three in various situations .
Regardless of where the work happens or how it 's transferred , merging the changesets is simple with DVCS because , well , DVCS is designed to make merging changesets simple .
It 's simple no matter where the changesets originated , in part because DVCS uses unique hashes to identify changesets .
Of course , it also tracks the parent revision of each changeset , so it can determine cases where a merge is n't necessary at all .
This , unsurprisingly is the most common case given that I 'm the only user in this scenario .
One thing you may have noticed in the workflow description is that it's a bit ambiguous which of my computers is " the server " .
Previously , it was my home machine , but why ?
It could just as easily have been any other machine ... in fact , I probably would have been better off running the centralized server on the laptop , though that does n't seem quite right either .
The fact is , this is a workflow where " the server " is naturally ambiguous .
There is no real value in designating my home machine ( or any other ) in this role .
Thus , the centralized model for version controlling my home directory simply is n't a natural fit .
The DVCS model , on the other hand , easily and naturally supports my desired workflow .
There are no " hacks " required to make this work cleanly .
As an added bonus , I get free offsite backups of my home directory repository .
This leads to our next myth .
DVCS Myth # 3 : DVCS users do n't believe in backups
The idea that DVCS users do n't believe in backups is surprisingly pervasive , perhaps because of the passive attitude DVCS advocates tend to have about server outages .
At our company , we have the same attitude , but we also make very frequent backups of our centralized repository .
Using DVCS may theoretically reduce the need for backups , but by no means does it eliminate it .
So , why make backups of a source control server with so many backups ?
It is improbable that many servers will suffer catastrophic hardware failures simultaneously , but it is not impossible .
A more likely scenario might be a particularly nasty computer virus that sinks its teeth into an entire network of vulnerable machines .
In any case , the probability of any or all of your backups becoming suddenly unavailable is really not the point .
The bottom line is that using independent clones as canonical backups ( as opposed to temporary stopgaps ) is a suboptimal strategy .
Security , for example , should be considered .
If you are using authorization rules to control access to specific portions of your repository , canonicalizing an arbitrary clone of the repository effectively renders those rules useless .
While this would rarely be a matter of practical concern in a controlled corporate environment , it is nonetheless possible .
It is worth noting that in an environment where a backup process is infeasible ( for financial , political or other reasons ) , backing up hashes of the repository files and their revisions for post - backup verification could provide a mitigation .
The key win of DVCS for backups , then , is that you do n't really need to invest in a " hot " backup .
When the server inevitably goes down , DVCS will buy you time .
Lots of time .
You 'll essentially be running at full productivity ( or very nearly so ) while you rebuild your server from backup .
When changesets created during the server downtime are pushed back to the restored server , the freshly restored authorization rules will be reapplied and you 'll be back on track .
DVCS Myth # 4 : Authentication and authorization do n't exist with DVCS
I touched on this a bit in the previous myth , but it 's worth emphasizing .
Authentication and authorization absolutely do exist in the DVCS model .
They only apply where you choose to apply them , however .
Our company has a canonical source control server which applies both authentication and authorization rules .
The authentication rules are specified via the Apache server configuration which provides network access to the repositories .
In fact , we leveraged the exact same Apache authentication configuration we had used for our Subversion installation ( this configuration allows us to leverage the user database in the company 's Windows domain ) .
For authorization , we use the more flexible options offered by Mercurial 's ACL configuration .
In the simplest case , we have developer - specific copies of mainline development branches which can be pulled by anyone , but only pushed ( written ) to by the developer who owns it .
Grouping users and splitting access based on subpaths of a single repository are nearly as simple .
Because the authorization rules are applied when changesets are pushed , developers working on local repositories are not denied any flexibility until they attempt to push their changes .
A user in this scenario can still commit changes against that repository , they just can't push them directly .
Thus , they would have to convince a developer who does have such permission that their changes are worthy of inclusion .
Despite the flexibility , the effectiveness of the authentication and authorization rules are not compromised .
DVCS Myth # 5 : DVCS can be used in corporate environments , but its advantages are mostly geared towards open source projects
DVCS is indeed quite popular for open source projects , and the reasons are fairly obvious .
When many disconnected developers are working on the same project , the workflow flexibility provided by DVCS becomes increasingly important .
It also provides a clean mechanism for remote users without commit access to the primary repository to create new functionality within the code base .
A user working on a new experimental feature , for example , can perform the work on their local clone of the repository .
Within this local copy , they can commit changesets and integrate changes from other users .
Importantly , as the mainline codebase evolves , they can also merge their changes with updated upstream code in a clean and organized way .
In a centralized system , they would be forced to maintain their changes as a set of patches , manually rebasing them when they pull down new changes in the upstream repository .
When their experimental feature is complete , they can easily export the new work and send a compact package to the appropriate maintainer .
The workflow flexibility DVCS offers is particularly valuable in an open source project with multiple maintainers .
The maintainers in this scenario would be responsible for integrating contributions from the community for the modules they are responsible for .
The contributions would mostly come in the form of structured patches exported by the DVCS client .
The process of integrating these patches is easier and more organized with DVCS .
Additionally , merging responsibilities can easily be split amongst several maintainers for patches that are accepted .
In corporations , on the other hand , it is rare to find groups collaborating by sharing patches .
Thus , at a glance the flexibility offered by DVCS model might seem to be overkill .
In some cases , this is true , I doubt any company or organization needs every feature provided by DVCS .
However , having the capability to restructure your workflow is extremely valuable , even if you do n't need it yet .
And the parts of DVCS you do n't use certainly do n't cost you anything .
Perhaps you want to prevent a group of developers from committing changes to your mainline repository until they are reviewed .
Using a centralized system , the developers from this group must submit patches for review and integration with the main code base .
Their commit logs are thus lost , overwritten by the reviewing developer who applies the patch .
DVCS makes this significantly easier .
Those responsible for reviewing the changes simply pull reviewable changesets directly from the developer , or they can pull them via a developer - specific branch on the server .
If the changes pass review , they can push them along to the main repository ( only they would have access to do this ) .
This group might also collect their changes together into their own shared repository , enabling a variety of changes to be tested together .
These sorts of scenarios can be especially useful when collaborating on a single project with an external development organization .
I have seen attempts to use centralized version control systems in these scenarios fail miserably .
Corporate centralized servers are rarely designed to be exposed on public networks , so naturally administrators shy away from enabling remote access , except via VPN .
When no shared central server is available , the inevitable result is a hackish process .
In the best case this might be a process based on exchanging patches from known parents , but more commonly it involves trading full copies of the source code with all revision history lost , then performing painful manual merges .
With DVCS , you simply send the whole repository once , then share the exported changesets by whatever transfer mechanism is most convenient ( server access is just a bonus ) .
Merges can again be performed by either development organization , which is especially convenient .
DVCS Myth # 6 : Having a server with perfect uptime invalidates the advantages of DVCS
Even if you are not on a plane , you may very well be on the bus , or at home , or at a coffee shop , or in a hotel room , or on vacation .
Just because your server has perfect uptime does n't mean you 're always in position to access it .
I have personally needed source control repository access in every single one of these places ( including the plane ) , and I cannot rely on high speed Internet access in most of them .
A couple of weeks ago I got a call about a bug that needed fixing while riding in on the bus .
I was only 10 minutes from my destination , but that was enough time to crack open my laptop and run a bisect session to uncover the changeset which introduced the bug .
Upon arriving at work , I knew exactly what the problem was and I was able to fix it immediately .
With more time , I could have prepared the fixed changeset on the bus , ready to transfer as soon as I arrived .
DVCS not only gives you access to your repository everywhere , it offers the most performant experience possible in all of these scenarios .
The performance aspect is a relevant point when speaking about uptime .
As far as I 'm concerned , if my " annotate " command takes 10 seconds to run , that counts as 9.5 seconds of downtime , because with DVCS it 's virtually instantaneous .
A slow responding centralized server can easily cost you as much productivity as an occasionally inaccessible one in the long run .
Hiccups can be mitigated to some extent by spending a great deal of money on your source control server , the hardware between it and your workstations , and appropriately qualified staff to make it all work together .
However , I 've rarely seen companies willing to make the required investment ( never in my own experience , and quite rarely in others ) .
Even in those that do , it 's still only a mitigation ( a server running on good hardware still inevitably gets sluggish under load ) , and it only lasts so long .
As your repository grows and your team expands , the scaling pressure increases .
DVCS , on the other hand , grows with your company , and always provides optimal performance .
Thus , you do n't need to spend an extra $ 25,000 on your server hardware " for future hires " .
DVCS Myth # 7 : DVCS encourages chaos in your development process
This seems to be the issue that , more than any other , causes the anti-DVCS crowd to load up the FUD cannons .
I 've not seen any evidence to suggest that DVCS encourages degradation in teams .
In fact , I have seen the opposite effect .
Because DVCS can be shaped to the natural workflows of your team , when implemented properly it enables teams to work more smoothly , with less communication overhead .
With that said , the fear , uncertainty and doubt surrounding this issue is n't going away , so it is only fair to address what seems to be such a " hot button " issue .
For starters , let 's define chaos .
I think it 's important to understand that " chaos " is a moving target .
A happy Subversion user might see the flexibility offered in the DVCS model as potentially chaotic .
Meanwhile , there are many happy Visual SourceSafe users ( really , there are -- I 've met some , they are nice people despite this ) who find the idea of a non-exclusive locking source control system to be the very definition of chaos .
Most people who have been writing software for a long period of time in a team environment accept that having multiple developers edit the same file at the same time is not only an acceptable form of chaos , but a very necessary one .
It may not be intuitive ( it sounds a lot like chaos until you 've realized its importance ) , but it 's almost universally recognized within mature development organizations that the cost of merging file changes when multiple developers edit the same file far outweighs the massive productivity cost of a strict locking system .
So at least on this single issue , the DVCS proponents and detractors agree with each other wholeheartedly , or at least the vast majority of them do .
It is not a huge step , then , to imagine other scenarios which might seem chaotic on the surface , but in fact enable huge gains in productivity .
We can acknowledge , having established that chaos can be valuable , that DVCS allows for chaos .
All systems allow for some form of it .
It is up to your team to determine the appropriate level of chaos that is permitted , and to enforce the process .
This is true no matter what system or process you are introducing .
If a particular developer working under a centralized source control system never checks in their work , that 's a process failure , not a technology problem .
Many common situations in centralized systems lead to chaos as well .
To me , the fact that a user cannot check in a set of changes until they 've merged in everyone else 's work on the same branch is chaos .
This makes it far too easy to lose work because of a " merge gone wrong " .
I have seen developers switch workstations to resolve merge conflicts on more than one occasion .
Being disallowed from checking in broken changes that you do n't wish to share with others also leads to chaos .
Developers wishing to add this layer of control with a centralized system today are forced to either do it manually ( by making a copy of the in - progress repository or the relevant patches in case you want to back out ) or to adopt a local DVCS .
The rapidly increasing popularity of running DVCS locally on top of centralized repositories really speaks to the need for the flexibility it offers .
If you ask around , you 'll find a number of different reasons why a given developer might have adopted this strategy .
Nearly all of them are good arguments for DVCS in general .
Some may want to version changes at a more granular level before sharing their changesets .
Some might want a layered mechanism for transferring partial changesets between different environments .
Others might value the ability to seamlessly create private branches for managing a particular single user workflow .
Indeed , DVCS provides significant benefits when used by a sole developer on top of a centralized server .
But when enabled for an entire organization , it becomes even more powerful .
For starters , all users of the system instantly gain access to the valuable features of DVCS .
Even developers that do n't take advantage of the more advanced DVCS features will instantly benefit from a speed improvement .
More importantly , the workflow flexibility enjoyed by the individual user now extends to the entire team .
Having a source control system that supports your workflow and enables people to work together optimally is very likely to lead less chaos in your company or organization .
DVCS Myth # 8 : All DVCS proponents think centralized version control systems are useless pieces of garbage , and that you 're insane for using them
I think this perception is common , and triggers a defense mechanism that in many cases gets in the way of having a rational discussion of DVCS .
First of all , most DVCS users used a centralized version control system before switching over .
And most of them did n't choose to use diff & patch in lieu of that centralized system ( with one rather notable exception ) .
I personally have several years of experience with CVS , Perforce and Subversion .
I have actually had generally positive experiences with all of those tools , and I 'd take any of them over a diff & patch based version control strategy .
However , part of the reason for my being able to co-exist peacefully with these tools is that I bent my development processes to fit the limitations of the tools .
Subversion 's sub-par branching , for example , was annoying but not crippling because I avoided having lots of branches , instead choosing to unnaturally manipulate process ( or even release dates ) .
Perforce wo n't let you blink without server access , so I wrote a layer of proprietary code on top of p4 to manually reattribute files and generate scripts to eventually notify the server of opened - and - or - changed - but - the - server - does n't - know - about - it files ( yeah , and DVCS is chaotic ) .
Everyone I worked with either had their own hacky solution to this problem , or they stopped getting work done when they did n't have server access .
As a generally content user of these centralized systems , I was curious enough about DVCS to read the occasional article touting it , but it never really hit me that it could make such a significant impact on my own development process , or the process at our company .
It 's difficult to see just how broken particular workflows are until they 're fixed .
As I began to better understand the advantages of DVCS , I started to become more aware of the annoying hacks that I was employing in an attempt to get work done under a centralized system .
DVCS Myth #9 : DVCS is hard to learn
Before becoming a DVCS user , I definitely had this perception .
DVCS can seem very intimidating .
Typical explanations of DVCS are littered with complex workflow descriptions that are rarely familiar or intuitive to users indoctrinated in a centralized source control system mindset .
This often makes DVCS seem overly complex or even irrelevant to one 's needs .
To a degree , DVCS is difficult to learn .
A system that allows for a great deal of flexibility is naturally more difficult to learn than a system with limited capability .
However , in the context of a particular need one needs to solve , DVCS is quite easy to learn .
If , for example , you decide to replace Subversion with Mercurial and continue using the same trunk / branch model , there is very little to learn in order to make the switch .
Thus , DVCS itself is not " hard to learn " .
It can be quite challenging , however , to determine the best possible workflow for change management at your company .
Because DVCS expands your options in this area , it 's easy to mistake it as " difficult " .
Conceptually , DVCS is really quite simple .
It 's the optimized application of DVCS that is challenging .
If you 're intimidated by it , start by using it to imitate your existing workflow , then look for gaps in the efficiency or flexibility of your workflow .
Chances are , DVCS will be able to solve them .
DVCS Myth # 10 : DVCS is hard to use
Once a particular DVCS workflow has been established , the difficulty of day - to - day usage of the system is very similar to centralized systems with equally complex workflows .
Many DVCS implementations include more granular commands than are offered by centralized systems , but it 's usually simple to emulate them .
Following are a few examples of common Subversion commands and their equivalent in Mercurial .
Operation Subversion Mercurial Commit changes to remote server svn ci hg ci && hg push
Get changes from remote server svn up hg pull -u
Show change log svn log hg log Annotate a revision svn blame hg annotate Show status of changed files svn status hg status
Show changes in current files svn diff hg diff
Print a file 's contents at a particular revision svn cat -r 55 hg cat -r 55 Cherry pick a single revision from branches / main to trunk svn merge - r720 ../../ branches / main hg transplant -s ../../ branches / main f587e
Merge all unmerged revisions from branches / main to trunk svn log | grep - i merging
...
svn merge - r640:646 ../ branches/main
svn merge - r681:682 ../branches/main
svn merge - r689:662 ../ branches/main
svn merge - r667:669 ../ branches/main
svn merge - r676:719 ../ branches/main
svn merge - r725:730 ../branches/main
svn merge - r734:HEAD ../ branches / main hg pull ../ branches/main
To learn this basic set of commands given a background with a centralized system and a similar or identical workflow would take only a couple of minutes .
Fortunately , you 'll buy back those minutes and many , many more each time you run these commands .
It can be a bit startling at first to adjust to all of your VCS commands running so fast , but you 'll cope , I promise .
And if you 're a Subversion or CVS user , you can stop scheduling " branch days " on your calendar .
DVCS Myth # 11 : DVCS is a fad
At some point , it became acceptable to discount the value of all new technology with a reference to some unrelated technological flop .
DVCS is the new Betamax , apparently , simply by virtue of the fact that it 's new and different .
Despite these inane comparisons , the question itself is worth pondering .
For a technology to be a fad , there needs to be some initial period of excitement and adoption , followed by a relatively rapid dilution of interest after this initial period .
Technologies that end up in the " fad " category tend to be those that can drum up excitement with marketable promises , but either fail to deliver on that promise or miss a key element required to reach a " tipping point " .
Most technologies that we associate with the " fad " term were interesting enough to justify at least some initial excitement at one point in their history .
Laserdisc was a failure , historically speaking , but putting video content on an optical disk and enabling interactive features does n't seem like such a bad idea these days .
DVCS certainly meets the criteria for fad potential , at least at this point in its history .
It has a strong and growing base of highly passionate users and evangelists .
It 's also a relatively new technology , despite having a few years of success stories in its wake .
So , will DVCS continue to accelerate ?
Let 's look at some of the " fad factors " as they apply to DVCS .
We might decide that Laserdisc was a failure because of a poor technical implementation .
That is , putting video content on an optical disc was a good idea , but the discs were too large or the quality was too low to back it up .
So , does DVCS have the same problem ?
I think there was some legitimacy to the " good idea , bad implementation " complaint as recently as a couple of years ago .
There were a several DVCS tools to choose from at that time , but each had significant quirks .
In the meantime , however , the quality of the DVCS experience has increased dramatically .
Excellent newcomers like git and Mercurial have burst onto the scene , while quirks have steadily been disappearing from their competition .
From a technological implementation perspective , the state of DVCS implementations is strong , and getting stronger .
Having used Mercurial for over a year now ( well before their 1.0 release ) , I 'm amazed by how trouble free it has been .
As the repository has grown and the complexity of our source control usage has increased , Mercurial has continued to be as fast and pleasant to use as it was on day 1 .
Perhaps it 's just our good luck , but it has also been less painful to administer than any source control system I 've managed in the past .
A bigger concern when evaluating whether or not something has fad potential is marketing a product that the market does n't exist for .
This is sometimes because the product is " ahead of its time " , but more often it 's because the benefits were oversold .
The Segway comes to mind , although I 'm not entirely sure they ever had the initial adoption to justify the " fad " label .
With DVCS , this argument is a bit more challenging to evaluate , because it involves some speculation .
I know from personal experience that DVCS offers unique capabilities that at least some segment of the market needs .
However , even if I 'd been doing this for a lifetime , it is a pretty microscopic sample size size .
Perhaps a better way of looking at it is to understand what you lose by moving to DVCS .
It 's very , very difficult to imagine a company or organization that can't benefit from at least one aspect of DVCS .
Any organization that allows employees to work from home , as a simple example , would benefit from improved productivity with DVCS .
But what do they lose ?
Obviously the answer to this question depends on the specific scenarios , but even assuming that you want to keep your centralized workflow I do n't see much downside .
You end up checking in merged changesets more often in DVCS , though every modern DVCS system has a way of making this happen nearly as seamlessly as in a traditional centralized system .
The difference between the two is basically a safety tradeoff ( that is , the ability to commit your changes before merging ) .
And the safety tradeoff is optional in many cases , for brave users who wish to merge remote changes with uncommitted files .
Of course , there are other advantages to decoupling commit and merge which are not realized in this case .
What about cost ?
Most DVCS software implementations are available free of charge .
Compared with best of breed commercial implementations of centralized systems , this can save quite a bit of money right off the bat .
Perhaps more significantly , the DVCS model minimizes the amount of money you need to spend on your server hardware .
All operations that do n't involve sharing changesets are done on local clones of the repository , so the server has far less work to do .
Thus , your shared repository will happily run on less - than - stellar hardware without impacting most SCM use cases .
Server administration is essentially identical to a centralized server , so you wo n't find hidden costs there either .
The only relevant cost consideration , in fact , is the cost of the initial migration .
While there are no guarantees that DVCS will break through into the mainstream , it 's difficult to find many compelling arguments against it .
For all its pros , there just are n't many cons .
The limitations that do exist today can be eliminated with modifications to the technology implementations as opposed to the idea itself .
There is no doubt in my mind that centralized systems will continue to exist for some time ( CVS is still quite popular , and its been years since there was a legitimate case for starting a project on it ) .
However , it is inevitable that centralized systems will start to gain more and more DVCS functionality .
It 's easy to imagine these DVCS / centralized system hybrids eventually becoming quite popular , in fact .
They might operate in full " DVCS mode " for the majority of operations , but automatically consult the server for files larger than a certain threshold , or for inspecting changesets that are several years old .
Or perhaps they will be able to enforce certain aspects of policy to ease the fears of those who remain fearful of " DVCS chaos " but desire the productivity boost it provides .
DVCS Myth # 12 : DVCS is the perfect solution in all cases
Having spent a fair amount of time talking about the benefits of DVCS , it 's only fair to spend some time talking about cases where it might not be the optimal solution , at least in its current forms .
If your company or organization has a single centralized repository with hundreds of thousands of files or millions of revisions , it may be infeasible to store the entire repository on each client .
As we discussed in our last myth , this does n't necessarily disqualify the DVCS concept , but current DVCS implementations do not yet have features to optimize this scenario .
Not all companies or organizations keep the entirety of their source code in a single repository , but it 's certainly not uncommon .
That said , there is no reason that future DVCS implementations ( perhaps in hybrid form ) should n't excel in this scenario .
Even in these " massive repository " cases , it is sometimes possible to restructure the repository into a collection of smaller repositories ( see OpenJDK ) .
This allows users to work optimally with a full repository clone in the area or areas of the system that are relevant to them .
A downside is that changesets cannot span repositories , so this is not always ideal .
In any case , this scenario is relevant in a very limited number of cases ( if you do n't work at a very large company , it probably does n't apply to you ) .
Looking forward , it would take an army of developers several years to develop that much source code , and in a few years it will no longer be prohibitive to store repositories of this size on each client .
If this problem does n't affect you today , it probably never will .
Graffiti artist Banksy unmasked ... as a former public schoolboy from middle - class suburbia
He is perhaps the most famous , or infamous , artist alive .
To some a genius , to others a vandal .
Always controversial , he inspires admiration and provokes outrage in equal measure .
Since Banksy made his name with his trademark stencil - style ' guerrilla ' art in public spaces - on walls in London , Brighton , Bristol and even on the West Bank barrier separating Israelis and Palestinians - his works have sold for hundreds of thousands of pounds .
He has dozens of celebrity collectors including Brad Pitt , Angelina Jolie and Christina Aguilera .
In the frame :
The man in this photograph , taken in Jamaica four years ago , is believed to be Banksy
He is also known for his headline - making stunts , such as leaving an inflatable doll dressed as a Guantanamo prisoner in Disneyland , California , and hanging a version of the Mona Lisa - but with a smiley face - in the Louvre , Paris .
But perhaps his most provocative statement , and the one that generates the most publicity , is the fact that Banksy 's true identity has always been a jealously guarded secret , known to only a handful of trusted friends .
A network of myths has grown up around him .
That his real name is Robin Banks .
That he used to be a butcher .
That his parents do n't know what he does , believing him to be an unusually successful painter and decorator .
Then there 's the suggestion that Banksy is actually a collective of artists and does n't exist at all .
Such is the curiosity about Banksy that when the great man threw a pizza box into a bin in Los Angeles , the box resurfaced on auction site eBay , with the seller suggesting that the few anchovies left inside might yield traces of his DNA .
He is the Scarlet Pimpernel of modern art , so adept at leaving false trails that even his own agent has claimed that he is not certain of his identity .
Indeed , trying to establish just who the elusive Banksy is has proved as difficult as predicting the location of his next work .
Famous fans : Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie at a Banksy show in Los Angeles where they spent £ 200,000
But now , after an exhaustive year - long investigation in which we have spoken to dozens of friends , former colleagues , enemies , flatmates and members of Banksy 's close family , The Mail on Sunday has come as close as anyone possibly can to revealing his identity .
And far from being a radical tearaway from an inner-city council estate , the man we have identified as Banksy is , perhaps all too predictably , a former public schoolboy brought up in middle - class suburbia .
Our search began with a photograph taken in Jamaica showing a man in a blue shirt and jeans , with a hint of a smile on his face and a spray can at his feet .
Taken four years ago , it was said to show Banksy at work .
When the picture was published it appeared to be the first chink in the armour of anonymity with which the artist has shielded himself ever since his work began to attract the attention of the art world .
Naturally , Banksy denied the picture was of him .
Indeed , as we discovered , Banksy and those close to him tend to deny everything .
Armed with this photograph , we travelled to Bristol , long said to have been Banksy 's home city , where we made contact with a man who claimed to have once met the artist in the flesh .
Of course , many people claim as much , but the moment one starts asking for more information , one discovers they actually ' know someone who met Banksy ' - and the trail runs cold .
However , this man claimed not only to have met the elusive artist but was able to furnish us with a name - not the usual variations of the name Banks but one all the more intriguing .
The man in the photograph , he insisted , was formerly known as Robin Gunningham - and it did n't require much imagination to work out how such a name could result in the nickname Banksy .
From records available to the public , we were able to glean further information .
Mystery boy : Robin Gunningham in 1989 when he was a pupil at Bristol Cathedral School , below
Robin 's father , Peter Gordon Gunningham , 66 , is a retired contracts manager from the Whitehall area of Bristol .
His mother , Pamela Ann Dawkin - Jones , 67 , was a company director 's secretary and grew up in the exclusive surroundings of Clifton .
She now works in a nursing home .
The couple married on April 25 , 1970 , at Kingswood Wesley Methodist Church .
On February 8 , 1972 , their daughter Sarah was born at Bristol Maternity Hospital , by which time Peter had been promoted to area manager for a hotel company and the couple had bought their first home , a semidetached house in Bristol .
On July 28 , 1973 , Robin was born in the same hospital .
According to neighbours , the boy had early surgery for a cleft palette .
When Robin was nine , the family moved to a larger home in the same street and it is there he spent his formative years and became interested in graffiti .
A neighbour , Anthony Hallett , recalls the couple moving into the street as newlyweds and living there until 1998 .
They have since separated .
When we showed Mr Hallett the Jamaica photograph , he said the man in it was Robin Gunningham .
In 1984 , Robin , then 11 , donned a black blazer , grey trousers and striped tie to attend the renowned Bristol Cathedral School , which currently charges fees of £ 9,240 a year and lists supermodel Sophie Anderton as a former pupil .
It is hard to imagine Banksy , the anti-authoritarian renegade , as a public schoolboy wandering around the 17th Century former monastery , with its upper and lower quadrangles and its prayers in the ancient cathedral .
But we then found a school photograph , taken in 1989 , of a bespectacled Robin Gunningham in which he shows a discernible resemblance to the man in the Jamaica photograph .
Indeed , fellow pupils remember Robin , who was in Deans House , as being a particularly gifted artist .
Scott Nurse , an insurance broker who was in Robin 's class , said : ' He was one of three people in my year who were extremely talented at art .
He did lots of illustrations .
I am not at all surprised if he is Banksy .
He was also in the house rugby team and I think he played hockey as well . '
In the rare interviews Banksy has given ( always anonymously ) , the artist has acknowledged that it was while at school that he first became interested in graffiti .

He has also painted murals including a Mona Lisa with a rocket launcher
In 1983 , the New York hip - hop group the Rock Steady Crew toured Europe , appearing at the Royal Variety Performance with a number of graffiti artists .
This performance was the inspiration for artists such as Massive Attack 's 3D and Nick Walker , now an equally high - profile artist and designer who did the backdrop for the films Eyes Wide Shut and Judge Dredd .
But Banksy 's interest in the art is said to have caused a family rift .
Former neighbour Mr Hallett said : ' The family was always very nice .
I do n't know for sure but I think Robin was working as a graffiti artist .
He worked for other people and would disappear for months on end .
He was quite nomadic .
' I would not go as far as to say he went off the rails , but there was some sort of rift in the family , probably because he did n't turn out quite as they hoped .
He just disappeared after he left home . '
In 1985 , Bristol 's Arnolfini Gallery hosted an exhibition called Graffiti Art In Britain , at which artists sprayed paint directly on to the gallery walls and the hip hop band The Wild Bunch , which later became Massive Attack , played .
In an interview in 2006 with pop-culture magazine Swindle , Banksy said : ' I came from a relatively small city in southern England .
When I was about ten years old , a kid called 3D was painting the streets hard .
I think he'd been to New York and was the first to bring spray painting back to Bristol .
I grew up seeing spray paint on the streets way before I ever saw it in a magazine or on a computer .
' 3D quit painting and formed the band Massive Attack , which may have been good for him but was a big loss for the city .
Graffiti was the thing we all loved at school .
We did it on the bus on the way home from school .
Everyone was doing it .'

Robin Gunningham left school at 16 after doing GCSEs and began dabbling in street art .
The following year , as part of Operation Anderson , undercover police arrested 72 artists across Britain on criminal damage charges .
Those arrested included Tom Bingle ( aka Inkie ) , the graffiti artist acknowledged to be Banksy 's partner in crime , who is now head of creative design at the computer games manufacturer Sega .
He was tried but acquitted .
Robin Gunningham was not arrested .
Nor is there any record of Banksy being apprehended .
But the artist has confessed he had by now become expert at evading police .
In his book Wall And Piece , he said : ' When I was 18 , I spent one night trying to paint LATE AGAIN in big silver bubble letters on the side of a passenger train .
British Transport Police showed up and I got ripped to shreds running away through a thorny bush .
The rest of my mates made it to the car and disappeared so I spent over an hour hidden under a dumper truck with engine oil leaking all over me .
' As I lay there listening to the cops on the tracks , I realised I had to cut my painting time in half or give up altogether .
I was staring straight up at the stencilled plate on the bottom of a fuel tank when I realised I could just copy that style and make each letter 3 ft high .
' I got home at last and crawled into bed next to my girlfriend .
I told her I 'd had an epiphany that night and she told me to stop taking that drug ' cos it 's bad for your heart . '
As our investigation continued , our inquiries demonstrated again and again that the details of Robin Gunningham 's life story dovetail perfectly with the known facts about Banksy .
By 1998 Robin Gunningham was living in Easton , Bristol , with Luke Egan , who went on to exhibit with Banksy at Santa 's Ghetto , an art store which launched at Christmas 2001 in London 's West End .
Recurring motif : Another Mona Lisa in Glasgow
However , when we approached him , Egan initially denied knowing and living with either Banksy or Robin Gunningham , even though he had exhibited with the former and the electoral roll had showed him living with the latter .
He eventually said : ' I lived with a guy , with Robin Gunningham .
But ... '
' But you 're saying he was n't Banksy ? '
' Well , he was n't then .
I lived with him ages ago .
I do n't think Banksy was around then anyway . '
Egan and Gunningham are believed to have left the house when the owner wanted to sell it .
Camilla Stacey , a curator at Bristol 's Here Gallery who bought the property in 2000 , said that Banksy and Robin Gunningham are one and the same person .
She knew the house had been inhabited by Banksy because of the artwork left there - and she used to get post for him in the name of Robin Gunningham .
' I bought the house that he used to live in , ' she told us .
' He had rented out a room but I think there had been problems with the tenants and the landlord had to sort of repossess it or whatever , so he was just selling it .
' When I moved in , the place had been covered in graffiti and stuff like that .
I threw things in the bin .
' At that point Banksy was just someone putting up stuff around Bristol .
He was just another artist who had graffitied around Bristol .
It keeps me awake at night sometimes thinking about it . '
Indeed , who would n't regret throwing out work that would now probably fetch tens of thousands ?
Suburban warrior :
The semi in Bristol where Robin grew up
It was in 1998 that Banksy and Inkie collaborated with other graffiti artists on a 400 - yard Walls On Fire hoarding around Bristol 's Harbourside .
In local writer Steve Wright 's unofficial biography , Banksy 's Bristol : Home Sweet Home , Inkie said : ' I helped Banksy organise the event but took a bit of a back seat and got pretty drunk on the day if I remember rightly . '
In 1999 Banksy painted the now famous Mild Mild West sign , which shows a teddy bear with a Molotov cocktail in his hand , on a wall opposite Subway Records in Stokes Croft , Easton .
Jim Paine , founder of Subway Records , held the ladder .
' I knew Banksy from a while back , from the mid- to late Nineties when he was sharing a house in Easton , a couple of streets from me , ' he said in Wright 's book .
After spending some months in London , Banksy returned to Bristol in February 2000 for his first art exhibition , at the Severnshed restaurant - a former boatshed designed by Brunel .
His work sold out on the opening night .
' It was the first time he had done work on canvas , ' curator Robert Birse told us last week .
' He did n't have a clue how to make canvas stretch or prepare the artwork so we helped him with that side of it , but he had a very strong idea of what he wanted to do .
' I do n't even know his name .
He has a number of pseudonyms he gives to people he 's working with , but at the time he only let his oldest mates in on everything .
I presume I gave him cash [ the proceeds of works he sold ] .
I could have written him a cheque without a name on it or I could have given him cash . '
Banksy moved to London around the turn of the millennium , once again at the same time as a certain Robin Gunningham .
Robin lived in a flat in Kingsland Road , Hackney , East London , with Jamie Eastman , who worked for Bristol 's Hombre record label .
Banksy drew a number of the record company 's album covers .
In 2001 Banksy had his first unofficial London exhibition at which he spray - painted 12 works on to the whitewashed walls of a tunnel in Rivington , Shoreditch .
But it was his show Turf War , in July 2003 , held in a warehouse just yards from Robin Gunningham 's flat , that put Banksy on the map .
The exhibition included live pigs and a heifer sprayed with an Andy Warhol likeness .
The Queen was depicted as a chimp .
An animal rights activist chained herself to the railings in protest but the RSPCA gave its approval to the show .
That same year Banksy shuffled into the Tate dressed as a pensioner and glued a picture to the wall - it stayed there for two - and - a - half hours - and demonstrated against the Iraq War .
He had arrived .
He has since sold works to singer Christina Aguilera , who bought three , including a pornographic picture of Queen Victoria with a prostitute , for £ 25,000 .
Hollywood actress Angelina Jolie blew £ 200,000 on his art in 2006 - among the works was a £ 120,000 twist on a Manet painting in which a white family lunch under an umbrella watched by 15 starving Africans .
Banksy 's works have also appeared in movies such as Children Of Men and Shoot ' Em Up , and he has sold Space Girl & Bird , the artwork for Blur 's Think Tank album , to a bidder from America for a record £ 288,000 .
For someone so anonymous he has a very high profile .
But where is Robin Gunningham , the mysterious figure whose whereabouts no one now knows but who crops up in numerous official records and always in the same place as Banksy , and at the same time ?
The man whose photograph was recognised by his former neighbour Anthony Hallett - although the same photograph was identified by several other sources as being of Banksy ?
The man who Camilla Stacey , along with several other contacts who wished to remain anonymous , told us actually was Banksy ?
It was time to find Robin 's parents to see if they could help .
His mother Pamela lives in a neat modern bungalow in a village outside Bristol .
After identifying ourselves , we asked her if she had a son called Robin .
Her reaction was very odd .
We showed her the Jamaica photograph and she was visibly startled , but said she did n't recognise the man in the photograph , to whom she bears more than a passing resemblance .
We asked if she could put us in touch with him .
' I'm afraid I do n't know how to get in contact with him , ' she said .
So she did have a son called Robin ?
' No , I do n't .
I do n't have a son at all . '
We asked her if she had any other children .
' Yes , a daughter . '
But no son and certainly not a son who went to Bristol Cathedral School ?
' No , ' she said , and went on to deny she was Pamela Gunningham , insisting that the electoral roll must be incorrect .
Our conversation with Peter Gunningham , who now lives in a gated development in the suburb of Kingsdown , was equally baffling .
Again , we presented the photograph of Banksy / Robin Gunningham .
Mr Gunningham said he did n't recognise the person in the picture .
We told him that we believed his son to be Banksy .
' No , ' he replied .
' I can't help you , really . '
Mr Gunningham politely continued to deny that his son was Banksy but his manner was almost playful .
He refused to give us any information about Robin .
It was all very strange .
Had the couple never heard of Banksy or Robin Gunningham , one might have expected a reaction of complete bewilderment .
This did not seem to be the case .
We then contacted Banksy 's public relations officer who , in the best Banksy tradition , neither confirmed nor denied the story but promised to get back to us .
At the time of going to press , we were still waiting to hear .
Banksy once told Swindle magazine : ' I have no interest in ever coming out .
I figure there are enough self - opinionated a** holes trying to get their ugly little faces in front of you as it is . '
Given Banksy 's long - standing success at covering his tracks , there is , of course , the possibility that the trail we have been following is a red herring , a complex set - up .
But if it is , it must be the most elaborate such ruse ever concocted .
And if it is , where is Robin Gunningham ?

The Pirate Bay has rolled out a new feature which allows users to add tags to the torrents they upload .
The tags will make it easier to structure and discover new content , and it gives users the opportunity to form tag based groups .
Although tags are fairly common for blogs and other online publications , The Pirate Bay is one of the first BitTorrent sites to implement this feature .
The purpose is to make it easier for users to discover content they are interested in , and structure and organize torrents more easily .
The tag cloud still has to be filled , but when it does , Pirate Bay users will have the option to browse through tag based archives .
In the days to come , support for tag based RSS feeds will be added , and the option to browse tags per category .
Among other things , the tags will allow users to form micro communities within the site , as Pirate Bay co-founder Peter Sunde explained : “ Let ’s say I run a small movie club or whatever , just tag the uploads with my club name and it will be on the same page .
The new feature adds genres to all the stuff as well , and i’m making a tag browser per category . ”
Peter further told TorrentFreak that they will be introducing some more additions to the site this weekend .
The new tag feature marks the end of a turbulent week , with many hours of downtime , which should be over by now .
In a few weeks , The Bay plans to move some servers , but until then , the site should remain up and running .
Stay tuned for updates .
For those who are interested , The Pirate Bay “ road movie ” , documenting their trip with the Bureau of Piracy to Bolzano , is available for download now .

After the last post on incommensurability , Mike provided a link to a more theoretical discussion of Lakatos ’s and MacIntyre ’s objections to Kuhn .
In my opinion , the linked article is too abstract to provide any guidance .
The author favors MacIntyre ’s idea that a scientist moves from one paradigm to another when the old paradigm fails to meet its own objectives .
But it would be nice to have good examples of this ( maybe MacIntyre provides these ; I have n’t looked up his discussion ) .
Initially , I am skeptical that this ever happens ; smaller theories reach clear dead ends , but paradigms do n’t .
So what brings a scientist to switch from one paradigm to another ?
So far as I can see , it is the potential for new fields of ideas ( and publications ) .
This has been happening in the field of chaos theory .
Somebody develops a new toolkit , and pretty soon people start seeing ways to apply those tools to all sorts of different phenomena , and they publish like crazy .
No one wants to get left behind .
It ’s not that the new applications are clearly better , or that the old business is clearly worse .
It ’s just that the new is new and the old is old .
And the “ new ” is n’t merely arbitrary or hollow or fake : the new applications show something , or do something , that the old applications could n’t , so something new is being learned and uncovered .
What becomes critical is whether there is something we really need to get done that only the old application can provide .
With Ptolemy / Copernicus , eventually the answer became “ no ” — everything we needed Ptolemy for could be done by Copernicus ( at least after Kepler ) .
But with chaos , the answer is still “ yes ” — we still need linear dynamics and Newtonian determinism for lots of tasks , so chaos will not be taking over anytime soon .
In the meantime , it is a fertile ground for new publications .
Sometimes , I imagine , the old paradigm gets discarded not because the new one can do everything it could do , but because our needs and interests change .
So we no longer need the old services , thank you very much .
So maybe one “ need ” keeping Ptolemy around was our interest in astrology .
As that need faded , so too did Ptolemy .
( I ’m making up that example ; I do n’t know the history of astrology well enough to know if this is indeed the case . )
So can we say that new paradigms are always “ true -er ” ?
Not exactly .
We can say that they are a better fit for our needs ( and they could n’t do that without being linked up to truth in some way ) , and the old paradigms no longer provide that fit .
This is a continuation of Python object graphs .
import gc import inspect import types import weakref import os
I 've already mentioned gc and inspect .
types and weakref help me distinguish certain kinds of objects .
os is needed to spawn dot to generate an image from the textual graph description .
def show_backrefs ( objs , max_depth = 3 , extra_ignore =( ) , filter = None , too_many = 10 ) :
This function starts from a given object ( or a list of objects ) and follows the reference chains backwards , up to a given maximal depth .
The extra_ignore argument is the same as for find_backref_chain , which I explained earlier .
The filter argument serves the same function , but instead of explicitly listing all the id of the objects I want to ignore here I can pass a function that takes an object and returns
True if that object is interesting .
This would be useful if I wanted to ignore all objects of a certain class , but it turned out I actually did n't need this .
Finally , too_many defines the branching factor after which new extra references to the same object would just clutter the graph too much to be useful .
if not isinstance ( objs , ( list , tuple ) ) : objs = [ objs ]
For convenience , I accept either a single object , or a list of objects .
f = file ( ' objects.dot ' , 'w ' )
It 's not nice to hardcode filenames , but this is debugging code .
Different quality standards apply .
print >> f , ' digraph ObjectGraph {' print >> f , ' node [ shape=box , style=filled , fillcolor=white ] ; '
This is what graphviz files look like .
I 'm setting up some attribute defaults .
queue = [ ] depth = {}
The standard BFS elements again .
ignore = set ( extra_ignore ) ignore .
add ( id ( objs ) ) ignore .
add ( id ( extra_ignore ) ) ignore .
add ( id ( queue ) ) ignore .
add ( id ( depth ) ) ignore .
add ( id ( ignore ) )
Do n't want the graphing code implementation to contaminate the graph itself .
for obj in objs : print >> f , ' % s[ fontcolor=red ] ; ' % ( obj_node_id ( obj ) ) depth [ id ( obj ) ] = 0 queue .
append ( obj )
Initialize the BFS data structures with our start points as well as making sure they are highlighted in red in the graph description file .
I 'll show the helper functions such as obj_node_id after the main function .
gc . collect ()
Just to make sure we have no collectable garbage lying around .
nodes = 0 while queue : nodes += 1 target = queue . pop ( 0 )
The standard BFS loop
tdepth = depth [ id ( target ) ] print >> f , ' % s[ label= " %s " ] ; ' % ( obj_node_id ( target ) , obj_label ( target , tdepth ) )
Nodes have labels , obviously .
h , s , v = gradient (( 0 , 0 , 1 ) , ( 0 , 0 , . 3 ) , tdepth , max_depth ) if inspect .
ismodule ( target ) : h = . 3 s = 1 print >> f , ' % s[ fillcolor= " %g , %g , %g " ] ; ' % ( obj_node_id ( target ) , h , s , v )
Make the background color depend on the depth of an object , in a gradient from white to dark gray .
Except for modules , which we want to highlight in green ( hue 30 % or 108° , saturation 100 % , value inherited from the gradient ) .
Modules show the root source of a memory leak , in my case , and I want them to be easily noticeable .
if tdepth == max_depth : print >> f , ' %s[fontcolor=white ] ; ' % ( obj_node_id ( target ) )
The objects farthest away have the darkest background .
Switching to white font color improves contrast , lets me use a wider gradient , and also acts as a reminder that the graph is incomplete — truncated at these nodes .
if inspect .
ismodule ( target ) or tdepth >= max_depth : continue
Never look up references to modules -- we already found what we wanted , extra backreferences would just clutter up the graph .
Also stop if we 've reached the maximum desired depth .
referrers = gc .
get_referrers ( target ) ignore .
add ( id ( referrers ) )
We do n't want new objects created during the search to become part of the graph .
n = 0 for source in referrers : if inspect .
isframe ( source ) or id ( source ) in ignore : continue if filter and not filter ( source ) : continue
Ignore objects we were told to ignore , as well as stack frames ( for convenience ) .
elabel = edge_label ( source , target ) print >> f , ' %s -> %s%s ; ' % ( obj_node_id ( source ) , obj_node_id ( target ) , elabel )
Add the edge to the graph , with an optional label .
By the way , I really like the graph description language .
if id ( source ) not in depth : depth [ id ( source ) ] = tdepth + 1 queue .
append ( source )
Standard BFS steps .
n += 1 if n >= too_many : print >> f , ' % s[ color=red ] ; ' % obj_node_id ( target ) break
If we have too many references to a single object , avoid the Starship Enterprise graph , change the border color to red , and skip all further references to this particular object .
This is lossy , but it 's better than to get overwhelmed with too much information .
print >> f , " } " f . close ( ) print " Graph written to objects .
dot ( %d nodes ) " % nodes
Ta dah !
os . system ( " dot - Tpng objects.dot > objects.png " ) print " Image generated as objects .
png "
If you want to , you might start an image viewer too at this point .
Now the helper functions :
def obj_node_id ( obj ) : if isinstance ( obj , weakref . ref ) : return ' all_weakrefs_are_one ' return ( 'o %d ' % id ( obj ) ) .
replace ( ' -' , '_' )
Every graph node must have an alphanumeric ID in a graphviz dot file .
The ID cannot start with a number , and cannot contain minus signs , so we massage ids a bit .
The special case for weakref .ref objects is here because I once had a graph with 300 of them , and they each had exactly one reference and one backreference .
It was a lot of clutter for no value , so I thought I 'd merge them to a single node .
Later I saw this was n't enough ( see the Starship Enterprise above ) and added the too_many limit .
def obj_label ( obj ) : return quote ( type ( obj ) .
__name__ + ':
' + safe_repr ( obj ) + '
' + hex ( id ( obj ) ) + ' , d= %d ' % depth )
I show four things in the nodes : the type of the object , a short representation of the object , its id and its depth .
In retrospect , I think the last two do n't add enough value to pay for the space they take up .
def quote ( s ) : return s . replace ( " \\ " , " \\ \\ " ) . replace ( " \ " " , " \\ \ " " ) . replace ( "
" , " \\ n " )
Newlines , double quotes , and backslashes inside strings confuse graphviz and must be escaped .
def safe_repr ( obj ) : try : return short_repr ( obj ) except : return '( unrepresentable ) '
Generating object graphs is time - consuming , and it's not fun when a bug in you custom repr ( ) function causes it to fail .
def short_repr ( obj ) : if isinstance ( obj , ( type , types .
ModuleType , types .
BuiltinMethodType , types . BuiltinFunctionType ) ) : return obj .
__name__
This is going to be the pattern of this function : a series of if statements .
I use obj.__name__ instead of repr ( ) or str ( ) because the graph nodes already show the type of obj .
Repeating the same information and showing " type : < type ' str ' > " instead of " type : str " would be redundant and would make the graph nodes needlessly big .
if isinstance ( obj , types .
MethodType ) : if obj .
im_self is not None : return obj .
im_func .
__name__ + ' ( bound ) ' else : return obj .
im_func .
__name__
Distinguishing bound and unbound methods is a nice touch , even if I say so myself .
if isinstance ( obj , ( tuple , list , dict , set ) ) : return ' %d items ' % len ( obj )
This is perfectly sufficient for containers , since I already see the relevant references to contained objects as graph edges .
if isinstance ( obj , weakref . ref ) : return ' all_weakrefs_are_one '
See the comment about obj_node_id .
return repr ( obj ) [ : 40 ]
And here 's the fallback , generic case .
I limit the repr to 40 characters to avoid explosions .
def gradient ( start_color , end_color , depth , max_depth ) : if max_depth == 0 : return start_color h1 , s1 , v1 = start_color h2 , s2 , v2 = end_color f = float ( depth ) / max_depth h = h1 * ( 1 - f ) + h2 * f s = s1 * ( 1 - f ) + s2 * f v = v1 * ( 1 - f ) + v2 * f return h , s , v
A pretty simple linear gradient function .
I happen to use HSV color space here , but it would work just as well with RGB .
I was seduced by the thought of making rainbow gradients , but it turned out to be impractical with the low number of gradient steps I had .
def edge_label ( source , target ) :
I 'm really proud of this idea .
if isinstance ( target , dict ) and target is getattr ( source , ' __dict__ ' , None ) : return ' [ label= " __dict__ " , weight=10 ] '
It 's easy to recognize an object 's __dict__ and then instruct graphviz to put the dict node close to the object node ( edge weight of 10 makes it shorter ) .
elif isinstance ( source , dict ) : for k , v in source .
iteritems ( ) : if v is target and isinstance ( k , str ) : return ' [ label= " %s " , weight =2 ] ' % quote ( k )
If we know that a dict refers to some object , we have to see if that object is a key or a value .
If it 's a value , and if the key is a string , why not show it as a label on the graph edge ?
When the source dict is something 's __dict__ , we get to see the names of the attributes that keep references to other objects , and this is extremely useful .
return ''
The boring default : no edge label .
That 's it .
Here 's the module in its entirety : objgraph.py .
Update : the module now has its own home page , source repository , and everything at https://mg.pov.lt/objgraph.
And here 's a sample object graph :
By the way , if you wonder how the BrowserRequest and BrowserResponse objects can point to each other without intermediate __dict__ objects , the answer is that they use slots .

It is with great pleasure that I ’m able to announce Haiku ( rev26666 ) runs on the Asus EEEPC !
I own a 701 model , and have sporadically been testing out Haiku revisions on the machine .
For months I ’ve been unable to boot Haiku , but somewhere along the line , the bug I filed got squashed , and Haiku will boot off the machine ’s internal 4 gb fixed disk !
I have two partitions on the machine .
One bfs partition of 250 mb , and the rest a FAT32 that Windows XP occupies .
I installed Haiku via a Vmware BeOS virtual machine ( running in Windows XP ) and access to the bfs physical partition , and then copying the contents of a nightly build over to the partition .
Then added the operating system to the NT bootloader using bootpart .

And here is the evidence ( sorry for the quality ) :
WASHINGTON  A little strategically placed makeup quickly turns the wimpiest of male barn swallows into chick magnets , amping up their testosterone and even trimming their weight , new research shows .
It 's a " clothes make the man " lesson that — with some caveats — also applies to human males , researchers say .
Using a $ 5.99 marker , scientists darkened the rust - colored breast feathers of male New Jersey barn swallows , turning lighter birds to the level of those naturally darkest .
They had already found , in a test three years ago , that the marked - up males were more attractive to females and mated more often .
This time they found out that the more attractive appearance , at least in the bird world , triggered changes to the animals ' body chemistry , increasing testosterone .
" Other females might be looking at them as being a little more sexy , and the birds might be feeling better about themselves in response to that , " said study co-author Kevin McGraw , an evolutionary biology professor at Arizona State University .
McGraw said the findings are surprising , in part because the hormonal changes occurred after only one week .
The study was published in Tuesday 's edition of the journal Current Biology .
' CURRENT BIOLOGY ' STUDY : Sexual signal exaggeration affects physiological state in male barn swallows
In the 30 male barn swallows who were darkened , testosterone was up 36 % after one week , during a time of year when levels of that hormone would normally drop .
At the same time , testosterone levels in the 33 birds that did n't get the coloring treatment fell by half , said lead author Rebecca Safran , an evolutionary biology professor at the University of Colorado in Boulder .
" It 's the ' clothes make the man " ' idea , Safran said .
" It 's like you walk down the street and you 're driving a Rolls Royce and people notice .
And your physiology accommodates this . "
Before you feel superior to these birds , Safran cautioned , people 's mating systems are more similar to birds ' than we might like to admit .
Barn swallows are " socially monogamous and genetically promiscuous , same as humans , " she said .
" There are some interesting parallels , but we do need to be careful about making them . "
In people , hormonal changes have been observed after changes in behavior .
A 1998 study found that loyal male fans of sports teams experienced a 20 % rise in testosterone when their teams won .
The researchers are n't certain how the testosterone boost happens .
It could be that because of the darkened color , the birds mate more often and that changes their testosterone levels .
It could also be that because of the darkened color , other males think the pecking order has changed and that boosts the darker swallows ' hormone levels .
Or it could be both .
The authors said figuring out which theory is right is the next step .
The birds ' weight loss is more easily explained , Safran said .
The more macho swallows could be spending more time mating than eating or working off the calories , she said .
Most of the time it 's the hormones that change the behavior or appearance , but this work shows " it can go more than one way , " said study co-author James Adelman , a Princeton University researcher .
" It certainly is a very new and interesting finding , " said Cornell University psychology and neurobiology professor Elizabeth Adkins - Regan , who had no role in the study .

Cisco has dug a little into its pocket to purchase privately held Pure Networks , a Seattle - based provider of home networking - management software and tools .
Pure Networks , which will be integrated into Linksys , enables consumers to set up a home network connecting a range of devices , applications and services , says Cisco .
Pure already partners with Cisco to provide the software infrastructure and tools used to create the Linksys Easy Link Advisor ( LELA ) , aimed at smoothing the process of organizing and managing a home network , according to Cisco .
The network giant will pay approximately $ 120 million in exchange for all shares of Pure Networks and the purchase is expected to close in Cisco 's first quarter of fiscal year 2009 .

[ UPDATE 7/31 : See additional context on Google ’s own energy thirst below . ]
David M. Herszenhorn , who covers Congress , sent me a note from Washington today on an interesting hearing held to explore the role of efficiency in cutting Americans ’ expensive energy appetite .
Here ’s David ’s report :
WASHINGTON -– Dan Reicher , Google ’s guru of all things related to energy and the environment , came to Capitol Hill on Wednesday with some ideas on how to keep Earth from overheating and poor families from freezing this winter in the face of sky - high prices for heating oil .
A central proposal , laid out in testimony before the Joint Economic Committee , was a national program aimed at cutting heat and electricity bills in 10 million low - income homes over a decade .
The existing federal “ weatherization ” program saw its Energy Department budget eliminated recently .
The hearing was called “ Efficiency : The Hidden Secret to Solving Our Energy Crisis . ”
Senator Charles E. Schumer , Democrat of New York and chairman of the joint committee , said he planned to include the weatherization proposal in a bill later this year .
“ I am very interested in the low - income home weatherization program , ” he said .
“ And I ’m going to put in some legislation to move it up . ”
Over in the main part of the Capitol , lawmakers have been locked in a bitter stalemate over energy policy , with Republicans pushing for increased oil exploration , including expanded offshore drilling .
Democrats , meanwhile , insist that drilling should be limited to existing leases on federal lands .
Both sides say efforts to produce energy from renewable sources should be vastly increased , but they disagree on how to do so .
Mr. Reicher offered an array of ideas to a mostly receptive panel of lawmakers .
In addition to weatherizing 10 million homes for low - income Americans , which he said would cost about $ 2 billion annually , he also said Congress should establish a mechanism called the Energy Efficiency Resource Standard that would set efficiency resource targets for electricity and gas suppliers over a given period of time .
He also called for a national “ renewable portfolio standard ” to increase the amount of electricity produced by sources other than fossil fuels .
Some two dozen states have a hodgepodge of such requirements now for their utilities .
This issue has divided Congress deeply in recent years .
Other proposals included a greater focus on boosting fuel efficiency , the improvement of electric cars and increased tax incentives for the construction of energy - efficient buildings .
Perhaps Mr. Reicher ’s most intriguing comment , though , was his observation on the role that information technology will play in helping solve the nation ’s energy problems .
“ The increasing interplay between energy hardware and information software — and the corresponding rise of the Internet and the connectivity it brings — adds to the potential to make and to use energy more productively , ” Mr. Reicher said .
“ From smart meters and smart appliances to smart homes and a smart grid , we are poised to significantly advance our ability to monitor and manage energy . ”
Presumably Google foresees a role in helping consumers or companies do this .
It ’s already aggressively pursuing investments in what it calls “ Renewable Energy Cheaper than Coal . ”
Mr. Reicher directs climate and energy initiatives at Google.org , the company ’s philanthropic arm , which has been capitalized with more than $ 1 billion in Google stock to address the issues of climate change , global poverty and global health .
UPDATE , 7/31 : Google , of course , is large and fast growing user of energy .
The company has been building large data centers — warehouse sized buildings with rows upon rows of computers that can deliver search results , YouTube videos , email and a growing array of digital goodies — around the United States and the world .
Google does not disclose its own energy use or carbon “ footprint . ”
( Yahoo does disclose its carbon dioxide emissions . )
Collectively , data centers accounted for 1.5 percent of all electricity used in the United States in 2006 .
Even though Google is believed to have one of the largest collections of data centers of any company , its energy use likely accounts for a small fraction of that total .
In his testimony , Mr. Reicher addressed the company ’s electricity appetite : “ At Google we have been working to lower the cost and increase the deployment of renewable energy , and to accelerate the deployment of plug - in vehicles .
We have also been working to increase our use of clean power and energy efficiency at Google data centers and offices in the U.S. and other countries .
Together with other technology companies and organizations , Google launched the Climate Savers Computing Initiative last year to reduce the power consumption of computers and servers . ”
Uma Thurman Suing French Cosmetics Giant for $ 15 Million
was an exclusive spokesmodel for the French cosmetics maker Lancome from 2000 to 2005 .
The actress and model penned a multimillion dollar deal with Lancome that gave them permission to use her likeness to sell their products .
When the contract ended her face continued to show up on ads in Asia and Canada .
Thurman , through her lawyer Burt Fields , has filed a lawsuit asking for $ 15 million in compensation .
The actress and her legal team first attempted to handle the problem without filing suit but where blindsided when the cosmetics giant filed suit against them .
In an attempt to quickly counter the initial claim , Lancome filed a lawsuit with the State Supreme Court of Manhattan asking a judge to rule that the company did not wrongfully use her image .
In their legal brief , they claim that they did not knowingly use her images after Thurman 's contract ended and immediately removed the images upon being notified of the situation .
Prior to filing Thurman 's suit , her lawyer said :
Look at the huge free benefit Lancôme gets from using her .
The French want to accept that benefit without paying for it .
Obviously , the French have decided they wo n't even try to resolve this amicably , so they have filed this sneak attack . "
Lancome 's action came two days after Thurman 's stalker fan , , was convicted of harassing the actress .
The judge in that case has ordered that Jordan will remain in custody and undergo a complete psychological evaluation .
He will be sentenced next month .

A complaint published by U.S. Senator Sam Brownback of Kansas claims that the government of China has ordered Beijing hotels to spy on guests during the Olympics .
The complaint mentions the use of software and an appliance but does not mention the specific technology .
( Now there is a sale the vendors are going to keep quiet ) .
This is not news of course .
Any visitor to China has noticed the active censorship they practice on web browsing and assumes that they are monitoring at least failed attempts .
On my recent visit I tried to Google " Tibet " and " Falun Gong " ( dissident Chinese group ) with remarkably different results than from here in the good old US of A .
This is not a practice unique to China either .
Anecdotal evidence abounds on French spying and wire tapping for the purpose of furthering their nationalized industries .
And yes , the US actively engages in spying on Internet traffic and warrantless wire taps .
As state sponsored spying and censorship is a reality how best should one protect ones data when traveling abroad ?
Here are my top ten tips :
1. Keep your laptops , PDAs and cell phones within sight at all times .
Locking them in a hotel safe is useless if the local government is targeting you .
2. Encrypt all unique data on your laptop .
Lots of great products to do this .
3 . Use passwords on your PDAs and cell phones .
A big hassle .
But you can turn it off when you are safe at home .
And , btw , your phone probably wo n't work in China anyway .
Check beforehand with your carrier .
4 . Do n't do anything to arouse the ire of the Chinese government .
If you are a journalist do n't research that article you are writing on Olympic terrorism from the hotel room .
You might get a loud knock on the door .
5 . I have not tested this but I have thought about how to bypass the Chinese censorship next time I go to China ( assuming my visa is not revoked after writing this ) .
Set up GOtoMyPC at home or your office if your policies allow it .
Use a good password .
Do not have sensitive information on that home PC or network .
You do not want to lead the Chinese Cyber Spies to your home !
Then simply connect to that PC from your hotel and use it to go to whatever site you need to on the Internet , like CNN.com or whatever .
6 . You can also try anonymizer sites .
Go here for a huge list .
Careful , site seems shady .
If you are using IE I would not try it .
But hey , anyone reading my blog would be using FireFox anyway .
Of course the major URL filtering services already know and can block access to these sites .
7 . For secure communication use a VPN .
I would try this but would not have much hope for it working .
Both IPSec and SSL will probably be blocked .
8. Encrypt your email .
This is easier .
I doubt the Chinese will block encrypted email .
But , they may block all email protocols ( POP , IMAP , SMTP ) in an attempt to prevent this .
Try it .
9. Encrypt your message .
Ca n't use your email software ?
Take your message , documents , images , videos and encrypt them locally .
Upload them to your gmail or Yahoo ! email account .
Do n't worry , although both Google and Yahoo ! are guilty of assisting the Chinese government in suppressing free expression they cannot turn over your encryption keys .
They wo n't have them .
10 . Finally .
If you can not trust the network you are on go around it .
Make a long distance phone call to your home base and use a dial up connection .
It is expensive and you wo n't be watching Youtube videos but you will be able to encrypt your traffic with no fear of prying government eyes .
It is disturbing that we have to think along these lines .
But one good thing will come of all this state sponsored snooping .
The use of encryption will finally start to take off !

For various sites I often want to create a narrow gradient image .
This site has two , for example , the grey background gradient and the purple header gradient .
Rather than having to open up a drawing tool every time I want to create one of these , I thought I 'd write a Python script to generate a PNG of a gradient according to declarative specifications .
The result is
Only linear gradients are currently supported although you can have any number of them at different vertical offsets and it's easy to modify the code to support other gradient functions .
The code itself is 50 lines long and has no dependencies other than the standard library .
I 've included some samples based on the gradients on jtauber.com and Pinax .
For example , this gradient :
is produced with the following code :
write_png ( " test2.png " , 50 , 90 , gradient ( [ ( 0.43 , ( 0xBF , 0x94 , 0xC0 ) , ( 0x4C , 0x26 , 0x4C ) ) , # top ( 0.85 , ( 0x4C , 0x26 , 0x4C ) , ( 0x27 , 0x13 , 0x27 ) ) , # bottom ( 1.0 , ( 0x66 , 0x66 , 0x66 ) , ( 0xFF , 0xFF , 0xFF ) ) , # shadow ] ) )
The 30 - line write_png function could also be used more generally for generating any RGB PNGs .
But sometimes a movie comes along and takes on special meaning because it 's based on a true story , and so we watch with rapt attention knowing that some real dude lived through all the awesomeness on screen .
But if you 're going to go with the " Based On A True Story " tag , all we ask is that you make the stories sort of , you know , true .
You can do that , right ?
We do n't ask a lot from our movies .
A nice story , maybe with some sex , violence and Batman thrown in .
7 The Pursuit of Happyness
Continue Reading Below Advertisement
The Hollywood Version :
Chris Gardner is a hard - working man with a pain - in - the - ass wife and an adorable little son boasting one of the greatest afros we 've ever seen on a child .
All Gardner wants to do is make enough of a living to provide for his son .
Through what we assume is black magic , he solves a Rubik 's Cube in record time , wowing an employee at Dean Witter and he apparently passes the only test needed to qualify a man to become a stock broker .
He toils for months , sleeping in subways and churches with his son at his side , but in the end it all pays off when he claims the one and only opening at Dean Witter , crying tears of joy and getting jiggy wit it in the streets of San Francisco .

In reality ...
Gardner did get a chance to show his stuff in the Dean Witter training program ( though we 're sad to report his acceptance had nothing to do with solving a colorful puzzle game ) .
But , as the more honest book version points out , he apparently was n't quite the father the film made him out to be .
First , he was so focused on getting a job and earning his first million that , well , he actually did n't even know where the hell his son was for the first four months of the program .
Chris , Jr. was apparently living at this point in time with his mother , Jackie .
Did we mention that the boy had been conceived when Gardner was still married to another woman ?

In addition , instead of being arrested just before his big interview due to parking tickets ... well , it seems that Chris was actually arrested after Jackie accused him of domestic violence .
" That 's right son , you gotta keep that pimp hand strong . "
Do n't get us wrong , Chris did indeed get his life turned around after landing the job as a broker .
There were just some things in Gardner 's past that they could n't quite bring themselves to have Will Smith do on screen .
Like selling drugs ( as Gardner admits he did briefly ) , or doing cocaine with his mistress , with little doses of PCP and a hearty helping of Mary Jane tossed in for good measure .

Adulterous sex ?
Cocaine ?
Neglecting your child for months at a time ?
It says something about the man that he did n't drop the pursuit , despite having pretty much found happyness already .
Update
Even the dark lords of 80s metal listen to the blogosphere these days .
After coming in for serious online criticism over the decision to lean on bloggers who had posted reviews of new Metallica tracks ( tracks which they had been invited to listen to and which were not covered by an NDA ) , the band has posted a statement on its website .
" Once we re-surfaced on Tuesday after a few weeks on tour in Europe , we were informed that someone at Q Prime ( our managers ) had made the error of asking a few publications to take down reviews of the rough mixes from the new record that were posted on their sites , " they wrote .
" Our response was ' WHY ?!!!
Why take down mostly positive reviews of the new material and prevent people from getting psyched about the next record ... that makes no sense to us ! ' "
And if something " makes no sense " to Metallica , there 's a pretty good chance it 's not a real coherent idea .
So , after a good " ear spank " of its management , the band posted links to the reviews in question .
The Quietus , a new music blog that had initially covered the album , was pleased by the news .
" Because of their magnanimous behaviour we'd like to apologize for suggesting that they were insane and for claiming that they had n't done a good album since the tragic death of Cliff Burton — arrant nonsense by anyone 's standards , let alone our own . "
Original story
Given all that Metallica has done , said , and been through in the last 20 years , what could they still do that would lead bloggers to ask , " What the hell is wrong with Metallica ? "
In this case , the answer is fairly pedestrian but still dumb : censor bloggers .
Here 's the scenario : internationally known heavy metal band with long history in the business invites music critics in London to listen to six tracks off the band 's forthcoming album .
Those critics then write reviews based on what they 've heard .
Despite the total lack of any non-disclosure agreements and the fact that the band must have known what it was doing , its management then contacted the blogs in question and asked them to take down the reviews .
Rock .
On .
Actually , " asked " may be a polite way of putting it .
The music blog Blinded by the Hype contacted The Quietus , one of the blogs that had run a review , wondering what had happened to the piece .
The answer , from editor Luke Turner , was clear .
" The Quietus kept our article up the longest and , as no nondisclosure agreement had been signed , " he wrote , " [ we were ] not prepared to remove it merely due to the demands of Metallica 's management .
We only removed the article earlier today to protect the professional interests of the writer concerned . "
Metallica 's management and PR team knew who the ( anonymous ) writer of the piece was , as they invited him ; if they chose to do so , they could probably make his livelihood more difficult to earn in the future .
The Quietus decided to pull the review and replace it with a cheeky note and an old interview with the band .
Wired 's Listening Post blog , which has followed the story , notes that this is n't just about being jerks ; management claims that the tracks in question were a rough mix that were n't ready for prime time , which perfectly explains why they invited journalists to come hear them .
Metallica has acquired a reputation for hating the Internet , which is n't really true — the band does have a website and it did finally come to iTunes — but the band invited derision from fans with its stance against Napster back in the day .
( As a metal band , Metallica of course has long stood up for the principles of fair play , buying your music at retail prices , and not being a rebel . )
Surely , the band 's handlers know that these sorts of things have long shelf lives , as evidenced in the new press coverage ( Metallica 's stance against Napster was mentioned every time ) , so it 's pretty mysterious why they would continue to perpetuate the image of Metallica as the cranky curmudgeons of pre-Internet rock .
...unless this is all a genius move to keep Metallica 's name in the news and drum up buzz for a new album that I , for one , had no idea was even in the works .
Could Your Bank Fail ?
by Bill Sardi by Bill Sardi
DIGG THIS
My wife and I took my 4 - year - old son to a children ’s theater this weekend to watch a live presentation of Robin Hood ( rob from the rich , give to the poor ) .
The mother of one of my young son ’s playmates said she is ready to go on a long - planned vacation .
I asked where she does her banking .
Her answer : Downey Savings and Washington Mutual ( WAMU ) .
Good God , Downey savings is at the top of the list of banks predicted to fold and Washington Mutual is burdened with the prospect that many of its customers with adjustable rate mortgages , which will be re-set in the coming months , wo n’t be able to make their monthly mortgage payments .
Most of my friends and acquaintances are oblivious to what is going on in America .
Re-setting of adjustable rate mortgages triggers the collapse
What IS going on is approximately 600 billion dollars ’ worth of subprime adjustable rate mortgages ( ARMs ) will go through rate - resetting between now and the end of 2008 .
About 15 % of these ARMs are predicted to default , representing $ 75 billion of mortgages that banks will have as non-performing loans on their books , which will be reflected in their quarterly earnings reports .
The stock price of these banks will then tumble and depositors will run to withdraw their funds from checking and savings accounts .
Since most banks have no more than 10 % of their depositors ’ funds in cash ( the rest has been loaned out ) , even a small run on the bank could leave a bank with no cash .
When the FDIC becomes insolvent , now what ?
So what happens if nearly every bank in America is calling on the Federal Deposit Insurance Company ( FDIC ) to bail them out at the same time ?
The FDIC , which insures your bank deposits , sees the handwriting on the wall .
It does n’t have enough funds ( $ 52.8 billion ) in reserve to cover trillions of dollars in bank deposits .
According to Wikipedia , as of June 2008 the FDIC insures 8471 banking institutions with total deposits of $ 8.575 trillion ( March 31 , 2008 deposit figures ) .
The IndyMac bank failure will swallow up $ 4— 8 billion of the FDIC ’s treasure chest and there are 300 other banks at risk of failure that represent another $ 26.8 billion of deposits the FDIC has to ensure .
The failure of a large bank , like WAMU ( $ 160 billion in deposits , with only $ 15 billion in cash reserves ) , would totally deplete the FDIC insurance fund by itself .
Sheila Bair , FDIC chairwoman , trying to head off an unprecedented banking disaster , is calling for banks to take all homes covered in ARMS right now and freeze the rates / and or convert them to a fixed rate product .
Bank implosion not impossible
Martin Hutchinson , writing in the Asia Times , says " It is thus not impossible for the entire US banking system to implode . "
( The Bear ’s Lair , July 16 , 2008 )
Hutchinson also points out that Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac , the two institutions that are supposed to guarantee home mortgages , require a bailout that prompted the Federal Reserve chairman to offer them a temporary lifeline — access to the discount window at the Fed , which supplies the nation with money .
Freddie Mac seeks $ 5.5 billion of outside capital , but who would put money into this sinking ship ?
The American public is being asked to provide $ 100 billion to bail out Freddie and Fannie , which means you as a citizen are now bailing out other people ’s bad loans !
The life ring thrown to Freddie and Fannie by the Federal Reserve is only temporary .
Congress must now vote on proposed legislation that would throw the burden of this whole mess upon the taxpayers .
Recognize Freddie and Fannie own or guarantee nearly half of the nation ’s $ 12 trillion in mortgages .
A bigger crisis lies ahead , say the experts .
Freddie and Fannie will be back in the headlines later this year .
This means a giant implosion is only being delayed .
Why should taxpayers bail out Freddie and Fannie ?
Hutchinson says " There can be no economic justification for the government guaranteeing the great majority of the nation ’s home mortgages , and the spurious u2018 government - sponsored enterprise ’ structure of Fannie and Freddie merely hides the likely consequences of their default . "
Hutchinson goes on to say : " Fannie and Freddie do not represent the entire US finance sector , far from it .
Nevertheless their insolvency would further erode confidence in the rest of the sector , very likely leading to a cascade of death spirals among other institutions .
After all , the best - run large non-global US bank , Wachovia , has itself got in trouble by its insanely foolish acquisition of the California mortgage lender Golden West Financial at the peak of the market in 2006 , while Bank of America , the largest retail - oriented US bank , voluntarily took on more of the mess by its purchase of the diseased and probably criminal Countrywide Financial as recently as last January . "
Says Hutchinson : " Thus a total collapse of the US financial system , while not inevitable , is a contingency which should now be planned for . "
Liar ’s loans to be banned , but not soon
The Federal Reserve has a belated answer for all this .
It has put its foot down and will invoke a rule banning subprime " liar ’s loans " — those loans where loan institutions overlooked the ability of borrowers to repay , and borrowers simply wrote down unconfirmed income numbers on their loan applications ( sometimes the lender ’s just scratched these number in themselves ) .
Well , that ’s a long - needed fix , but for unexplained reasons the Fed wo n’t put it into effect till October 1 , 2009 .
( Fed Prohibits subprime u2018 liar ’s loans ’ , Holden Lewis , Bankrate.com )
News media and bank insolvency
Harry Koza , senior Canadian markets analyst at Thomson Financial , says the IndyMac bank failure has " barely got any news coverage outside of California papers . "
( IndyMac bank run : a sign of things to come ?
Globe and Mail , July 18 , 2008 )
Is the news media intentionally blacking out the IndyMac bank failure to areas outside of California ?
It is obvious that any censorship is an attempt to calm the public from running to pull their money out of their accounts .
Oh , the news media has broken ranks to publish what is called " The Texas ratio , " which is a measure that fairly accurately predicts whether a bank will fail .
The " Texas ratio , " coined from a tool used to predict bank failures in Texas banks in the 1980s , is calculated by dividing the value of a lender ’s non-performing leans by the sum of its tangible equity capital and loan loss reserves .
A few smaller banks made it on this list in what appears to be an effort to wipe out the small banks while the larger banks grab market share .
What ’s the Texas ratio for large banks like Wachovia , WAMU , etc ?
IndyMac Bancorp
Inc argued its " Texas ratio " had been unfairly calculated ( it was around 140 % , anything over 100 is a predictable collapse of the bank ) .
So the Texas Ratio accurately predicted the IndyMac collapse .
Using data gleaned from Wachovia ’s Quarterly SEC 10 - Q filing , ending March 2008 , shows a Texas Ratio of 78 % , which is down from 84 % last quarter , but these are dated figures now , and their loan loss reserves declined , and most of their ARM loans are now being readjusted upwards , so anticipate many non-performing mortgage loans at Wachovia .
Nobody has uttered a word about this , but if the prospect of insolvency is pointed at smaller banks , and leaks of such information prompts the public to run and demand withdrawal of their funds from these institutions , the depositors will likely take their money and open accounts at bigger and seemingly safer banks .
The FDIC has sufficient funds ( ~$ 53 billion ) to cover the deposits at these small banks should they become insolvent , and this would infuse billions into the banking giants .
This appears to be what is happening by the leak of a list of smaller local and regional banks at the top of the " Texas Ratio " list and the indiscretion by Senator Charles Schumer ( NY ) , member of the Senate Banking Committee , who publicly disclosed to the news press a letter he wrote to regulators about the financial status of IndyMac Bancorp , which resulted in a run on that bank ’s deposits .
Restricting bank withdrawals
The banking industry is walking on pins and needles , hoping the bad news does n’t become a self - fulfilling prophecy that drives bank depositors to demand withdrawal of funds en masse .
Try to withdraw $ 10,000 from your bank today and you are likely to be told you can only withdraw $ 5000 at a time .
The banks know .
The news media knows .
The FDIC knows .
The Federal Reserve knows .
But DO YOU know ?
There is a high likelihood the American banking system will fail , and you will likely be the last to know .
The more panicked you get , and withdraw funds , the worse the implosion .
In an effort to avert runs on the banks , will the news media delay informing the public of the current dire situation , which appears to be an inevitable system - wide banking collapse ?
What to do ?
So , while your bank still has money and can process your checks , it may be time to pay down debts , pay quarterly taxes and mortgage payments in advance , and think of having money outside of banks ( gold , foreign currencies ) , etc. , before your money is inaccessible or even evaporates !
Do n’t think all your investments outside of banks are immune from all this turmoil .
For example , money market mutual funds , where Americans have invested $ 3 trillion , are not covered by FDIC insurance ( however , money market accounts offered by banks are covered ) .
Recent losses in some of these money market mutual funds have caused some companies to rush to plug the losses .
For example , Legg Mason Inc. and SunTrust Banks Inc. , recently pumped $ 1.4 billion each into its money market funds .
Bank of America Corp. has injected $ 600 million .
As for your checking and savings accounts , recognize you may have five different accounts in the same bank , but the FDIC only insures individuals , not each account , up to $ 100,000 .
Putting your money in different accounts in the same bank does not necessarily provide better insurance for your deposits .
Kathy M. Kristof of the Los Angeles Times offers a simplified explanation of what the FDIC does cover : " Knowing your insurance limits on bank accounts is key , " Los Angeles Times , July 20 , 2008 .
Finding a bank
There are bankers today who know their institutions are doomed to fail soon .
They will issue misleading press releases and put a positive spin on their financial status in a futile attempt to stave off a run on the bank by depositors for a time .
Which financial institutions will fail first ?
“ The only way to find out is for investors to push every institution toward failure and see which ones keep operating , ” says Joseph R. Mason , a financial economist at Louisiana State University in Baton Rouge .
( Investors are pushing institutions to the limits to assess risk .
Peter G. Gosselin , Los Angeles Times , July 20 , 2008 )
Ideally , find a bank that does not have any adjustable rate mortgages on its books , like Union Bank of California ( in the top 25 U.S. banks , has over 334 branches in California , Oregon and Washington ) .
Recognize , when you deposit money in a bank you agree to allow the bank to use most of it to loan to others and only keep 10 % of your money on hand for withdrawal .
Banks operate on the supposition depositors wo n’t all need their accounts turned into cash withdrawals at the same time .
Will we ever address the underlying cause ?

Usually I am using buildout for doing all my Python development work which is great as it gives you a flexible sandbox for developing .
One problem might strike you though if you upgrade your subversion installation to 1.5 as I just did .
When running buildout again a la
bin/buildout
you might encounter an error like this :
NameError : global name ' log ' is not defined
and buildout to stop .
As far as I digged into it and read on mailinglists this has to do with a different format of the .svn/entries of Subversion 1.5 ( setuptools uses this to check version numbers afaik ) .
This bug seems to be fixed in the setuptools trunk in subversion but no release is made yet .
So in order to get this fixed what I did was the following ( there is probably a better way to do this but I was too lazy to dig into this further as this only is supposed to be a temporary workaround anyway ) :
Check out the setuptools trunk : svn co http://svn.python.org/projects/sandbox/trunk/setuptools in some working directory Build an egg out of it : python setup.py bdist_egg
You can find it in dist / then Copy this egg into the eggs / directory of your buildout ( or in the egg directory you have configured in ~/.buildout/default.cfg
Open bin / buildout with your editor and change the path to the egg used to the one you just copied ( should have some name like setuptools - 0.7a1dev_r0-py2.4.egg .
Now your buildout should run again ( but might give some warnings about those . svn/entries files .
( This was done on Mac OSX , should be similar on Linux , might be slightly different on Windows due to the setup of bin\buildout.exe )
And now that it works with subversion 1.5 , I am eager to try out it ’s new features such as merge tracking .
PS : Maybe there is a way to specify the setuptools egg directly via some configuration .
If so , I would like to learn about it :-)

Aid is still needed urgently in the delta region A month after Burma was devastated by a cyclone , foreign aid agencies say a quarter of a million people have still not received any help .
Despite claims by the Burmese generals that the relief operation is now over , aid workers say there remains an urgent need to provide food , shelter , clean water and other basic aid .
Matt Prodger , a BBC correspondent who has spent the past week in Burma , found there was growing anger against the military government .
He said there were reports of villagers in the worst affected areas fighting with soldiers .
One young man from within the stricken Irrawaddy Delta region told him that the cyclone had killed 1,000 people in his village , yet there had been no assistance from either the military or aid organisations .
The man said that , on one occasion , desperate villagers had fought with soldiers tasked with keeping order in the region .
' Criminal neglect '
In the aftermath of the 2 - 3 May cyclone , the military government came under huge international pressure to step up its relief effort , and received heavy criticism for refusing to allow foreign aid workers into the affected regions .
Cyclone : Mapping the aftermath Victims ' misery turns to fury
At the weekend , US Defence Secretary Robert Gates accused the Burmese regime of " criminal neglect " , saying that the initial delays could have cost tens of thousands of lives .
Returning from a visit to Burma , the UN's food agency chief Josette Sheeran said : " What we need is a seamless global lifeline of relief supplies . "
" Progress has been made , but urgent work remains on the critical last leg , " she added .
Following a trip by UN Secretary General Ban Ki-moon , during which the junta promised to allow international relief workers into the country , there has been an improvement in the number of visas granted to foreign specialists .
But aid workers say there are still bureaucratic hurdles preventing people from travelling to the delta , and according to our correspondent , hotels in Rangoon are full of aid workers waiting for official permission to begin work in the stricken areas .

What are these ?
The nation ’s drug wars sank to new depths Wednesday as the Mexican navy announced it had seized a submarine that was transporting cocaine off the southern coast .
The navy intercepted the 33 - foot vessel about 125 miles south of Puerto de Salina Cruz in Oaxaca state .
Jose Luis Vergara , a navy spokesman , said in a radio interview that special forces waited until the vessel surfaced before rappelling from helicopters and overpowering the four - man crew .
Vergara called the submarine bust unprecedented for the navy .

“ There were a lot of packages , ” he said .
“ It appears to be cocaine . ”
The navy provided no information on the identities or nationalities of the suspects .
Colombian authorities have captured more than a dozen such vessels over the last couple of years .
Law enforcement experts say the homemade subs are becoming ever more sophisticated .

Meanwhile , Mexico ’s drug wars claimed another high - ranking law enforcement official .
Salomon Diaz , a Sinaloa state police commander , was shot dead by suspected drug gang hit men in the troubled western state , where more than 300 people have died in drug - related violence this year .

I 've always wanted to be a roadie for a rock band .
Think of the perks :
Heavy drinking , free shows , lots of sightseeing , and countless sexual favors , not to mention cool " all access " laminated passes .
As the years passed , I gradually realized my rock band roadie fantasy would probably never come true , but then Lloyd Miller , lead singer and bassist of The Deedle Deedle Dees said he'd let me roadie for the Brooklyn - based kids ' band .
" When 's the show ? " I said , figuring I 'd need some time to perfect my microphone cable winding skills .
" Sunday afternoon , " he said .
" Where ? "
" Temple Beth Elohim . "
I know what you 're thinking .
Kids ' band ?
Temple ?
A true roadie would run as soon as he heard those words .
Well , a true roadie never says no , my friend .
Especially , a guy like me , who has a wife and two kids and no time for a two - week rock road trip across the Midwest .
This was the closest I was going to get to being a " road dawg . "
Sunday .
1:00 p.m .
I show up at Lloyd 's house in Carroll Gardens , but Lloyd is n't there .
Then I hear a car horn , and see a red SUV pull up .
" Sorry I 'm late , " Lloyd says , getting out of the car .
" My daughter had a massive bowel movement in church and I had to help my wife air - dry her pants . "
Leading me into his basement apartment , Lloyd points to a checklist on a piece of paper ( Bass amp , acoustic guitar , PA , mailing list , mixing board ) .
" You can start loading stuff into the car , " he says .
I pick up a P.A. speaker and walk out of the basement .
I shove it in the back of the SUV while Lloyd wrestles with his daughter 's car seat .
I 'm about to tell him I have two child car seats of my own when I stop myself .
I 'm a roadie today .
Somewhere , not too far away , my kids are running around , but I 'm about to get on the road .
And , I 'm already carrying heavy rock and roll equipment .
" Should I get a cup of coffee for the road ? " I say .
" It 's a short trip , " Lloyd says .
1:15 p.m
Lloyd and I are finally on the road .
We 're talking about the band , and it turns out , they 're a lot like The Ramones .
They all have the same last name , Dee .
There 's Booker T. Dee , Innocent Dee , and Otto Van Dee.
Lloyd 's stage name is Ulysses S. Dee , after Ulysses S. Grant , who he feels a special affinity for .
" He was a complete failure before he became a general , " he says .
" And then he really found himself . "
I wonder to myself who'd I 'd be named after if I were a historical figure .
I wonder if other rock band roadies have ever wondered this .
Lloyd double parks outside Innocent Dee 's apartment .
We 've driven about an eighth of a mile , but I 've thoroughly enjoyed my 1 minute and 48 seconds on the road .
No one can take that away from me now .
1:19 p.m .
Innocent Dee , also known as Anand Mukherjee , hops in the SUV .
Innocent is the guitarist .
Being the roadie , I offer to take the back seat .
I ask the band how their last show went .
" It was at a hospital for the criminally insane on Randall 's island , " Lloyd says .
I want to ask Lloyd why a kids ' band would be booked at a hospital for the insane , and wonder if this says something about normal kids .
Instead , I sit back and listen to Lloyd tell me about the show at the mental hospital and how they'd had to put their equipment on a conveyor belt before entering the building .
Then they'd been escorted to a locked room , deep within other locked rooms .
The sign on the door said " The Manhattan Club . "
Inside , heavily drugged inmates parted silently before The Deedle Dee Dees , who , it turned out , were not reason they had all shuffled into The Manhattan Club .
" The hot dogs and Snickers , " Lloyd says .
" Were the main attraction . "
1:25 p.m .
I walk up to the drummer , Ely Levin 's apartment , with the other Dees .
Ely has injured his right ankle after rehearsing a Parliament Funkadelic song all night with his other band , which shows you what funk music can do to white guys .
He seems relieved that I 'll be giving him a hand .
Outside , I ask him why he 's holding a long wooden pole .
" I thought I 'd use it for a cane , " he says .
The road dawg in me wants to grab it and toss it away .
Fuck the cane !
He can lean on my shoulder if he wants !
" I guess I 'm a little injury prone , " Ely says , leaning over to rub his foot .
" A few months ago , I tore some cartilage in my sleep . "
" Ouch , " I say .
Lloyd tells us that since Ely is injured , he 'll have to take my place in the SUV .
Anand offers to walk the rest of the way with me to Temple Beth Elohim .
It is n't far .
After a few moments of trying to figure out what direction we 're headed , Anand and I start walking .
We pass the time by talking about his stage name , Innocent Dee , which he came up with after reading a book about Pope Innocent III .
I 'm wondering how many other rock musicians are named after popes when I hear the sickening scrape of steel against steel and see a No Parking sign snapping back and forth .
" Is that Lloyd 's car ? " I say .
" It is , " Anand says , running across the street .
1:30 p.m .
Me and the other Dees are inspecting the damage to Lloyd 's SUV .
" It 's just a scratch , " he says .
We start to unload the equipment and Lloyd shows me how to carry his upright bass .
" Grab this handle like this , and the other one like this . "
" Like this ? " I say , grabbing the handle .
" No , " he says , putting his hands on his hips .
2:05 p.m .
In the middle of " loading in , " to " the venue . "
I find myself momentarily transfixed by a poster on an easel inside the Temple lobby .
The Hebrew Hammer , it says .
The baddest Hebe this side of Tel Aviv .
2:12 p.m .
I haul the duffel bag containing Ely 's drum hardware down a flight of stairs and open the door .
It feels like I 'm carrying twenty barbells on my shoulder .
" Is this is the way to the auditorium ? " I say to a maintenance guy .
" No , " he says .
" It 's upstairs . "
" Well , " I say cheerfully .
" At least I 'm getting some exercise . "
" That 's not exercise , " he says .
" If you walked up these stairs all day like I do every day , then that would be exercise . "
A true roadie would tell this yob to fuck off , perhaps even in an English accent .
Instead , I thank him and trudge back up the stairs with Ely 's amazingly heavy drum equipment .
I feel like I 'm carrying a corpse .
Ely 's waiting for me in the hallway , with his long wooden pole .
He looks at me sadly and points to the wheels on one end of the duffel bag .
" It rolls , " he says .
2:34 p.m .
I 'm introduced to Chris , also known as Booker T. Dee .
He 's the pianist in the band .
We shake hands and then there 's an uncomfortable moment of silence .
I break it by asking him what it 's like to play piano in a kids ' band .
" It 's great , " he says .
" Lots of groupies ? " I say , kidding around .
" Lots of breastfeeding , " he says .
" So what do you do when that happens ? " I say , picturing Chris 's eyes dancing across a row of breastfeeding mothers , searching for a safe place to come to rest .
" I stare , " he says .
2:46 p.m .
The show 's about to begin .
The kids are sitting on the faded red rug in front of Lloyd .
Others are sitting on their parents laps on the folding chairs .
Ely 's bad ankle is firmly in place behind his bass drum .
The organizer of the event is looking worried .
" I 'm going to open the windows , " she says .
" Cause it 's a little perfumey and yucky in here . "
I do n't say anything , because words like " perfumey " and " yucky " are not in a road dawg 's vocabulary .
Exasperated , she shakes her head and flies toward the windows .
I watch her crank them open and take a seat by the stage .
" Wake up , wake up , " a father next to me begs the son who has fallen asleep in his arms .
3:01 p.m .
We 're ready for show time .
We 're going to blow them away .
This chandeliered , parquet - floored room does n't stand a chance against those PA speakers .
I watch Lloyd step up to the microphone , one finger already hooked around the E string of his upright bass .
" Please let us know if it 's too loud , " he says to the audience .
3:09 p.m .
The Dees are cruising through " Henry Box Brown , " a catchy song about a slave who mails himself to freedom .
I stand ready as a three year old girl in a pink cardigan becomes fascinated by the mixing board , but her mother carries her away .
A morose looking brown haired boy in a red sweater is watching Lloyd play his bass guitar .
The song ends .
The audience claps .
The boy whispers something to Lloyd .
" What did you say ? "
Lloyd says , bringing his mic closer to the boy .
" Sometimes things do get worse , " the boy says cryptically before turning away and walking back up the aisle .
3:31 p.m .
I 'm clapping along to " Cesar Chavez , " The Deedle Dee Dees excellent , socially conscious song about Chavez ' 23 - day hunger strike .
" He said no food for me , " Lloyd sings .
" 11 , 12 , 13 , " the kids sing .
I clap along as Lloyd counts all the days of Cesar Chavez ' fast , thinking of the emaciated activist , too weak to even talk .
Could he have ever known that one day an auditorium full of well - fed children would be running around in circles and merrily counting off the days of his hunger strike ?
And if he did , would he have shaved off a week ?
3:35 p.m .
A woman puts her hand on my shoulder .
I turn around , expecting that I 'm about to be offered my first sexual favor .
Instead , it 's Beth , a friend of my wife 's .
She 's there with her two kids .
" What are you doing here ? " she says .
" I'm the band 's " roadie , " I says , putting quotes around " roadie " with my fingers to indicate mature , cynical detachment .
This does n't seem to help matters .
I turn around and hear her whispering something to the mom next to her .
Feeling an urge to clarify things , I turn around and smile at her .
" I should have called my wife , " I say , as if the thought had just occurred to me .
" Had her bring down the kids . "
" That would have been a good idea , " Beth says , looking at me warily .
" It 's a kids ' concert , right ? "
4:08 p.m .
The Dees are in the chorus of their last song , " Satchell Paige , " ( " 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 , ball four " ) , but I 'm momentarily distracted because a small child has become pinned under a stack of large plastic squares in a corner of the room .
A mother is waving for help .
Four other mothers have joined her before I even take two steps , quickly freeing the young boy .
I think of the eleven people trampled to death at that Who concert in Cincinnati , and how fast public events can turn tragic .
Then I realize a stack of large , multicolored plastic squares could n't crush my little finger .
Meanwhile , the little girl in the pink cardigan has taken advantage of my absence and is about to adjust the levels on the mixing board .
Her mother snatches her away again , just in time .
4:09 p.m .
The show 's over and I 'm rolling Ely 's duffel bag of drum hardware out of the auditorium .
In the coat room across from me , a very well dressed , attractive young mother is surgically picking her nose under a fluorescent light .
The funny thing is , when she sees me rolling the duffel bag toward her she does n't stop .
Finally , I know I 'm a true roadie .
4:15 p.m .
I witness my first groupie interaction .
As Chris shows me the correct way to wind a microphone cable , the three - year - old girl in the pink cardigan walks up and asks him his name .
" Booker T. Dee , " he says , smiling at her .
" I'm Josephine , " she says , starstruck .
Then she runs away .
4:43 p.m .
After " loading out , " I shake hands with the Dees and thank them .
They 're a terrific band ( and their CD Freedom in a Box is available at CDbaby.com ) .
It 's been a short tour , one afternoon really , but I 'd do another show with them in a heartbeat , even one at the hospital for the criminally insane .
Who could pass up Snickers bars and hot dogs ?

Howdy again ,
Today , we 're going to look at almost the exact opposite of what we 've done in the past in our posts on security through obfuscation ( the series being linked back to on the most recent page ) and look at a freely available , and highly configurable , way to unmangle Perl code .
The program ( or , to be more exact , the Perl Module ) that takes care of that for us is called Perl : : Tidy , which also , in the build process , creates a binary called perltidy that I find is more convenient to run tests with for the most part , since it requires no edits of the mangled Perl script and can easily be dumped to different output files or file descriptors via simple command line switches .
And , speaking of perltidy 's command line switches , if you ever want to take a look at all of them ( and there are more than a few ; ) , just type :
host # perltidy -h |more <--
The pipe to more is only a suggestion , but should make it easier to read the 3 to 4 pages of output you 're going to get :)
The output should be the same for everyone , but this was only specifically tested on Solaris Unix , RedHat Linux and Cygwin for Windows .
For a simple example of how this Perl Module / program works , let 's take a look at a simple Perl program that asks for a username and password , after which it spits out the simple " crypt " result which you could cut - and - paste into your /etc / shadow file ( if you 're a cowboy ;)
host # cat crypt_mess.pl
#!/usr/bin/perl
#
# crypt_mess.pl
#
# This code is insane
#
print " Enter a user name : " ; $ name = < STDIN > ; system ( " stty - echo " ) ; print " Password : " ; $ pass = < STDIN > ; system ( " stty echo " ) ; print "
" ; chop ( $name ) ; chop ( $ pass ) ; print & CryptPasswd ( $ name , $pass ) ; print "
" ; sub CryptPasswd { local ( $ ph_alias , $clearpasswd ) = @_ ; @saltset = ( ' a ' .. 'z ' , ' A ' .. ' Z ' , ' 0 ' .. ' 9 ' , '.' , '/' ) ; $ now = time ( ) ; ( $ pert1 , $ pert2 ) = unpack ( " C2 " , $ ph_alias ) ; $ week = $ now / ( 60*60 * 24*7 ) + $ pert1 + $ pert2 ; $ nsalt = $ saltset [ $week % 64 ] .
$ saltset [ $now % 64 ] ; $ cryptpass = crypt ( $ clearpasswd , $nsalt ) ; return ( $ cryptpass ) ; }
Just for kicks , we 'll make sure it works ( which we could also reasonably assume from the output of a " perl - c " syntax check ) :
host # ./crypt_mess.pl
Enter a user name : user1
Password :
dTumj3pR1ZtjA
Cool ( of course , if you really want to test it , you can use the crypt function to see if that string actually matches the password you typed in , like we did in a previous post on simple password guessing ) .
Now let 's tidy up that code with perltidy ( we 'll also use the - syn flag to do the equivalent of a " perl - c " syntax check at the same time - this only shows output if there is an error in the syntax .
You get no indication of the syntax being " OK " like you do with " perl - c " ) :
host # perltidy - syn crypt_mess.pl
Note that , since we did n't use any options , the default action for perltidy ( insofar as file preservation is concerned ) is to leave the original file alone and create a new " tidied up " file with a . tdy extension ( using perltidy with the - b option will make a backup of the original file and inline - edit the existing file ) :
host # cat crypt_mess.pl.tdy
#!/usr/bin/perl
#
# crypt_mess.pl
#
# This code is insane
#
print " Enter a user name : " ;
$ name = < STDIN >;
system ( " stty - echo " ) ;
print " Password : " ;
$ pass = < STDIN >;
system ( " stty echo " ) ;
print "
" ;
chop ( $name ) ;
chop( $ pass ) ;
print & CryptPasswd ( $ name , $ pass ) ;
print "
" ;
sub CryptPasswd {
local ( $ ph_alias , $ clearpasswd ) = @_ ;
@saltset = ( ' a ' .. 'z ' , ' A ' .. ' Z ' , ' 0 ' .. ' 9 ' , '.' , '/' ) ;
$ now = time ( ) ;
( $ pert1 , $ pert2 ) = unpack ( " C2 " , $ ph_alias ) ;
$ week = $ now / ( 60 * 60 * 24 * 7 ) + $ pert1 + $ pert2 ;
$ nsalt = $ saltset [ $ week % 64 ] . $ saltset [ $ now % 64 ] ;
$ cryptpass = crypt ( $ clearpasswd , $ nsalt ) ;
return ( $ cryptpass ) ;
}
And it looks much nicer .
But , and we should always do this test , does it still work ?
host # ./crypt_mess.pl.tdy
Enter a user name : user1
Password :
dsT2fglQvgnyM
Assuming we 've checked that the output string is good , this is good news ! :)
Of course , like I mentioned , perltidy has a ton of options ( literally pages worth , unless you have an extremely high - rez monitor ) .
For instance , if we wanted to conform to Gnu 's formatting spec's ( - gnu ) , and just print to STDOUT ( - st ) , instead of creating a new file , we could do this :
host # perltidy - st - gnu crypt_mess.pl
#!/usr/bin/perl
#
# crypt_mess.pl
#
# This code is insane
#
print " Enter a user name : " ;
$ name = < STDIN >;
system ( " stty - echo " ) ;
print " Password : " ;
$ pass = < STDIN >;
system ( " stty echo " ) ;
print "
" ;
chop ( $name ) ;
chop( $ pass ) ;
print & CryptPasswd ( $name , $ pass ) ;
print "
" ;
sub CryptPasswd
{
local ( $ ph_alias , $ clearpasswd ) = @_ ;
@saltset = ( ' a ' .. 'z ' , ' A ' .. ' Z ' , ' 0 ' .. ' 9 ' , '.' , '/' ) ;
$ now = time ( ) ;
( $ pert1 , $ pert2 ) = unpack ( " C2 " , $ ph_alias ) ;
$ week = $ now / ( 60 * 60 * 24 * 7 ) + $ pert1 + $ pert2 ;
$ nsalt = $ saltset [ $week % 64 ] .
$ saltset [ $now % 64 ] ;
$ cryptpass = crypt ( $ clearpasswd , $ nsalt ) ;
return ( $ cryptpass ) ;
}
And , lastly , it can also create output in HTML format , which may or may not be useful for you .
It 's very easy to implement , but does have its limitations .
For instance :
host # perltidy - html crypt_mess.pl
will create HTML output , but ( per the picture at the end of this post ) it 's not really very well formatted ( This is due to the fact that perltidy , in this instance , does n't really do too much tidying .
You can get around this by running perltidy on your file and then running " perltidy - html " on your tidied file so that it looks better - see picture number 2 ) .
However , the code itself can be modified and basic css is included in the html file .
You can also auto - create , or read in , a css style sheet by using that command line option .
Note , here , that the default behaviour of the - css flag is to create the file if it does n't exist but to leave it alone if it does :
host # perltidy - css=my.css - html crypt_mess.pl
And this is the default css stylesheet you can expect it to output if none exists :
host # cat my.css
/* default style sheet generated by perltidy */
body {background : #FFFFFF ; color : # 000000}
pre { color : # 000000 ;
background : #FFFFFF ;
font - family : courier ;
}
. c { color : # 228B22;} /* comment */
.cm { color : # 000000 ; } /* comma */
. co { color : # 000000 ; } /* colon */
.h { color : # CD5555 ; font - weight : bold ; } /* here - doc- target */
.hh { color : # CD5555 ; font - style: italic ;} /* here - doc- text */
. i { color : # 00688B ;} /* identifier */
.j { color : # CD5555 ; font - weight : bold ; } /* label */
. k { color : # 8B008B ; font - weight : bold ; } /* keyword */
. m { color : # FF0000 ; font - weight : bold ; } /* subroutine */
. n { color : # B452CD ;} /* numeric */
. p { color : # 000000 ;} /* paren */
.pd { color : # 228B22 ; font - style:italic ;} /* pod-text */
.pu { color : # 000000 ;} /* punctuation */
.q { color : # CD5555 ;} /* quote */
.s { color : # 000000 ; } /* structure */
.sc { color : # 000000 ; } /* semicolon */
.v { color : # B452CD ;} /* v-string */
.w { color : # 000000 ; } /* bareword */
And that should be enough to get you started .
As I mentioned , perltidy has " a lot " of options .
Using it straight - up , I find , is about all I ever really need , but you can certainly use this module to do more things than are dreamt of in my philosophy ;)

One by one , John Devaney sold his treasures , hoping to forestall what was in the end inevitable .
He sold his Renoir and his Gulfstream , his home and his helicopter .
Even his cherished yacht  gone .
But on Wednesday Mr. Devaney , who made and then lost a fortune trading mortgage investments , finally called it quits .
He shut his hedge fund , and told his investors that all their money was gone too .
“ I ’m devastated , I ’m totally devastated , ” Mr. Devaney said by telephone from Aspen , Colo .
“ I feel horrible that I ’ve lost my own money and that so many people who saw the skills I have and trusted in us have now been hurt . ”
It is a stunning downfall for Mr. Devaney , whose brash bets in the markets  and equally brash public pronouncements on the perils and promises of subprime mortgages  made him something of a Wall Street celebrity .

House Justice Committee Hears Kucinich Resolution
Direct from the hearing
Michael Collins
" Scoop " Independent News
Washington , DC Part 1
Today 's hearing on the abuse of presidential powers before the House Committee on the Judiciary turned into a devastating political ambush by Chairman John Conyers ( D - MI ) , committee Democrats , and the extraordinary panel of witnesses ..
At least 12 Democratic Committee members were present plus the Chairman while only four Republicans bothered to show up .
Belying their casual appearance in the committee chambers , the Democrats presented a well coordinated , hard hitting case against President George W. Bush .
This led to a double climax in the form of surgically erudite testimony by conservative legal scholar Bruce Fein , a former Reagan administration official , and former Los Angeles District Attorney Vincent Bugliosi 's stunning summary statement .
The best the Republicans could offer was inappropriate humor by Rep. Dan Lungren ( D - CA ) and a request to clear the chambers when the audience cheered Mr. Bugliosi 's remarks .
The hearing resulted from the non stop campaign for the impeachment of President George W. Bush by Rep. Dennis Kucinich ( D - OH ) .
That effort received an overwhelming endorsement last week with the votes of a 238 majority in the U.S. House of Representatives .
The 229 Democrats and 9 Republicans voted to refer the single count impeachment bill to the House or Representatives Committee on the Judiciary chaired by Rep. John Conyers ( D - MI ) .
The Kucinich Resolution - H.R. 1345 outlines the case for the impeachment of President Bush .
Specifically , as president , Bush :
" Deceived Congress with fabricated threats of Iraq Weapons of Mass Destruction ( WMD ) to fraudulently obtain support for an authorization for the use of force against Iraq and used that fraudulently obtained authorization , and then acting in his capacity under Article II , Section II of the Constitution as Commander in Chief , to commit US troops to combat in Iraq . "
There was speculation prior to the hearing that the Republicans might scuttle the entire process due to House rules that prevent disparaging comments about the president .
Apparently they failed to read the entirety of House Practice , Sec. 25 which lists a number of negative comments that House members have used in the past and makes clear that they 're available in the present .
" Few Issues More Important "
Chairman Conyers opened the hearing by noting that there are " few issues more important " than the actions of Congress to curtail the abuse of presidential powers .
As a member of the House committee that heard the Nixon Impeachment case , he speaks with a certain authority .
He listed the various abuses of presidential power by Bush laying out the case that his fellow Democrats would elaborate .
The senior member of the committee , Republican Lamar Smith ( R - TX ) responded that he'd seen a lot from this committee but today 's hearing was like " hosting an anger management class . "
Rep. Robert Wexler ( D - FL ) , a strong advocate for the hearings , responded by pointing out that given the evidence of high crimes , this is n't a Democratic or Republican issue , it 's an American issue .
The Democrats continued the theme of gravity with Cong. Zoe Lofgren ( D - CA ) referring to Bush as " the worst president our country has ever suffered "
Cong .
Sheila Jackson Lee ( D - TX ) returned to what would lead to the most devastating and startling charges of the hearing - the basis for the invasion of Iraq and the disregard for civil liberties through the torture of foreigners and the domestic assault on privacy .
Rep. Trent Franks ( R - AZ ) responded that the hearing was nothing but " a do - over that amuses our terrorist friends . "
" If lying about casual sex " is an impeachment issue , " then certainly lying to the American people about invading Iraq " is , responded Rep. Hank Johnson ( D - GA ) .
Rep. Tammy Baldwin ( D - WI ) , another strong supporter of impeachment , continued the hard hitting attack
The Republicans were still not taking the hearing seriously when Rep. Lungren resorted to nothing more than wise cracks in response .
Murder & Tyranny
The peroration came from conservative legal scholar Bruce Fein 's testimony about the Bush administration 's descent into tyranny .
Had Bush showed up at the Constitutional Convention in Philadelphia , he would have been barred at the door by George Washington , Fein said with confidence .
He made the comment in a fashion that betrayed contempt for any defense of the Bush administration 's behavior .
Bush was labeled a tyrant from one of the best and brightest of the United States ' legal establishment .
The finale was the testimony of former Los Angeles District Attorney , Vincent Bugliosi .
As DA , Bugliosi tried and convicted Charles Manson of first degree murder gaining a death sentence even though the state admitted that Manson was never at the seen of the murders .
In the past , Bugliosi has said that preparation is the key to winning cases and that he knows that he 's won after the opening statement .
With only five minutes , he had a tall task but the syllogism he established was air tight .
On October 1 , 2002 , President Bush was told that Iraq had no weapons of mass destruction ( WMD ) .
On October 7th , Bush clamed that Iraq was a threat to the United States due to the possession of WMD .
He then used this claim to justify the war in Iraq making him guilty for the death of over four thousand U.S. soldiers and over 100,000 documented deaths of Iraqi civilians .
There were other members of the witness panel , including the author of today 's hearings Dennis Kucinich ( D - O ) , Republican Rep. Walter Jones of North Carolina , Rep. Maurice Hinchey ( D - NY ) , and Rep. Brad Miller ( D - NC ) .
But it was the patient and cagey Chairman of the Judiciary Committee , his supporting cast of Democrats and the two star witnesses , Fein and Bugliosi who made charges of rule by tyranny and murder - charges that will not be easily forgotten no matter how much the mainstream media and politicians choose to ignore this issue .

A little while back I tried to give a rough idea of what Lie algebras were about .
What I want to do now is show how with a bit of Haskell code we can directly get our hands on one .
I 'm going to assume you know how to make matrices for rotations , and multiply them , and some knowledge from previous posts , for which I 'll give links .
Firstly a bit of Haskell administration :
Now we need some quick and dirty matrix code :
What I 'm going to do is start by constructing elements of the group of 3D rotations , otherwise known as SO ( 3 ) , and show how there 's another algebraic structure hidden inside it .
So let 's make some rotation matrices :
These are the three rotations around the x- , y- and z-axes .
It 's traditional to build arbitrary rotations through the use of Euler angles
The 3D rotations form an example of a Lie group .
( A Lie group is essentially a group where the operations like multiplication are differentiable . )
Any 3D rotation can be constructed from a single application of .
But notice how there 's a bit of ugliness in this function .
I 've made an arbitrary choice of which order to apply the rotations in .
I could have defined :
And it 's easy to show that .
This is because rotations do n't commute .
In other words , for rotations , a * b ≠b *a .
We can measure the non-commutativity .
Remember that any rotation has an inverse .
For examplegives us the identity matrix because one of these two rotations ' undoes ' the other .
Given any two rotations we can construct what is known as their commutator
The idea is that we first perform b , then a , then undo b and then undo a .
If a and b commute then this expression can be rearranged toand then the inverses cancel leaving us with the identity matrix .
If they do n't commute then we end up with a non-identity matrix .
So the comuutator measures the extent to which matrices do n't commute .
As I 'm feeling lazy , I do n't feel like writing .
Instead , as I 'm only going to work with rotations , I 'll use the fact that the inverse of a rotation matrix is the transpose and define :
Try playing with expressions like .
Note how the numbers quickly get messy .
Try to write down closed form expressions for applications ofand you 'll see how complex things can get .
But there 's another way to approach the rotation group - through ' infinitesimal ' rotations .
In my earlier article I just talked about infinitesimal group operations in a hand - wavey way .
Now I 'm going to make the notion more rigorous .
We just need to introduce an infinitesimal number , d , whose square is zero .
I 've talked about this a lot before so I 'm borrowing my earlier code and defining :
If you try it you 'll see thatis zero .
Now we can try making infinitesimal rotations :
Note how when we evaluate this we get ' nice ' numbers .
No need to worry about those trig functions any more .
And if you look closely atyou'll see that it 's essentially the identity matrix plus an infinitesimal part .
We can pull the infinitesimal part out using .
You may be able to guess how to build it from the arguments to .
But first , try evaluating
It 's the same !
Try other infiitesimal rotations .
When dealing with infinitesimal rotations it does n't matter what order you apply them in , you get the same result .
Working with infinitesimal rotations is looking much easier than working with full=size rotations .
In fact , it gets better .
Try definingNow look atand compare withand .
We can multiply infinitesimal rotations simply by adding their infinitesimal parts .
In fact , we can defineSo we have : and Not a single trig expression anywhere !
So we have a simplified way of viewing rotations by looking at infinitesimal rotations .
A triple [ a , b , c ] can be thought of as representing an infinitesimal rotation through star and instead of multiplying matrices we just add the triples elementwise .
These triples , together with the binary operation of addition form an example of a Lie algebra .
But there 's a piece missing .
We have lost all information about the non-commutativity of the rotations .
It 's one thing to simplify , but it 's another to lose an important feature of what you 're looking at .
The problem is thatis ' too small ' .
We need an infinitesimal that does n't go to zero the moment you square it , but is still , in some sense , infinitesimally small .
We could rewrite thetype .
But there 's a trick .
Define :( If you think ofas forming a tensor product as I described here then e=1⊗d+d⊗1 . )
You can check thatis non -zero butis zero .
Now when we compute a commutator we get something a little different : is essentially the identity as before .
But if we look atthere 's a non-zero infinitesimal piece which is different from what we had when we worked with .
This infinitesimal piece is in fact proportional to .
Asis a half , we can extract the coefficient offromusing
In fact , we have .
So by choosing infinitesimals that are n't too small , we have n't lost information about non-commutativity .
In fact , a bit of experimentation may convince you that with : we have :
So let 's step back a bit and recapitulate all this in something approaching English : Given a tiny rotation we can represent it as three Euler angles a , b , c , all of which are tiny .
We can think of a , b and c as forming a vector [ a , b , c ] .
When we do this , apart from an even smaller error , multiplication of rotations becomes ordinary addition of vectors and the order of rotations is n't significant .
But if we choose not to ignore this small error we see that a rotation represented by u and a rotation represented by v do n't quite commute and the order does matter .
The size of this error is measured by the cross product of u and v .
This is intuitively plausible , we 'd expect that rotations defined by vectors in a similar direction would be closer to commuting , and this is reflected in the fact that the cross product is zero for parallel vectors .
So now I can fill in the missing piece from the description of the Lie algebra I gave above .
The Lie algebra so ( 3 ) consists of the 3d vectors ( representing infinitesimal rotations ) , addition of vectors ( representing multiplcation of infinitesimal rotations ) and the cross product ( measuring the amount by which small rotations fail to commute ) .
This picture does n't just apply to the rotations , a similar one applies for any Lie group .
We get the same pattern of a simplified form of multiplication and a binary operation that measures non-commutativity .
But you might still ask if there 's something missing .
What if we definedso thatis zero butisn't ?
Would we extract more information about the non-commutativity of rotations ?
Well the interesting fact , which I wo n't prove here , is that it does n't .
Almost everything you need to know about a Lie group can be extracted from its Lie algebra .
In fact , from a group 's Lie algebra you can almost recover the original group .
( In fact , what you recover is its universal cover . )
But notice how there are no trig formulae involved when talking about Lie algebras .
Lie algebras give a really nice way to study Lie groups without getting your hands too dirty .
But this is n't the only reason to study Lie algebras , many physical properties arising from symmetries are more naturally studied through the Lie algebra because Lie algebras arise from Lie groups as soon as you start differentiating things .
In particular , Lie algebras play a major role in Noether 's theorem , one of the cornerstones of modern theoretical physics .
In summary then , I hope I 've given some flavour of Lie algebras .
Using infinitesimals you can get your hands on them directly without the use of a large amount of mathematical machinery .
There has been some difficult stuff here , but I 'm hoping that the freedom you now have at the Haskell prompt to play with the things I 've been talking about will make up for the inadequacies of my explanations .
One last word : in principle we could do the same with E8 .
But we 'd need 248 by 248 matrices , and the equivalent ofwould need 248 parameters .
( That 's a coincidence , in general the number of parameters needed to define an element of a Lie group is n't equal to the dimension of the matrix , but it is for SO ( 3 ) and E8 ) .

EDINBURGH , Scotland , July 20 ( UPI ) -- Scottish actor Sean Connery stopped giving his son money to force him to make his own way in life , the actor 's former wife says .
Diane Cilento alleged the former star of the James Bond movie series said several years ago he would no longer give his son Jason any money as part of his goal of teaching the young man how to earn a living on his own , The Sunday Times of London reported .

Cilento alleges Connery also criticized his son's attempts to become an actor , saying his only child was merely capitalizing on his famous last name .
" Sean said , ' You only got this ( acting ) job because your name 's Connery , ' " Cilento said of Connery 's initial reaction to one of his son 's acting jobs .
Despite such conflicts , Cilento says in her autobiography " My Nine Lives " that Connery now has a decent relationship with his adult son .
" Jason loves him , but Sean has a problem about relationships , as everybody who 's round him knows , " she said .
The Times said Connery is release his own autobiographical book titled " Being a Scot " that details his own youthful efforts to earn a living .
NEW YORK ( CNNMoney.com ) --
A spike in the unemployment rate - the biggest in more than two decades - raised new concerns Friday that a weak labor outlook , high oil prices and continuing woes in the housing and credit markets are leading the U.S. economy into a painful recession .
The government said Friday that the unemployment rate soared to 5.5 % in May from 5 % in April - much higher than economists had forecast .
The surge marked the biggest one - month jump in unemployment since February 1986 , and the 5.5 % rate is the highest level seen since October 2004 .
Unemployment is now a full percentage point higher than it was a year ago .
" You 're not going to have a lot of people arguing ' no recession ' with this data , " said Lakshman Achuthan , managing director of the Economic Cycle Research Institute .
The prolonged job loss and jump in unemployment are better indicators that the economy is in a downturn than is the traditional thumbnail rule of two quarters of falling gross domestic product , he said .
The jobs report came on the same day that oil prices soared to $ 134 as the dollar lost value against the euro and the yen .
It also comes the day after the Mortgage Bankers Association reported that homes in foreclosure crossed the 1 million mark during the first quarter , a record high .
" All these things take time to digest , " said Roger Bayston , a senior portfolio manager for Franklin Templeton Investments .
" We believe that in the long - term the economic boat is going to righted , but in the near term everyone is going to be busy bailing water . "
Teenage unemployment soars
John Silvia , chief economist with Wachovia , said the unemployment rate was distorted by a big jump in teenage unemployment in May , to 18.7 % from 15.4 % , as the school year ended and teenagers started searching for jobs .
And the Labor Department figures were probably underestimating unemployment in the months leading up to Friday 's report , he said .
" This report reflects what we should have seen over the last two to three months , " said Silvia .
The Labor Department also reported Friday a net loss of 49,000 jobs in May , compared to a revised loss of 28,000 jobs in April .
That was a touch better than economists ' forecast of a 60,000 loss , but it marked the fifth straight month that the economy has lost jobs .
Overall , the economy has shed 324,000 jobs this year , the worst start to a year since 2002 , when the nation was still struggling with the aftereffects of a recession .
The job losses in the payroll report were widespread , as the battered construction industry lost 34,000 jobs and manufacturers cut 26,000 jobs from the nation 's factories .
But the service sector also saw job losses in many sectors , as retailers trimmed 27,000 jobs .
The business and professional services categories took a 39,000 job hit .
" The business and professional has to be a focus of concern .
The job losses have broadened out , " Silvia said .
" Those are generally good - paying jobs .
This is a clear sign the weakness is spreading beyond the construction and manufacturing . "
Part of the decline in business and professional services came from a 30,000 cut in temporary jobs , bringing losses in that sector to 106,000 so far this year .
Tig Gilliam , chief executive of Adecco Group North America , the unit of the world 's largest employment firm , said that cut is another indicator about widespread concern among employers .
" As the economy slows down , the temporary employees are sometimes the first to go , " he said .
Temporary employment also tends to pick up just before a recovery , he said .
" The May number shows there 's no recovery ( ahead ) yet . "
Jobs on the campaign trail
Presidential candidates Barack Obama and John McCain were both quick to react to the jobs report .
Each argued that the dire employment picture was proof that they had the best solution for the nation 's economy , and that their opponent 's policy would be a mistake .
" This is a reminder that working families continue to bear the brunt of the failed Bush economic policies that John McCain wants to continue for another four years , " said Obama 's statement .
" We can't afford John McCain 's plan to spend billions of dollars on tax breaks for big corporations and wealthy CEOs . "
McCain 's statement argued that tax breaks are more important to spur the economy in the face of weak employment .
" The wrong change for our country would be an economic agenda based upon the policies of the past that advocate higher taxes , bigger government , government - run health care and greater isolationism , " said McCain 's statement .
" To help families at this critical time , we cannot afford to go backward as Senator Obama advocates . "
Mr Sarkozy said he wanted love , not war , around the Mediterranean French President Nicolas Sarkozy has launched a new international body with 43 member nations aimed at ending conflict in the Middle East .
The Union for the Mediterranean will tackle issues such as regional unrest , immigration to pollution .
At the summit 's opening in Paris , Mr Sarkozy said its aim was to ensure the region 's people could love each other instead of making war .
Israeli and Palestinian leaders earlier expressed optimism about peace talks .
Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Olmert said Israel and the Palestinians have never been as close to a peace deal as they are now .
He was speaking after talks with Palestinian leader Mahmoud Abbas , who said both sides were serious and wanted to achieve peace .
Transform the region Mr Sarkozy urged Middle Eastern countries involved in long - running conflicts to end the deadly spiral of war and violence , as European nations had done by making peace which each other during the 20th Century .
Please turn on JavaScript .

He said the grouping " will build peace in the Mediterranean together , like yesterday we built peace in Europe " .
Comprising 27 EU members with states from north Africa , the Balkans , Israel and the Arab world , the union 's membership will include 756 m people from Western Europe to the Jordanian desert .
Welcoming the presence of Arab states alongside Israel , Greece alongside Turkey and Morocco alongside Algeria , Mr Sarkozy said the group would not be " north against south , not Europe against the rest ... but united " .
He outlined the group 's determination to focus on concrete projects focusing on the environment , immigration , security cooperation , transport and education .
The French president was clearly buoyed by the presence in Paris of so many Mediterranean rim leaders and said the union would be based on concrete projects , says BBC world affairs correspondent Nick Childs .
Mr Sarkozy is one of those politicians who is full of surprises because he is always campaigning

Mideast optimism at French talks
But critics have dismissed the new union as lacking substance , and diplomats say there are continuing disagreements over key issues such as how to address the Middle East peace process and a possible role for the Arab League .
The only leader boycotting the Paris meeting was Libyan President Muammar Gaddafi , who has described the union as a new form of colonialism .
Mr Sarkozy played down the absence of Moroccan King Mohammed VI , saying he had sent his brother as a senior representative .
He also dismissed suggestions the Syrian president had snubbed Israel by walking out of a speech by Ehud Olmert .
Meanwhile , Palestinian leader Mahmoud Abbas said both he and Mr Olmert were serious and wanted peace .
Israeli PM
Ehud Olmert said his country had never been so close to reaching an agreement with the Palestinians as now .
He added that he would like direct talks with Syria , but warned they must not hinder talks with the Palestinians .

If I writein Haskell , how many multiplications will be used to compute the power ?
A stupid question ?
Well , for this example , but if I was computingand x has 100000 digits then I 'd care .
So how can I find out ?
I can look at the definition of the exponentiation operator .
Here it is , from the Haskell report and GHC 6.8 : It 's a bit involved , but decipherable .
Another way would be to insert some kind of debug trace message in the multiplication .
I 'd like to show a different way .
Here 's a ghci session :
So what 's going on ?
The value of x is , which means that there 's some magic going on .
The variable can be used as usual , for instance in computing .
A traced value can also be shown as an expression , which is whatdoes .
So a traced value is somewhat like the symbolic values I had in an earlier post , but in addition to having a symbolic representation they also have a normal value .
But the output fromdoes n't really help in answering how many multiplications there are , since the shown expression has no sharing ; it is totally flattened .
Thefunction is the black magic here , it recovers the sharing , and we can see what happened .
What we see is that there are actually five ( 5 ) multiplications involved in computing 10^8 .
This shows that the definition of exponentiation is suboptimal , since it can be done with three multiplications ( three repeated squarings ) .
Thereally does have somemagic .
It recovers information that is not part of the Haskell semantics , so from that we can conclude that it must contain the powerful incantationsomewhere .
How does it reveal implementation secrets ?
Look at this :
The let expression and the expression where the variable has been expanded are semantically equal in Haskell , so no ( pure ) function can possibly be able to give different results for them .
OK , so how does it work ?
I 'll show a simplified version of the Traced module here that only deals with one traced type , but it can be extended .
The ( soon to be available ) hackage package contains the extended version .
In the Traced type we need to represent expressions .
We only need constants and function applications .
data Traced a = Con a | Apply a String [ Traced a ]
The function application contains the value , the name of the function , and the arguments the function was applied to .
In the exported interface from the module we want to be able to convert to and from the Traced type .
Nothing exciting here .
traced :: a ->
Traced a traced = Con unTraced :: Traced a -> a unTraced ( Con x ) = x unTraced ( Apply x _ _ ) = x
instance ( Show a ) =>
Show ( Traced a ) where show = show .
unTraced
instance ( Eq a ) => Eq ( Traced a ) where x == y = unTraced x == unTraced y
Num
fromInteger
instance ( Num a ) => Num ( Traced a ) where (+ ) = apply2 " + " (+ ) ( -) = apply2 " - " ( -) ( *) = apply2 " * " ( *) negate = apply1 " - " negate abs = apply1 " abs " abs signum = apply1 " signum " signum from Integer = traced .
fromInteger apply1 s f x = Apply ( f ( unTraced x ) ) s [ x ] apply2 s f x y = Apply ( f ( unTraced x ) ( unTraced y ) ) s [ x , y ]
We want to show a traced value the same way we show the underlying value .
Comparing for equality , we simply compare the underlying values .
And we 'll make traced numbers be an instance of .
All the functions ( except ) build apply nodes .
A fancier version of this module could make the Traced type an applicative functor etc. , but that 's not really so important .
Finally , we want to be able to show a traced expression as an expression tree instead of a value .
Traced t ->
String showAsExp ( Con x ) = show x showAsExp ( Apply _ s [ x , y ] ) | not ( isAlpha ( head s ) ) = " ( " ++ showAsExp x ++ " " ++ s ++ " " ++ showAsExp y ++ " ) " showAsExp ( Apply _ s xs ) = " ( " ++ concat ( intersperse " " $ s : map showAsExp xs ) ++ " ) "
module Traced ( Traced , traced , unTraced , showAsExp ) where
Traced > putStrLn $ showAsExp $ 10^8 ( ( ( 10 * 10 ) * ( 10 * 10 ) ) * ( ( 10 * 10 ) * ( 10 * 10 ) ) ) Traced >
We only export what is necessary , so the module header should beA quick test :
And now we need the black magic to recover the sharing .
We would like to have a unique label in each node of the expression tree .
If we only had that we could see when two things referred to the same subexpression , and use the label to refer to it instead of the value .
If we were doing this in , . , Java we could use object identity for this purpose .
If we were doing it in C , we 'd just compare pointers to the structs containing the expressions .
But we 're doing it in Haskell and none of this is available .
It 's not unavailable because Haskell wants to make our lives difficult , quite the contrary .
Languages that allow pointer comparisons ( object identity ) must introduce an extra level of indirection in the semantics to explain how this is possible .
So now it 's not enough to know we have the number 5 , we need to know that this is the number 5 at location 1000 .
And that 's not the same as the number 5 at location 1010 .
The numbers contained in the locations might be the same , but the locations are not interchangable since they could , , be mutated differently in the future .
So is everything lost in Haskell ?
Not at all .
GHC implements a library of stable names , which is ( at first approximation ) the same as the address of something in memory .
The API to System .
Mem.StableName is very simple .
data StableName a makeStableName :: a -> IO ( StableName a ) hashStableName :: StableName a ->
Int
makeStableName
StableName
hashStableName
Thefunction is like the & operator ( address of ) in C .
It returns the " address " of something .
Sois like a C pointer type .
And thefunction converts the " address " to an int , , like casting it to int in C .
( In the simplified code below we 'll assume that two stable names never hash to the same Int , although this is not absolutely guaranteed . )
How come this interface is OK ?
For instance , calling makeStableName on semantically equal values can yield different results if the values happen to be stored in different parts of memory .
It 's ok , because the returned value is in the IO monad .
In the IO monad anything can happen , so it 's perfectly reasonable that the same argument yields different results in different calls .
Despite the name and the documentation the GHC stable names have a stability flaw .
The stable name changes when an unevaluated expression is evaluated .
It 's annoying , but not a major flaw .
But once evaluated the stable names is guaranteed to remain the same .
( The implementation of stable names is not as simple as taking the address of an object , since the GC can move objects around . )
So now we have a way to get the identity of each node in the expression tree built by the Traced type .
The plan is to traverse the expression tree .
For each node we 'll use the " address " of it as it's name , and remember that we 've seen this node .
As we traverse the tree we build a list of nodes we 've seen .
This list then corresponds to let bindings we'd like to display as the final result .
As we traverse the nodes we 'll also replace each node with a reference to its name instead , so we can see the sharing in the result .
To be able to represent the expression with rediscovered sharing we need to extend the Traced type .
We need variable references and let bindings .
In fact , we 'll only generate a top level let binding , but we include it in the data type anyway .
data Traced a ... | Var a Name | Let [ ( Name , Traced a ) ] ( Traced a ) type Name = String
Var
unTraced
... unTraced ( Var x _ ) = x unTraced ( Let _ e ) = unTraced e
... showAsExp ( Var _ n ) = n showAsExp ( Let bs e ) = " let " ++ concatMap bind bs ++ " in " ++ showAsExp e where bind ( n , e ) = n ++ " = " ++ showAsExp e ++ " ; "
Var
makeStableName
type TState = ( M. IntMap ( Traced a ) , [ ( Name , Traced a ) ] ) share :: Traced a -> StateT TState IO ( Traced a )
import Control .
Monad .
State import qualified Data.IntMap as M import System.Mem.StableName
share e@( Con _ ) = return e share e@( Apply v s xs ) = do ( sm , bs ) return ie Nothing -> do let n = " _ " ++ show h ie =
Var v n put ( M.insert h ie sm , bs ) xs ' ( sm ' , ( n , Apply v s xs ' ) : bs ' ) return ie
Var
Var
We store the value in theconstructor to makepossible .
New cases :
And we want to show the new constructors :
To rediscover the sharing we need to keep some state .
We need a mapping from the node address to thethat should replace it , and we need to accumulate the bindings , , the pairs of node name and expression .
So we need a state monad to keep track of the state .
We also need to be able to callin the IO monad , so we need IO as well .
We 'll do this by using the state transformer monad on top of IO .
So the function that discovers sharing will take a traced value and return a new traced value , all in this monad .
So we have the type : Assuming some importsNow the body : Constants are easy , we do n't bother sharing them ( we could , but it 's not that interesting ) .
For an apply node , we get its stable name ( it 's already evaluated , so it wo n't change ) and hash it .
We then grab the map ( it 's an IntMap ; a fast map from Int to anything ) from the state and look up the node .
If the node is found we just return the expression from the map .
If it 's not in the map , we invent a name ( using the hash value ) and insert anode in the map so we 'll never process this node again .
We then recursively traverse all the children of the apply node , and rebuild a new apply node with those new children .
This constitutes a binding and we stick it in the accumulated list of bindings .
Finally we return the newnode .
At the top level we need to call share and then build a let expression .
The bindings are put in the list with the top node first in the list , so it looks nicer to reverse it .
According to an investigative report by the New Orleans City Business newspaper , Orleans Parish District Attorney Keva Landrum - Johnson is routinely seeking five - to - 20 years sentences for minor pot possession offenders .

District attorney boosts felony convictions with marijuana cases
via neworleanscitybusiness.com
Shortly after Keva Landrum - Johnson took over as district attorney following Eddie Jordan ’s resignation Oct. 30 , hundreds of new felony cases flooded the public defenders office , overwhelming the 29 defense attorneys .
… The flood of new felony charges did n’t target murderers , rapists or armed robbers — they targeted small - time marijuana users , sometimes caught with less than a gram of pot , and threatened them with lengthy prison sentences .
The resulting impact has clogged the courts with non-violent , petty offenses , drained the resources of the criminal justice system and damaged low - income African - American communities .
… Landrum - Johnson ’s decision to accept felony charges on people arrested for second and third marijuana possession offenses is a dramatic break from the tactics of former DAs Jordan and Harry Connick .
A first - time marijuana possession charge in Louisiana is a misdemeanor punishable by up to six months in prison but typically results in a small fine .
A second offense is a felony that can carry up to five years in jail and a third offense up to 20 years .
Under Jordan and Connick , however , second and third offenses were routinely reduced to misdemeanors that typically did not require a trial .
This freed up public resources to be spent on violent crimes as opposed to minor , victimless offenses .
Question :
Who ’s the real ‘ bad guy ’ here ?
The obvious answer is DA Landrum - Johnson , who is throwing the book at minor pot offenders in a cynical effort to appear ‘ tough on crime ’ and bolster her campaign for Criminal Court Judge .
But the blame should not end with the DA .
The true culprits responsible for this mess are the Louisiana lawmakers who , apparently , believe it ’s quite alright for minor pot offenders to face up to 20 years in prison and a felony record .
It ’s not the responsibility of each individual DA to try and make rational sense out of what is clearly an irrational law .
In fact , in an ironic twist , DA Landrum - Johnson ’s actions may actually hasten statewide reforms in Louisiana by once and for all exposing the state ’s dirty little secret : Louisiana possesses some of the most malevolent pot penalties in the country !
Well , it ’s time that we call them on it .
Write or call your Louisiana state legislators and ask them if they believe that minor marijuana offenders should face five - to - 20 years in prison .
And if they do n’t , then tell them to sponsor legislation in 2009 to make Louisiana ’s absurd pot penalties a thing of the past .

Bending light around a massive object from a distant source .
The orange arrows show the apparent position of the background source .
The white arrows show the path of the light from the true position of the source .

Mathematicians working on one of the bedrocks of mathematics , the Fundamental Theorem of Algebra ( FTA ) , have recently found collaborative allies in the unlikely field of astrophysics .
In their article From the Fundamental Theorem of Algebra to Astrophysics : A ' Harmonious ' Path , in the Notices of the AMS , mathematicians Dmitry Khavinson from the University of South Florida , and Genevra Neumann from the University of Northern Iowa , describe their mathematical work that surprisingly led them to questions in astrophysics .
The FTA concerns the solutions of polynomial equations .
A linear equation of the form has exactly one solution .
A quadratic equation like has two solutions :
These solutions are real if the part under the square root is positive , and coincide if this is zero .
If the part under the square root is negative , then we have to evoke the world of complex numbers , which is equipped to cope with roots of negative numbers .
A cubic equation likehas three possibly complex or coinciding solutions .
The solutions to these types of equations are also calledorof the polynomial , and the FTA states that
The mathematicians were working on dynamical systems formed by polynomial equations like the ones above .
These are systems which evolve over time within the complex space ( for more on complex dynamics , read the Plus article A fat chance of chaos ? )
During the 1990s , Khavinson extended the FTA to polynomials of more than one variable .
He proved that for a certain class of multivariate polynomials , known as harmonic polynomials , the number of zeros is at most where is the highest power in the polynomial .
Picking up on these results , Pietro Poggi- Corradini extended Khavinson 's approach to rational harmonic functions — harmonic functions that can be written as that ratio of two polynomials :
The result of this work was slightly different — the number of zeros of rational harmonic functions turned out not to be less than but However , they drew no conclusions on whether this limit was " sharp " — that is , whether it could be pushed any lower .
A week after publishing their results on arXiv , the researchers received a congratulatory e-mail from astrophysicist Jeffrey Rabin of the University of California , San Diego informing them that their theory resolved a gravitational lensing conjecture .
Multiple images are visible due to lensing .
From NASA .
Gravitational lensing occurs when light from a very distant , bright source bends around a massive object ( such as a cluster of galaxies ) between the source object and the observer , and is one of the predictions of Einstein 's general theory of relativity .
Due to this deflection , the observer sees multiple images of the same source .
If there is one massive star in between the source and the observer , the light gets bent around the star and we see what looks like two sources — sometimes the images can be merged and it will look like a ring .
If there is more than one massive object between us and the source , what we see is more complex .
The conjecture that the mathematicians solved was the Sun Hong Rhie conjecture which states that the number of images created by light bending around a massive object due to gravitational lensing is always less than Rhie initially found an arrangement of four massive objects that created 15 images , and then expanded this to the conjecture .
Having seen the results of Khavinson and Neumann , the astrophysicists were able to construct their results in terms of rational harmonic functions .
Additionally , the mathematicians were able to use the results of the astrophysicists to prove that the bound was sharp .
Who said pure maths has no physical application ?
My girlfriend and I purchased a house about 2 months ago , closing July 3rd .
We 've been doing extensive remodeling on it but began moving in just this weekend .
We 've spent exactly two nights in the house so far ...
Tonight we were over at the old apartment getting the very last of our things .
It turned out to be a lot more than we expected , so we were over at the apt .
until about 11:40 .
As we were walking out ... a huge owl swooped down , landed in a tree just 30 feet from us and sat there .
I commented how freaking weird it was ... we kissed and parted , she was going to drop off the keys and I was going to get a soda on the way back to the house .
When I got back to the house I turned left into the alley and down to the backdrive ... as I pulled in I saw a man , looked to be kneeling in my back yard ... next to where the swing used to be .. and rope , still was .
I froze .
It crossed my mind .
Is this a suicide .
The figured looked to be kneeling ..
I put the car in reverse and started backing up ...
I honked my horn , put on my brights and sat ... thinking he'd get up and run away .
He did n't .
I backed up more ... not having my cell phone .
Wondering if my girlfriend had beat me home , found this and left ... I sat there .. not knowing what to do ... too affraid to get out of the car .
Lights came from the north alley .. and I got out and walked towards them ... it was Kelly .
From where she parked she could n't see anything ... I said :
" There 's something wrong .
There 's someone in our back yard ...
I think , he 's hanging there . "
She said she 'd never seen this look on my face before ... everything in my body was screaming .
I had no way to defend us ....
I had no idea what was going on ... it looked like a halloween dummy .
" Call 911 . " I said .
Five minutes later I ran down the alley to the street and flagged down a cruiser .. he beamed his light on me and I sprinted back up the alley .
He followed and when we reached the yard he got out and asked " Where is he ? "
I pointed and he exited his car , drew his gun .. and walked forward .
He came back and asked " Do you know him ? "
I skipped the answer and asked " Is he dead ? " he knodded , almost laughingly and said " Yeh ... he 's dead . "
I wo n't get into the details of who he was ... or why he was there , but I 'd never met him or seen him or knew him ... and tonight , he hung himself in my backyard .
I 've never heard Kelly scream like that before .
She was screaming and crying and asking what was going on and why ...
I have never seen anything this **** ed up in my life .
We are shocked .
We 're at her parents tonight ... canceled my travel plans for the rest of the week and settling in for the strangest night I hope to ever live .... this was very , very bad .
The news pulled up out front , wo n't make it though .. nor the paper ... the firemen cut the rope from the tree .
The cinder block he jumped from I picked up myself .. and carried back tothe rubbish pile .
The questions are .. what would have happened if we 'd been there ?
Would it have still happened .. would he have done something to us .
Was the owl a symbol ... and why do this to someone you 've never met .
Or yourself .
Ugh ... its so **** ing messed up .

Ministers want more pupils from poorer backgrounds to go to university
One in 10 academically promising state school pupils in England does not go on to university , a report has claimed .
The study also says thousands of bright pupils are let down by schools because they fall back after high levels of early achievement .
The report for education charity the Sutton Trust says 60,000 high achievers do not go on to university every year .
The government said it was determined that children 's talents , no matter what their background , would not be wasted .
If you get A - levels you are as highly likely as any other pupil to subsequently enrol on a degree course
Sutton Trust report
The research , based on analysis of the attainment of pupils starting secondary school in 1997 , tried to estimate the educational " attrition rates " of academically gifted pupils long before they think of applying for university .
It found the number of high - achieving state pupils shrank from about 88,000 at the age of 11 , to just over 50,000 at age 16 .
Some 32,000 of these end up going to university .
It also found high rates of " leakage " among the least privileged of pupils - those qualifying for free school meals ( FSM ) .
Two thirds of the top - performing pupils at age 11 were no longer in that category by the time they did their GCSEs .
And half of these did not go on to university .
The report says : " The raw gap in higher education participation rates between pupils on free school meals and other pupils is stark . "
It said non-FSM pupils had about a one in three chance of going to university while those on FSM had about a one in eight chance .
If all the missing 60,000 pupils had gone on to university , they would have boosted the participation rate by a quarter , the report added .
But the study had a positive message for those who did A - levels .
' Social mix '
" If you get A - levels you are as highly likely as any other pupil to subsequently enrol on a degree course .
" The main problem in terms of widening access to higher education is getting non-traditional students to A - levels in the first place , " it added .
The country 's elite universities are being urged to increase the number state pupils that attend as undergraduates , and many are struggling to do so .
Dr Anna Vignoles , of the Institute of Education , who led the research said it had long been argued that financial and social barriers at the point of entry to higher education prevented them from going to university .
" This research shows clearly that the main reason why poorer students do not go to university to the same extent as their wealthier peers is that they have weaker academic achievement in school . "
There are now around 300,000 more young people going to university than 10 years ago .
Bill Rammell
Higher Education Minister Research director at the Sutton Trust , Dr Lee Elliot Major said the study showed there were significant numbers of bright young people with academic potential who do not progress to university .
" If we are serious about broadening the social mix of the sector it is important not only that the brightest and best get in to our most highly - selective institutions , but that more young people from poorer backgrounds go on to higher education full stop . "
Higher Education Minister Bill Rammell said : " There are now around 300,000 more young people going to university than 10 years ago .
" Latest figures show that we are improving attainment across the board and the gap between children on free school meals and their peers getting five good GCSEs in 2007 had narrowed by four per cent since 2003 .
" We are determined to continue this trend . "
He added that a number of schemes linked up talented pupils in school with higher education students as mentors .
Shadow Universities Secretary David Willetts said the report confirmed his worst fears .
" Bright children from poorer backgrounds are being failed by the education system .
It is a shocking waste of talent .
" Universities cannot make up for all the problems that occur early on .
That is why we are committed to more good schools . "

Sure , we were inspired when Michael Phelps broke every world record ever despite a presumably painful condition that causes him to shit gold medals .
But take a look down the roster of Olympic events and you 'll see those ... other sports .
The ones that draw crowds with less energy and a higher concentration of parents than a 5 year - old 's piano recital .
Luckily , there 's a tier of sports - in - waiting that are " officially recognized " by the Olympic Committee and could be added at any time .
Here are six that make us wonder what the hell they 're waiting for : Advertisement
6 Rotorsports Continue Reading Below Advertisement
If you watch some of the track and field events and think how much cooler it would be if the contestants were in helicopters , then rotorsports are for you .
That 's right , helicopter racing is among the sports recognized by the International Olympic Committee , but were apparently considered too awesome to include in the games .
With top speeds over 200 miles an hour , it 's all of the fun of Formula
One racing with the added bonus of giant , spinning , metal blades of death .
Sure there 's the issue of whether this is really a sport as the helicopter is doing the work , but the same argument applies to Dressage , and Olympic event which is basically slow horse dancing , where the rider does fuck all except tell the horse where to go .
You decide what looks cooler : Continue Reading Below Advertisement
Anytime you have fast moving machines you also get the potential for some fearsome crashes and , just like NASCAR , a lot of us would tune in just for that .
The difference is that when a helicopter goes down it does n't just crash , it also breaks apart into big , angry pieces looking to take down everyone else around it .
Tell us that was n't more entertaining than watching some guy swim really fast .

Jet Li was a Wushu champion and fucking Darth Maul ( Ray Park ) used it .
When we found out that some Wushu events like duilian involve two or more people and weapons , we wondered why the Olympics are n't made up of nothing but that .
OK , so the fighting is choreographed ahead of time .
But , so is the floor exercise in gymnastics and you have to agree that watching two guys perform a scene from a Kung Fu movie right before your eyes is way more interesting than watching some dude in tight shorts do cartwheels by himself .
The video up there alone should demonstrate the crazy amount of skill required to avoid getting impaled by a 4 foot - long spear .

We 're not sure whether points for coming closest to death are also given but if not , they should be .

BBC News , Detroit
Could growing fresh vegetables help save crumbling inner cities around the world and tackle hunger ?
Putting in the spade - work at one of the charity 's gardens
That is the ambitious aim of a charity called Urban Farming , which has its headquarters in Detroit , the capital of the US 's wilting car industry .
The idea is very simple : turn wasteland into free vegetable gardens and feed the poor people who live nearby .
Motown has lost more than a million residents since its heyday in the 1950s and it is common to see downtown residential streets with just a few houses left standing .
Taja
Sevelle saw the hundreds of hectares of vacant land in the city and came up with the idea of creating an organic self - help movement that would be " affordable ( and ) practical " .
Beginning three years ago , armed with $ 5,000 ( £ 2,500 ) and a pamphlet , the singer and entrepreneur managed to win a wide cross-section of support around the city .
Now her charity is expanding across the US .
Ms Sevelle is also keen to discuss her ideas with the new Mayor of London , Boris Johnson .
With a handful of full - time staff , Urban Farming co-ordinates the cultivation of what amounts to 500 family - sized gardens across Detroit .
No greed Visiting one of the largest allotments , on a site that had been derelict since Detroit 's infamous 1967 riots , locals spoke about an astonishing transformation .
Derelict streets highlight Detroit 's tough past and present " There is something that every hand in this area can do , " said Rose Stallard , who is keen to enlist as many volunteers as possible to help tend the garden and its precious crops .
As she organises a band of eager helpers to pull greens from the rich top - soil , Ms Stallard says food is more expensive than ever and neighbourhood shops are scarce .
" That 's one cucumber you did n't have to pay 69 cents for , " she adds , with a smile .
There are no fences but one local said greed had not been a problem .
" People are only taking what they need , because they know it 's for everybody , " he said .
Collective wisdom
Many of the regular gardeners come from rehabilitation programmes linked to the county jail .
Offenders say they have earned self - respect , as well as local thanks , for literally doing the spade - work .
" It 's good for me to know that I 'm helping somebody , instead of hurting somebody , " said Reginald Moore .
Taja Sevelle and Rose Stallard are keen to expand their work " All this is positive .
Next year , you 'll see this all over , " added Rod Shepard .
Providing free food on the doorstep brings people together and spreads collective wisdom , according to local city hall manager Gail Carr .
" Fresh fruits and vegetables are something that we all need .
And we really , really need to educate our children in that area .
" If we do n't , we 're going to have a lost generation to many diseases such as diabetes , " she said .
The local sheriff 's liaison officer , Beth Roberts , said that crime figures had improved wherever Urban Farming took root .
Growing crops also marked a return to slower but better times , she said .
" We used to do this in our backyards .
This used to be a culture , a way of life , so we 're restoring that through urban farming . "
Future plans
As the charity expands , it remains to be seen if enough local people will do the groundwork to keep the gardens blooming .
Time to benefit from all the hard work
But the idea of permanent social change , away from the old industrial core , is something that Detroit sorely needs , according to the editorial page editor of the Detroit News , Nolan Finley .
" Today 's reality is that we have a lot of vacant space , and not much economic opportunity , " he said .
" You could have urban farming - you could have livestock in some of these stretches of empty land .
" You could reforest it into tree farms so you 're not maintaining a sidewalk , a power line , for a street that has two houses on it . "
The conversion from Motown to Growtown may seem far - fetched , but given Detroit 's economic woes , marketable ideas are in big demand .

The Stolen Earth Punditry
30 Jun 2008
This is for those who watched ( and care about ! )
Dr Who episode 12 The Stolen Earth , so be warned - there are spoilers !
This email landed this morning :
I ’m surprised to not see a Dr Who post on your blog .
Are we going to get one ?
Will David Tennant be staying ?
Did you feel a pang of sadness at the thought of losing our current doctor ?
Ah , go on then .
I do n’t think this is when David Tennant leaves , and I base that solely on the fact that he ’s been seen filming the Christmas Episode !
However , some points against that though :
It ’s possible that the production team kept his leaving secret - after all they had planned that Rose would be coming back , and managed to keep it secret for a couple of years .
Catherine
Tate did put her foot in it by saying this was his last season , after which there was an air of ‘ she let the cat out of the bag ’
The scenes for the Christmas episode may be flashbacks , or some other ‘ Time - Crash ’ style plot device .
Or even a complete Red Herring .
Ood Sigma telling him that his “ song may soon end ” ( although I take this to refer to Professor River Song - too literal ? )
Still , my feeling is that next year ’s special episodes will be his last .
3 - 4 years is the usual reign for a Doctor , and I ’m sure that he would want to move on soon .
He ’s a great actor after all , and would n’t want to be typecast no matter how much of a fan he is .
I hope he does n’t go though - he makes even a bad script magic to watch .
So if this is n’t his last story , as I ’m reckoning , then that leaves some issues .
Will they back out and do some cringey plot device about how he regenerated but ‘ came back the same ’ ?
Hopefully not , but here ’s my theory :
There was a brief mention to Donna that she ‘ had something on her back ’ - referencing the previous episode ( Apparently Dextrus says this to Donna in ‘ Fires of Pompeii ’ , but I missed that reference ) .
There is still a Time Beetle™ on her back , and once some other choice is reversed , it will undo all these events .
Anyway , we ’ll see come Saturday !
I 'm going to talk about low - level vs. high - level .
Again .
It 's complicated .
Lots of angles .
I need to warm my brain up .
For a warm - up , let 's start with an important theorem I 've recently discovered .
yosefk 's Semantical Decay Theorem : all useful terms which are not completely neutral become meaningless .
Think about the definition of anything political , like " nationalism " or " democracy " .
For most people , it 's little more than a synonym for " good " or " bad " .
Just an emotion ; the meaning is long gone .
Clarification : by " most people " , I mean literally " the majority of the population " .
You know , the guys who decide who runs your government .
I 'm afraid " the majority of the people you hang out with " is a somewhat skewed sample .
And it 's not just politics .
Let 's take a minute to browse through The Modern Software Industry Dictionary .
Object - Oriented
adj .
1. Good .
Examples : " But is it an Object - Oriented language ? " , " Ewww , what an ugly , non-Object - Oriented interface ! "
Translation : " I do n't know why I want something to be OO , but I want it , and I want it bad , ' cause everybody does .
All the pros .
I 'm a clueless programmer thinking of myself as a pro .
Maybe I 'll get a clue some day , but do n't put your money on it " .
2. Bad . Example : " Just wonderful !
What a huge pile of crud .
' Object - oriented ' and all .
These people have to make everything complicated . "
Translation : " Unlike my ' we - are - pros - we - like - OO ' colleagues , I can't even understand what happens when you override a method .
Where 's my spaghetti dish ? "
Real Time Embedded Software
n .
1. Goodness .
Examples : " In embedded applications , we do n't need all those helpers and layers and interfaces . "
" In Real Time Software , you never have such features . "
Translation : " Yes , I like to hard - code M copies of N hexadecimal values into a K - screen do - everything function , for very large values of M , N and K .
And there 's nothing you can do about it , ' cause without me , you can't even boot the board .
I 'll do as I damn please . "
2. Badness .
Example : " Oh , right , that would be too sloooow for a so - called embedded device .
Damn , why can't I use a normal CPU ? "
Translation : " My code is slow , because I 'm too lazy to find out why and speed it up .
My code also happens to be quite useless , because I 'm too lazy to figure out how to make it useful .
But you wo n't see how useless it is , because your hardware is only as fast as 2 or 3 Cray - 1s , so it ca n't run my code . "
Design
n .
1. Goodness .
Example : " We 'll rewrite this code , and this time , it will be Designed properly . "
Translation : " I 'm a Software Architect .
I know Design Patterns .
Just look at this code .
No Structure to it .
It 's time for someone like me to take over this project .
Look , a loop !
Calls for the Iterator Pattern .
Ummm …
Wanky wanky !
Could you please close the door ?
It kinda feels awkward in public .
Please do n't interrupt my work . "
2. Badness .
Example : " Yeah , they want to ' design ' it .
Talking and writing and writing and talking .
Instead of getting work done . "
Translation : " I write crap .
We ship crap here , in case you did n't notice .
Crap !
Ever saw crap ?
Now get out of my way or I 'll crap all over you ! "
I do n't know what 's attached to " OO " or " RT / Embedded " or " Design " in your brain .
Maybe it 's something sensible .
Maybe you know that there are different object systems and why they are useful or useless in your context and how to get by without an object system at all .
Maybe you think that " embedded " means that a digital processor is designed to be a part of a specific system and run a specific application as opposed to being a general - purpose delivery platform .
Or maybe you think that " embedded " means " low- end " or " small " the way " embedded " cross-compilers targeted at Windows CE seem to interpret the term .
Maybe these words mean something to you .
I 'm not going to discuss whether you attach the right or the wrong meaning to the words .
I 'm saying that attaching any meaning to them at all makes you a part of a minority .
Whenever I hear " OO " or " RT / Embedded " or " Design " , I know there can be only 3 options , listed in the decreasing order of probability :
1 . The speaker is clueless or dumb or evil or all three combined .
2 . The speaker managed to not notice that most frequently , the words are used by the people from option 1 .
3 . The speaker noticed it , but decided to heroically ignore it , because the word has a meaning , damn it , and I 'll still use it , risking being classified as an option 1 guy , because I 'm a Linguistic Hero .
All 3 options are suboptimal .
Which is why I try to avoid these words altogether .
It is n't very hard , because the concepts are fairly " thin " – you can simply fall back to first principles below them .
Instead of " that 's not Object - Oriented " , you can say " What if we need another type of query ?
Why not have a class Query with a handle ( ) method instead of the switch ? "
Instead of " that 's not suitable for Real Time Software " , you can say " a dictionary lookup would be slow ; why not keep a pointer to the value inside the key object ? " .
Instead of " that code has poor Design " , you can say " I 'm going to rewrite that code , because it 's one big mess .
What 's that ?
' It works ? '
Well , if you 're under that impression , I 'll be happy to transfer my responsibility for its maintenance to you .
Oh , suddenly it does n't look like ' working code ' anymore , does it ? "
And so on .
I do n't find myself needing a special word most of the time .
Except for one case : " high - level " and " low - level " .
Maybe it 's because I do n't quite understand the underlying first principles , but for whatever reason , I really need a shortcut for that .
Sadly but expectedly , " high - level " has made it to The Modern Software Industry Dictionary long ago .
I planned to look it up and share the definition with you , but it turned out to be really long , with several different ways of equating " high - level " with " good " or " bad " .
So I decided to spare it and go straight to the definition found in the yosefk 's Small Dictionary of Special Words He Still Can't Avoid :
High - level
special adj .
An attribute of formal interfaces , such as programming languages , operating systems , computer programs and libraries , and mathematical notation .
An interface A has a higher level of abstraction than an interface B with respect to a concept C if the following holds : C can be expressed in terms of both A and B , but A comes with a special word for C .
Why do I need a special word for the property of having special words so badly ?
I 'm not sure yet .
Lots of angles .
Complicated .
Perhaps examples will help .
Example 1 : C and C++ do n't have reflection .
This means that you can't take a pointer to an object and serialize it , because you do n't know the size and the layout of the object pointed by the pointer .
Example 2 : C and C++ do n't have arrays .
When you see a pointer , you do n't know how many adjacent objects are pointed by it .
This means that if you parse your compiler - specific debug information format , creating non-portable reflection , you still can't serialize arbitrary objects .
Because if an object has a member pointer , it can really be a member array of unknown size .
Oh , and it can point to a dead object .
It can also point to a Segmentation fault or an Access violation , depending on your target OS .
All these are non-problems in Java , which has reflection , arrays and garbage collection .
Example 3 : MS Windows has buttons and menus and scroll bars and stuff .
The X Window System does n't have any of that .
Instead , it comes equipped with design principles , such as " If a problem is not completely understood , it is probably best to provide no solution at all " and " If you can get 90 percent of the desired effect for 10 percent of the work , use the simpler solution . "
This means that on Windows , you can change the way widgets look throughout the system , and with X11 , you can't .
Example 4 : MS Windows defines a format for keeping the text & layout of dialogs , menus and the like .
This crud is called " resources " and comes with a " resource compiler " , translating an ad - hoc human - editable format into the binary machine - friendly format , and a set of clunky APIs for manipulating the binary format .
This means that you can create an editor for translating the text on the buttons into a different language ( and replace icons having text on them and flip dialog layouts for right - to - left locales ) .
You can't do this to a program based on the knowledge that it uses X11 for the GUI .
Of course you can only do this to a Win32 program if it was designed by drones who sticked to the ad hoc format by Micro$oft .
If the program was written by Real People who threw together their own ad hoc format , you 're helpless .
Example 5 : C does n't have garbage collection , but at least it comes with malloc and free ( unlike COBOL , for example ) .
You can and will forget to call free on a malloced chunk , but it is possible to build a platform - specific tool for tracing calls to malloc and free , and listing the call stacks at which leaked blocks were allocated .
Of course nothing prevents people from reserving a large chunk of bytes and rolling their own memory management in this chunk .
Using a plethora of custom " memory pools " is a C++ weenie 's favorite way to defeat the tools for memory leak detection .
Example 6 : Did I mention that C does n't have arrays ?
Well , it does n't .
Suppose you have a function working with int* a and int* b , supposedly pointing to two arrays of length n .
Of course they can really point to the same array , and the compiler has to make sure the code works in this case .
And that would be the only problem if a and b were arrays .
But they are n't .
They are pointers .
So a can point to b+1 or b - 2 or wherever it damn pleases .
This gets in the way when compilers optimize code as simple as for ( i=0 ; i<n ; ++i ) a [ i ] =b[ i ] * 2 ; because , say , loading 4 values from b before storing values into a changes the semantics .
This is known as the pointer aliasing problem and is a major pain in the ass for optimizing compilers ; years and years passed before restrict was standardized , few people use it , and almost nobody knows what it really means .
Example 7 : HTML has a concept of " document content " .
That 's why if you have a WordPress blog , you can change your broken " theme " or " skin " or whatever they 're called to some other broken theme or skin , and all your precious old content will get a spiffy new look .
I think that MS Word does n't have a user - visible high - level concept of " document content " .
The closest thing to it is probably the support for clipboard formats such as plain text or HTML .
The latter is n't very appetizing .
Much as I hate the WordPress entry composition window , I dropped the idea of copying from Word and pasting to WordPress , because there 's too much crud to clean up .
My way to summarize this is as follows .
In natural language , I find myself trying to avoid " special words " because they tend to be used for so many different things , so nobody can tell which one of those things you meant .
And using " lower - level " sentences instead of " higher - level " words is n't much of a problem .
People are awfully good at taking my low - level text and " raising " it back to the original high - level concept .
But with formal machine - readable languages , it 's the exact opposite , because machines are awesome at lowering and they suck at raising .
Machines do n't have a problem figuring out what a Java array or a Win32 resource or a C call to malloc means .
You never get to a point when a machine tells its fellow machine , " I 've heard programs say ' malloc ' so many times in so many different contexts that I just do n't know what it means anymore " .
On the other hand , try building a program reading your code and spotting all places where custom memory management occurs and instrumenting these spots to monitor leaks at run time .
Machines can't do that , but people can ( " oh , look , char g_pool [ maxturd ] ! " ) .
People are stunningly good at raising things to a higher level .
I think this is one reason people believe in X11 - style design principles ( " provide low - level mechanisms , leave high - level policies to users " ) .
There 's another reason to favor this approach – it results in less work .
This reason is perfectly legitimate – you only have that much time .
After all , if you have infinite resources , everything becomes a no - brainer ( you can compute the optimal chess move in every position , for example , so the game becomes rather boring ) .
Basically , the only thing " smart " means is " capable of sensibly utilizing finite resources " .
So if I lack resources for defining and implementing a higher - level interface , and I cop out , do n't call me names until you can squeeze that work into a budget like mine .
But going low - level kills metaprogramming , so treating it as a value instead of a necessary compromise is , I think , wildly wrong .
Metaprogramming can be considered worthless from the user perspective .
There are actual pseudo - business - oriented people out there who label things as economically worthless because " users do n't see them " .
These people deserve a separate discussion ( and a spanking , but we do n't do physical violence here ; stay tuned for some R- rated virtual violence on the subject ) .
The whole point of the examples above was to show how metaprogramming , made possible by high - level interfaces , enables implementation of user - visible features or detection of user - visible bugs .
The funniest thing on the list of features is performance ( definitely user - visible in a variety of interesting cases ) .
Everybody knows that " higher - level is slower " , for many values of " everybody " .
However , program optimization is just one kind of metaprogramming ; what makes metaprogramming hard , makes optimization hard .
The lack of arrays in C and C++ gets in the way when you serialize just like it gets in the way when compilers optimize .
If you 're going to deal with arrays , you better have a special word for it in your language .
Does this mean that " high - level " is , at the bottom line , a synonym for " good " , and should rightfully be listed in The Modern Software Industry Dictionary as such ?
I wish I could say yes .
I think that high - level / low - level is an extremely complicated question .
Angles and all .
I think I 'll spill out some more half - baked thoughts on the subject .
I also think that choosing the right level of abstraction is The Grand Challenge when you design something .
Oops .
Um , forget that I used that word .
I meant " when you define something " .
This word seems to still have a meaning .
I wonder how long it will last .
Twice now , I have seen reference to a secret meeting in the House of Repreesntatives in which people were informed that the US is on the verge of financiall collapse and martial law .
It was reported here : click here .
The meeting , one of only four such secret meetings in the last 25 years , Congresspeople were alledgedly told :
* The imminent collapse of the U.S. Economy to occur sometime in late 2008
* The imminent collapse of the U.S. Government finances sometime in mid 2009
* The possibility of Civil War inside the United States as a result of the collapse
* The advance round - ups of “ insurgent U.S. Citizens ” likely to move against the government
* The detention of those rounded up at The REX 84 Camps constructed throughout the United States
* The possibility of public retaliation against members of Congress for the collapses
* The location of safe facilities for members of Congress and their families to reside during massive civil unrest
* The necessary and unavoidable merger of The U.S. with Canada and Mexico establishing The North American Union
* The issuance of a new currency called the AMERO for all three nations as an economic solution .
While there are wars going on , and a FISA aftermath , and impeachment to push , and so much more , obviously if the items listed above are accurate , investigating and reporting on about this seem rather logical things to happen now .
And if there are camps being built to intern " insurgent " ( " critical , " " dissenting " ? )
Americans in preparation for martial law , does that not take a bit of priority over anything else anyone is doing politically ?
Many are concerned about staged terrorists attack or some other emergency to declare martial law .
So , when there is news that Congress is being informed of " imminent collapse " and of internment camps in preparation for martial law , it seems ... prudent ( sane , patriotic , logical , necessary , urgent ? ) to make as little bit of noise about this .
And yet headline reporting on this was listed low on the list of political things happening and the article itself contained no actions to be taken .
This idea is inspired by the 100 foot rolls of bacon idea ( #1063308896 ) and [ kamenmann ] 's comment .
Basically , this vehicle uses a battery to heat an electric conveyor grill built into the engine block .
This feature is integrated into the " glow - plug " system common in modern diesels .
After the combustion chamber generates enough heat to cook the bacon and extract most of the fats , the electrical heating system turns off .
The cooked bacon comes out a slot in the dash with an automatic blade that cuts it off at a user - specified length and drops into a washable basket below .
You load the rolls of bacon into a special port just between the windshield and hood / bonnet ( next to the refrigeration unit also used for A/C ) .
Mr Gramm ( right ) said he was now Mr McCain 's " rank - and - file " supporter
An adviser to Republican presidential hopeful John McCain has resigned after saying the US had become a " nation of whiners " over the state of the economy .
Phil Gramm said attacks against him had become a " distraction " for Mr McCain ahead of November 's presidential poll .
Mr Gramm - who co-chaired Mr McCain 's campaign - last week also said that Americans were in a " mental recession " over US economic woes .
Democrats have seized on the comments to launch attacks on Mr McCain .
They have tried to portray the Arizona senator as being out of touch at a time when many voters are concerned about their livelihoods and rising prices .
McCain quickly rebuffed Mr Gramm 's comments , saying he did not speak for him .
Mr Gramm , a former Texas senator , said in a statement : " To end this distraction and get on with the real debate , I hereby step down as co-chair of the McCain campaign . "
He added that he was now joining " the growing number of rank - and - file McCain supporters " .
Mr Gramm also said that in last week 's interview he was referring to the country 's political leaders , not Americans in general .
THE rising demand for flat - screen televisions may have a greater impact on global warming than the world 's largest coal - fired power stations , a leading environmental scientist has warned .
Manufacturers use a greenhouse gas called nitrogen trifluoride to make the televisions .
As the sets have become more popular , annual production of the gas has risen to about 4000 tonnes .
As a driver of global warming , nitrogen trifluoride is 17,000 times more potent than carbon dioxide , yet no one knows how much of it is being released into the atmosphere by the industry , said Michael Prather , director of the environment institute at the University of California .

Arriving at Ben-Gurion airport in Tel Aviv. ( Sumia Ibrahim )
“ Hello , ” I said smiling .
After over a 15 - hour flight from Philadelphia , US , which included a two - and - a - half - hour layover in Barcelona where I was searched and questioned , and where my bags were carefully examined by hand , I was anxious to breathe fresh air and catch up on sleep .
Given the fact that I was extensively questioned and searched by Israeli airline security in Barcelona , I expected to undergo minimal additional security measures at Ben-Gurion Airport in Tel Aviv , if any .
The woman scrutinized my passport , which held a red sticker placed by Israeli security in Barcelona , and called over another airport official .
“ Come with me , ” this woman said , leading me to a nearby seating room .
Rows of people waiting for their passports to be stamped stared at me as I walked by .
Most of them , American and European Jews , would have no trouble entering .
It ’s quite a different story for an Arab American .
In the sitting room was a family of five : one mother and four children .
The youngest , a boy of about four , sat in a chair sliding a small toy truck over the armrest , while the rest of the family slouched in their chairs looking exhausted .
I found out that they were Palestinian Americans from California .
“ We ’ve been waiting here three hours already , ” the mother said to me , shaking her head .
“ Ca n’t they tell we are just a family who want to see our relatives ? ”
After 20 minutes of waiting , a middle - aged man led me into a small office .
He did not wear a uniform , but a short sleeved blue collared shirt which matched his immediately penetrating eyes .
Semi-casual dress in other circumstances may have been comforting , but for an airport security official to be sitting comfortably in a cotton shirt while young officials around him were clad in uniforms , it implied higher authority .
Indeed , he soon revealed that he held a high position in Israeli security .
After several minutes of questions regarding my religious background , my Arabic language proficiency , my major in college , and my employment , he turned to my reason for visiting Israel .
I told him that as a recent university graduate , I wished to spend my summer touring the area and conducting research at Haifa University while staying with a friend in Israel .
He was not content with my answer .
“ How do I know that you ’re really just visiting Israel ? ” he said , after several minutes of detailed questions regarding the friend in Israel .
“ How do I know you ’re not going to the West Bank ?
How do I know you wo n’t end up at a demonstration against Israel ?
How do I know you wo n’t go work with Palestinian organizations , NGOs [ non- governmental organizations ] they call them ? ”
Immediately it was clear : visiting Palestine is illegal .
Helping Palestinians , showing discontent with Israeli policies peacefully , and spreading truth about Israeli policies in the West Bank and Gaza , are all also illegal .
I was asked to return to the sitting room pending “ investigation , ” and told that I may very well be denied entry .
After a half hour of waiting , during which I met a blind German Muslim woman who described to me the rigorous questioning she undergoes every time she visits the region , the man called me back into his office .
He showed me a picture of a young woman on his computer and asked , “ Who is this ? ” I confirmed that it was my Israeli friend with whom I am staying .
“ Now lets see if you are telling the truth , ” he said , picking up the telephone .
“ If not … ” he put his wrists together as if he were wearing handcuffs .
He proceeded to call my friend on the telephone , and conversed in Hebrew with her for several minutes .
When he hung up , he raised his voice and exclaimed : “ You lied to me !
You told me you were staying with her all summer .
She told me you were staying with her until you found another place .
Should I shut the door right now and hit you ? ”
We sat in silence for several seconds .
“ If you lied about this , what else are you lying about ?
It ’s not about you , ” he continued , “ There are hundreds just like you , who come from America and say they ’re just touring Israel .
A few weeks later I get a call from the secret service saying they ’ve just been arrested for demonstrating in the West Bank . ”
I apologized , but told him that I was really looking forward to spending my summer here and did not want to be denied entry .
I reiterated that I was not going to be involved in any demonstrations or deliberately put myself in harm ’s way .
He repeated the laundry list of don’ts : do n’t go to the West Bank ; do n’t get involved in any political organizations ; do n’t protest ; do n’t volunteer for an NGO .
Otherwise , he said , “ you ’ll end up in jail . ”
He then informed me that he will order the secret service to monitor me , and told me that he will contact my friend in Israel next week and that I “ better be with her . ”
He walked me to where my luggage was being held , saying until the very end , “ I do n’t know about you . ”
After two and half hours of questioning , I was relieved to leave the airport .
But I was one of the lucky ones .
Many sources have reported that an increasing number of Arab Americans are being denied entry in the past few years and further increased after Israel ’s war on Lebanon in the summer of 2006 .
My experience revealed a great deal about Israeli policies adopted since the start of the second intifada in 2000 .
Israel has determined that it is illegal to visit the Palestinian territories , illegal to reveal the truth about the lives of Palestinians , and certainly illegal to try to help in any way .
This has been compounded with decades of Israeli attempts to deny Palestinians ’ existence , identity and culture , all part of its attempt to annex the rest of Palestinian land and solve the “ Palestinian problem ” once and for all .
Palestinians have known for a long time that their continued existence has been rendered illegal ; thus , their land is being taken , they are being confined in open - air prisons , their houses are demolished , and they are arbitrarily arrested , tortured , and killed .
However , Israel relies on manufacturing international sympathy and maintaining financial and military support to achieve these goals .
This can only be achieved by making Palestine , and truth , elusive to foreigners .

July 27 , 2008  --
Sen John McCain just back from a swing state tour sat down with ABC's George Stephanopoulos in Cottonwood , Arizona to discuss the economy , gay adoption and McCain 's apparent embrace of a timetable for withdrawal from Iraq .
GEORGE STEPHANOPOULOS , ABC NEWS : Senator Obama was in London this morning , and he was responding to your comments from yesterday when you said that 16 months might be a pretty good timetable in Iraq .
He said , " We 're pleased to see that there 's been some convergence around proposals we 've been making for a year - and - a - half . "
SEN JOHN MCCAIN :
That 's really good .
Look , it 's not a timetable , as I said .
I was asked , how does that sound ?
Anything sounds good to me , but ...
STEPHANOPOULOS :
But you never used the word before .
MCCAIN : ... you know , the point is ...
STEPHANOPOULOS :
You made a point of never using ...
MCCAIN : ... I never ...
STEPHANOPOULOS : ... the word before .
MCCAIN : Look , I have always said , and I said then , it 's the conditions on the ground .
If Senator Obama had had his way , we'd have been out last March , and we'd been out in defeat and chaos , and probably had to come back again because of Iranian influence .
It 's conditions on the ground -- the way that the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff said , the way that General Petraeus has said -- conditions on the ground , so that the Iraqi government can have control , can have the sufficient security , so that we do n't have to come back .
Senator Obama said that if his date did n't work , we may have to come back .
We 're not coming home in victory .
We 're coming home in victory .
STEPHANOPOULOS :
But it does seem ...
MCCAIN : But it is a -- it is not a date .
I want to make it very clear to you , it is not a date .
It 's conditions on the ground .
STEPHANOPOULOS : So , you should n't have used the word timetable .
MCCAIN : Pardon me ?
STEPHANOPOULOS :
You should n't have used the word timetable .
MCCAIN : I did n't use the word timetable .
That I did -- if I did ...
STEPHANOPOULOS :
Well , it 's a pretty good timetable .
MCCAIN : Oh , well , look .
Anything is a good timetable that is dictated by conditions on the ground .
Anything is good .
But the timetable is dictated , not by a artificial date , but by the conditions on the ground , the conditions of security .
And by the way , our ambassador to Iraq basically said we have succeeded .
We have succeeded in this strategy .
Now , look .
Senator Obama does n't understand .
He does n't understand what 's at stake here .
And he chose to take a political path that would have helped him get the nomination of his party .
I took a path that I knew was unpopular , because I knew we had to win in Iraq .
And we are winning in Iraq .
And if we 'd done what Senator Obama wanted done , it would have been chaos , genocide , increased Iranian influence , perhaps al Qaeda establishing a base again .
Now we have a stable ally in the region , and it is not based on any date .
STEPHANOPOULOS :
But it does seem like ...
MCCAIN : I like six months , three months , two months .
I like yesterday .
I like yesterday , OK ?
That seems really good to me .
But the fact is , the conditions on the ground ...
STEPHANOPOULOS :
But what 's the difference between ...
MCCAIN : ... have not dictated it .
STEPHANOPOULOS : ... your positions now ?
He says , OK , here 's the timetable I want .
That 's the mission .
MCCAIN : Yes .
STEPHANOPOULOS :
If the commanders come and tell me the conditions have changed dramatically , if Iraq 's going to be unstable , I 'll take that into account .
You also say , timetable sounds great , but it's on the conditions on the ground .
MCCAIN : Senator Obama said that he would come out no matter what .
He said that he would be out -- according to his original plan , it would have been last March .
He says that the surge has not worked .
He said it could n't work .
There 's a fundamental difference between myself and Senator Obama .
And now that it 's the general election coming up , I can see why he and his people are trying to blur that distinction .
When the decision had to be made whether to adopt the strategy of the surge , he said it would n't work , it would increase sectarian violence .
He said all those things that made it acceptable to the left of his party .
STEPHANOPOULOS :
But there was a fundamental difference about the original decision to go to war .
He said it would inflame the Muslim world , it would become a recruitment tool for al Qaeda .
You said , and you wrote , that it would lessen antipathy in the Muslim world , and that we'd be greeted as liberators .
Was n't Senator Obama right about that ?
MCCAIN : I do n't believe so .
We were greeted as liberators .
We mishandled the war for nearly four years .
We mishandled it in a way that was so harmful that I stood up against it .
I said it would n't work .
I said we had to have a new strategy , and I was criticized for being disloyal -- disloyal to Republicans .
STEPHANOPOULOS :
You also said many times that the strategy was the right strategy .
MCCAIN : I said that Saddam Hussein caused a -- imposed a threat to the United States of America and our security .
And the Oil for Food scandal , the $ 12 billion he was skimming , the fact that he had said that he had in operation and he wanted to have weapons of mass destruction , the fact that this society that he ruled in such a brutal fashion was really awful .
And he did pose a long - term threat to the security of the United States of America .
But that 's a job for the historians .
When the crucial time came as to whether we were going to leave Iraq and lose , or stay and do the very unpopular thing of 30,000 additional troops -- asking young Americans to make the sacrifice -- he was wrong , I was right .
That was the crucial point ...
STEPHANOPOULOS :
And you do n't ...
MCCAIN : ... in the strategy .
STEPHANOPOULOS : ... accept that he was right and you were wrong ...
MCCAIN : Of course not .
STEPHANOPOULOS : ... on the original decision .
MCCAIN : Of course not .
Of course not .
STEPHANOPOULOS :
You 've also taken some heat this week with your comments saying that Senator Obama would rather lose ...
MCCAIN : Yes .
STEPHANOPOULOS : ... a war than win a political campaign .
MCCAIN : Yes .
STEPHANOPOULOS : I can't believe you believe that .
MCCAIN : Well , I 'm not questioning his patriotism .
I 'm questioning his actions .
I 'm questioning his lack , total lack , of understanding .
His ...
STEPHANOPOULOS :
But that is questioning his total ...
MCCAIN : I ...
STEPHANOPOULOS :
When you say someone would rather lose a war , a candidate , that 's questioning his honor , his decency , his character .
MCCAIN : All I 'm saying is -- and I will repeat -- he does not understand .
I 'm not questioning his patriotism .
I am saying that he made the decision , which was political , in order to help him get the nomination of his party .
STEPHANOPOULOS :
So , putting lives at risk for a political campaign -- you believe he 's doing that .
MCCAIN : I believe that , when he said that we had to leave Iraq , and we had to be out by last March , and we had to have a date certain , that was in contravention to -- and still is -- the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff , General David Petraeus .
When he never asked to sit down for a briefing with General Petraeus , our commander on the ground , when he waited 900 days to go back again , where young American lives are on the line , I think that 's a fundamental lack of understanding .
And I think the American people will make the appropriate choice .
STEPHANOPOULOS :
But you 're questioning his motives .
MCCAIN : I say that it was very clear that a decision had to made .
And I made it when it was n't popular .
He made a decision which was popular with his base .
And that is a fundamental difference .
And he does not understand , and did not understand and still does n't understand , that the surge was the vital strategy in us not having to lose a war .
Chaos , genocide , increased influence of Iranians in the region .
The consequences of failure would have been severe .
STEPHANOPOULOS : But ...
MCCAIN : Now , the benefits are enormous of a stable ally in the region , of a country that is a friend of ours , a brake on Iranian influence -- certainly a brake on al Qaeda and other jihadist organizations .
So , he made the decision that that was the best way to go to get the nomination of his party .
STEPHANOPOULOS :
There 's also been a flap about Senator Obama 's decision in Germany not to visit the troops at Landstuhl .
He now says that , based on what he was hearing from the Pentagon , there was no way that would n't be seen as a political trip , which is why he decided not to go .
Do you accept that explanation ?
MCCAIN : Well , I know this , that those troops would have loved to have seen him .
And I know of no Pentagon regulation that would have prevented him from going there -- without the media and the press and all of the associated people -- nothing that I know of would have kept him from visiting those wounded troops .
And they are gravely wounded , many of them .
STEPHANOPOULOS :
He 's done it many times in the past .
MCCAIN : In Landstuhl , Germany , when I went through , I visited -- I visited the hospital .
But the important thing is that , if I had been told by the Pentagon that I could n't visit those troops , and I was there and wanted to be there , I guarantee you , there would have been a seismic event .
And so , I believe he had the opportunity to go without the media .
And I 'll let the facts speak for themselves .
STEPHANOPOULOS : So , this is ...
MCCAIN : It certainly was n't the Pentagon ...
STEPHANOPOULOS : ... ( inaudible ) campaign ( ph ) .
MCCAIN : That 's certainly what the Pentagon spokesman said .
There was nothing to prevent him from going , if he went without the press and the media and his campaign people .
But we 'll see what happens .
STEPHANOPOULOS : Fair game ?
MCCAIN : Well , I think people make a judgment by what we do and what we do n't do .
He certainly found time to do other things .
STEPHANOPOULOS : Let 's talk about the economy .
President Bush in -- and adding some unvarnished talk recently about the economy when he did n't think the cameras were on .
I think he said , " Wall Street got drunk , and now we 're going through the hangover . "
I know you do n't want to use language like that , but is his basic take right ?
Is Wall Street the villain here ?
And what would you do about it ?
MCCAIN : I think that Wall Street is the villain in the things that happened in the subprime lending crisis and other areas where investigations and possible prosecution is going on .
But I also think that Congress is at fault .
We did n't restrain spending .
Spending got completely out of control .
We were ...
STEPHANOPOULOS :
But what does that have to do with the mortgage crisis ...
MCCAIN : It increases ...
STEPHANOPOULOS : ... or with the housing crisis ?
MCCAIN : It increases the deficit .
We did n't address the energy crisis , which has been building for 30 years .
We 're now sending $ 700 billion of Americans ' money overseas to countries that do n't like us very much .
So , I think there 's a lot of blame to go around here .
But I also would blame a gridlocked Congress , which is gridlocked as we speak , when we should be doing offshore drilling .
STEPHANOPOULOS : The gridlock ...
MCCAIN : We should be moving forward with nuclear power .
STEPHANOPOULOS :
The gridlock broke today on the housing bill .
It passed , I think , 72 to 13 in the Senate .
I know you could n't be there .
Would you have voted for that bill ?
MCCAIN : Yes .
But I also see , again , the influence of special interests .
They place the responsibilities for trying to help solve some of these problems of people remaining in their homes -- and it is real and significant -- in the hands of the lenders .
I would have liked to have seen the homeowner , the primary residents , go down and get the 30 - year FHA guaranteed loan at the new value of their home , and put it in the hands of the borrower , the homeowner .
But I 'll support ...
STEPHANOPOULOS :
Then why vote for the bill ?
MCCAIN : Because it 's better than nothing .
It 's better than -- it may give relief to several hundred thousand homeowners .
Or if it gives relief to one , it 's a -- but I think it can provide some relief .
STEPHANOPOULOS : Several of your colleagues look at this bill and say it could put the taxpayers on the hook for up to $ 25 billion for Fannie Mae .
They look at the government stepping in to help Bear Stearns and they say , this is socialized capitalism .
You know , what we have is that the private companies get to make all the profits .
When they get in trouble , the government steps in .
Is that right ?
MCCAIN : No , it 's not right .
But we reached such a situation that , if these institutions failed , the impact on millions of innocent Americans could be very severe .
In the case of Fannie and Freddie , we should stop their lobbying activities .
We should eliminate the pay and bonuses that these people rake in ...
STEPHANOPOULOS : George Will has an idea on that .
MCCAIN : ... the most ...
STEPHANOPOULOS :
He says that when some places like Freddie Mae ( ph ) or Fannie Mae or Bear Stearns get the government guarantee , that the executives that work there should get a government salary .
MCCAIN : Sure .
That 's exactly right .
And we could go out and ask people -- the smartest people in America , maybe somebody like Jack Welch or John Chambers or Meg Whitman , people like that -- and say , come and take over and do it for $ 1 a year .
They 'd be willing to do that .
But the other thing is , the shareholders should not be the first ones to be paid .
There should be new preferred stock issued .
And those people would be , and the government , paid off first , since the government is on the hook .
STEPHANOPOULOS :
And should the government get some stock , so that if Fannie Mae does recover , the taxpayers should benefit ?
MCCAIN : Absolutely .
Absolutely , they should , in my view .
And we 've got to send the signal that , over time , that these kinds of institutions have not helped the American homeowner .
They 've basically helped enrich a lot of people that otherwise should n't have been .
STEPHANOPOULOS : A majority of Americans think you 're going to come in .
They look at your tax plans and say you 're going to be just like President Bush on the economy .
What would you do right now -- spending aside -- that would be different from what President Bush is doing ?
MCCAIN : Well , I would give every family in America double their exemption for -- on the child tax and children 's tax , a dependent tax break , from $ 3,500 to $ 7,000 .
I would declare that we will scrub every agency of government and eliminate those that are not necessary .
I will veto every single pork barrel bill that comes across my desk , and make them famous .
I will promise that we will not only keep tax cuts low , but we will have some additional incentives for American investment and growth of jobs .
I will embark on an immediate , an immediate effort to eliminate our dependence on foreign oil -- nuclear power , offshore drilling , wind , tide , solar -- and stop this drain of $ 700 billion a year from the American economy .
This administration -- for 30 years , Congress and the administrations have not done anything on this energy crisis .
Now , it 's hurting low - income Americans the most .
There are many steps that can be taken absolutely , including the gas tax holiday .
Everybody -- everybody ...
STEPHANOPOULOS :
Not a single economist in the country said it 'd work .
MCCAIN : Yes .
And there 's no economist in the country that knows very well the low - income American who drives the furthest , in the oldest automobile , that sometimes can't even afford to go to work .
STEPHANOPOULOS :
But they all say that that 's ...
MCCAIN : And they have n't met ...
STEPHANOPOULOS : ... not who 's ( ph ) going to get the benefit .
The oil companies , the gas companies are going to absorb ...
MCCAIN : You know , they ..
STEPHANOPOULOS : ... any reduction .
MCCAIN : ... they say that .
But one , it did n't happen before , and two , we would n't let it happen .
We would n't let it -- Americans would n't let them absorb that .
STEPHANOPOULOS : How would you prevent that ?
MCCAIN : We would make them shamed into it .
We , of course , know how to -- American public opinion .
And we would penalize them , if necessary .
But they would n't .
They would pass it on .
STEPHANOPOULOS : Let me ask you about ...
MCCAIN : But let me just finally say , Americans need trust and confidence in their government .
The most important thing I would do , the most important of all , is what I have done all the years I 've been in the Congress .
I 'd reach across the aisle to the Democrats , and I 'd say , " Let 's go work together . "
MCCAIN : I 've worked with -- it 's not a fact that I would do something new .
I 've worked with Joe Lieberman , Ted Kennedy , Russ Feingold , Byron Dorgan -- you go down the list -- Carl Levin , Fritz Hollings .
Look down the list of the bipartisan legislation and action that I 've done together .
I could do that much , much more effectively as president of the United States .
STEPHANOPOULOS : Social Security .
You 're a longtime supporter of the private accounts , as President Bush called for them .
MCCAIN : I am a supporter of sitting down together and putting everything on the table and coming up with an answer .
So , there is nothing I would take off the table .
There was nothing I would demand .
I think that 's the way that Ronald Reagan and Tip O'Neill did it .
And that 's what we have to do again .
STEPHANOPOULOS :
In the past you said there was essentially -- and you told the " Wall Street Journal " ...
MCCAIN : No , I have said and will say , I will say that everything has to be on the table , if we 're going to reach a bipartisan agreement .
I 've been in bipartisan negotiations before .
I know how you reach a conclusion .
We all have to sit down together with everything on the table .
STEPHANOPOULOS :
So , that means payroll tax increases are on the table , as well ?
MCCAIN : There is nothing that 's off the table .
I have my positions , and I 'll articulate them .
But nothing 's off the table .
I do n't want tax increases .
Of course I 'd like to have young Americans have some of their money put into an account with their name on it .
But that does n't mean that anything is off the table ...
STEPHANOPOULOS : With ( ph ) their payroll taxes diverted into accounts .
MCCAIN : I say that everything is on the table that has to be on the table , the way Tip O'Neill and Ronald Reagan did .
STEPHANOPOULOS : Let me ask you about your position to exclude Russia from the G - 8 .
How are you going to get that done ?
Every other G - 8 nation is against it .
MCCAIN : Well , you have to take positions whether other nations agree or not , because you have to do what 's best for America ...
STEPHANOPOULOS :
You 've got some visitors here .
MCCAIN : ... and the world .
That 's Sam .
Look at Russia 's actions in the last week or so .
He 'll get out of here .
STEPHANOPOULOS :
He 'll get out .
It 'll be fine .
MCCAIN : In the last week or so , look at Russia 's actions .
They cut back on their oil supplies to the Czechs , because the Czechs made an agreement with us .
They have now thrown out the -- or forced out -- BP out of Russia .
And by the way , I -- a lot of us thought that might happen .
They continue to put enormous pressures on Georgia in many ways .
They 're putting pressure on Ukraine .
They are blocking action in the United Nations Security Council on Iran .
And so ...
STEPHANOPOULOS :
But how is kicking out of the G - 8 going to make that better ?
We need them ...
MCCAIN : The G - 8 ...
STEPHANOPOULOS : ... to help secure nuclear weapons .
We need them to help contain Iran .
To kick them out is going to make it harder , is n't it ?
MCCAIN : We need to improve their behavior .
We need to make them realize that the G - 8 was founded -- basically , countries that are democratic , have our values and our goals and shared principles .
And President Putin and ...
STEPHANOPOULOS : The former President Putin .
MCCAIN : ... his government -- former President Putin , and now Prime Minister Putin -- has taken his country down a path that I think is very harmful .
STEPHANOPOULOS :
Do you still think he 's in charge ?
MCCAIN : Oh , yes .
I am confident -- yes , I believe that he 's in charge .
And I do n't think he would have chosen his successor , if he did n't think he would remain in charge .
STEPHANOPOULOS :
Well , let me get back to the original question .
MCCAIN : They 've become -- they 've become an autocracy .
STEPHANOPOULOS : Because President Medvedev says this proposal is n't even serious .
So , I go back .
How are you going to exclude Russia from the G - 8 , when every other country is against it ?
MCCAIN : I will stand up for what I think is the best for the United States of America and the world , the way that Ronald Reagan went to Berlin and said , " Tear down this wall . "
And they said , " Oh , he 's a cowboy .
He 's going to make relations worse .
He should n't say that . "
And yet , we wanted the Wall down .
We want better Russian behavior internationally .
And we have every right to expect it .
And I will do what I can to see that they reverse many of the behavior patterns , which have really been very unhelpful to peace in the world .
STEPHANOPOULOS :
What is your position on gay adoption ?
You told the " New York Times " you were against it , even in cases where the children could n't find another home .
But then your staff backtracked a bit .
What is your position ?
MCCAIN : My position is , it 's not the reason why I 'm running for president of the United States .
And I think that two parent families are best for America .
STEPHANOPOULOS :
Well , what do you mean by that , it 's not the reason you 're running for president of the United States ?
MCCAIN : Because I think -- well , I think that it 's -- it is important for us to emphasize family values .
But I think it 's very important that we understand that we have other challenges , too .
I 'm running for president of the United States , because I want to help with family values .
And I think that family values are important , when we have two parent -- families that are of parents that are the traditional family .
STEPHANOPOULOS :
But there are several hundred thousand children in the country who do n't have a home .
And if a gay couple wants to adopt them , what 's wrong with that ?
MCCAIN : I am for the values that two parent families , the traditional family represents .
STEPHANOPOULOS : So , you 're against gay adoption .
MCCAIN : I am for the values and principles that two parent families represent .
And I also do point out that many of these decisions are made by the states , as we all know .
And I will do everything I can to encourage adoption , to encourage all of the things that keeps families together , including educational opportunities , including a better economy , job creation .
And I 'm running for president , because I want to help families in America .
And one of my positions is that I believe that family values and family traditions are preserved .
STEPHANOPOULOS : Opponents of affirmative action are trying to get a referendum on the ballot here that would do away with affirmative action .
Do you support that ?
MCCAIN : Yes , I do .
I do not believe in quotas .
But I have not seen the details of some of these proposals .
But I 've always opposed quotas .
STEPHANOPOULOS :
But the one here in Arizona you support .
MCCAIN : I support it , yes .
STEPHANOPOULOS : Finally -- and I 'm just going to take a stab at this .
I pretty much know the answer .
I 've been told that when you 're talking about your vice presidential pick , the way you characterize it is , you want to scramble the jets with your pick .
What does that mean ?
MCCAIN : I 've never used that phrase .
STEPHANOPOULOS : Never used that phrase ?
MCCAIN : Never .
STEPHANOPOULOS : So , what do you want to do with your pick ?
MCCAIN : I want to be the best team that we can provide the United States of America in very difficult times .
STEPHANOPOULOS :
Are you getting close on a decision ?
MCCAIN : We are still in the process .
STEPHANOPOULOS : Senator McCain , thank you very much .
MCCAIN : Thank you .
Could strawberry ice cream disappear from our lives ?
What about vanilla Swiss almond ?
The folks at Haagen - Dazs are worried enough that they and others have mounted a campaign to halt the shocking decline of honeybees and other pollinators of strawberry plants , almond trees and the rest of the roughly 90 percent of terrestrial plant life that needs pollination .
Officials of the Oakland company told Congress on Thursday that more than 40 percent of its product 's flavors , derived from fruits and nuts , depend on honeybees .
Without bees , fruits and nuts cannot exist .
As for whether strawberry , raspberry or almond ice cream could disappear , Haagen - Dazs brand director Katty Pien said , " We hope not , but that 's why there is such a sense of urgency , so that the millions of people who love our strawberry ice cream can have it forever . "
Honeybees mysteriously began to abandon their colonies in 2006 , destroying about a third of U.S. hives .
The rate of decline is accelerating , reaching 36 percent last winter .
" How would our federal government respond if 1 out of every 3 cows was dying ? "
Maryann Frazier , a bee expert at the University of Pennsylvania , asked during testimony to the House subcommittee on Horticulture and Organic Agriculture .
Fruits , nuts , seeds and many vegetables are the foundation of California 's $ 34 billion agricultural industry , the nation 's largest , and the basis of a healthy human diet .
About a third of human food requires pollination .
The plants cannot grow without it .
" Our business is simple : No bees , no blueberries , " agreed Edward Flanagan , chief executive of Jasper Wyman & Son , a wild - blueberry grower in Maine .
" Wild blueberries can't be planted .
Not here , not in Chile , not in China .
... We are very scared at the prospect of no pollinating bees for our fields .
There is no alternative . "
Baffled about the cause
Federal research dollars are beginning to flow and will jump dramatically with the newly passed farm bill , but scientists remain baffled about the cause of pollinator decline .
The problem extends not just to the commercialized honeybee imported from Europe 400 years ago but , etymologists say , to other native pollinators .
Those include native bees such as bumblebees that are also showing rapid declines , plus butterflies , moths , beetles , flies , hummingbirds and bats .
Lack of data on these species hinders measurement .
Scientists suspect multiple villains : loss of habitat , pesticides that disrupt insect neurology , combinations of sublethal pesticides , and viruses and parasites .
Frazier said one study of 108 pollen samples revealed 46 pesticides , as many as 17 different pesticides in a single sample .
Only three of the samples showed no pesticide residue .
Another suspect is large farm monocultures of single crops that create " floral deserts . "
The most obvious of these are the 660,000 acres of almond trees blanketing the San Joaquin Valley .
Miles of almond trees offer pollinators a single - source diet during one gigantic burst of bloom , akin to eating nothing but strawberry ice cream for a few weeks , followed by starvation the rest of the year .
Such environments are deadly for native pollinators and require farmers to import honeybees for pollination .
Hostile environments
Pollinators face an increasingly hostile environment elsewhere too , on golf courses , parks , corporate grounds , school grounds , suburban yards and city parks , where native plants , bare dirt , deadwood and other pollinator habitat is ill - tolerated .
Pesticide and herbicide use on farms is tightly regulated , but homeowners and groundskeepers use them with abandon .
Visalia beekeeper Steve Godlin said 1.3 million honeybee hives are trucked in each spring from around the country to pollinate the California almond crop , which is fast replacing cotton in the Central Valley .
The collapse of honeybee hives and the enormous demand for almond pollination has sent its price soaring .
That will show up soon in grocery store prices , said committee Chairman Rep. Dennis Cardoza , D - Fresno. Haagen - Dazs '
Pien said the company is bracing for not just higher costs but a reduction in the supply of pollinated ingredients .
After a survey showed half the public is not even aware of the bee decline , the company awarded a $ 250,000 research grant to UC Davis and the University of Pennsylvania .
It also opened a public education campaign , starting with a limited edition flavor called Vanilla Honey Bee and a goal to distribute 1 million flower seeds to consumers and community groups to aid native pollinators .
A Web site , www.helpthehoneybees.com, provides information .
The idea is to educate consumers about things they can do to help now , such as creating habitat and avoiding pesticide use .
" All Americans can help now with pollinator - friendly practices in their own backyards , " said Laurie Davis Adams , executive director of the San Francisco nonprofit Pollinator Partnership , established a decade ago to promote biodiversity .
Planting native salvias rather than hybrid tea roses , providing water and shelter or devoting a patch of yard can help .
" Plant , and they will come , " she said .
Such practices save money , too , by reducing the need for mowing , watering and chemical fertilizers .
If one person sets aside 15 percent of a lawn , it might not help much , she said , but if a million people do , " what kind of change is that ? "
The group , at www.pollinator.org, is issuing guides for each of 35 eco-regions of the country that can be used by farmers , public - land managers , corporations and consumers for choosing pollinator - friendly plants and practices .
" People who were afraid when they saw a bee are now afraid when they do n't see one , " Adams said .
How to help pollinators Honeybee populations are in drastic and accelerating decline , and bumblebees could be close behind .
Other pollinators are bats , moths , butterflies , hummingbirds , beetles and flies .
Here are some ways homeowners can help : Provide food : Native flowers provide nectar ( carbohydrates ) and pollen ( protein ) .
Butterfly larvae eat host plants .
Fermented fallen fruits provide food .
Plant in groups .
Stagger bloom seasons from early spring to late fall .
Use flowers of different colors and fragrances on plants of different heights .
Native perennials such as salvias , as well as herbs such as mint , oregano , lavender , garlic , parsley and chives , and annuals all support bees and butterflies .
Provide shelter : Incorporate canopy layers by planting trees , shrubs and different - size perennials .
Leave dead wood for nesting and dead plants and leaf litter for shelter .
Leave some areas of soil uncovered for ground - nesting insects .
Group plantings to help pollinators move through the landscape to avoid predators .
Provide water : Running water , ponds and small containers provide drinking and bathing water .
Water sources should have a sloping side so pollinators can approach easily without drowning .
Do n't poison : Avoid using pesticides and herbicides .

A small software company has accused major label Sony / BMG of software piracy , in a reversal of the normal orientation of piracy cases between major labels and the rest of the world .
PointDev , which makes Windows administration software , claims that a raid on Sony / BMG servers revealed that as much as 47 percent of the software used by the company can be considered to have been pirated under French law , according to Zeropaid 's Google translation of the initial report :
We are not interested in an amicable settlement .
It is not just aquestion of money but more importantly in principle .
The rate of software piracy in the companyis very high .
According to the Business Software Alliance , aassociation of the major publishers in the market , 47 percent of programs usedin the company would be [ unlawful ] in France ...
The Business Software Alliance raid that uncovered the programs on Sony / BMG 's servers was apparently triggered by Sony IT worker 's request for assistance with a program called Ideal Migration .
When the PointDev tech support person tried to help , he or she seems to have discovered that the key provided by Sony / BMG was pirated .
Sony / BMG apparently asked La Provence not to pick up on the story , which , of course , it did .
The case will surely provide no small amount of glee to file sharing activists and RIAA boycotters as it unfolds .

The price tag for the nation ’s housing crisis escalated again with reports Tuesday that a record number of Californians lost their homes to foreclosure in the last three months and that a potential bailout of mortgage giants Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac could reach $ 25 billion .
The figures were released as the House prepared to vote as early as today on legislation aimed at staving off foreclosures , stimulating the troubled housing market and providing a government backstop to Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac .
Rep. Loretta Sanchez ( D - Garden Grove ) said the new California foreclosure numbers were “ alarming , ” and point to the need for rapid approval of the legislation .
Foreclosures statewide jumped 33.5 % in the three months ended June 30 , compared with the same period last year , DataQuick Information Systems reported .
The 63,061 homes taken back by lenders were the most for a three - month period since the firm began tracking this data in 1992 .
Advertisement
The latest figures contained one surprise : defaults -- the first step toward foreclosure -- rose by just 6.6 % in the second quarter , down from a 39 % spike the previous period .
DataQuick President John
Walsh said the reason was not immediately clear .
Foreclosures may be “ nearing a plateau , ” he said , but it could also mean that lenders are “ swamped and ca n’t handle processing any paperwork . ”
Sean O’Toole , founder of the data tracking firm ForeclosureRadar , thinks the leveling off may mean that defaults on subprime mortgages -- loans made to poorly qualified buyers -- are nearing a peak .
But the housing market still could face a new wave of defaults from other loans that will adjust to higher rates , including pay - option adjustable - rate mortgages and so - called Alt - A loans , which are a step between subprime and high - quality prime loans .
Advertisement
“ Most resets on those products are still in front of us , ” O’Toole said .
UCLA economist Edward Leamer agreed that the default rate on Alt - A loans , a specialty of failed Pasadena lender IndyMac Bank , could be pivotal .
“ The big uncertainty is what happens when all those Alt - A ’s reset , ” he said .
Those mortgages were also more prevalent in higher - priced housing markets , he noted , where there have been fewer foreclosures .
O’Toole said that even if foreclosures do level off , it probably will take years for the market to absorb all the homes that are being resold by lenders at steep discounts .
Advertisement
So far , most foreclosures have been in outlying areas that attracted first - time home buyers .
But repossessions are on the rise in more established neighborhoods , including affluent communities .
Malibu and Beverly Hills had one foreclosure each in the second quarter of 2007 .
This year , Malibu had eight and Beverly Hills had seven , according to DataQuick .
There were 26 foreclosures in Newport Beach and Newport Coast combined for the second quarter this year , up from 10 a year ago .
Although these numbers are relatively small , Leamer said , the slump hitting the broader market will drag down values just about everywhere , in part because depressed prices discourage homeowners from selling and trading up .

“ Prices are not going to recover soon , that ’s for sure , ” Leamer said .
In Washington , meanwhile , lawmakers put the finishing touches on housing relief legislation that would give the Treasury Department the go - ahead to increase its line of credit to Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae and buy stock in the companies , if necessary .
The federally sponsored mortgage firms , which own or guarantee nearly half the nation ’s mortgages , are reeling from loans gone sour .
In a report Tuesday , the Congressional Budget Office said Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac stand a “ better than 50 % chance ” of weathering the housing and mortgage crisis without a government rescue .
But the CBO also said there was a chance the firms could require as much as $ 25 billion in government aid .
Advertisement
“ Many analysts and traders believe that there is a significant likelihood that conditions in the housing and financial markets could deteriorate , ” the CBO said .
“ Such continuing problems would increase the probability ” that the bailout would be needed .
That prospect has made some conservatives wary .
But after hearing the latest cost estimate , Sen. Judd Gregg of New Hampshire , the top Republican on the Senate Budget Committee , said the $ 25 - billion figure will “ pale in comparison to our long - term costs if we do not address this problem now . ”
The House Democratic leadership defended the measure , saying it has taxpayer protections , including letting the Treasury secretary delay dividends to Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac shareholders if the government must rescue the companies and permitting a new regulator to restrict compensation for the firms ’ executives .
The American Housing Rescue and Foreclosure Prevention
Act also would include $ 4 billion in federal aid to help hard - hit communities buy and repair foreclosed properties , a provision that has drawn a White House veto threat and could complicate passage of the overall measure .
Advertisement
It would also give the Federal Housing Administration new authority to guarantee repayment of up to $ 300 billion in mortgages if a lender agrees to write down the loan principal below a home ’s current appraised value .
Finally , it includes measures aimed at stimulating the housing market , including a tax credit for first - time home buyers and authority for states to issue an additional $ 11 billion of tax - exempt bonds to refinance subprime loans , provide loans to first - time home buyers and fund the construction of low - income rental housing .
And it would permanently raise to $ 625,000 the limit for mortgages that Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac could buy , less than the amount sought by officials in California , with its high housing costs , but more than the previous limit .
The legislation comes as the Democrats who control Congress have talked about a second economic stimulus measure costing $ 50 billion or more for consideration in September that could include increased spending for such things as infrastructure projects and energy assistance for low - income households .
That would be on top of the two - year , $ 168 - billion economic stimulus package approved in February .

Treasury Secretary Henry M. Paulson Jr. urged Congress to act quickly to shore up Fannie and Freddie , saying in a speech in New York that “ their continued activity is central to the speed with which we emerge from this housing correction and remove the underlying uncertainty in our financial markets and financial institutions . ”
UCLA ’s Leamer , however , said home sales and prices wo n’t recover until buyers can get loans , but that banks wo n’t lend until prices start to rise .
The federal aid package , he said , “ is too little to really matter . ”

Hong reported from Los Angeles and Simon from Washington .
This is my Wall - E project that I am currently working on it is 150 mm x 150 mm x 160 high , it uses a pair of Mattracks http://www.litefootatv.com/html/litefoot_in_the_news.htm for motive power and two robosapien V2 hip motors .
It will be controlled by a BS2P40 stamp CPU and will have the following functions described below .
I build robots quite prolific but my let down is programing " hopeless but learning " I have a friend at http://www.robocommunity.com
who is programing it for me , From this I hope to learn how this program is put together and eventually program myself .
We are in the progress of designing the H - bridge for the motors using the L298 chip ,
The head is finished apart from his adorable eyebrows which http://www.musclewires.com/shapememoryalloys.shtml wire or Muscle flex and pan / tilt has been run .
The main reason for building this project was to see if I could use parts from my stock of components that I have lying around my basement and electronics room ,
The only thing so far that I have had to buy is the Mattracks , uOLED screen and L298 H - bridge ic .
Which GWJax is sending me .
I was inspired to build this project after seeing a Pixar demo video and thought WOW what a neat bot to build .
I have been in R/C scale and other unorthodox aircraft for over 30yrs and modeling is my passion , so this comes in handy when creating something like Wall - E. I hope you like how it is coming along .
I would also like to add that GWJax has been an inspiration to me on the programming side .
The main construction of Wall - E is 5 mm lite ply , sides , front , back and top , with 2 mm balsa cladding on the sides with some 1.5 mm ply to form the raised panels .
Rivets were made using PVA glue watered down 40 % and applied to the required area's with a sharp pointed rod , One dip will give you 3 rivets .
The arms were constructed out of 1.5 mm ply and balsa , and uses 4 of my Technics air rams back to back ,
The fingers were modded Technics angle beams covered in 1 mm ply for the sides and balsa top and bottom .
The base is constructed out of 5 mm Acrylic sheet as this is good for boring holes to mount your fittings .
the head H'mmm a real challenge here , I had to draw it out first to get the pear shaped eye right then work from there .
The main eye tube was a pair of alloy pill containers which worked out to be the right size for the head .
The Blue LEDs x 6 , 3 in each eye are mounted on a 5 mm acrylic disc and inserted in the tube about 2 /3rds down , then another Acrylic disc in front with the ping sonar in each eye .
The ping sonar is from TX and RX had to be removed from the board [ tricky and an extension lead [ screened ] run from the board to the Tx and RX in each eye .
I was not sure at the time if this would alter the characteristics of the range , but after testing this was unfounded .
The eyes light up at present using a circuit which has a CDS cell and when you switch the lights of the eyes come on , GWJax may code this to work also with some other functions on Wall - E. Wall - E was finished with off the shelf spraykote enamel cans , grey primer , followed by antirust primer , then layered with yellow , rivets applied , then sliver over the rivet area , followed by an airbrushed rust over the rivets .
The whole body was then rubbed with scotchbrite pads until the rust and some silver was showing through , then airbrushed with a mix of satin varnish and grey primer to give Wall - E that weathered effect .
The head was done in a similar way but with different colors .

A mystery plague threatens Britain 's bees and the result could be worse than foot and mouth
Nothing better illustrates the folly of this Government than the clumsy and ignorant way it has casually slashed the tiny budget supporting research into one of Nature ’s most useful creatures : the bee .
The news is currently dominated by the bigger issues of oil prices and house prices .
But it is often in the apparently obscure detail of Government policy that we can best see where its values and priorities lie .
A mystery plague is threatening Britain 's bees , and the result could be worse than foot and mouth
Bees matter .
And not just for honey .
When they are collecting nectar to make honey they spread pollen , which fertilises many of our garden flowers and useful fruits .
Apples , pears , cherries , raspberries , strawberries , blackcurrants , broad and runner beans depend on them .
They are the unpaid workers whose labour supports many an orchard or garden .
On the narrowest calculation , they help produce £ 165 million a year of marketed products .
Yet unthinking human activity is doing considerable harm .
Britain ’s bumblebee population has been drastically reduced .
One factor is the use of dangerous insecticides in agriculture .
These break down the bees ’ orientation and communication skills and impair their memory .
Bees travel many miles for nectar and use a complex language of dances to point to the location of flowers .
Without their inbuilt navigation they can’t find their way back to the hive .
Honey bees are also in a battle for survival with parasites .
Professional beekeepers transport their hives across country – which contributes to the spread of
parasites such as varroa .
This leeching mite has virtually destroyed the wild honey bee population .
It activates lethal viruses which it carries from bee to bee as it feeds on their blood .
It is like a dirty syringe spreading HIV and is probably causing more damage than foot - and - mouth disease .
But bees , unlike livestock , do not have powerful commercial interests to support them .
As a result , a vital link in the natural chain that makes these islands what they are could vanish .
Three native bumblebee species have already disappeared and seven more are at serious risk .
Our crops are under threat and any further decline would seriously damage the rural economy .
Clovers and vetches – which play a key role in keeping soil fertile – and some rare plants may disappear and , according to some experts , are doing so already .
The result would be catastrophic for the future of farming itself .
Britain ’s 44,000 beekeepers are not very commercially minded .
Like the bees , they work largely for free .
I came to understand what was happening only when I visited an apiary tucked away in a quiet corner of my Twickenham constituency .
Volunteers tend the hives and manage the swarms because they love their hobby .
Simple common sense and national self - interest suggest that the Government should support some research into bees and their diseases .
Before recent cuts , it spent £ 1.25 million on bee health , of which less than a fifth was for research .
The Government thus spends less than one per cent , at most , of bees ’ value to the economy .
And it is swamped by the massive £ 3.2 billion budget of the Department of Environment , Food and Rural Affairs , DEFRA .
Yet a succession of Labour Ministers , from the invisible Mrs Beckett to the voluble Mr Benn via the ambitious Mr Miliband , have devoted their considerable energies to finding cuts in the tiny bee - health programme , axing 20 per cent – £ 250,000 .
Researchers are being laid off .
Ministers have sacked half of the bee inspectors whose job it was to identify and treat European Foul Brood , one of the worse parasite infections affecting hives .
Many people will be puzzled that a Government struggles with minuscule spending commitments when it can whistle up £ 25 billion to rescue a failing bank and will find something approaching that to support a three - week festival of running and spear - throwing in 2012 .
It has already devoted £ 6 billion to the Iraq War .
This Government is penny - pinching and pound profligate .
It squanders vast sums of taxpayers ’ money on prestige projects or mega disasters , then tries to balance the books by petty cuts it hopes no one will notice .
In the bureaucratic infighting around the Government ’s budget , tens of thousands of NHS staff , scientists , people in the arts world and local community projects are discovering that – like the bees – they may be doing invaluable , irreplaceable work but Ministers regard them as dispensable .
The battle over the DEFRA budget tells us much about this Government and its priorities .
Several years ago , the totally mad EU Common Agricultural Policy was reformed to be less mad but more complicated .
DEFRA made a complete mess of the changeover to Single Farm Payments , overspending by hundreds of millions of pounds .
The money could not be retrieved from the farmers , so Gordon Brown ’s Treasury decided to cut the excess from the rest of the DEFRA budget .
Essential flood defence work was stopped .
Funding was cut for environmental work .
Elderly people lost access to grants to insulate their homes .
The bees were at the end of a long line of casualties .
When I first threw my modest weight behind the bee four years ago , I was singled out for criticism by Tony Blair in Prime Minister ’s Questions .
He was echoed a few weeks later by Gordon Brown , attacking my irresponsible approach to public spending .
I thought at the time that I might have hit a raw nerve .
I now realise their ridicule was based on incomprehension .
Stewardship of Nature – protection of the natural environment – is a concept the two most powerful men in the country simply do not understand .
They are ignorant , and proud of it .
So far , the public has not noticed the cuts .
Perhaps it never will .
The price of honey is unlikely to have the same impact as the price of oil .
And bees do not elicit the love we bestow on cuddlier creatures .
Indeed , they pack a vicious sting ; my wife is one of many who could suffer a fatal anaphylactic shock unless treated immediately .
By contrast , had ponies , cats , dogs , badgers or foxes been put at risk , there would have been a national outcry to save them .
Perhaps , if sentiment cannot save the bee programme , sound economics will .
Most early civilisations valued bees ; the Greeks and Romans in particular .
Many developing countries are introducing hives and beekeeping techniques to boost the income of peasant farmers .
Other developed countries are investing in research , while we retrench .
Without proper research , it is difficult to quantify the scale of bees ’ decline absolutely .
But what is known is troubling .
There are 270,000 hives in Britain .
Last winter one in five colonies perished .
Half of Italy ’s 50 billion honey bees died last year .
The picture is similarly bleak across France , Germany , Brazil and Australia .
And nobody quite knows why .
American fruit growers have lost billions due to a phenomenon dubbed Colony Collapse Disorder , first reported in 2006 .
CCD has wiped out close to two million colonies across America and billions of bees worldwide .
We need bees .
Einstein was said to have calculated : ‘ If bees disappeared off the surface of the globe then Man would have only four years of life left .
No more bees , no more pollination , no more plants , no more animals , no more life . ’
One of the earliest economics texts ever written was Mandeville ’s Fable Of The Bees , a satire on greed .
The author had noticed that , in nature , not every creature is programmed simply to fight for survival .
Some , notably bees , also unselfishly perform a public service from which others benefit .
The Fable has been used to justify raising taxes so governments can perform useful tasks we could not perform as individuals .
Many taxpayers believe this Government has brought the civilised arguments for taxation into disrepute ; and nowhere more obviously than in the way it has shouldered aside the tiny but invaluable bee health programme to help pay for its grander follies .
On America ’s 232nd birthday , we lost one of the most craven pigs ever to have attained elected office , North Carolina Senator Jesse Helms .
In a country that has never shied away from its retrograde racists and backward stump - jumpers , Helms stood out as a kind of walking , sweating , cross- burning caricature of the Old South .
Son of a cop , he supported Pinochet and Salvadoran rightist death squads , threatened the safety of President Clinton in 1994 , created race - baiting political ads and crushed NEA funding .
Moved by his death , I have written a play .

IF THE business of electing the most powerful man in the world were up to the world , rather than just those pesky Americans , Barack Obama would face no contest .
A poll for the Guardian this week , on the eve of Mr Obama 's whirlwind tour of Europe and the Middle East ( half a dozen countries in a week , some for the first time in his life ) , shows that Britons would back him against John McCain by the astonishing margin of five to one .
The Pew Research Centre reported last month that , in each of the main European countries , at least twice as many people have confidence in Mr Obama as in his rival .
Elsewhere things are a bit more nuanced , but from Mexico to China , and from Russia to Australia , the foreigners are firmly in the Obama camp .
There are reasons for them to be more cautious .
Marvellous orator and skilled electoral tactician though he may be , Mr Obama has not repealed the basic laws of politics .
Most obviously , he may not win .
Rasmussen , a pollster , rattled the Obama machine this week by showing the two candidates tied , and most other analysts agree that the bounce he enjoyed after seeing off Hillary Clinton has been small and short - lived .
Mr Obama still definitely has the edge , but opinion at home diverges sharply from that in most of the rest of the world .
Second , President Obama would not be answerable to the world that so adores him .
A president is elected by America 's more ambivalent people , and is accountable only to them .
And his powers are mightily constrained by Congress , which is even more immediately accountable to its electorate .
Finally , there are some disquieting signs of a tendency on Mr Obama 's part to tailor his message to whichever audience he is talking to .
All politicians do this of course .
But Mr Obama 's two - steps have become Astaire - like .
For instance , in his primary battle with Mrs Clinton , Mr Obama laid out a timetable for a virtually complete withdrawal from Iraq within 16 months of taking office , specifying a rate of one to two brigades a month .
Since starting to campaign in the general election , he has fudged this clear line : he committed to withdrawal again this week ( see article ) , but he has also been careful to give himself wriggle - room on its pace .
Similarly , he once talked of negotiating with the Iranian leadership without preconditions : now he talks of the need for “ preparations ” .
Both these alterations make sense , but many Europeans wo n't like them .
Other bits of pandering could be more costly .
Mr Obama recently told the main pro-Israel group in Washington that Jerusalem must never be divided , a position that goes beyond those of the Clinton and Bush administrations ( not to mention that of many Israelis ) .
Then he backtracked .
Doffing the cap
On trade , Mr Obama used to demand the renegotiation of NAFTA ; now he stresses his dedication to the cause of free trade .
A welcome adjustment , but he is almost certain , if elected , to have a heavily Democratic Congress which is liable to send him protectionist legislation he may find it hard to veto .
On climate change he , like Mr McCain , favours a cap - and - trade system .
But the Democrat - controlled Congress recently failed to agree even on a watered - down version of such a plan , without any need for a veto from George Bush .
On all these fronts , in fact , there are doubts : doubts as to just what Mr Obama 's positions as president would actually be , and doubts over what he could get through Congress .
Those doubts will not stop the crowds turning out for him , even if he fails to commandeer the Brandenburg Gate as his backdrop .
But the fans should bear in mind that what they see is not precisely what they will get .
Portions of the Civil Assistance Plan ( CAP ) signed by the U.S. - Canadian military in mid-February were just recently posted on the U.S. Northern Command ( NORTHCOM ) and Canada Command websites .
The plan would allow for military from one nation to support the armed forces of the other nation during a civil emergency , including one that does not involve a cross - border crisis .
Some fear that this agreement could lead to foreign troops being used for gun confiscation and marital law .
CAP , along with the Security and Prosperity Partnership ( SPP ) , are further advancing the merging of U.S. - Canadian military command structures and represent steps towards a North American Union .
In 2002 , then U.S. Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld , announced the creation of NORTHCOM , and boasted that it would have jurisdiction over all of North America .
In an article by Michel Chossudovsky , he states the , “ redesign of Canada ’s defense system is being discussed behind closed doors , not in Canada , but at the Peterson Air Force base in Colorado , at the headquarters of US Northern Command ( NORTHCOM ) . ”
He went on to say , “ Under an integrated North American Command , a North American national security doctrine would be formulated . ”
In addition , this is taking place through the SPP and poses a serious threat to Canadian sovereignty and any resemblance of an independent foreign policy .
Canada Command and NORTHCOM have established close bilateral ties , meeting regularly and planning as well as participating in joint military exercises .
American , Canadian , and even Mexican troops have held military training exercises in advent of a possible natural disaster or terrorist attack during the 2010 winter Olympics in Vancouver .
It is unclear whether American troops will be providing any type of security at the Olympics .
On top of merging command structures , binational integration is also taking place in areas of intelligence and law enforcement .
In advance of the SPP Leader Summit in Montebello , Quebec back in 2007 , it was reported that the RCMP , along with the U.S. Army , blocked the Council of Canadians from renting a municipal community center to hold a forum in .
The reason cited was that it was located inside the reported 25 km security perimeter .
There is little doubt that the SPP is also further advancing the police state .
The majority of Canadians reject the SPP , and deeper integration with the United States .
It is not surprising that the Harper Conservative government and the Canadian military failed to announce the signing of CAP .
This agreement was not signed by the governments of both countries , but by military commanding officers with no public debate or Parliamentary and Congressional oversight .
There was no Canadian Forces press release , and the government refused to answer questions on the agreement in the House of Commons .
It is hard to imagine that an agreement of such magnitude , which would allow U.S. - Canadian troops on each other ’s soil and threaten the sovereignty of each nation was not debated or voted on .
Just like the SPP , CAP is shrouded in secrecy , with many missing annexes that remain classified .
This agreement goes hand in hand with parts of the North American Plan for Avian and Pandemic Influenza , which was announced at the SPP Summit in Montebello .
Canadian military command structures are further merging with the U.S. , and it is becoming more aggressive in its operations .
The Canadian government ’s tone and language directed towards other nations is becoming more hostile .
There has been a shift from its more traditional role as a peacekeeping nation , which has garnered praise and respect from around the world .
Canada might play a more active role in the war on terror , including possible participation in future U.S. military operations .
The SPP is further advancing Canadian security and military assimilation into the U.S. and a North American Union .

Obviously , a political gimmick is what a political gimmick is , but there 's really something very strange about the conceit that flying to Iraq and taking a guided tour courtesy of the U.S. military is the best way to learn about the country .
I went to Spain for a week once , saw the central parts of Madrid and took some day trips to noteworthy towns that were easily accessible by train , but to answer even very basic question about Spain like " how wealthy is this country ? " or " how many immigrants live here ? " you need to look up the data not wander around .
The McCain approach leads to a lot of incidents like this , " McCain 's claim that Mosul is " quiet " was disproved earlier today in grim fashion .
Three suicide bombings -- two in Mosul and another in a surrounding town -- left 30 Iraqis dead and more than two dozen injured , according to press reports . "
Of course we can expect to hear more about this and about related things like McCain using General Petraeus in fundraising appeals , since turning MNF - Iraq into an extension of the McCain is a pretty appealing tactic .
Active duty officers will try to avoid getting dragged into the political fray , but the Bush administration has repeatedly shown that it can be done easily enough , and active duty generals are hard surrogates for Obama to push back against .
We want to hear what you think about this article .

Geneva –
The global financial crisis could lead to losses of 1,600 billion dollars for financial institutes , according a report in the Swiss Sunday newspaper SonntagsZeitung .
It quoted a confidential study by the hedge fund Bridgewater Associates as saying losses for banks holding risky assets could be four times greater than the 400 billion dollars previously estimated .
The hedge fund expressed doubts that the financial institutes would be able to drum up enough funds to cover the losses , something it said could exacerbate the crisis .
Bridgewater , one of the world ’s biggest hedge funds , based its calculations on the state of risky debt - based US assets , such as mortgages , credit and credit card demands .
The value of such risky assets is 26,600 billion dollars , according to the hedge fund .
The losses would amount to 1,600 billion dollars if these assets were valued at market rates and not in the form of securitization , the newspaper said .

Enlarge By Laura Rauch , AP SpaceShipOne taxis out on the launch ship , White Knight , in Mojave , Calif. , in 2004 .
British billionaire Sir Richard Branson and American aerospace designer Burt Rutan are due Monday to show off their mothership , which is designed to air launch a passenger - toting spaceship out of the atmosphere .
LOS ANGELES ( AP ) 
Aerospace engineers have been holed up in a Mojave Desert hangar for four years , fashioning a commercial spaceship to loft rich tourists some 62 miles above Earth .
Now the wraps come partially off the top - secret project .
British billionaire Sir Richard Branson and American aerospace designer Burt Rutan are due Monday to show off their mothership , which is designed to air launch a passenger - toting spaceship out of the atmosphere .
The rollout — a year after a deadly accident at Rutan 's test site — marks the start of a rigorous flight test program that space tourism advocates hope will climax with the first suborbital joy rides by the end of the decade .
More than 250 wannabe astronauts have paid $ 200,000 or put down deposits for a chance to float weightless for a mere five minutes .
" Having invested all my faith in it , I 'm so excited to see the actual thing , " said artist Namira Salim , a customer who is lined up for a ride on Branson 's Virgin Galactic .
The last time there was this level of buzz in the high desert north of Los Angeles was in 2004 , when throngs of spectators gathered to witness SpaceShipOne capture the $ 10 million Ansari X Prize by becoming the first private , manned craft to reach space .
It was designed by Rutan and bankrolled by Microsoft Corp. co-founder Paul Allen .
SpaceShipOne ushered in a new space age dominated by deep - pocketed entrepreneurs with dreams of making space voyages as mundane as airplane travel .
That vision remains unfulfilled .
Among the new space entrepreneurs is the swashbuckling Branson , who teamed with Rutan 's publicity - shy Scaled Composites LLC to commercialize SpaceShipOne .
Its successor , SpaceShipTwo , is being designed out of the public eye , along with the carrier aircraft White Knight Two .
" They 've been hyping this and selling tickets , " said Alan Radecki , a helicopter mechanic and aviation photographer who follows the private space race .
" This is the first time they 're going to have hardware to show people . "
Branson previously heralded 2008 as the " Year of the Spaceship . "
In January , he and Rutan offered a sneak peek of their commercial partnership , showing off scale models of the mothership and the spacecraft it will launch .
Though technical details remain guarded , tidbits about the vehicles have trickled out :
The twin-fuselage White Knight Two will have the same wingspan — 140 feet ( 42.4 meters ) — as the Boeing B - 29 Superfortress , a World War II U.S. bomber .
It will launch SpaceShipTwo , which will be the size of a corporate Gulfstream capable of carrying six passengers and two pilots .
Both will be built wholly from ultra - light composite materials .
Only White Knight
Two will be unveiled at Monday 's rollout , expected to be attended by politicians , government regulators and space tourism customers .
Flight testing is slated for the end of September after ground tests in August .
Meanwhile , SpaceShipTwo is only about 70 % complete , said Virgin Galactic president Will Whitehorn .
Observers of the infant private spaceflight industry are encouraged by the progress , but note that the main attraction — the actual spaceship that will carry passengers — is yet to come .
" It 's a positive step forward , " said space analyst John Logsdon of George Washington University .
" The real indication of progress will be showing a spaceship that 's on the path that 's ready to fly . "
Monday 's unveiling comes a year after an explosion at Scaled Composites ' test site killed three technicians .
The company , now owned by Northrop Grumman Corp. , is appealing a state fine of $ 28,870 for workplace violations in connection with the blast , which occurred during the development of SpaceShipTwo 's propellant system .
Exactly when tourists will experience zero gravity or see Earth 's curvature is unknown , but the project already lags Virgin Galactic 's 2004 prediction that passengers would be in space last year .
Whitehorn declined to set a date for commercial travel , but he said the earliest flights to space could be late 2009 or early 2010 .
The maiden voyage has been reserved for Branson and his family ; Virgin Galactic plans to rename the aircraft " Eve " after Branson 's mother , a former glider pilot instructor and flight attendant .
Plans call for White Knight Two to carry SpaceShipTwo 50,000 feet ( 15,151 meters ) in the air , tucked beneath its single wing , before releasing it .
SpaceShipTwo will then power its hybrid rocket and climb into space .
Before gliding back to Earth , it will use a Rutan - designed " feathering " technique — in which the wings are rotated upward from the fuselage to reduce the heat of re-entry .
The 2 { - hour trip is expected to include about five minutes of weightlessness .
Unlike the space shuttle that orbits Earth , early space tourism plans involve flights that simply go up and come back down .
Virgin Galactic has pledged more than $ 250 million toward the project ; about $ 100 million has been spent so far , Whitehorn said .
Virgin Galactic already has lofty plans for White Knight Two besides space tourism .
Company executives envision the aircraft can be used as a launcher of small satellites into low Earth orbit .
With the proper permits , the craft can also be adapted to fight wildfires or be used as an emergency rescue vehicle .
First , though , it needs to emerge from its secret hangar before it can get off the ground .

The Reality Distortion Field is starting to wear off , and I ’m getting a bad feeling about the iPhone 3G .
Do n’t get me wrong – my complaint is n’t about the iPhone 3G itself or how much it costs , but about how much more it will end up costing U.S. customers than the original iPhone thanks to higher monthly fees , and how Apple and AT&T are hiding that price increase from potential customers .
( It appears that things are different in other countries , where plans for the iPhone 3G are little changed . )
Apple ’s tag line for the iPhone 3G is “ Twice as fast .
Half the price . ”
And indeed , the price of a new 8 GB iPhone 3G is now $ 199 , down from $ 399 .
However , the 16 GB iPhone 3G drops from $ 499 to $ 299 , also a $ 200 drop , but not half the original price .
I ’m willing to grant a certain poetic license for marketing slogans – if one of the two models is half the price , that ’s good enough to warrant the tag line .
Things start to smell worse when you realize that the 3G cellular networking that gives the iPhone 3G its name both reduces battery life and costs more .
As I reported in “ Apple Announces iPhone 3G to Ship on 11 - Jul - 08 ” ( 2008 -06-09 ) , an unlimited personal data plan will cost $ 30 per month , up $ 10 from the original iPhone plan , when coupled with a voice plan that starts at $ 39.99 per month .
( ZDNet.com has a list of rates for individual and family voice plans ; note that you must add $ 10 per line to the family plans .
Business data plans will cost $ 45 per month , and must also be coupled with a voice plan . )
So buying an iPhone 3G may cost $ 200 less than before , but paying the monthly bill will set you back $ 240 more over your 2 - year contract with AT&T , for a total of $ 1,680 in subscription fees instead of $ 1,440 ( previously , the lowest monthly voice + data plan cost $ 59.99 per month ) .
How exactly is that cheaper ?
Wait , it gets worse !
Om Malik , in an interview with Ralph de la Vega , president and chief executive officer of AT&T Mobility , learned that SMS messages are no longer included in the data plan either , so you ’ll have to pay extra for them .
Previously , the data plan included 200 SMS messages per month .
AT&T ’s Messaging 200 plan , which includes 200 SMS messages , costs $ 5 per month , so it would seem likely that the iPhone 3 G ’s SMS plan would be similar .
( The iPhone 3 G ’s SMS rate details are n’t yet disclosed , and AT&T ’s live chat customer assistance person was either unwilling or unable to reveal how much they ’d be .
An AT&T spokesperson told us that the company would discuss the specifics of SMS pricing closer to the iPhone 3G release date . )
So now the minimum monthly cost of an iPhone 3G is up to $ 75 , raising the cost across 2 years by another $ 120 , to a total of $ 1,800 , and bringing the total cost of ownership and service of an 8 GB iPhone 3G to an even $ 2,000 .
That ’s $ 160 more than the total cost of ownership and service for an original 8 GB iPhone ( after the first price cut ) , which totals out to $ 1,840 .
What about AT&T ’s prepaid GoPhone plan , something that Apple reportedly required as an option for the original iPhone ?
Unfortunately , PhoneNews.com is reporting that AT&T has tentatively confirmed that GoPhone plans will not be available for the iPhone 3G .
It looks like you ’re stuck with a 2 - year contract , although it wo n’t be added onto existing contracts for current iPhone owners ( the 2 year contract will simply restart ) .
It ’s unclear what will happen to the iPhone hacking community , which has proven capable of unlocking each successive version of the iPhone software so you could use it with other , possibly less - expensive , carriers .
Apple ’s international push will remove much of the desire for unlocking in other countries , and in the United States , there will apparently be some sort of penalty for people who do n’t activate their iPhones within 30 days of purchase .
In the past , you could purchase an iPhone and activate it online through iTunes , which made it easy to avoid activation and instead unlock .
However , in a major shift , the iPhone 3G can be purchased and activated only in person at Apple and AT&T stores , which not only takes 10 to 12 minutes , but will make it nearly impossible to avoid activation .
The lines are going to be awful the first few days , with each transaction taking far longer than at the iPhone ’s launch in 2007 , when purchasers could head home and activate online .
( Perhaps this will be an easier process for an existing AT&T customer transferring her current phone number , or for a current iPhone owner – could the phone ’s SIM card simply be swapped in and the plan updated ? )
The reason for this change is the way AT&T ’s contract with Apple has been renegotiated .
Gone is the revenue sharing deal that gave Apple a portion of your monthly fees ( as much as $ 18 per month by some estimates ) .
In place of that , AT&T will pay Apple more for each iPhone , thus subsidizing the lower initial cost to customers .
AT&T ’s press release says that this revised agreement “ is consistent with traditional equipment manufacturer - carrier arrangements , ” and “ both iPhone 3G models will be offered at attractive prices to broaden the market potential and accelerate subscriber volumes . ”
So AT&T believes that lowering the initial price of the phone and raising the monthly fees will – by 2010 – generate more income than the previous revenue sharing approach .
AT&T backs this up by noting that “ average monthly revenues per iPhone subscriber are nearly double the average of the company ’s overall subscriber base . ”
I do n’t have a problem with Apple and AT&T making moves to increase market size or profitability .
And I do n’t even really have a problem with the overall cost of the iPhone 3G , which seems roughly comparable with similar smartphones and their associated service plans ( as Gizmodo ’s chart shows ) .
What does bother me about all this is how both Apple and AT&T are making a big deal about the iPhone 3G being cheaper , Apple with the “ Half the price ” tag line and AT&T with its “ $ 199 Starting Price Significantly Expands Mass Market Appeal ” line in the press release , along with the bare - faced statement that lowering the initial price will “ accelerate subscriber volumes . ”
That initial purchase will indeed be cheaper , but anyone who does n’t take the higher monthly fees into account is either being deceived or is just plain stupid .
I know it ’s standard marketing practice to take advantage of the math - challenged with tricks like this , but it still feels underhanded .
And yes , I realize that Apple is just the manufacturer now , especially given that the revenue sharing plan has been dropped , but we ’re talking about a cell phone that ’s essentially useless without a voice and data plan , for which there is only one source – AT&T .
So any discussions of cost must include the monthly service fees in addition to the initial purchase price .

At least 17 people have been killed and 150 hurt by two bombs in a residential area of the Turkish city of Istanbul .
The first bomb was planted in a rubbish bin in the Gungoren area .
It caused crowds to gather before a second , larger device detonated .
No group has claimed responsibility , but security services said the attack bore the hallmarks of Kurdish rebels .
It came hours before the constitutional court began deliberations over whether to ban the ruling AK Party .
The AKP forms the country 's government and won a resounding victory in elections just last year , but Turkey 's secular elite accuses the party of seeking to impose an Islamic agenda - a charge it denies .
The BBC's Sarah Rainsford , in Istanbul , says the chances are that the court will close down the AK Party , casting doubt over Turkey 's political future , its international relations and relations with the European Union .
Hidden bombs
The long - running court battle with the AKP has been overshadowed by the bloodshed in Istanbul .
The death toll , which stood at 16 overnight , rose to 17 on Monday after one injured person died in hospital , the country 's health minister said .
Seven more people remain seriously injured , Recep Akdag told the country 's Anatolia news agency .
Some Turkish newspapers reported on Monday that three people had been arrested near the scene of the bombings , but there was no confirmation of this by the police .
Turkey 's President Abdullah Gul said the attack on Istanbul showed " the ruthlessness of terrorism " , while Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan said such attacks only strengthened Turkey 's determination in its fight against terrorism .
The blasts occurred about 10 minutes apart around 2200 local time ( 1900 GMT ) on a busy pedestrian street .
There were scenes of panic , with people covered in blood as they tried to run from the scene .
TV footage showed many victims lying on the street and being carried to ambulances in blankets .
About 1,000 were said to be in the area at the time on a warm summer evening .
" The first explosion was not very strong , " Huseyin Senturk , the owner of a nearby shoe shop , told the Associated Press .
" Several people came to see what was going on .
That 's when the second explosion occurred and it injured many onlookers . "
Kurds suspected Police in Istanbul quickly linked the bombings to the Kurdish separatist group , the Kurdistan Workers Party ( PKK ) .
The balmy summer weather meant the streets were full of people
The group has bombed Turkish civilians before , and may be seeking revenge for recent operations by the Turkish military against its bases .
Istanbul Governor Muammer Guler said " there appears to be a link " with the PKK .
He said the authorities were trying to confirm it .
But the PKK leader Zubeyir Aydar was quoted by pro-Kurdish news agency Firat denying any involvement .
" The Kurdish freedom movement has nothing to do with this event , this can not be linked to the PKK , " he was quoted as saying .
Suggestions that Islamist groups planned the attack were played down , as previous attacks by Islamists have targeted foreign consulates or businesses in Istanbul .
In November 2003 , more than 60 people were killed by a series of suicide bombings in Istanbul , which the authorities linked to al - Qaeda .

What are these ?
In Murehwa , in the province of Mashonaland East , many voters did just that .
After a full night of being forced to chant the slogans of Mr. Mugabe ’s party , ZANU - PF , they were taken to the polls in groups of five , said a teacher who described the events .
He was too afraid to provide his name .

“ In each group there was a leader who would record the serial number on the ballot so they could detect who you voted for , ” he said , because Mr. Tsvangirai withdrew too late to have his name removed from the ballot .
Many voters were desperate for the protection offered by a pinky finger dipped in red ink , evidence that they had voted .
“ I just wanted the ink for security reasons , ” said MacDonald , 33 , a man who voted in a ramshackle Harare suburb and did not want his comments accompanied by his last name .
“ I fear victimization from the ZANU - PF militia .
It is obvious they will come door to door .
If they see you do not have the red ink , they will know you are for the opposition . ”
Friday ’s election , denounced as a sham by many leaders across Africa and throughout the world , was a woeful event in a woebegone nation , afflicted by sinister violence and an economy that has plunged most everyone into penury .
The vote was a marked contrast to the election that took place here in March , when optimism tinged the air and people stood in long lines , chatting and joking , welcoming the chance to partake in democracy .

The National Australia Bank ’s decision to write off 90 per cent of its US conduit loans will have dramatic repercussions around the world .
Wall Street will be deeply shocked when they understand the repercussions of what NAB has done .
It is clear global banks have nowhere near provided for their exposures to US housing loans which in the words of John Stewart are experiencing a “ meltdown ” .
We are now way beyond sub -prime .
NAB says that it is suffering a 55 per cent loss on American housing loans – an event that has never happened in the history of a developed country in recent memory .
This is an unprecedented event and means that the cost of bailing out the US financial system is now far beyond the highest estimates .
A US recession is now locked in , but more alarmingly , 55 per cent loan losses point to the possibility of a depression .
It means the cost of bailing out housing exposures to the two mortgage insurers will be so great that it will leave no room to bail out anything else and there are several US banks that are now in big trouble .
NAB says that the dislocation in the residential market is separate from the corporate market , but the flow on is inevitable .
While global banks have been writing down their balance sheet assets , few have tackled their conduit exposures which are off balance sheet but to which they are ultimately liable .
This morning at around 6 am I wrote that we had been experiencing a ‘ dead cat bounce ’ .
I had no idea that NAB would trigger the downturn and confirm what I had written .
And of course Wall Street will receive a deep shock when it wakes up .
How did NAB get caught in $ 1.2 billion mess ?
They had a number of big clients who wanted to invest in these US housing loans .
They were sucked in by the ‘ triple A rating ’ given to the securities by the rating agencies .
They did not take into account that the monoline insurers who guaranteed some of the loans had no substance .
To become a player NAB took out $ 1.2 billion in these triple A securities and 90 per cent of it has been lost .
Many Australian institutions are very angry .
NAB is paying out far too much in dividends and should be conserving capital .
The American bank it purchased , Great Western , was a good idea but it is now clear it overpaid for it .
Fortunately it only has a small exposure to the bad loans .
But what ’s happening to the NAB is not the main game .
The global banks have been marking to market the assets they held on their balance sheet , but the vast amounts held in so called ‘ conduit trust accounts ’ have not been written down because they were not marketable .
NAB wrote them down when they saw the bad mortgages .
US banks have written down $ 450 billion in bad housing loans .
The revelation from NAB means that they will now certainly need to take provisions to $ 1,000 billion .
But write - downs of $ 1,300 billion and perhaps even more are on the cards .
Where will the equity come from to cover these bad loans ?
The world has never attempted a rescue effort of this size and it will make liquidity in the globe very tight .
That ’s why corporates will be hit .
All Australian companies that need equity should raise it now .

TEHRAN , July 26 ( Reuters ) - Iran ’s OPEC governor said world oil prices could reach as high as $ 500 per barrel in a few years ’ time if the U.S. dollar falls further and political tension worsens , an Iranian weekly said .
“ If the dollar ’s value continues to decrease and if the political crisis becomes worse , the oil price would reach up to $ 500 , ” Mohammad Ali Khatibi told Shahrvand-e Emrooz in an interview published on Saturday .
He was asked about predictions that oil prices could reach up to $ 200 per barrel in the next two or three years .
Oil dropped $ 2 to a fresh seven - week low on Friday , extending a decline that has knocked more than $ 24 off crude in two weeks as high fuel prices continue to batter demand .
Crude prices reached an all - time peak of $ 147 earlier this month .
Khatibi also said oil exports from the whole Middle East region would be at risk if the Islamic state came under any military attack over its disputed nuclear programme .
“ If there is another war in the region , it will not only be Iran ’s oil not reaching the market , but rather the oil of the whole region would be cut from the market , ” Khatibi said .
“ In that case , we will not have a price rise .
We will have a price explosion . ”
Around 40 percent of global oil shipments leave the Gulf through the Strait of Hormuz off Iran ’s southern coast and Tehran has threatened to impose controls on shipping there if it is attacked , and warned Gulf neighbours of reprisals if they took part .
The United States and Iran are at loggerheads over Tehran ’s disputed nuclear work .
Washington says it wants a diplomatic solution to the row , but has not ruled out military action if that were to fail .
Tehran says its atomic activities are purely peaceful , aimed at generating electricity .

A senior Chinese official has urged India to " understand and support " China 's policy towards Tibet , following recent unrest there .
State Councillor Dai Bingguo comments came in a telephone call to Indian National Security Adviser MK Narayanan .
Beijing said Mr Narayanan had reiterated that the government in Delhi viewed Tibet as part of China .
Tibet 's spiritual leader , the Dalai Lama , has lived in India since fleeing his homeland in 1959 .
India is also home to more than 150,000 Tibetan exiles .
Tibet 's government - in - exile , based in India , says about 140 people were killed in a crackdown by Chinese security forces since anti-China riots began two weeks ago .
Beijing disputes this , saying 19 people were killed by rioters .
Improved relations
Mr Dai said he hoped Mr Narayanan could " understand and support China 's actions " in Tibet .
India has not allowed large - scale Tibetan protests
He added that Mr Narayanan responded by saying that the government in Delhi did not support independence for Tibet or allow anti-Chinese actions on India 's soil .
The telephone talks followed reports in India 's media that China had recently summoned the Indian ambassador to Beijing to voice its concern about Tibetan protests in India .
India has in the past been sympathetic to the Tibetan cause but in recent years Delhi 's relations with Beijing have improved .
India has not allowed large - scale public protests for fear of embarrassing Beijing .
Earlier this month , more than 100 Tibetan refugees were detained in India while attempting to march to the Chinese border .
DAVE MATTHEWS “ JUST VOTE ” CAMPAIGN OFFERS EXCLUSIVE PERFORMANCE
Dave Matthews is joining the Just Vote campaign , with the mission of engaging young Americans to check their status , register ...
Credulity , it seems , is the quintessential American virtue .
Value is found not in closely examining claims to discover their relationship to truth but , instead , by expressing a willingness to abandon inquiry in favor of hope .
Would claim X , if true , make the world a better place ?
If so , we should act as if it is true , regardless of evidence or consequences .
We can solve the energy crisis , for instance , if we believe strongly enough in green technologies and never mind the cost .
We can banish homelessness by giving those without shelter the hope of a better tomorrow , regardless of the underlying causes of their plight .
We can put an end to hate and bigotry by admonishing those who do not respect all beliefs .
We can justify a lifetime of suffering if only we hold fast to the idea of posthumous paradise .
Religion , of course , is the exemplar of this culture of credulity .
Faith is , at its core , wish fullfilment .
I want there to be an omnibenevolent God who loves me so , therefore , there is an omnibenevolent God who loves me .
I desire good to be rewarded and evil punished so , therefore , an afterlive exists designed to do just that .
The rejection of religious faith , thus , is popularly condemned as the broader rejection of hope .
The atheist must be bitter and suffering as a result of his choice — or perhaps his choice came about because of his bitterness and suffering .
Regardless , the atheist is the subject of pitty , if not outright scorn , because he has opted to turn away from a set of beliefs that are so nice .
Why , society asks , would any person want to undermine such an optimistic world view ?
This condemnation of atheism is socially acceptable in a way that would seem immediately suspect if directed at a given religious sect .
A movie or television show that portrayed a Jewish character as brought low by his religion , only to find happiness by embracing Christ , would find itself labeled religious bigotry , not a messenger of embraceable platitudes .
A clear example of the banality of anti-atheist sentiment can be seen in the recent blockbuster film , “ I Am Legend . ”
Staring Will Smith , the movie tells the story of a scientist , Robert Neville , left alone by , and immune to , a global plague that turns many of its victims into zombie - like vampires .
By day , he explores an abandoned New York City , hunting the vampires and bringing them back to his lab to experiment for a cure .
By night , he hides in his home , which he has retrofitted into an armored bunker , hoping to live to see the next day .
Whether Neville was an atheist before the infection is never explicitly told , though there is a scene at the beginning where he prays with his family .
We can assume , therefore , that he was , at one time , a man of faith , but lost his belief as a result of the evils he saw around him .
This is typical of Hollywood ’s view of atheists : they only ever arrive at their atheism through a traumatic severing of faith .
Religion is the default human condition and to reject it must be the result of anger against the heavenly father .
Instead of atheism being a rational choice , one arrived at by weighing argument and evidence , it is instead analogous to the teenager screaming “ You ’re not my dad ! ” at her offending parent and slamming her bedroom door .
Atheism comes about through emotional rebellion , not intellectual application .
As such , it is less a philosophy than a symptom of a curable disease .
Why is the atheist so angry ?
If we can alleviate that anger , he will gladly return to the fold .
Near the end of the film , Neville meets a woman and a young boy .
They are traveling to a safe zone somewhere in New England .
Neville , who has information that these protected areas , while planned , never materialized , questions the woman on how she knows of its existence .
“ God told me , ” she said .
Neville rejects this .
Returning to the theme of atheism as anger , he tells the woman that there is no God.
Would God have allowed this plague ?
No , Neville says .
There must not be a God , because the disease is wholly the work of man .
The woman is n’t put off by any of this .
She knows
God is out there and that he ’s the one who told her about the safe zone .
When we first see her , she ’s driving a car with a cross hanging from the rearview mirror .
The climax comes when the three are cornered by the vampires in Neville ’s lab .
Neville discovers that his latest attempt at a cure , tested on a vampire he has imprisoned in the spot they ’re now hiding , has worked .
He can fix the world ’s greatest ill .
For reasons that make little practical sense , however , he decides that he must hand the cure off to the woman and sacrifice himself to protect her and the boy .
He comes to this odd conclusion through a clumsy recovery of faith .
His daughter , it seems , was fond of clasping her tiny hands into the shape of a butterfly , a fact he remembers as he notices first a butterfly tattoo on the neck of the vampire he ’s captured and , second , the cracks in the glass separating him from the horde of undead , cracks which form , yes , a butterfly .
These coincidences convince him that there really is a god and that the woman ’s claim to divine knowledge is true .
Neville hands her the cure , locks her safely away , and blows himself up .
He ’s recovered from his unfortunate atheism but must still pay the price for rejecting God .
The film concludes with the woman and boy finding the promised safe zone and handing Neville ’s cure to the proper authorities .
What are we to make of this heavy handed moralizing ?
The message in “ I Am Legend ” is clear : belief in God makes even the extraordinary possible .
To reject belief in God , then , is to reject the possibility of the extraordinary .
What a sad and hopeless belief atheism must , therefore , be .
Of course , had Neville been Jewish and the woman more overtly Christian , anti-defamation leagues everywhere would have called for the film ’s boycott .
That is n’t the case when the target of righteous condemnation is atheism .
All good , caring , and loving people necessarily have faith in a good , caring , and loving creator .
It is only the cynics and the miserable who would reject such a beautiful dream .
Enjoyed this post ?
If you enjoyed this post , you ’ll probably like my very infrequent newsletter , where I talk about what I ’m up to , what I ’m reading , and what I ’m thinking about .
Leave this field empty if you 're human :
Trees and shrubs are likely to be most threatened by rising temperatures Climate change has caused plants to seek cooler conditions at higher altitudes , scientists suggest .
A study of 171 forest species in mountain ranges of western Europe found that many plants had climbed an average of 29 metres each decade .
Smaller species such as ferns , which had shorter reproduction cycles , were the quickest to relocate , the researchers said .
The findings have been published in the Science journal .
" This is the first time that it has been shown that climate change has already had a significant effect on plant species over a wide range of temperatures during the past century , " explained Jonathan Lenoir , the paper 's lead author .
Climate ' fingerprints ' Professor Lenoir , an ecologist at AgroParisTech , France , said the team wanted to establish whether " fingerprints of climate change were already apparent in ordinary ecosystems " .
In order to do this , the team of French and Chilean researchers compared the distribution of forest species between 1905 and 1985 with their distribution between 1986 and 2005 .
" This work was possible because of two large - scale , long - term databases that have recorded the presence of forest species since 1905 , " he explained .
This may imply profound changes in the composition and structure of plant communities and animal species that depend upon them
Professor Jean - Claude Gegout ,
AgroParisTech
" We used 171 species commonly found over French mountains , which are part of Mediterranean , temperature and mountainous forest ecosystems between 0 m to 2,600 m above sea level .
" We found a significant change in species ' altitudinal distribution towards higher elevation of about 29 metres per decade .
" Out of the 171 species , most are shifting upwards to recover temperature conditions that are optimal for their development and reproduction . "
Co-author Jean - Claude Gegout added that different types of plants displayed different responses to the temperature changes .
" Long - life plants , such as trees and shrubs , did not show significant shifts , whereas short - life species , such as herbs , showed a strong upward shift , " he said .
" Herbs , by having a short life cycle , have had several generations during a decade that allows for a faster dispersal of seeds .
" By contrast , trees have had just one or two generations during the same period of time , which may affect their ability to track the climate changes . "
Professor Gegout said that this suggested that long living woody plant species , such as trees , were likely to be more threatened by climate change than herb species like grasses .
" This may imply profound changes in the composition and structure of plant communities and animal species that depend upon them . "
The researchers concluded by saying that further studies were needed to understand the full magnitude of the changes , and to assess the impact on the ecosystems ' long - term future .

What are these ?
TORONTO , July 8 ( Reuters ) -
After years of hovering high above sports stadiums to provide aerial shots to TV audiences , blimps may soon take on a new role in carrying heavy cargo to remote regions like northern Canada ’s oil sands .
Chicago - based Boeing Co BA.N said on Tuesday it has teamed with a privately owned Canadian company to build a blimp it says will be able to carry a 40 ton load 200 miles ( 320 km ) without refueling .
Boeing said the blimp would be environmentally friendly because it would eliminate the need to build roads or rail lines to remote locations , where transportation can be costly , inadequate and unreliable .
The JHL - 40 , or Jess Heavy Lifter , is named after Pete Jess , president and chief operating officer of SkyHook International , the Calgary , Alberta - based company that secured the patent for the blimp , which combines elements of a helicopter and a traditional airship .
“ Companies have suggested this new technology will enable them to modify their current operational strategy and begin working much sooner on projects that were thought to be 15 to 20 years away , ” Jess said in a statement .
Boeing said the blimp , which would be able to carry more than double the capacity of the biggest helicopter , uses lighter - than - air helium to lift itself off the ground while fuel would be dedicated to powering the craft ’s four rotors , used solely to move the load .
This compares with helicopters , which require plenty of fuel just to lift themselves off the ground .
Boeing said the aircraft will hit the market as soon as it gets certification from Transport Canada and the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration .

It really does n't look that bad .
I mean , it 's still a stupid idea , if you ask me , but it seems as though they are bringing back old - school elements to the Mortal Kombat universe .
Hence my statement , " It really does n't look that bad . "
If only DC had more interesting characters besides Batman and Superman ( Sorry Flash ) .
Special Future of War edition : robots , lasers , brain weapons , and a little thing called " strategic thinking . "
 174th Robot Wing : The 174th Fighter Wing of the US Air Force has flown its last mission , and has been replaced by an all - RPV ( Remote Piloted Vehicle ) squad .
The MQ - 9 " Reaper " is a real combat aircraft , carrying literally a ton of bombs ; it also can stay in operation for over 14 hours straight , uses far less fuel and costs two - thirds less than the F16s it replaces .
Put simply ,
It 's cheaper , more effective , and safer ( for pilots ) to use Reapers ( or similar aircraft ) for a lot of the ground support work .
Fighters are still needed to keep the skies clear of enemy aircraft , although Reapers are better suited for the dangerous work of destroying enemy air defenses .
But for fighting irregulars , the Reaper is king .
It 's unclear how much longer the superiority of fighters for air - to - air combat will last , especially if you can get three Reapers in the air for the cost of one Falcon .
These are n't true robots , of course -- they 're remote vehicles , with human operators on the ground with radio controls .
This means that sticky questions about autonomous systems pulling the trigger on human targets still remain on the horizon .
It also means that we 'll probably see even more effort put into figuring ways to jam or take over the radio controls .
Finally , it 's not hard to imagine that such vehicles would be more likely to be used in situations which would previously have been avoided in order to not put human pilots in danger .
 ZZZZZZZZZAP ! : Question is , how long until these remotely - piloted vehicles get outfitted with high - energy lasers for long - distance pinpoint attacks ?
Right now , the Advanced Tactical Laser system requires a big old C130 cargo aircraft .
But -- if it works the way the Air Force claims ( always a big if ) -- it really does change the nature of tactical conflict .
The accuracy of this weapon is little short of supernatural .
They claim that the pinpoint precision can make it lethal or non-lethal at will .
For example , they say it can either destroy a vehicle completely , or just damage the tires to immobilize it .
The illustration shows a theoretical 26 - second engagement in which the beam deftly destroys " 32 tires , 11 Antennae , 3 Missile Launchers , 11 EO devices , 4 Mortars , 5 Machine Guns " -- while avoiding harming a truckload of refugees and the soldiers guarding them .
Over at New Scientist , David Hambling explores some of the implications of a system like this .
Since the ATL can " deliver the heat of a blowtorch with a range of 20 kilometers , " it 's not hard to imagine its use for covert operations .
With a laser , there are no munition fragments to identify what hit the target , only an " ... instantaneous burst - combustion of insurgent clothing , a rapid death through violent trauma , and more probably a morbid combination of both . "
( " It happens sometimes .
People just explode .
Natural causes . " )
 Braaaaiinnnnnssssss : Mind bombs and lie disruptors and super - soldiers , oh my .
The Guardian gives us a peek at the future of war , and this time , it 's heavily medicated .
On the battlefield , bullets may be replaced with " pharmacological land mines " that release drugs to incapacitate soldiers on contact , while scanners and other electronic devices could be developed to identify suspects from their brain activity and even disrupt their ability to tell lies when questioned ...
Drugs could also be used to enhance the performance of military personnel .
Of course , the first would be restricted by existing chemical weapons treaties -- and while we 've seen in recent years that treaties are only as good as the people willing to abide by them , it is an issue -- and the second is one of those " real soon now " developments that remains perpetually on the horizon .
As for the last one , the drug - enhanced soldiers , get in line :
The military will be following the commercial market , not leading it .
 Whoops .
Our Mistake :
Of course , this all assumes that war has a future .
At least in some cases , it really is the worst option , at least according to those crazy left - wingers at the RAND corporation :
The comprehensive study analyzes 648 terrorist groups that existed between 1968 and 2006 , drawing from a terrorism database maintained by RAND and the Memorial Institute for the Prevention of Terrorism .
The most common way that terrorist groups end -- 43 percent -- was via a transition to the political process .
However , the possibility of a political solution is more likely if the group has narrow goals , rather than a broad , sweeping agenda like al Qaida possesses .
The second most common way that terrorist groups end -- 40 percent -- was through police and intelligence services either apprehending or killing the key leaders of these groups .
Policing is especially effective in dealing with terrorists because police have a permanent presence in cities that enables them to efficiently gather information , Jones said .
Military force was effective in only 7 percent of the cases examined ; in most instances , military force is too blunt an instrument to be successful against terrorist groups , although it can be useful for quelling insurgencies in which the terrorist groups are large , well - armed and well - organized , according to researchers .
In a number of cases , the groups end because they become splintered , with members joining other groups or forming new factions .
Terrorist groups achieved victory in only 10 percent of the cases studied .
The key point of comparison here : a terrorist group is more likely to achieve its desired goals than to be put down by military force .

Global Oil Demand Reduced By High Prices ?
We 're Still Waiting ...
Ready for $ 12 Gas ?
$ 500 Oil Inevitable , Says London Professor
And with the advent of what artificial - intelligence expert Professor Hugo de Garis calls artilects - massively intelligent artificial intellects - there is the risk that not only will we have created our successors but also that such machines may wipe humans out by accident or design .
De Garis thinks " species dominance " will be one - if not the - main political issue this century .
" If these artilects come into being , they may become so superior to us they might , to use an analogy , treat us like ants , " he says .
" They may do something and , as a side effect , we get wiped out .
Or they may choose to wipe us out .
" They would think a trillion times faster , they would have unlimited memory , they could change their shape , they would be immortal .
They would be godlike .
Imagine what they could be thinking . "
De Garis is the director of the China Brain Project , trying to build China 's - and possibly the world 's - first artificial brain .
As with Bill Gates , he can foresee a time when robotics will be a huge industry .
( So can the US military , which is already talking about phasing out human soldiers by the 2030s and putting robot troops on the front line . )
" If we can build an artificial brain , that would hopefully be the beginnings of increasingly intelligent robots and that could become a huge industry , " de Garis says .
" They could babysit the kids , take your dog for a walk .
A robot is just a piece of steel but it's the control that makes it useful .
That 's where the artificial brain comes in . "
Yet in his book , The Artilect War , he imagines a scenario where there will be a terrible battle between the forces who want to build these massively intelligent machines ( the Cosmists ) and those who do n't ( the Terrans ) .
The Terrans would either fear the potential for catastrophe - what if a robot soldier accidentally nukes a city ?
- or be nervous about the idea of humans being surpassed by machines .
De Garis says the growth of nanotechnology will give engineers and scientists powerful new tools .
There will be an explosion of knowledge of how the brain works - companies involved in artificial brain research " will be the Googles and Microsofts of the future " .
This technology can be used to create artificial brains that replicate many of our brain 's pathways and features for use in the robotics industry .
" Year by year , billions of people will notice that last year 's robot is quite a bit dumber than this year 's , " de Garis says .
" They upgrade .
As the IQ gap between humans and machines starts decreasing , you can imagine millions of people starting to worry a little .
People start to ask questions such as , ' Are machines going to get as smart as us ?
Is that a good thing ?
Should we legislate an upper limit of artificial intelligence so it's not threatening to humans ? " '
The Terrans might be tempted to launch a pre-emptive strike on the Cosmist force to remove any possible danger from such superhumanly smart machines .
And the Cosmist forces , who see such technology as the destiny of humanity , may respond in kind .
" And since we 're talking about the late 21st century , we 're talking about gigadeaths , " he says .
" Frankly , I 'm glad to be alive now .
I do not want to be alive to see this . "
Hans Moravec , research professor at the Robotics Institute of Carnegie Mellon University , predicts in his book , Robot : Mere Machine To Transcendent Mind , that robots will evolve into a new intelligent species and take over the running of a more automated economy .
People will have a lot more leisure time , with the drawback being we 'll have to accept our own obsolescence .
Others are more optimistic .
In his book , The Singularity Is Near : When Humans Transcend Biology , writer and technological visionary Ray Kurzweil says that " within several decades information - based technologies will encompass all human knowledge and proficiency , ultimately including the pattern - recognition powers , problem - solving skills , and emotional and moral intelligence of the human brain itself " .
Yet he rejects de Garis 's idea of an almighty war between robot - loving Cosmists and tech - fearing Terrans .
" It is like a war today between the Amish , an American religious sect that largely rejects technology , and the rest of society , " he says .
Instead Kurzweil imagines a more benign role for robots , who will work hand in hand with humans - and may regard their human creators with something approaching reverence .
Kevin Warwick , professor of cybernetics at the University of Reading in Britain , has been researching ways to link artificial and human intelligence to upgrade the latter .
He can see the appeal of a third option : to technologically augment oneself to become an artilect - like superior being .
" In terms of moving from being human - I see humans as being very limited , " Warwick says .
" And why should we be so limited ?
I can see the advantages from a mental point of view particularly [ of merging with technology ] .
Once you merge with the machine , you can plug yourself into the network . "
Some people may want to remain totally human .
" They 'll be part of some subspecies , " Warwick says .
" It 'll be up to them if they want to be bossed around and be second - rate . "
He thinks it is mildly ridiculous that some people consider humans will always be smarter than machines because machines can't write poetry or make a cup of coffee .
" I think some of the time people like to write books with Hollywood endings and the Hollywood ending is that humans will be all right because robots can't make a cup of coffee , " Warwick says .
" If you say in the book that humans will all die off , no one wants to read that .
Even Terminator gets crushed in the end .
In reality it's not the Terminator that gets crushed - it 's the humans that get crushed . "
After receiving over 200 inadvertent complaints and DMCA takedown notices while studying BitTorrent traffic in 2007 , researchers at the University of Washington decided to evaluate the accuracy and effectiveness of monitoring agents employed by copyright stakeholders .
What they found was not a particularly encouraging state of justice .
In the recently published paper , researchers Michael Piatek , Tadayoshi Kohno , Arvind Krishnamurthy , Department of Computer Science & Engineering at the University of Washington , set out to attract bogus DMCA takedown notices to determine what methods were used to identify P2P file sharers , to evaluate their accuracy , and determine how easy it would be to deliberately or accidentally implicate an innocent IP address .
In the course of the research to reverse engineer enforcement methods , there were no infringing files were shared with any torrent , but between both projects , 487 false positive complaints were received , the majority for movies and television followed by software , books , and finally music .
The copyright thieves , I mean culprits that were implicated : networked printers , a wireless access point , and a desktop computer without any infringing content on it .
Of course , we all know that printers enjoy downloading and watching the latest Hollywood blockbusters without paying for them as much as anyone does .
Based on the data collected , the authors came to the following conclusions :
Copyright holders utilize inconclusive methods for identifying infringing BitTorrent users .
We were able to generate hundreds of DMCA takedown notices for machines under our control at the University of Washington that were not downloading or sharing any content .
We also find strong evidence to suggest that current monitoring agents are highly distinguishable from regular users in the BitTorrent P2P network .
Our results imply that automatic and fine - grained detection of monitoring agents is feasible , suggesting further challenges for monitoring organizations in the future .
Challenges and Directions for Monitoring P2P File Sharing Networks –or– Why My Printer Received a DMCA Takedown Notice
DMCA takedown notices sent to ISPs typically include the IP address of the infringing host , metadata identifying the infringing file , and the date and time of detection .
Detection agents like Media Sentry and Media Defender , typically hired by the likes of the MPAA and the RIAA , have two basic methods available to them .
Direct detection involves actually contacting a peer in a torrent swarm identified by a tracker and downloading at least part of an infringing file .
The other method is indirect detection where IP addresses associated with a swarm are provided by the torrent tracker , which are presumed to be file sharing without any actual file sharing taking place .
The latter method is predicated on an assumption of guilt without any proof that the supposed crime was actually committed by the accused ; the witness never saw any crime actually being committed .
The basic experimental setup was to identify candidate BitTorrent swarms and query the accompanying tracker for bootstrapping peers .
This allowed the researchers to determine swarm membership as well as identify themselves as a possible replica to the swarm without any infringing files exchanged .
Any contact between computers on the internet always requires IP address to route communications , but the researchers were able to deliberately falsify their client IP addresses as well as cause accidental misreporting of their IP address to the swarm .
There are a number of different scenarios possible as to how a tracker can end up with the wrong IP address by forgery or error , how the wrong computer can be associated to an IP address , or how a computer can be unknowingly used for file sharing :
Certain trackers allow clients to specify alternate an IP address for files to allow compatibility with proxy servers and network address translation ( NAT )
Tracker metadata is user generated and can be altered to include any arbitrary IP address as a peer
IP address are reallocated to other users on public Wi-Fi when a previous P2P user fails to disconnect properly from the torrent
Tracker responses to queries are unencrypted , allowing for interception and alteration by anyone between transmission points
Malware running on a machine that hosts or downloads infringing content
An open network access point that is used by other to transfer infringing content
During the experiment , the researchers were able to frame a random collection of networked devices at the University of Washington that were incapable of infringement by simply providing incorrect IP addresses to the trackers .
Because they never provided any infringing files to the torrent trackers , all of the DMCA notices that they received could only come from indirect detection .
Direct detection eliminates the possible false positives because an erroneous address will not have any infringing files available for download .
So , with all the possible sources of error , why are content providers and their watchdogs relying on unreliable methods ?
To cut costs .
Direct detection of file sharing for copyright infringement is bandwidth and effort intensive , i.e. it costs more .
After identifying an IP address with potentially infringing content , someone has to take the time to download the file and it has to be stored somewhere .
This would quickly add up over the many possible occurrences and the costs to catch actual copyright infringement are then multiplied further by downloading the false positives .
It ’s far easier to find a place were crimes might be committed and start accusing anyone they happen to find in the vicinity .
The flipside to sending out DMCA notices to prevent illegal file sharing is that it is technically also illegal to send out bogus notices under Section 512 ( f ) which provides penalties for knowing misrepresentation of copyright claims .
With the obvious flaws and inconclusive evidence provided by indirect detection , it is not very believable that these self - appointed copyright cops are unaware of the high probability that they implicate innocent people .
It ’s nice to see that organizations like the MPAA and the RIAA do n’t mind breaking the law to ensnare innocent people in their effort to prevent illegal copyright infringement as a cost saving measure all to enhance the corporate bottom line .

President Carter 's most recent moralizing on American foreign policy in the Middle East is exasperating particularly in light of President Mugabe 's misrule of Zimbabwe , where Mr. Carter 's role in bringing the dictator to power has been mostly forgotten .
Mr. Mugabe is one of the nastiest dictators in Africa  he has inflicted a " silent genocide " by starving his own people .
The effects of his authoritarian rule have been made all the worse by his staying power .
In more than 27 years as head of state , Mr. Mugabe has turned one of Africa 's most productive economies into a shambles .
A country whose currency once beat the British pound now boasts an inflation rate nearing 10,000 % per annum and a land that once exported beef and grain now has a population desperately in need of food and humanitarian aid .
Last month , Mr. Carter termed the American and Israeli government 's boycott of the Hamas - led Palestinian government " criminal . "
It would be more enlightening though to hear what he thinks of the terrible situation he helped to create in Zimbabwe .
In 1978 Ian Smith , the prime minister of white - ruled Rhodesia , now known as Zimbabwe , who had just declared two years earlier that majority rule would not come for " 1,000 years , " reached an agreement with black moderate leaders for a transition government .
Under this plan , termed the " internal settlement , " whites , who represented about 4 % of the population , would be reserved 28 out of 100 parliamentary seats as well as control over certain government ministries  privileges that seem ripe for condemnation today but hardly unusual for an African country emerging from nearly a century of colonial rule .
The plan facilitated by the American and British governments that Mr. Mugabe would eventually accept in 1980 put aside 20 out of 100 seats for whites  eight less than the arrangement stipulated by the internal settlement .
In April of 1979 , the first fully democratic election in Zimbabwe history 's occurred .
Of the eligible black voters , 64 % participated , braving the threat of terrorist attacks by Mr. Mugabe 's Zimbabwe African National Union - Patriotic Front party , which managed to kill 10 people .
Prior to the election , Mr. Mugabe had issued a death list with 50 individuals he named as " traitors , fellow - travelers , and puppets of the Ian Smith regime , opportunistic running - dogs and other capitalist vultures . "
Nevertheless , Bishop Abel Muzorewa of the United Methodist Church emerged victorious and became prime minister of Zimbabwe - Rhodesia , as the new country was called .
Yet the Carter administration , led by the U.S. ambassador to the United Nations , Andrew Young , would have none of it .
Mr. Young referred to Mr. Muzorewa , one of the very few democratically elected leaders on the African continent , as the head of a " neo- fascist " government .
Mr. Carter refused to meet Mr. Muzorewa when the newly elected leader visited Washington to seek support from our country , nor did he lift sanctions that America had placed on Rhodesia as punishment for the colony 's unilateral declaration of independence from the British Empire in 1965 .
Messrs .
Carter and Young would only countenance a settlement in which Mr. Mugabe , a Marxist who had repeatedly made clear his intention to turn Zimbabwe into a one - party state , played a leading role .
Mr. Young , displaying the willful naiveté that came to characterize Mr. Carter 's mindset , told the London Times that Mr. Mugabe was a " very gentle man " whom he " ca n't imagine ever pulling the trigger on a gun to kill anyone . "
Mr. Mugabe already had pulled the trigger on many innocent people , though .
And not long after taking power in 1980 , he killed about 25,000 people belonging to a minority tribe , the Ndebele .
In spite of this , in 1989 , Mr. Carter launched his " Project Africa " in Zimbabwe , a program aimed at helping African countries maintain food sustainability .
Now , however , the Carter Center maintains no programs in Zimbabwe .
There is probably more of a reason for this than simply due to Mr. Mugabe 's recent ban on foreign aid groups .
Since Mr. Carter was thrown out of office by the American people in 1980 , he has spent his post - presidential years lecturing others on morality .
The same year Mr. Carter lost a democratic election , Mr. Mugabe ascended to power in a violently flawed one .
Yet over the past 27 years Mr. Mugabe has escaped being a target of Mr. Carter 's frequent hectoring .
Rather than criticizing the American and Israeli governments for their stance towards Hamas , perhaps Jimmy Carter ought to focus his efforts on how to rid the world of the murderous despot in Zimbabwe whom he helped create .
Toronto's Catholic board will be testing the faith of its Grade 4 students – or at least their knowledge of it – in a controversial new religious exam .
The unique " religious knowledge test " was piloted in five schools last year and was to be rolled out in all Grade 4 classrooms this May , although half of the board 's 12 trustees have already opted out .
The test asks students to fill in the missing words to the Lord 's Prayer or explain why " Jesus is the light of the world , " among other things .
" Even though there are a variety of things that separate ( public and Catholic ) boards , the tangible thing you see is the teaching of religion , " said trustee John Del Grande .
Testing is a way to ensure the quality of the religious education and show that it is " an important part of the school curricula , " he added .
Teachers , however , argue students already write provincial literacy and numeracy tests in Grades 3 , 6 , 9 and 10 and this just adds to the burden .
" We 're worried that it kind of minimizes what Catholic education is all about , " said Anthony Bellissimo , president of the 4,000 - member Toronto Elementary Catholic Teachers .
" We measure more by living out the faith .
I mean it 's good to know the Ten Commandments , but what if a school does n't get 75 per cent ( of students passing ) but does all kinds of social justice initiatives ?
Are they going to say that school is n't good enough ? "
Del Grande says the test will be used to pinpoint areas of weakness or schools that may need help in delivering programming , and that neither schools nor students will be penalized for low marks .
The test will take place this May in 77 schools across six wards of the Toronto Catholic District School Board at a cost of about $ 12,000 .
No other public Catholic schools in Ontario are believed to offer such a test .
In the U.S. , private Catholic schools in about 12 dioceses take part in ACRE ( Assessment of Catechical and Religious Education ) yearly .
Tests , with multiple choice and open - ended answer questions , are also written in various grades in some Australian schools .
Trustee Sal Piccininni , whose schools will not write the test , said those in the community he spoke to " found it to be quite silly . "
" Our faith is tested every day , with our morals and the way we live our lives , " he said .
" We do n't need to put pen to paper on that . "
A January letter sent to all parent councils from Toronto Catholic elementary teachers notes that " in all of our religious education courses , at all levels , there are ample tools of assessment of religious knowledge ...
A standardized test of religious knowledge is not only limited in scope , it is redundant ... "
But Oscar Correia , a parent council chair who is also a veteran educator in the Catholic system in Ontario , said he personally " believes in the integrity and accountability " such tests provide .
Just go to any church mass where children are involved , he said , and they generally do n't know what 's going on .
While agreeing faith is something people build through experience , he said " you have to give children the basis and the foundation of the concepts . "
Correia has been told some teachers skimp on religious instruction , using the time to work on numeracy and literacy to make sure students do well on the provincial tests , because " that 's where they are going to be accountable . "

The problem with that is , with church attendance declining , religious instruction really has fallen to the classroom , he said .
" The school has become the new church . "
In the pilot test last year , more than three - quarters of Grade 4 students met the expected level of knowledge , as did about 84 per cent of Grade 7 students who took the test .
That indicates " the instruction in religious education that our students receive is very good and that there is a very good to excellent retention of the basic tenets of our faith and liturgical practices , " said a report by board staff .
Del Grande said trustees and staff seemed to be divided on testing , so last year he offered five of his schools as guinea pigs .
Some parents barred their children from taking the test , which is fine , he said .
" In essence , it 's testing program delivery – not an aspect of your faith or whether you go to church or not , " he said .
He said if scores in this round are as high as they were in the pilot , this might be something the board only conducts every five years .
If the results vary , maybe teachers need to look at how they are teaching , or the board to provide different materials .
Del Grande said he'd like to call it something other than a " test " because " it 's not the testing of the children , it 's the testing of the program . "
John Podgorski , co-ordinator of religious education and family life education for 20 years at the Ottawa Catholic School Board , said his board rotates " system exams " through different subject areas , including religious education , in high schools but has n't heard of others testing younger students in this way .
" If I proposed it to my board , I do n't think it would go forward , " he said .
" The educational goals associated with religious education ... are designed to draw forth some of the deeper questions about life , deeper values like your sacred dignity as a person , the value of friendship , family , community , justice in the world – those are the kinds of deeper questions posed through religious life programs . "
Editor :
We asked self - described social media junkie Steve Rubel for his tips on how to participate in online social sites like Twitter and FriendFeed without losing your entire workday .
Here 's what he said .
Social media is the equivalent of digital food .
It 's nourishing , tasty and , for many of us , necessary .
However , consume too much and you can get sidetracked and create larger consequences .
The good news is you can participate in social media in a way that adds value to your life .
You just need to know how to manage it so so that it does not devour your attention — the most valuable commodity of the digital age .
Here are three simple steps I take .
Advertisement
Step 1 . Set a North Star
The first step is to ask yourself a really hard question :
Where does social media fit in my life ?
What need does it truly serve ?
For many it meets a combination of business , personal and / or spiritual needs .
However , for some , it 's just a way to kill time .
So keep it real and be honest .
No answer is wrong .
Advertisement
In my case , social media is integrated into my work .
At Edelman Digital I track technology and social trends and advise our team and blue - chips on how these will impact marketing .
In addition , I share insights that support our agency 's thought leadership efforts by participating in different venues .
Now that I know what I want to get out of the social sphere , I can make sure I devote the right amount of time in a focused way .
Set a North Star that keeps you moving toward a destination and view the social web as an essential part of the journey .
G/O Media may get a commission LG 75 - Inch 8K TV Buy for $ 2150 from BuyDig Use the promo code ASL250
Step 2 . Apply the Pareto Principle
For me , social media follows the Pareto Principle : 80 % of the value comes from 20 % of the content .
Weed out the noise , home in on the signal and have systems that archive information so it 's easy to find later .
Tools will hopefully evolve to make this more seamless in the future .
However , for now you 're on your own .

One way I zero in on high value information is to use FriendFeed .
This might seem contradictory given it can be a fire hose .
Still , if you use its powerful imaginary friend , hiding and search features and follow only a small number of people who use their streams to provide information that move you closer to your North Star , it can be very effective .
I am looking at integrating this with AideRSS .
Another system I have takes full advantage of Google Reader 's search and tagging capabilities .
I subscribe to hundreds of feeds .
Many of these are archived just for search .
Others , like the ones in my " Faves " folder , I make sure I read daily to stay ahead .

Step 3 : Schedule Time to be Social
There 's a time to keep your head down and focused and there 's a time for being social .
Keep these separate and sacred and aligned with your priorities and peak productivity times .
Advertisement
One way I focus my time is to avoid running desktop applications like Twhirl or a desktop RSS reader that constantly pulls down new content .
They 're terrific apps , but they 're not for me .
In addition , I have two calendars set up in Google Calendar : one for budgeting my time and another that I use to log it to ensure I stay on track .
Using these two in tandem , I know how much time each week I can to devote to social media and just when I will do so .
In addition , I can easily see if I fell off the wagon .
There are also a number of services that can automate this for you .
I use Firefox 's powerful Smart Bookmarks feature .

I keep tweaking my system , but these are three life hacks that are working quite well for me right now .

Direct data transfers from .DBF files are supported for Access , DB2 , FileMaker Pro , MySQL , Oracle , PostgreSQL , SQLite , SQL Server and Sybase database servers .
Feature Comparison Summary
To summarize the feature comparison table , FmPro Migrator Platinum Edition is required for performing Access and FileMaker migrations , as well as PHP to LiveCode and BASIC to LiveCode conversions .
The remaining features can utilize FmPro Migrator Developer Edition or FmPro Migrator Platinum Edition .
But in all cases , FileMaker Pro Advanced is always recommended in order to enable the pasting of Table XML code via the Clipboard .
FileMaker Table Consolidation Projects [ FileMaker Merge Database Automation ]
Support Note : The FileMaker 11 - 19 Table Consolidation feature is supported on macOS .
Consolidating a multi- file solution into a single file improves FileMaker developer productivity because user accounts / privilege sets only need to be updated within a single file instead of dozens of files .
Single - file solutions can also be easier to backup / move between computers and even send to users via an email attachment .
FmPro Migrator Developer Edition implements automated batch capture and creation features using AppleScript ( macOS ) and clipboard XML for Tables / Fields , Table Occurrences , Relationships , Value Lists , Custom Functions , Layouts and Script Workspace Scripts using FileMaker Pro Advanced 11 - 19 on macOS .
During the migration process , Table Occurrences and file references are automatically remapped into the new database structure without manual intervention on the part of the developer .
TOs are remapped throughout every object of every Layout , Script and Relationship within the new migrated database file .
The 2 - pass dependency resolution feature makes 2 automated passes through the Layout creation process in order to resolve dependencies between scripts and layouts .
During pass # 1 of the layout creation process the layouts are created in the normal manner .
FileMaker scripts are then pasted into the new database , thus resolving dependencies between scripts and layouts .
Then during the 2nd pass through the layout creation process , the contents of each layout are deleted and pasted again , resolving dependencies between layout objects and scripts .
The Layout text search and replace feature enables developers to quickly re-purpose Layouts between database solutions , by changing specified text strings within dozens of Layouts at once .
This intelligent search mechanism is implemented to insure that text is changed only within Layout text objects , thus preventing the accidental replacement of text within TOs or field names .
FmPro Migrator Developer Edition creates both custom and field based Value Lists using the clipboard XML transfer method .
Custom Value List items and Custom Function code can also be edited within FmPro Migrator Developer Edition after being imported from the FileMaker DDR XML file .
Access , Firebird & SQL Server to FileMaker Pro
The Access To FmPro Migration Service built into FmPro Migrator Developer Edition provides a fixed - price conversion feature for Microsoft Access database files to FileMaker Pro database files .
This feature includes the conversion of Forms / Reports , Queries , Relationships , Value Lists , Layouts and Visual Basic code .
Using FmPro Migrator , Access databases can be migrated to FileMaker 11 + in order to take advantage of FileMaker Pro's legendary ease of use and increased data management capacity .
Migrated Access databases can now grow to the maximum 8TB file size offered by FileMaker 11 + and can be run on macOS and Windows .
FmPro Migrator makes a direct ODBC connection to SQL Server databases to automate the mapping of SQL Server columns to FileMaker Pro fields , perform column name to field name conversions and create the tables in the FileMaker database .
When using FileMaker Advanced , FmPro Migrator can put the table definition XML code onto the clipboard for easy pasting directly into FileMaker Advanced .
On macOS , FmPro Migrator utilizes the Actual ODBC Driver for SQL Server from Actual Technologies to make a direct connection to SQL Server and Access databases ( purchased separately ) .
FmPro Migrator makes a direct ODBC connection to Firebird databases to automate the gathering of table structure , relationships and transferring data to FileMaker Pro. Firebird relationships are converted into FileMaker Pro relationships and rebuilt in an automated manner using AppleScript on macOS .
FileMaker Pro to SQL Databases
FmPro Migrator 4 Step Migration Process
FmPro Migrator documents and migrates FileMaker Pro database structure and data to MySQL , Oracle , Access , SQL Server , Sybase , DB2 , PostgreSQL , and SQLite .
FmPro Migrator interactively reads meta-data from FileMaker Pro databases , gets Field size info for each field , creates the table in the SQL database and transfers data ( including images and repeating fields ) between the databases .
Using the FileMaker Pro/FileMaker Server External SQL Sources feature , data can be stored within a MySQL , Oracle or SQL Server database but still be used within FileMaker Pro as if the data was stored locally .
Thus achieving the reuse of existing FileMaker Pro layouts and business logic .
FmPro Migrator facilitates ESS configurations by performing the initial SQL table creation and data transfer to the SQL database server .
Critical tasks performed by FmPro Migrator include the automated sizing of SQL table columns based upon FileMaker Pro field contents and the transfer of repeating fields data into a new relational table structure .
Repeating Fields Migration
Many FileMaker
Pro databases include non-relational data elements called repeating fields .
These fields store multiple values within each field and are associated with the main database record by FileMaker Pro.
Manually extracting these repeating fields into a relational database structure can be a time consuming and error - prone process .
FmPro Migrator easily extracts FileMaker
Pro repeating fields into a child database table in which the records are related to the parent table by the primary key .
Each iteration of a FileMaker Pro repeating field is inserted as a new record within the repeating fields table as shown in the diagram below .
Migrating repeating fields to a SQL database can be an essential step to setting up a FileMaker ESS ( External SQL Sources ) configuration using MySQL , SQL Server or Oracle .
FmPro Migrator also migrates repeating fields within FileMaker 11 + databases using auto - generated data transformation scripts .
This feature overcomes the lack of repeating fields support within new versions of the FileMaker Pro ODBC driver .
Image Transfer to SQL Databases [ Image Transfer SQL Video - macOS & Windows ]
FmPro Migrator Platinum Edition directly transfers images and attached files via ODBC to facilitate the migration of FileMaker Pro container field binary data into SQL databases .
This container field transfer feature supports inserting of embedded [ not external ] container field data directly into BLOB columns of SQL databases including MySQL , SQL Server , PostgreSQL , Oracle , and SQLite .
Currently shipping FileMaker
Pro versions support the insertion of images including GIF , JPEG , TIFF , PDF , EPS , and PNG when using the Insert Picture ... menu .
Inserting binary files of all types is supported when selecting the FileMaker Insert File ... menu which would commonly be used for storing spreadsheets and other binary files .
Earlier FileMaker versions supported additional file types which are no longer directly supported ( including : EMF + - Windows Enhanced MetaFile Plus , META - Windows Metafile ( enhanced ) , METO - Windows Metafile ( original ) , XMLO - FileMaker layout , JP2 - JPEG 2000 , moov - ( old ) Quicktime format , PICT , qtif - QuickTime Image File , MacPaint , FPix - FlashPix , .SGI , TPIC - TGA - Targa , .SGI generic bitmap , 8BPS Photoshop ) .
These deprecated file types can also be exported to disk by FmPro Migrator , using an alternate image export feature for older FileMaker 7 - 13 versions .
Convert Layouts , Scripts , Relationships , Value Lists to Functional LiveCode Desktop and Mobile Applications
The LiveCode Conversion feature built into FmPro Migrator Platinum Edition provides an automated FileMaker Pro to LiveCode cross-platform desktop / mobile applications conversion feature .
This feature includes the conversion of layouts / forms / reports , scripts , relationships , tab controls and value lists .
Features of the FileMaker database are logically grouped with easily updated libraries [ SQL_Library , Value_List_Library , Relationships_Library ] within the new stack file architecture .
Convert Layouts to Functional PHP Web Applications
The PHP Conversion feature built into FmPro Migrator Platinum Edition provides an automated FileMaker Pro to PHP web applications conversion feature .
This feature includes the conversion of layouts / forms / reports , scripts , relationships , tab controls and value lists .
This feature leverages the automated layout and relationship importing features of FmPro Migrator Platinum Edition .
FileMaker
Pro developers can convert existing or new FileMaker Pro database files directly into functional PHP web applications within a few minutes .
The converted PHP web application uses the contents of existing layouts to build dynamic web forms having insert , query , update and delete features .
Almost all layout objects are converted , including : charts , image fields , tab controls , custom value list menus , field - based value list menus ( single and dual field ) , checkboxes , radio buttons and vector graphic objects ( rectangle , rounded rectangle , oval / circle ) .
Convert FileMaker Pro to SQLite
Convert FileMaker
Pro database files into SQLite , in preparation for performing an automated conversion into LiveCode for building desktop or mobile applications .
SQLite is the portable database of choice for mobile application development , if data needs to be stored on a mobile device .
Automated Batch Transfer ( Mirroring , Data Sync ) [ Platinum Edition Feature ]
The FmPro Migrator Batch Transfer utility is included with FmPro Migrator Platinum Edition licenses .
This new utility enables automated data transfers ( data sync , mirroring of data ) from FileMaker Server Server to SQL databases ( MySQL , SQL Server , PostgreSQL , Oracle , SQLite ) .
What it is :
An Economical Tool - Most data sync products cost thousands of dollars in licensing and consulting setup costs .
FmPro Migrator Platinum Edition combined with the FmPro Migrator Batch Transfer utility offers a more economical alternative .
No Changes Required to FileMaker Database -
As long as an ODBC connection can connect to each base table in your FileMaker database , the data can be quickly transferred into one of the supported SQL databases .
This is a data pull type of operation , and not a triggered push of data from the FileMaker database .
Development Sync Tool - FmPro Migrator Platinum Edition is typically used for the development of SQL database applications based upon source FileMaker database files .
The FmPro Migrator Batch Transfer utility is useful for keeping development servers in sync with the original FileMaker database during development and testing of new applications .
One Way Data Sync for Web Servers -
For low traffic websites it may be necessary to occasionally update product catalog info for instance .
For high traffic websites the batch transfer process could update a local SQL database , and then SQL database mirroring / replication features can transfer the data to the SQL database server running the website .
macOS & Windows Compatible - macOS 10.12 -> 10.15 versions are supported at this time , and Windows 7 -> Windows 10 are supported .
What it is not :
Transaction Based Data Sync / Mirroring -
This utility truncates the destination database tables and then transfers all records to the SQL database each time it runs .
There are other well respected products in the FileMaker marketplace which are designed to transfer records individually on a transactional basis .
Some of these products include :
360 Works MirrorSync
Brilliant Sync™
Image Transfer Tool - FmPro Migrator Platinum Edition includes a separate Image Export to SQL Database feature .
The image transfer tool is only designed to be run interactively .
Repeating Fields Transfer Tool - FmPro Migrator Developer Edition includes a separate Repeating Fields data transfer feature .
Since Repeating Fields are a deprecated feature in the FileMaker database , it is necessary to manually run a script in the FileMaker database to concatenate the repeat values together before reading the data via ODBC .
This process does not lend itself to automation .
Furthermore the design goal for the batch transfer is to avoid making any changes to the FileMaker database beyond adding base table TOs to the relationship graph .
A base table TO is required in order for the OBBC driver to read the data .
Two Way Data Sync -
The data transfer occurs in only one direction - from the FileMaker database server to the SQL database .
Compatible with macOS 10.12 -> macOS 10.15 Catalina versions are supported .
The handcuffs may not be coming off cellphone owners , but they are getting looser .
Early termination fees , the cellphone companies ’ main tool for shackling consumers to their contracts , are becoming a lot less restrictive .
T - Mobile last month became the third of the four major carriers to reduce its penalties for those who bolt to another cellphone company before the end of a contract .
In some cases , the new policy shaves more than $ 100 in penalties .
These new policies look a lot like a gift to anyone who wants to jump to a new carrier .
Before the policy changes at Verizon and T - Mobile , customers who wanted to cancel their contracts faced penalties of $ 175 for Verizon and $ 200 for T - Mobile .
That was just steep enough to make anyone but the most fashion - forward early adopters sit on their hands and wait for their contracts to expire , or wait for some Silicon Valley miracle to drop iPhones or the next hot phone into the lineup of their carrier .
Now , defectors may still get a rap on the knuckles when they leave , but the later they leave , the softer the rap .
T- Mobile ’s new policy is better than the old one , but it will still sting , and the pain you ’ll feel is worse than that experienced by Verizon or AT&T customers .
If you leave T - Mobile within the first 18 months of signing a two - year contract , you pay $ 200 .
After that , the penalty drops to $ 100 , and if you depart with three months or less remaining on your contract , you pay $ 50 .
Cancel during your last month and you pay the lesser of $ 50 or your standard monthly charge .
Smalltalk ではスタックフレームも 「コンテキスト」と呼ばれるオブジェクトです。ちなみに、実行中のコンテキストに容易にアクセスできるようにわざわざ thisContext という擬変数まで用意されています 。Smalltalk には予約語は全部でたった６つしかない（他は self、super、nil、true、false）うちのひとつを使うわけですから、これはある意味、破格の扱いです。
こうした背景もあってか、はたまた私の単純な思い込みでか、Smalltalk のデバッガは「コンテキスト（や、その連なりによって表現されるコールスタック）をブラウズするためのツール」という性格が強いように感じられます。クラス用ブラウザがクラスブラウザ、インスタンス用がインスペクタなら、デバッガはコンテキスト向けに特別に用意された“第三のブラウザ”といったところでしょうか。
▼デバッガの起動 デバッガを起動するにはまずノーティファイアを呼び出します。ちなみに、Smalltalk ではデバッガを使うにあたって、モードの切り替えや特別なビルド操作のようなものは必要ありません（もっとも
Edit - Build - Debug といった開発サイクル自体が Smalltalk にはないわけですが…）。 ノーティファイアは、割り込み操作（alt / cmd +
ピリオド）や例外時、また、任意のオブジェクトへの「halt」メッセージの送信（通常は、ブレイクポイントを設置したい式のレシーバの直後に halt と挿入しておけばよいでしょう。モダンな
Smalltalk 処理系と違い 、Squeak Smalltalk ではブレイクポイントをハンドコードして指定する必要があります）により画面に現われるやや小さめのウインドウで、三つのボタンとコールスタックの一覧からなります。 デバッガは、このノーティファイア上段右端の
Debug ボタン、もしくは、下に列挙されたコンテキストから任意のものをクリックすることで起動できます。
たとえばワークスペースなどで次式を do it（alt / cmd + d）してみてください。ノーティファイアが現われたら UndefinedObject >>
DoIt をクリックします。 ( 1 halt to : 3 + 4 ) do : [ : each | each factorial ] ちなみにノーティファイアにある他のボタンは
、Proceed ボタンが処理の続行で 、Abandon ボタンは処理の中断に使います（後者はノーティファイアをウインドウのクローズボタンをクリックして閉じるのと一緒）。
コンテキストのクリックと同時にノーティファイアが閉じ、入れ替わりにデバッガが起動します。
ノーティファイアやデバッガにおいて（いや。これらに限らずシステム内において…）コンテキストは原則として「レシーバのクラス名（実際にメソッドが属するクラス名）>>実行中のメソッド名」の形式で表記されます。ブロックでは、若干表記が変わります（[ ] in …）が、その扱われ方はほとんど変わりません。
また、ここでの例のように、組み込みのエディタなどで入力・選択した式やスクリプトを
do it や print it でインタラクティブに評価した場合には、評価した式やスクリプトを本体に持つ
# DoIt という名前のメソッドの実行として、通常のメソッド呼び出しと同様に扱われます。 これは、評価のための操作と同時に、その文脈での self のクラス（たいていは self は nil なのでそのクラス の
UndefinedObject）に # DoIt という名前のメソッドとして定義され（そう 。Smalltalk も Ruby 同様オープンクラスで、普段からこの機能を大いに活用しています）、self へのメッセー ジ
「 DoIt 」 の送信で呼び出されたあと、自動的に削除される
…のだと解釈するとよいでしょう（実際にもそれに近いことをしています）。
▼ステップ実行 上のコンテキスト一覧からブラウズしたいコンテキストをクリックして選ぶと（あるいはデバッガ起動時にあらかじめノーティファイア上で選んでおくと）、そのコンテキストで実行中のメソッドのソースコードが中央の枠内に表示されます。 このとき、次に実行されるポイントが選択された状態になっていますが、単純にテキストが選択状態にあるだけなので、ちょっとしたマウスやキーボードの操作で簡単に解除されてしまいます。そんなときは、右端の
Where ボタンで元の選択状態に戻すことが可能です 。
ステップ実行操作のためのボタンとして、中央付近に並んだ
Into 、Over 、Through の三種類があります 。
Over ボタンは単純にワンステップの実行のみを行ないます。
Into ボタンは、次に新たに作られるコンテキストにブラウズ対象を切り替えます。
Through ボタンの動き は
Over ボタンとよく似ていますが、do : [...]
のようなブロック付きメソッドの呼び出しの際に、これを
Over のときのようにワンステップにまとめてしまわずに、引数のブロック内の処理もステップ実行してくれます。
そのメソッドに潜りたいときは Into を使い、その必要がなけれ ば Through で。ただしループをいちいち走査する必要がないとき は
Through の代わり に
Over を…というように使い分けるとよいでしょう。 いずれのボタンも、メソッド中の最後の式まで実行を終えると同時に、ブラウズ対象を、呼び出し元のコンテキストに切り替えます。これまでブラウズしていたコンテキストは通常の実行時と同様、原則として破棄されるので、もうそこには戻れません。
Restart ボタンを押すと、ブラウズ中のコンテキストの実行ポイントをメソッドの最初の式に戻せます。 ただしこのとき、self や関連オブジェクト（self のインスタンス変数に代入されたオブジェクトたち）の状態はリセットされないので注意しないといけません。self の状態も戻さないといけない場合（self が状態を持つオブジェクトの場合たいていはそうですが…）は、次項のデバッガ備え付けのインスペクタで self の状態を編集するか、そのオブジェクトを生成しているもっとも前のコンテキストに戻ってそこからやり直す（そのコンテキストをブラウズした状態で
Restart し、あらため て
Into で目的のコンテキストまで戻ってくる）必要があります。 コールスタックの深いところにあるはずのコンテキストにアクセスしたいのに、なんらかの理由で表示されていないようなときは、Full
Stack ボタンを押すと、それらをリストの下の方に追加できることがあります。
Proceed ボタンは（ノーティファイアのそれと同様に）デバッガを閉じて処理を続行します。

The furniture shop was on the King 's Road in London .
It sold tables , wardrobes , chairs and desks - but anybody peering through its plate - glass window on a Sunday might have noticed something rather more unusual .
Amid all the pine and oak , stretched out languidly on a bench , there was a lion .
And it was n't stuffed .
Scroll down for more ...
" Christian used to lie beside me while I did the accounts at weekends , " remembers Jennifer Mary Taylor , who worked there .
" And every so often , if I 'd ignored him for too long , he 'd sock me across the head with one of his great big paws .
" He was very loving and affectionate - he liked to stand and put his paws on your shoulders .
But he was ... " , she pauses .
" I mean , he was a lion .
Does that sound silly ? "
Christian the lion ( named by someone with a Biblical sense of humour ) arrived in
Chelsea at a time when the King 's Road - home to Mick Jagger - was the very heart of the Swinging Sixties .
For a year , the Big Cat was part of it all , cruising the streets in the back of a Bentley , popping in for lunch at Casserole , a local restaurant , even posing for a Biba fashion advert .
He eventually grew too big to be kept as a pet and was taken to Kenya , where he was rehabilitated into the wild by the ' Lion Man ' , George Adamson .
Now , his story is to be told in a new book , written by the Australian John Rendall who , along with his friend Ace Berg , bought Christian from Harrods in 1969 .
So what possessed them to buy a lion cub in the first place ?
" A friend had been to the ' exotic animals ' department at Harrods and announced , rather grandly , that she wanted a camel , " says Rendall .
" To which the manager very coolly replied : ' One hump or two , madam ? '
" Ace and I thought this was the most sophisticated repartee we 'd ever heard , so we went along to check it out - and there , in a small cage , was a gorgeous little lion cub .
We were shocked .
We looked at each other and said something 's got to be done about that . "
Harrods , it turned out , was also quite keen to be rid of Christian , who had escaped one night , sneaked into the neighbouring carpet department - then in the throes of a sale of goatskin rugs - and wreaked havoc .
The store , which had acquired the cub from Ilfracombe zoo , happily agreed to part with him for 250 guineas .
So began Christian 's year as an urban lion .
Today , it would be unthinkable for a shop to take such a cavalier attitude towards selling exotic animals ( though Harrods did , at least , provide Ace and Rendall with diet sheets ) .
And it is hard to imagine either the animal rights lobby or any local council condoning a shop as a suitable habitat for a lion .
But , back then , no one minded at all .
Christian was given his own living quarters ( and a very large kitty - litter tray , which he used unfailingly ) in the basement of the appropriately named Sophistocat furniture shop .
" He had a beautiful musky smell that was very distinct , " says Rendall .
" But he was clean . "
The vicar of the Moravian Chapel nearby was approached to allow Christian the run of the graveyard , and every day he was taken there to roar around and play football .
Once , when he was brought along to a seaside picnic , he dipped his toes reluctantly in the water and intimated with a shudder that it was disagreeably cold .
But he was eventually persuaded to swim in the English Channel .
" He was a lot of work , " says Rendall .
" It took all four of us - me , my then girlfriend Jennifer Mary , Ace Berg and an actress called Unity Jones - to look after him .
" He also ate a lot , four meals ( two liquid , two solid ) plus supplements every day , which cost about £ 30 a week - a lot of money back then . "
He pauses , then adds , " And he had a very good sense of humour . "
Really ?
" Oh yes .
Sometimes , he'd see people staring at him through the back window of the car , keep very still on purpose - and then , just when they were convinced he was a stuffed toy , he would very slowly turn his head and freak them out . "
Everyone loved Christian and he became a popular local figure .
In 1970 , when Chelsea beat Leeds in the FA Cup Final , Sophistocat received a call from a policeman , ' The football fans are going to be boisterous , so you 'd better get your bloody lion out of the window or they 'll smash it in , ' he warned .
Christian himself was beautifully behaved , and though he never hurt anyone , you underestimated his strength at your peril .
Jennifer Mary remembers taking a friend to see him , " after I 'd had one or two glasses of wine - and when he put his paws on my shoulders , one of them slipped , his claw caught my dress and he pulled the whole front of it off . "
He grew and grew - from 35lb when he first arrived to a rather more serious and imposing 185 lb a year later - and he was beginning to acquire a mane that made him look more fearsome .
He clearly could not stay with his two young owners for ever .
His future was decided by a chance encounter - when the actors Bill Travers and Virginia McKenna walked into the shop to buy a pine desk .
They had recently starred in the film Born Free , which tells the true story of the wildlife conservationist George Adamson and his wife Joy , who raised a lion cub called Elsa in Kenya then rehabilitated it into the wild .
And they immediately suggested that Adamson might be able to help .
Certainly , the conservationist was intrigued by the challenge of introducing a King 's Road lion to the wilds of Africa .
" But , " he warned , '" ou must be prepared for this not to work .
Elsa was born in Africa and she knew its smells .
Taking a British - born lion , whose parents were also raised in captivity , is going to be a very different thing . "
Christian was flown to Kenya in a specially - made crate emblazoned with the words , ' East African Airways .
London - Nairobi .
Christian - male lion , 12 months ' .
John and Ace went with him .
" I think George Adamson got quite a shock when he met us , " says Rendall .
" Straight from the King 's Road , in all our gear - flares from Granny Takes A Trip , and with hair everywhere .
" We looked rather different from everyone else in Nairobi .
But then so did Christian .
He 'd come from winter in England , so had a very thick coat - he was almost as hairy as we were . "
Adamson wanted to drive straight to the Kora Reserve , close to the Tana river , where there was no human habitation .
This , he felt , would be the ideal spot to build a camp .
Because lions live and hunt in prides , and it is hard to impose a new male on an existing one , the plan was to introduce Christian into the wild in tandem with Boy , one of the tame beasts who had starred in Born Free .
Together , they would form the nucleus of a new pride - and the whole project would be funded by a TV programme .
Christian was marshalled into the back of a Land Rover , with straw on the floor and chicken - wire separating him from his friends on the front seat .
It was all rather confusing for a lion accustomed to the butter - soft leather of a Bentley .
And he was hot .
And dusty .
And confused .
Not long into the journey , Rendall ventured , " Mr Adamson , he needs to go to the loo . "
Adamson was impatient .
" We 're miles from anywhere .
If we stop here and he runs away , we will never , ever catch him . "
" Mr Adamson , " promised Rendall , " that is not going to happen . "
The great Lion Man turned his head , sucked on his pipe and pulled over on the dirt road .
Rendall opened the back of the car , and Christian jumped out to take his first real steps on African soil .
To his evident disgust , it was prickly and hot .
He clearly did n't like it one bit .
Rendall picks up the story , " So he went tip - toeing along and went to the loo .
Considerably .
Then he looked around and I said , ' OK , come on , back in , ' pointed back at the car - and in he jumped .
" I got back in the car , too , shut the door and George Adamson turned round and said to me , ' That is quite remarkable .
You may call me George . ' "
Kora , an area that now has National Park status , lies about 220 miles to the north - east of Nairobi .
The scenery is rugged - densely packed with knotty thorn bushes , with just a narrow corridor of greenery that follows the course of the Tana river .
And so Christian arrived at the camp , which Adamson 's brother had built from macuti - palm fronds - chicken - wire and mud .
The conservationist went off again and returned a couple of days later with Boy , the lion from Born Free .
At that time , Boy was very fragile , as his shoulder had been shattered in a nasty encounter with a buffalo .
But he was the first fully - grown lion that Christian had seen since leaving Ilfracombe zoo as a cub .
The first meeting was explosive .
Normal lion protocol dictates that the younger male should be subservient to the dominant male .
But Christian , more schooled in Sloane than feline etiquette , sashayed fearlessly towards Boy .
Fortunately , Christian and Boy , though in adjacent compounds , were separated by a wire fence .
In fury at the perceived slight , Boy flung himself against it - until Christian , suddenly realising his faux pas , slunk away with his belly close to the ground .
This process was repeated over and over again until Adamson felt confident enough to allow the pair to meet without the safety barrier of the fence .
" First , Boy left his compound , " recalls Rendall .
" Then Christian went out to meet him .
" Boy took one look - and he clobbered him .
Christian did n't fight back .
He rolled over on his back .
That went on for day after day , until Boy was obviously satisfied that Christian knew who was boss - and they became totally inseparable . "
Adamson had also acquired a female lion cub , Katania , to add to the pride , and she seemed to act as an intermediary between the two males .
Each day , the three lions would go out for a walk in the bush , Boy first , Katania in the middle , then Christian - with Adamson , carrying a rifle in case he needed to scare anything off , at the rear .
For Christian , there were some tricky moments , such as the time he spied a rhino and tried to stalk it , only for the beast to hurl him through the air in a cloud of dust .
" I saw Boy turn and look at Christian , " says Rendall .
" There was a look on his face , as if to say : ' You absolute fool .
What a howler of a blunder . ' "
Slowly , progress was made .
The biggest threat to Christian and Boy were the wild lions that stalked the reserve , which Boy was fighting to establish as his territory .
Then , one day , there was a tragedy that caused the whole project to be called into question .
A chef called Stanley had left the safety of the compound to look for wild honey .
He had n't realised Boy was nearby , and when he saw him , he tried to flee .
Running away was the worst action he could have taken .
Adamson , hearing Stanley 's screams , came running and shot Boy through the heart - but it was too late .
Stanley had been bitten through the jugular and died an hour later .
The outcry that followed almost brought the lion project to a halt , but Adamson found some support for his work among other conservationists , dug in his heels and carried on .
John Rendall and Ace Berg continued to make sporadic visits to Kenya , but mostly they followed Christian 's adventures from afar .
Finally , in 1974 , George Adamson wrote to say that the pride was self - sufficient .
Christian was defending it .
There was a litter of cubs .
They were feeding themselves and rarely returned to camp .
The King 's Road lion had finally adapted to the wild .
This was a bittersweet moment for all concerned .
Rendall and Ace decided to travel to Kora one last time , in the hope of being able to say goodbye , though Adamson warned them that it would almost certainly be a wasted mission .
" Christian has n't been here for nine months .
We have no reason to think he 's dead - there have been no reports of lions poached or killed .
But he may never come back , " he said .
Rendall recalls , " We said : ' OK .
We appreciate that , but we 'll come anyway and see you . ' "
They flew to Nairobi then took a small plane to the camp in Kora , where Adamson came out to meet them .
" Christian arrived last night , " he said simply .
" He 's here with his lionesses and his cubs .
He 's outside the camp on his favourite rock .
He 's waiting for you . "
Adamson and his wife Joy often talked about the mysterious , apparently telepathic communication skills of lions - particularly between lions and men .
Both believed that lions were possessed of a sixth sense and George was convinced that a scientific explanation would one day be found .
And here , it seemed , was the proof .
" Christian stared at us in a very intense way , " says Rendall .
" I knew his expressions and I could see he was interested .
We called him and he stood up and started to walk towards us very slowly .
" Then , as if he had become convinced it was us , he ran towards us , threw himself on to us , knocked us over , knocked George over and hugged us , like he used to , with his paws on our shoulders .
" Everyone was crying .
We were crying , George was crying , even the lion was nearly crying . "
" The lionesses were far from pleased .
There was a lot of growling and spitting , " continues Rendall .
" ' George said : ' This is n't safe - we 'd better go . '
So we each put a hand on Christian 's back and he walked with us back to camp . "
The reunion party went on all night and into the morning .
Leaving his exhausted companions to go to their beds , Christian returned to his pride .
" We watched him go back to the two lionesses , who were not at all happy with this man , smelling of nicotine , whisky and humans , " says Rendall .
" He just walloped the two of them with his paw , then collapsed . "
And that was the last anyone ever saw of him .
For the next 14 years , George Adamson remained at Kora , rehabilitating several other lions and ignoring warnings from the authorities , who did not consider it safe for him to stay .
Then , in 1989 , he was ambushed and murdered by bandits .
He died with a gun in his hand and , in accordance with his wishes , was buried at Kora .
Following his death , his supporters formed the George Adamson Wildlife Preservation Trust , which now does work in Kora as well as in Tanzania , where it is reintroducing the endangered black rhino and hunting dog .
The trust 's chief aim is keep alive Adamson 's dream of a place where animals can roam free - a fitting epitaph not just for the great conservationist but also for the lion who once lived in Chelsea .

How to stay very , very dumb /
It 's a fact : TV sitcoms destroy your brain .
But what else can you do with all that unused mental power ?
It 's one of the most powerful and disorienting and disturbing feelings I 've ever known and perhaps the very best reason I can think of that I now watch very little mainstream TV , much less sitcoms , much less those howlingly soul - deadening laugh - tracked things featuring Kelsey Grammar or Charlie Sheen or maybe that enormous guy from " Everybody Loves Raymond , " shows that make your soul curdle like fresh soy milk in the sun .
It 's also the sole reason I 've trained myself to instantly mute all TV commercials when they appear and turn my gaze from their grisly carnage lest their death lasers of hyperbranded idiocy penetrate my flesh and make me impotent and encephalitic and Republican .
The feeling is this :
You 're sitting there zoning out in front of some mindless slew of shows and you 're sucked in and not laughing in the slightest and actually only remotely amused , even as , deep down , some benumbed part of you is quietly screaming , oh sweet Jesus with an old " Will & Grace " DVD , why the hell am I watching this swill ?
It 's not even funny or interesting or even all that entertaining ?
And then three or four or nine hours into your TV drone , you begin get that slimy feeling on your skin and your face is all oily and your jaw is slack and your genitalia feel all shriveled and your heart is palpitating strangely , and you finally say , OK that 's enough , and shut the damnable TV off , and wham .
That 's when it happens .
The sledgehammer .
The slap .
The roaring silence .
Suddenly the room caves in and the walls shudder and your brain snaps back to life and you leap back into your wary body .
Ah yes , reality .
Action and movement and thought .
Here we are again .
I hate that feeling .
I hate that sodden realization that TV has just sapped enormous chunks of my soul , removed me entirely from all physical and cognitive and spiritual functioning .
At least if I 'm wasting time on the Net , I like to think I 'm usually doing something -- reading , learning , seeking , sifting , clicking around , taking in information .
Are n't I ?
It 's a notion that comes to mind as I read about NYU New Media prof Clay Shirky 's popular notion of the " cognitive surplus , " a nifty , Malcolm Gladwellish idea he defines as that huge heaping mountain of extra brainpower , all that mental capacity we 've had at our disposal since the Industrial Revolution freed us up from all those pesky tasks of , you know , basic survival -- but which , for the past 50 years or so , we 've chosen to dump right at the feet of the idiot box merely because , well , we just did n't know what else to do with it .
Shirky goes so far as to calculate that Americans watch close to 200 billion hours of TV a year , each and every hour wasted potential .
Nothing new there .
But by contrast , he estimates Wikipedia -- the entire , massive , impressive project of it -- required about 100 million hours of thought .
In other words , thanks to the Net , a tiny sliver of that cognitive surplus was finally put to use online , and look what a useful , powerful thing it created .
Imagine if that caught on .
Imagine if even a fraction of everyone who watched TV now decided to switch to doing something - anything - on the Net that involved some sort of social networking , some glorious Web 2.0 process , something interactive and collaborative and even a tiny bit engaged .
Who knows what incredible projects might evolve ?
Shirky , like many Web 2.0 evangelists , thinks we 're entering a far more interactive , user - generated , participatory age wherein we are finally snapping out of our collective TV stupor and demanding a far more active role in our media .
In other words , no longer is the Net - connected generation content to be passive , drooling consumers of whatever media conglomerates shovel our way .
We now demand some semblance of control .
We demand feedback loops and mouse buttons and comment fields and the ability to customize the experience , and Shirky deems this a powerful and amazing thing , on par with the Industrial Revolution in how it could transform public life and reshape and reinvigorate culture .
I 'm not so sure .
It 's a slick and intriguing idea and I 'm actually with him most of the way , right up until you think about , well , art , and independent thought , and creativity , and just about anything of true imaginative value because sweet Shiva with an iPod and a Chris Ware book , if social networking is the future of creativity , the future is bland indeed .
Here is the fatal flaw in all the Web 2.0 mania currently sweeping dot- comland : Fact is , Wikipedia 's unusual success aside , few things are worse in this human world than creation by committee , by crowd and consumer and the masses .
Few things destroy true vision and the integrity of a unique idea more than bowing to the forces of groupthink .
The examples are legion , eternal , painful :
You want to destroy a unique TV show ?
Run it by lots of focus groups .
Want to maul a good film ?
Hire a team to write the script .
You want to annihilate a great piece of architecture ?
A school ?
A park ?
Let city government choose its design .
Want to destroy a great website experience ?
Strip away all editorial voice and kill all actual content and let users generate the entire sloppy hollow product and call it a " portal . "
Or maybe " MySpace . "
See , I still want immersion .
I want to feel the full expression of the artist , the filmmaker , the writer , the journalist , the individual .
I do n't want to walk into an art gallery and have the ability to change a painting 's colors on a silly whim .
I do n't want to read a book and be able to change a character 's name or even pick a particular cover design to match my couch .
I do n't want to click the remote and choose which characters die or select an alternate ending .
If I want to interact with my DVD , I 'll just buy porn , you know ?
All the whining about major media aside , do we all not still want talent and expertise and professionalism ?
Whatever the hell it is you consume , do n't you want to feel the sweet or sour tang of true human thought behind it , to sense that the person who created it knew what the hell they were doing , had a semblance of skill and talent ?
Of course you do .
So yes , sure , let 's get more people off the couch and onto the Web and let 's get them interacting and creating funky collectives and collaborations and maybe indeed we 'll end up creating a thousand more Wikipedias and even a few Flickrs and YouTubes and notcot.orgs , harness the cognitive surplus of the world and combine our individual knowledge in new and unfathomable ways that will take us to the next stage of entertainment and enlightenment .
Sure , sounds lovely .
Then again , maybe not .
Because with a precious handful of exceptions , the last thing the world needs is more groupthink .
We simply need more visionaries .

AUSTIN , Texas -- Bonnie Richardson ran .
She threw .
She jumped .
And when it was time to hand out the team trophies , Richardson accepted the 1A team championship for Rochelle High School -- by herself .

Richardson was the only Rochelle athlete to qualify for the state meet and stunningly won the team title .
University Interscholastic
League officials said it was the first time they can remember a single athlete winning a girls ' team title .
It 's happened before on the boys ' side , but not since former Baylor Bear and Pittsburgh Steeler Frank Pollard did it for Meridian High School in the 1970s , said UIL Athletics Director Charles Breithaupt .
" This totally blows me away , " the freckle - faced Richardson said while holding the trophy with a gold medal draped on her neck .
" This is amazing .
I had no idea it was even possible . "
Richardson 's title march began with field events on Friday when she won the high jump ( 5 feet , 5 inches ) , placed second in the long jump ( 18 - 7 ) and was third in the discus ( 121-0 ) .
On Saturday , she won the 200 meters in 25.03 seconds and nearly pulled off a huge upset in the 100 before finishing second ( 12.19 ) to defending champion Kendra Coleman of Santa Anna .
Richardson , a junior , earned a total of 42 team points to edge team runner - up Chilton ( 36 ) .
It was a good thing the 1A events were split over two days because Richardson said the heat -- temperatures were in the high 90s both days -- might have knocked her down .
She laughed off a suggestion that she could have won more if UIL rules did n't limit individual participation to five events .
" I do n't think I could handle any more , " she said .
" It was hot and I was tired . "
Many outstanding girls athletes have dominated state meets , but few cross over from the sprints to the field events with Richardson 's success , Breithaupt said .
" The way she did it is really impressive , " Breithaupt said .
" A lady like that could be a heptathlete . "
Rochelle is about 85 miles east of San Angelo , and Richardson 's high school does n't even have a real track .
The football field has a ring of caliche and grass around it .
So how does she train ?
" Watch for potholes , " she joked .
" We have a track about 10 miles down the road and train there usually . "
Richardson 's coach , Jym Dennis , suspected she could do something special in the team category , but did n't tell her on the trip to Austin because he did n't want to make her nervous .
" I was hoping she'd get a few gold medals to put her over the top and she did , " Dennis said .
" She 's an amazing athlete .
I think she could win a lot of events . "
As a sophomore , she competed in the high jump , long jump and discus .
She won the long jump but did n't medal in the others .
On Saturday , she was surprised by her second - place finish in the 100 .
" Kendra and I have been battling all year .
I was amazed I stayed with her .
I did n't think I was that fast , " she said .
Richardson also plays tennis and led her basketball team to the state semifinals last season .
" I 'd play football if my parents would let me , " she said .
" Not quarterback .
Defense . "
PRINCETON , NJ -- Barack Obama continues to hold a lead over John McCain in Gallup Poll Daily tracking -- 48 % to 42 % in June 8 - 10 polling of registered voters nationwide .
This marks the third consecutive day that Obama has held a significant lead , as he enjoys a modest boost in support following Hillary Clinton 's decision to concede the nomination .
Obama 's six and seven percentage point advantages over McCain in recent days have been his best to date .
Obama has held significant leads over McCain at other points since mid-March ( when Gallup first began tracking general election preferences ) , but for the most part the two candidates have been locked in statistical dead heats .

“ … I think it ’s very clear who Hamas wants to be the next president of the United States . ” — Senator John McCain [ Source : Huffington Post ]
“ I ’m going to raise the level of political dialog in America , ” McCain , R - Ariz . , said at a campaign rally in central Michigan , “ and I ’m going to treat my opponents with respect and demand that they treat me with respect . ” — Senator John McCain [ Source : ABC News ]
Most Americans might conclude that a member of the Ku Klux Klan ( KKK ) would vote for John McCain over Barack Obama in the 2008 election given the atrocious , historic practices of the KKK ; however , from casual reading of any one of the many online KKK forums today , most Americans would be surprised to find that the KKK is not necessarily a friend of John McCain .
Nevertheless , McBush3.com has learned from an anonymous source inside the KKK that many of their members do clearly prefer John McCain over Barak Obama for the next president of the United States despite strong , internal opposition to McCain ’s immigration policy .
Does this make Senator John McCain a domestic terroist ally or unworthy of a vote due to an endorsement from the Ku Klux Klan ?
Of course not .
Nor does the endorsement of Obama by Hamas make the honorable United States Senator of Illinois , Barack Obama , a friend , ally or cohort of a foreign terrorist organization .
McGive me a break .
“ I ’m going to raise the level of political dialog in America , ” — Senator John McCain ( McFibber ) McDissapointed in McCain .

Can I cite Andre the Giant in The Princess Bride ?
On a cloudy May morning , the 1,700 students of Bryan Adams High School enter the building in different states of haste , some racing to class to beat the 8:35 bell , some loitering with friends unaware of time or space , some openly defiant and bent on being tardy .
A metal detector slows down traffic and Fanny Aragon , as she stands in a line of students and grows anxious about being late .
Aragon , 16 , hands over her bags for inspection .
Inside her black purse sits the key to her punctuality , a Global Positioning System , which tracks her whereabouts 24/7 in a court - ordered attempt to keep her in school .
Aragon has a history of ditching class , missing the majority of her first semester in the ninth grade because of a miscarriage .
She spent some time in the hospital and then simply could n't muster the strength to come back to school .
" I felt depressed and did n't want to socialize , " Aragon says .
" I just wanted to be by myself . "
The GPS device she carries is lightweight , looks like a walkie - talkie and is part of an innovative program to prevent students from dropping out .
Aragon is one of the thousands of Dallas adolescents whose chronic truancy — missing more than 50 school days a year — swells the dockets of Dallas County 's four truancy courts .
The program , administered by the Dallas County Truancy Court - North , is called Attendance Improvement Management and is one of only a few programs nationwide using GPS to force kids to attend school .
AIM 's monitoring system employs a cell phone and provides for constant surveillance via satellite , tracking Aragon 's position within 5 to 10 feet of her location .
The signal is picked up every 10 minutes and sent to a computer , but since most kids live close to school , each one is required to press a locator button three times in case the signal is lost inside the building .
Aragon does this three times a day : when she arrives at school in the morning , at lunchtime and after coming home for her obligatory 9 p.m. curfew when she receives an automated digital phone call that requires her to call back within three minutes .
Upon returning the call , she must read a series of numbers , and the system recognizes her voice , which confirms her identity .
If Aragon does not respond to calls or is n't where she 's supposed to be , a Dallas County constable picks her up and brings her to court .
Those who work with dropouts say truancy is just the symptom of much deeper problems .
Some kids cut class because they are drinking and drugging , others are too tired to come to school because they work late to help their families pay bills or baby - sit their younger siblings so their parents can work late .
Some are runaways or throwaways , having no one at home who gives a damn about them , much less their education .
And some are just plain lazy .
The magnitude of the problem is staggering as well .
Thirty - seven percent of all high school freshmen in the Dallas Independent School District — more than 5,000 students — are expected to drop out this year .
In April , a study by the Editorial Projects in Education Research Center ranked Dallas the seventh worst among the 50 largest cities , with a 44.4 percent graduation rate in 2004 .
And the societal cost of dropping out goes far beyond the dumbing down of the populace .
Studies reveal that chronic truants who drop out may be doomed to a lifetime of poverty and poor - paying jobs .
The dropout rate is a predictor for future involvement in gang activity , drug use and daytime burglaries .
That is why applying a high - tech , one - size - fits - all Band - Aid to solve such a complex social problem seems at best insubstantial .
But Dallas County , to its credit , has taken a comprehensive approach to truancy , using the soft touch of social services to address the root causes of truant behavior , and the hard press of truancy courts to enforce the law against parent and child alike .
Principals committed to this approach such as Bryan Adams ' Cindy Goodsell have dramatically altered attitudes in their schools by reducing truancy and making their schools a safer place to learn .
But the driving political force behind reducing truancy in Dallas County has been County Commissioner Mike Cantrell who , along with Principal Goodsell , has become a champion of the AIM program .
Although the program 's local founders , Dr. Paul Pottinger and Shelton Stogner , cite Pottinger 's recent study chronicling the success of their program , they were surprised to learn that the program affects more than truancy rates .
" What we learned is a little bit of attention , respect and focus on these kids goes a long way , " Pottinger says .
Before Aragon became one of nine Bryan Adams students to take part in this spring 's pilot program , she stayed out late on weeknights and spent most weekends at a friend 's house .
She says depression was the cause of her truancy and spending time with friends at night became her only escape .
But the AIM curfew forced her to be at home and spend more time with her mother and sister , improving her relationships with them and giving her more time to study .
Aragon now says that after graduating from Bryan Adams , she hopes to attend college and then law school .
Despite mounting evidence of its success , the program has raised concerns among some civil libertarians who question whether the constant surveillance invades the privacy of students .
State Senator Royce West , a powerful member of the Senate Education Committee , has also voiced his opposition to the program , maintaining that it treats kids like criminals .
Although DISD has appointed a liaison to the program , it has failed to back AIM with funding .
The county commissioners court set aside $ 500,000 last year in its budget to expand the program with the expectation that DISD would match the funds .
However , the district has n't budgeted any money and has no plans to do so , even though it receives funding from the Texas Education Agency based on average daily attendance .
DISD loses about $ 35 for each day a student is not in school , which adds up to millions in lost funding each year .
Jon Dahlander , spokesman for DISD , says the district did not have available funds to match the contribution from the county and notes that DISD is facing a tight budget year and a slight dip in enrollment , which makes funding the program " difficult if not impossible . "
He says the district would prefer to see the program work over the course of a full school year , but what they 've seen over a six - week period is " very promising . "
" We 're constantly on the lookout for grants , and when and if we find something that this might match , we 'd certainly consider it , " he says .
At least one supporter of the program believes that DISD may be undermining the program because of its intractable focus on Texas Assessment of Knowledge and Skills testing .
Bruce Leadbetter , an equity investor , claims the district encourages truants to drop out before taking the TAKS exams in order to keep their scores out of the overall school 's performance .
" It is not in the schools ' best interest to keep these kids , " he says .
" Their interest is putting them on the street to make it the county 's or city 's problem . "
Dahlander claims that DISD has no indication that this is happening , and if so , the district would not advocate it .
" We can't see any teacher who 's in the education business — who 's there for students , who wants to help students — actually encouraging students to drop out , " he says .
Commissioner Cantrell has a long history of dealing with the school district 's intransigence .
" DISD has never taken the approach to truancy that it really needs to with the volume of kids that are dropping out of its schools , " he says .
" In my opinion , it 's just not a high priority for them . "

Cantrell is no stranger to Dallas County 's truancy problems .
He spent two - and - a - half years overseeing the juvenile docket in Garland as a municipal court judge before hearing hundreds of truancy cases in eight years as a justice of the peace for the Garland area .
During his successful campaign for commissioner in 1994 , truancy reform was part of his platform .
" Basically , there was really nothing we could do about truancy other than bluff kids to try to get them back to school , " he says .
Shortly after taking office , Cantrell joined other state and local officials in an effort to change how the courts view truancy in Dallas County .
He successfully lobbied the Legislature for a change in state law that empowered courts to initiate contempt proceedings against students failing to obey court orders to return to school .
The new law took effect in 1996 .
With the law on the books , the Dallas Challenge Truancy Enforcement Center was opened to receive contempt referrals from JPs .
The TEC , referred to as a diversionary program , handles 1,500 - 2,000 cases yearly and works with truants for 90 days to help them avoid spending time in juvenile detention .
TEC case managers interview each truant and assess whether they have problems with drugs , abuse or mental heath .
If so , they can be immediately referred to any of approximately 40 cooperating county agencies .
But with their dockets filled with cases ranging from traffic tickets to evictions , the JPs were simply unable to deal with their overwhelming truancy docket , as the average case was taking 77 days from filing to court date .
So in 1999 , Cantrell began working on plans to create specialized truancy courts in Dallas County , two of which would exclusively serve DISD .
But redistricting and repeated delays from the Dallas City Council and DISD postponed the courts ' opening until 2002 .
A third truancy court overseeing DISD opened in 2003 , and a fourth hearing cases from Garland , Mesquite and Richardson ISDs began operations in 2007 .
These courts created a more efficient truancy system , allowing cases to be heard much more quickly , and reduced the annual number of DISD filings from 20,000 to approximately 15,000 .
Judge Rey Chavez of the north truancy court says the courts have also created more consistency in the process , and his cases are normally heard within 10 to 20 days from filing .
" That makes a big difference because if you wait 75 days before you get them into court , then that kid has already lost one or two semesters , possibly failing an entire year , " Chavez says .
" If I can get them in two to three weeks from the case filing , then I can at least save the year and hopefully the semester . "
Yet truancy remains a significant problem in Dallas , resulting in thousands of youths hitting the streets without a high school diploma and few trade skills to get a decent job .
Cantrell says dropouts cost schools millions of dollars in funding from the Texas Education Agency , along with affecting economic development in Dallas County because " attracting new businesses is difficult without a well - trained , well - educated workforce . "
He stresses that most dropouts are smart enough to finish their education , but they start skipping school because of drug or alcohol addiction , mental problems , abuse , financial issues or emotional problems at home or school .
" If we can get that kid turned around and back in school , it not only saves society a lot of money in the long run , but it also benefits that child and future families , " he says .
Cantrell has been a strong proponent of the AIM program , which he sees as yet another tool to curb truancy .
Pottinger and Stogner founded AIM in 2006 after Pottinger spent the early part of the year selling GPS monitoring to border sheriffs through his company , Criminal Justice Solutions .
Pottinger , a retired psychologist , had chaired Dallas Challenge , a nonprofit that works with adolescent substance abuse , domestic violence and truancy .
Dallas Challenge also runs the Truancy Enforcement Center , which Stogner directed after working in the juvenile justice system from 1983 to 1996 .
Stogner met Pottinger during the 10 years he spent with TEC .
Stogner , also retired , says his involvement with AIM is " more of a hobby than a profession . "
Both men wanted to find a way to deter kids from cutting classes , so they decided to replicate what the juvenile justice system in Dallas had been doing since the early 1990s — tracking young offenders using an ankle bracelet and a belt device .
This rectangular device , which is larger than the walkie - talkie unit , contains the GPS technology .
The ankle bracelet looks like a wrist watch and contains a radio frequency transmitter that sends a signal to the belt unit .
If the bracelet is separated from the GPS device by more than 100 feet , authorities are notified .
Pottinger and Stogner successfully pitched their plan to Cantrell as well as Judge Chavez , who agreed to order monitoring for the more flagrant truants who came before him .
" I supported this program because there is a need to find a way to handle the persistent truant — that percentage of students who , without some other type of intervention , are not going to go to school , " Chavez says .
Truants are kept under court order for 180 days , and Chavez reviews their cases approximately every six weeks .
If kids are unable to improve their attendance substantially , they are handcuffed by a constable and taken to the TEC .
The boys are transported in pink handcuffs , just in case they think wearing cuffs makes them look tough .
The final piece to the program 's implementation was finding a school to test it out .
And there seemed no better choice than Thomas Jefferson High School in northwest Dallas , which was struggling with truancy and one of its biggest causes : drugs .
In the fall of 2006 , Chavez enlisted 19 of the high school 's worst truants into the program , and Pottinger and Stogner were surprised by the results .
Many kids turned their lives around , and their success extended beyond just returning to school .
One student , " a big time cheese head , " says Stogner , was missing from school during a routine GPS check .
After determining that he was not in school , a constable was sent to find him .
When the GPS unit located him , he was found on the verge of overdosing .
He was taken directly to Parkland Hospital , and then placed in the Letot Detention Center , a short - term youth facility providing care for runaways , juvenile offenders and drug addicts .
" I think the monitor saved his damned life , " Stogner says .
The trial run at Thomas Jefferson was considered a step forward , but Pottinger and Stogner wanted to expand the program and track the results .
But they found that the administration at the school was n't supportive of the program .
" We could n't get any traction , " Pottinger says .
" Nobody cared .
Nobody would support us . "
Pottinger maintains that this program cannot be effective without strong support from the school and its staff .
" All of us felt a strong lack of interest and cooperation by the principal and administrative staff at TJ , so we moved on to a different venue , " he says .
In the spring of 2007 , the men moved the program to Bryan Adams in East Dallas , which had the demographics they wanted — 62 percent Hispanic , 28 percent black and 10 percent white and others — because it approximated the demographics of DISD .
At Bryan Adams , the men found a new partner in Principal Goodsell , who envisioned that AIM might provide a cost - effective solution to truancy .
" I embraced the program because of the truancy problems we had on our campus , and the courts were n't even keeping up with them because they were so backlogged , " Goodsell says .
" I knew that any help I could get would be better than what I had . "

The gang symbols and graffiti are gone from the walls of Bryan Adams , for which Principal Goodsell is both grateful and responsible .
Instead , fresh white paint spruces up the hallways and a mural of the school 's mascot , the Cougar , replaces the once bullet - riddled glass above the school 's front door .
But Goodsell is n't just about cosmetics .
She is a meat - and - potatoes principal when it comes to tardiness and truancy .
And once the bell rings between classes , she insists that the tsunami of students flooding the halls not linger more than necessary .
" Get your butts to class , " Goodsell tells a cluster of kids having a discussion as if they had no place to be .
" C'mon , get a move on , " she tells another student .
After the second bell rings , she spots a straggler .
" Roberto , come here , " she says .
The student gets a stern look from Goodsell , who asks what he 's doing .
" Nothing , " he says , looking down at the floor , seemingly unaware that he 'll be late to his class .
Goodsell sends him to the vice principal 's office for discipline .
It was n't always like this at Bryan Adams , not until DISD Superintendent Michael Hinojosa plucked Goodsell from Irving 's Lamar Middle School in 2006 to turn around what Goodsell calls " a broken school . "
When she began her tenure , the police seemed to have a permanent presence at Bryan Adams , and Goodsell did n't wear jewelry or fancy clothes and refused to drive her Lexus to work out of fear it would be stripped for parts before she left .
The students ' lack of respect for teachers resulted in verbal and physical attacks .
No learning was taking place , says Goodsell , and there were no systems in place to make safety the priority .
On her first day at Bryan Adams , Goodsell fired the registrar , who was in charge of verifying the addresses of students to ensure they lived within the school 's boundaries .
Accurate verification reduced the rolls by nearly 900 kids , many of them problem students who had been kicked out of other schools .
She fired 20 teachers who said they were unhappy in their work , dismissed three assistant principals and set up tardy tanks in the auditorium and cafeteria where students had to earn their way back into class .
Within two years , she reduced the number of tardies from 400 per class period to six .
" I do n't want to take the credit for it , " she says modestly .
" But I was elated about it because I thought we were beginning to make success possible for many more kids than we had before . "
Goodsell has taken a personal interest in many of the students involved in AIM , including their parents — several of whom expressed their excitement about the new hope their kids had , she says .
One of her favorites is Ricardo Pacheco , a former gang leader .
In January 2007 , Goodsell asked for a meeting with the leaders of the Bloods and the Crips —rival gangs at the school — to broker a truce between them .
Pacheco was leader of the Crips — known as the East Side Homies — and a third - generation gang banger .
Pacheco helped convince Goodsell to introduce a dress code at Bryan Adams , which bans the use of gang colors ( red and blue ) .
After the meeting , she took Pacheco under her wing .
She gave his family money to pay bills while his father was in jail .
" I love that kid , " she says .
But Pacheco was skipping school regularly and was on pace to lose credit for his classes .
He became one of 46 chronic truants at Bryan Adams under court order to wear an ankle bracelet and GPS device , a unit that soon became known simply as " the box . "
Pacheco , now 18 years old and about to graduate , did n't miss a day of school while in the AIM program .
He says he stopped smoking pot and snorting cocaine and is no longer affiliated with gangs .
It became easier to leave the gang once he was in the monitoring program because gang members felt as though they were being watched too .
He credits the program for keeping him in school and Goodsell for keeping him on the right path .
" I have changed a lot , " he says .
Other truants report similar changes .
Josh Cervantes , a 16 - year - old freshman , started missing school when his friends convinced him to spend the day smoking marijuana instead .
" We did n't have anything else to do , " he says .
" Mainly , all we did is smoke . "
Cervantes stopped smoking and started attending school , thanks to GPS monitoring and court - ordered drug testing .
He says he was missing two to three days of school every week , and he 's missed just one class since the program began .
Some of his friends also snort cheese , which is a mixture of heroin and Tylenol PM that has claimed several lives in the Dallas area , but Cervantes had enough sense not to indulge .
" The only way to distance myself from them was to stop smoking , " he says .
Cervantes says the monitoring helped improve his grades and family relationships along with keeping him in school .
Instead of coming home on weekdays around 10 or 11 p.m. , he is spending more time with his parents in the afternoon when he gets home from school .
" Now , whenever they eat , I get to eat too , " he says .
Jaime Pacheco ( not related to Ricardo ) , another 16 - year - old freshman , cites laziness as the cause for missing approximately two out of every three weeks of school .
He would regularly stay up until 2 a.m. watching TV , which caused him to sleep until noon and beyond on school days .
Jaime says he did n't like school or see the point of going .
" I always thought it was n't worth my time . "
His parents , who live in Irving and Plano , left him with his grandfather when he was just 18 months old .
He sees his mother on Thursdays and his father on weekends , and claims their absence from his everyday life does n't bother him .
His grandfather , Carlos Mendez , says otherwise , laying the blame for Jaime 's truancy on his strained relationship with his parents .
" He 's like ours , you know , but I think he wants his parents more involved than they 've been , " Mendez says .
" They 're not there for him , and I think that really discourages him more than anything else . "
Jaime shut down when he first started missing school , says Mendez , but when he started the monitoring program , it opened up his eyes and he started asking questions .
Mendez credits the GPS device with giving his grandson a second chance , and Jaime says the curfew has brought him closer to his grandparents .
He 's even helping out with chores , something he refused to do in the past .
" Just knowing that people are watching me , helping me out with schoolwork and keeping me aligned in school has helped me a lot , " Jaime says .

When the first pilot program at Bryan Adams was completed in the spring of 2007 , Pottinger prepared a 67 - page report which analyzed the results of the program .
The study examined 92 truants who accrued a staggering 5,095 unexcused absences in the first 10 weeks of the spring semester — an average of 55 absences per student .
These chronic truants were split into a monitored group and a control group .
The 46 monitored students went from an average attendance of 85 percent , which is below the 90 percent requirement to get class credit , to 97 percent during the six - week pilot .
The top half ( 23 ) of them had almost perfect attendance at 99.75 percent .
Meanwhile , the control group continued to miss class , ranging from 83 percent to 85 percent over the same time period .
The program 's success was enough to convince Cantrell and the Dallas County Commissioners Court to budget $ 500,000 to expand AIM , with the provision that DISD would match the funds .
But the program was n't well - received by some local politicians , most notably Senator Royce West .
Commissioner Cantrell would not repeat West 's specific concerns , but he confirmed that West " has a serious problem " with using electronic monitoring .
" He did n't want to do it , and the school district did n't want to do it , " Cantrell says .
" So that 's why we 're not doing it . "
West says he is opposed to the use of ankle bracelets because they " send the wrong signal " to students and are intrusive .
" Are they truants ?
Yes .
Are they criminals ?
No , " he says .
" Do we need to deal with truancy ?
Yes , we do . "
Based on a May 12 New York Times article about the AIM program citing " a state senator " who compared the ankle bracelets to " slave chains " and sources telling the Observer that West 's concerns were related to a connection with slavery , he was asked if his opposition was in fact racially rooted .
" Everybody can opine on what they think , " he says .
" But the reality is that I do n't want kids getting used to having to wear ankle bracelets .
They put them on and become accustomed to it , and then they can't do without them .
I just think it sends the wrong signal . "
Dotty Griffith , public education director for the American Civil Liberties Union of Texas , raises similar concerns about " criminalizing students because it 's so similar to electronic monitoring for students under house arrest . "
She also has some reservations about the extent to which AIM violates the privacy rights of students , particularly because it uses a device to track kids after school hours .
" Obviously , we'd be concerned that the systems were set up so that you were n't able to hack and track — where somebody could hack into the system and somehow track a child . "
Although West 's concerns delayed funding for an expanded program , Pottinger credits West with challenging him to redesign the program .
The Bryan Adams ' pilot this spring , though smaller in number , used a walkie - talkie unit with a cell phone inside , instead of the ankle bracelet employed in the first two trials .
West says he has n't seen the new unit , but he will be evaluating it to see if it addresses his concerns .
And he says if the unit is similar to a traditional cell phone , " then that 's OK with me . "
Tom Urrutia , a former DISD teacher who tracks the students for AIM using the Internet , was skeptical that the program would n't have the same success without the ankle bracelets because " the kids were pretty much tethered before . "
But the nine students in this spring 's program achieved near perfect attendance while being monitored , with just four unexcused class absences among them .
The program is financially feasible , adds Urrutia , and while it's not a perfect system , " it certainly works well . "
If he could add something to the program , he'd want to provide more intensive communications , including helping the parents get health insurance and jobs .
Pottinger has plans to expand AIM to between 600 and 800 truants over the course of a full school year , which he estimates will cost approximately $ 638,000 .
Despite a March meeting with DISD officials Jose Torres and Karen Ramos at which Pottinger says they " enthusiastically " invited AIM to be part of a federal grant request , the district says the program was not included in any grants and there are no immediate plans to match the county 's $ 500,000 pledge .
DISD spokesman Jon Dahlander confirms that the grant was discussed with Pottinger , but says there was less funding available in the grant than anticipated , so the money was used to support existing programs .
Ramos , who was the principal at Bryan Adams before Goodsell and is the director of alternative programs for DISD , refused to comment to the Observer .
But Pottinger is n't giving up , and neither is Cantrell .
Cantrell sent a briefing on the program to several people including DISD officials and Dallas Police Chief David Kunkle to gain support for AIM .
Until then , funding for any further pilots will likely come from Bruce Leadbetter , who says he 's spent more than $ 300,000 on the first three trials .
Pottinger says he may change his business model to training and certifying schools after hearing from schools in Waco , Arizona and California that became interested in the program as a result of the recent publicity garnered from a June 10 story on CBS Evening News with Katie Couric .
And Principal Goodsell is lobbying DISD to find funding to retain the program at Bryan Adams .
On May 23 , Fanny Aragon , Josh Cervantes and Jaime Pacheco came to school ready to hand in their monitors along with the other six students in the program .
Pottinger and Urrutia greeted them with cookies and doughnuts , and the students happily handed over their devices .
Pacheco says " it feels good " to get rid of the monitor , but it helped him take the time to realize that he needs to graduate to get a good job .
Cervantes says he would n't be where he is without the support of everyone involved in the program .
" They 're trying to help me , " he says .
" The only way I can help them back is to keep doing what I 'm supposed to be doing so I can make it in life . "
As for Aragon , she says " it feels weird " because she is so used to being monitored now .
She leans back , takes a deep breath and reveals that she 's " worried a little bit . "
Aragon will be spending the summer with family members in Mexico , trying to heal emotional wounds from her miscarriage and the strained relationship with her father , who disappeared in January after her grandmother died .
She holds onto the image of watching other students leave the truancy court in handcuffs , remembering how scared she was that day .
" Hopefully , I wo n't go back to what I was . "
The elusive Iranian weapons
Tina Susman in Baghdad
02:47 PM PT , May 8 2008
Copyright 2008 Los Angeles Times
There was something interesting missing from Maj.
Gen. Kevin Bergner ’s introductory remarks to journalists at his regular news briefing in Baghdad on Wednesday : the word “ Iran , ” or any form of it .
It was especially striking as Bergner , the U.S. military spokesman here , announced the extraordinary list of weapons and munitions that have been uncovered in recent weeks since fighting erupted between Iraqi and U.S. security forces and Shiite militiamen .
Among other things , Bergner cited 20,000 “ items of ammunition , explosives and weapons ” reported by Iraqi forces in the central city of Karbala ; an additional Karbala cache containing 570 explosive devices , nine mortars , four anti-aircraft missiles , and 45 RPGs ; and in the southern city of Basra alone , 39 mortar tubes , 1,800 mortars and artillery rounds , 600 rockets , and 387 roadside bombs .
Read his remarks here .
Not once did Bergner point the finger at Iran for any of these weapons and munitions , which is a striking change from just a couple of weeks ago when U.S. military officials here and at the Pentagon were saying that caches found in Basra in particular had revealed Iranian - made arms manufactured as recently as this year .
They say the majority of rockets being fired at U.S. bases , including Baghdad ’s Green Zone , are launched by militiamen receiving training , arms and other aid from Iran .
Today brought fresh attacks , including an unusual barrage fired at a military base used by British and U.S. forces in Basra , in southern Iraq .
A statement said “ several ” rockets hit the base during the afternoon , and that initial reports indicated two civilian contractors were killed , and four soldiers and four civilians injured .
It was the first reported attack of its kind since March 27 in Basra .
Iraqi officials also have accused Iran of meddling in violence and had echoed the U.S. accusations of new Iranian - made arms being found in Basra .
But neither the United States nor Iraq has displayed any of the alleged arms to the public or press , and lately it is looking less likely they will .
U.S. military officials said it was up to the Iraqis to show the items ; Iraqi officials lately have backed off the accusations against Iran .
A plan to show some alleged Iranian - supplied explosives to journalists last week in Karbala and then destroy them was canceled after the United States realized none of them was from Iran .
A U.S. military spokesman attributed the confusion to a misunderstanding that emerged after an Iraqi Army general in Karbala erroneously reported the items were of Iranian origin .
When U.S. explosives experts went to investigate , they discovered they were not Iranian after all .
Iran , meanwhile , continues to seethe after an Iraqi delegation went to Tehran last week to confront it with the accusations .
It has denied the accusations , and it says as long as U.S. forces continue to take part in military action in Iraq ’s Shiite strongholds , it wo n’t consider holding further talks with Washington on how to stabilize Iraq .

Since the late 1970 ’s , the winter storm track located above the western US has slowly been sliding north .
The combination of global warming and the ozone hole have forced this change , making for fewer winter storms in the American Southwest .
And according to new research from the University of Arizona in Tucson , the hotter and drier springs being inflicted upon Southern California , Arizona , Nevada , Utah , western Colorado and western New Mexico , are a direct result of the poleward shifting storm track .
“ We used to have this season from October to April where we had a chance for a storm , ” said Stephanie A. McAfee , a doctoral candidate in the UA ’s department of geosciences .
“ Now it ’s from October to March . ”
“ When you pull the storm track north , it takes the storms with it , ” said McAfee .
“ During the period it ’s raining less , it also tends to be warmer than it used to be .
We ’re starting to see the impacts of climate change in the late winter and early spring , particularly in the Southwest .
It ’s a season - specific kind of drought . ”
Some of the consequences that are brought about by seeing warmer conditions earlier in the year include affects that take place on the snowpack , said McAfee .
With less snow and rain falling due to a shorter winter , there is less snowmelt and runoff into lakes and rivers .
The future does not bode well either , when looking at computer models , which suggest that the storm track will continue to slide northward , further decreasing rainfall in the southwest of continental America .
“ We ’re used to thinking about climate change as happening sometime in the future to someone else , ” said McAfee ’s co-author Joellen L. Russell , “ but this is right here and affects us now .
The future is here . ”

Mars ' South Pole Ice Deep and Wide

This map shows the thickness of the south polar layered deposits of Mars , an ice - rich geologic unit that was probed by the Mars Advanced Radar for Subsurface and Ionospheric Sounding ( MARSIS ) .

Pasadena , Calif . --
New measurements of Mars ' south polar region indicate extensive frozen water .
The polar region contains enough frozen water to cover the whole planet in a liquid layer approximately 11 meters ( 36 feet ) deep .
A joint NASA - Italian Space Agency instrument on the European Space Agency 's Mars Express spacecraft provided these data .
This new estimate comes from mapping the thickness of the ice .
The Mars Express orbiter 's radar instrument has made more than 300 virtual slices through layered deposits covering the pole to map the ice .
The radar sees through icy layers to the lower boundary , which is as deep as 3.7 kilometers ( 2.3 miles ) below the surface .
" The south polar layered deposits of Mars cover an area bigger than Texas .
The amount of water they contain has been estimated before , but never with the level of confidence this radar makes possible , " said Jeffrey Plaut of NASA 's Jet Propulsion Laboratory , Pasadena Calif .
Plaut is co-principal investigator for the radar and lead author of a new report on these findings published in the March 15 online edition of the journal Science .
The instrument , named the Mars Advanced Radar for Subsurface and Ionospheric Sounding ( MARSIS ) , also is mapping the thickness of similar layered deposits at the north pole of Mars .
" Our radar is doing its job extremely well , " said Giovanni Picardi , a professor at the University of Rome " La Sapienza , " and principal investigator for the instrument .
" MARSIS is showing itself to be a very powerful tool to probe underneath the Martian surface , and it 's showing how our team 's goals , such as probing the polar layered deposits , are being successfully achieved , " Picardi said .
" Not only is MARSIS providing us with the first - ever views of Mars subsurface at those depths , but the details we are seeing are truly amazing .
We expect even greater results when we have concluded an ongoing , sophisticated fine - tuning of our data processing methods .
These should enable us to understand even better the surface and subsurface composition .
" Polar layered deposits hold most of the known water on modern Mars , though other areas of the planet appear to have been very wet at times in the past .
Understanding the history and fate of water on Mars is a key to studying whether Mars has ever supported life , since all known life depends on liquid water .
The polar layered deposits extend beyond and beneath a polar cap of bright - white frozen carbon dioxide and water at Mars ' south pole .
Dust darkens many of the layers .
However , the strength of the echo that the radar receives from the rocky surface underneath the layered deposits suggests the composition of the layered deposits is at least 90 percent frozen water .
One area with an especially bright reflection from the base of the deposits puzzles researchers .
It resembles what a thin layer of liquid water might look like to the radar instrument , but the conditions are so cold that the presence of melted water is deemed highly unlikely .
Detecting the shape of the ground surface beneath the ice deposits provides information about even deeper structures of Mars .
" We did n't really know where the bottom of the deposit was , " Plaut said .
" Now we can see that the crust has not been depressed by the weight of the ice as it would be on the Earth .
The crust and upper mantle of Mars are stiffer than the Earth 's , probably because the interior of Mars is so much colder .
" The MARSIS instrument on the European Space Agency 's Mars Express orbiter was developed jointly by the Italian Space Agency and NASA , under the scientific supervision of the University of Rome " La Sapienza , " in partnership with JPL and the University of Iowa , Iowa City .

Jeff Atwood recently published two anti-XML rants in his blog entitled XML : The Angle Bracket Tax and Revisiting the XML Angle Bracket Tax .
The source of his beef with XML and his recommendations to developers are excerpted below
Everywhere I look , programmers and programming tools seem to have standardized on XML .
Configuration files , build scripts , local data storage , code comments , project files , you name it -- if it 's stored in a text file and needs to be retrieved and parsed , it 's probably XML .
I realize that we have to use something to represent reasonably human readable data stored in a text file , but XML sometimes feels an awful lot like using an enormous sledgehammer to drive common household nails .
I 'm deeply ambivalent about XML .
I 'm reminded of this Winston Churchill quote :
It has been said that democracy is the worst form of government except all the others that have been tried .
XML is like democracy .
Sometimes it even works .
On the other hand , it also means we end up with stuff like this : < SOAP -ENV : Envelope xmlns : SOAP-ENV= " http://schemas.xmlsoap.org/soap/envelope/ "
SOAP-ENV:encodingStyle= " http://schemas.xmlsoap.org/soap/encoding/ " >
< SOAP-ENV :Body > <m:GetLastTradePrice xmlns:m= " Some - URI " > < symbol >
DIS </ symbol > </m:GetLastTradePrice >
</ SOAP-ENV:Body > </ SOAP-ENV : Envelope > …
You could do worse than XML .
It 's a reasonable choice , and if you 're going to use XML , then at least learn to use it correctly .
But consider : Should XML be the default choice ?
Is XML the simplest possible thing that can work for your intended use ?
Do you know what the XML alternatives are ?
Would n't it be nice to have easily readable , understandable data and configuration files , without all those sharp , pointy angle brackets jabbing you directly in your ever - lovin ' eyeballs ?
I do n't necessarily think XML sucks , but the mindless , blanket application of XML as a dessert topping and a floor wax certainly does .
Like all tools , it 's a question of how you use it .
Please think twice before subjecting yourself , your fellow programmers , and your users to the XML angle bracket tax .
< CleverEndQuote > Again.</CleverEndQuote >
The question of if and when to use XML is one I am intimately familiar with given that I spent the first 2.5 years of my professional career at Microsoft working on the XML team as the “ face of XML ” on MSDN .
My problem with Jeff ’s articles is that they take a very narrow view of how to evaluate a technology .
No one should argue that XML is the simplest or most efficient technology to satisfy the uses it has been put to today .
It is n’t .
The value of XML is n’t in its simplicity or its efficiency .
It is in the fact that there is a massive ecosystem of knowledge and tools around working with XML .
If I decide to use XML for my data format , I can be sure that my data will be consumable using a variety off - the - shelf tools on practically every platform in use today .
In addition , there are a variety of tools for authoring XML , transforming it to HTML or text , parsing it , converting it to objects , mapping it to database schemas , validating it against a schema , and so on .
Want to convert my XML config file into a pretty HTML page ?
I can use XSLT or CSS .
Want to validate my XML against a schema ?
I have my choice of Schematron , Relax NG and XSD .
Want to find stuff in my XML document ?
XPath and XQuery to the rescue .
And so on .
No other data format hits a similar sweet spot when it comes to ease of use , popularity and breadth of tool ecosystem .
So the question you really want to ask yourself before taking on the “ Angle Bracket Tax ” as Jeff Atwood puts it , is whether the benefits of avoiding XML outweigh the costs of giving up the tool ecosystem of XML and the familiarity that practically every developer out there has with the technology ?
In some cases this might be true such as when deciding whether to go with JSON over XML in AJAX applications ( I ’ve given two reasons in the past why JSON is a better choice ) .
On the other hand , I ca n’t imagine a good reason to want to roll your own data format for office documents or application configuration files as opposed to using XML .
The XML Litmus Test - Dare Obasanjo provides some simple guidelines for determining when XML is the appropriate technology to use in a software application or architecture design .

XML is a plain - text , Unicode - based meta - language : a language for defining markup languages .
It is not tied to any programming language , operating system , or software vendor .

C hicks Love Linux
Increasingly More Women Join the Community
by Andrea W. Cordingly , for our Reality Mixed with Humor section - reallylinux.com
T here I was standing around the LUG booth at the annual Linux expo when I realised that unlike years past , there were considerable numbers of female attendants .
No , I am not referring exclusively to those female models hired to promote an OS ( I wo n't mention which one ) wearing skimpy demon costumes .
I was truly encouraged to find that women from all backgrounds and ages were making up an increasingly larger portion of those attending such Linux conferences .
After speaking with three in particular I came to appreciate the women of Linux as passionate and techno savvy as any of their kernel compiling male counterparts .
What this means for Linux and the community as a whole I leave to your personal interpretation .
But what it means to the individual women involved with Linux is unique and important .
Take Cheryl for example .
Okay , do n't “ take her ” literally , but consider her situation .
She 's a young grad student finishing studies in computer science with plans to work as a research fellow on a number of Linux driven technologies .
She says , “ My research goals certainly include Linux .
I can't imagine progressing my career without the many tools I 've come to rely on , all on the Linux platform . ”
Her enthusiasm is contagious .
As another friend named Karen arrives to add to the discussion , it becomes apparent that the women of the Linux community have come a long way .
Karen sees Linux as a “ great way to meet smart people . ”
She 's not as ambitious regarding career planning , but certainly is looking to improve her social network .
“ I hate doing the usual club scene .
I end up meeting guys that have trouble with speaking words , let alone being capable of a mutually beneficial relationship . ”
Leaving behind men that drool and consider T&A part of their regular vocabulary , Karen instead shows up to her LUG to enjoy company that operates on a far more refined level .
And as she points out , at her LUG she can start conversing with someone who can speak without groping , use words with more than two syllables and actually be interested in what she shares .
Perhaps the biggest asset of such a social group as Linux users , Karen finds they are “ very helpful and friendly . ”
“ I went to our weekly LUG meeting and was amazed to find out how many guys are willing to spend hours voluntarily trying to get wifi working in my new apartment . ”
The other day , she noted that three LUG members helped her jump start her car , while a fourth offered to buy her some more fuel “ just to be sure she had enough to get home . ”
The Linux community certainly does reach out and encourage women more than most communities , as is witnessed by Linda .
Her personal anecdotes are both shocking and quite appealing .
“ There 's nothing more fun than sitting on my bed late at night , eating some really rich dark chocolate and playing Frozen Bubble .
Sheepishly , she admits that one of her favorite pastimes is playing Linux games or chatting with internet friends using her Linux driven laptop .
Linda ended up buying an ASUS mini running Linux out of the box and loved it .
“ Not only is it ultra portable , but with Linux installed I ended my days dealing with idiotic messages , XP warnings , and security settings galore , ” says Linda .
Proof that Linux is going to benefit anyone trying to get away from the Windows related issues .
Listening to the details Karen shares , Linda also admits to taking up Linux partly because it brings her in contact with a “ completely different world of men . ”
In a bar , the man who comes over to chat tends to stare at my breasts while talking about the weather .
But at a Linux conference , the guys that come over to chat with me tend to be staring at my ASUS running Google 's Picasa while asking about memory limitations . ”
“ When I spend time with a guy who knows his kernel parameters , I get this strange rather exciting feeling . ”
Linda is n't embarrassed to admit that men who are Linux professionals excite her because they “ have money , clout , and job security . ”
As with all of the women I met and spoke with , Linda spends most of her work fiddling with Linux servers and the people she meets are not only fun to be with , but frequently help her with job related issues .
“ You learn a lot from the Linux community , ” says Linda .
It is both refreshing and encouraging to see that many more women today are getting the picture that Linux is empowering and freeing .
It grants access to a community that is helpful and intelligent .
Finally , Linux is a highly useful tool for any woman to achieve goals , earn serious income , meet great people and get ahead .
Smart chicks indeed love Linux .
After emerging from a colorful academic career at Crazy Go Nuts University with a computer science degree at the end of 1994 , I steered away from the opportunities available to a junior developer at the time — maintaining mainframe and minicomputer software for banks , insurance companies , and other large enterprises — and instead joined an upstart company that paid its employees $ 12.50 an hour to make multimedia applications .
The company was called Mackerel Interactive Multimedia , and they ’d made a name for themselves in the design community by making some of the most clever interactive brochures and kiosks of that era , and were starting to take on bigger clients .
You have to remember that this was back when many computers did n’t have sound cards , never mind CD - ROM drives and modems , and Netscape had just released the 1.0 version of this new software called a “ web browser ” .
Mackerel ’s goal was to make the next Myst or similar multimedia hit .
In order to pay the bills while we worked towards that endgame , we made multimedia apps for clients .
These were typically interactive advertising or educational pieces that would eventually be distributed on CDs or even multiple floppy disks .
As the company ’s chief programmer ( I was the only one out of a couple dozen rank - and - file employees who had a computer science degree ) , I ’d be brought into meetings with the clients .
That ’s where I had my first brush with the music industry in its pre-Napster state .
One day during the summer of 1996 , one of the founders came into the developers ’ bullpen and announced that we ’d landed a contract with an independent record label belonging to a major record company .
“ Is n’t that a contradiction in terms ? ” I asked .
Apparently it was n’t .
The label turned out to be a new branch of the major record company that presented itself as an indie for street cred with both its acts and the music - buying public .
In spite of their Hot Topic - level authenticity , we thought they ’d make an interesting client , and the money was too good to pass up .
The exec that the label sent to visit was a woman who gave off more of a business school vibe than a rock vibe .
She peppered her speech with business - school - isms like “ target audience ” and “ units sold ” .
She used the word “ product ” several times , and I do n’t recall her using the word “ music ” or even “ album ” once .
It seemed that everything she knew about music did n’t come from being a fan ; it came from what she ’d read in market research reports .
“ That ’s why they do n’t call it show art , ” one of the creative directors quipped .
One of the goals of this initial meeting was to brainstorm some ideas for interactive apps that we could build for them .
I ’d been working on an idea that I was rather proud of : CD player apps customized for specific albums .
For any CD other than the one for which it was customized , it would show a mostly plain interface , plus some promos for the album .
However , if you used the player to play the album for a specific album , it would “ come alive ” with the album ’s lyrics , liner notes , album art and so on .
It was an attempt to bring back what was lost in the move from LPs to CDs .
“ Nice try , kid , ” said the exec with great disdain .
“ We did some market research and we ’ve determined that no one will ever listen to music on their computer .
“ People see them as machines for getting work done .
We ’re aiming for the rec room , the den , the living room and the bedroom , not the home office .
You computer guys are aiming for home office . ”
“ You sure about that ? ” our production manager asked .
“ We all use the CD players on our machines .
For some of us , our computers are in our bedrooms and living rooms , and they ’re also our primary stereos now . ”
“ That may be true for you , ” she replied , “ but you guys are the exception .
Computers are great , but they ’re office equipment .
You do n’t keep a typewriter or photocopier in your living room , so why would you have a computer there ?
And that ’s where people listen to their music .
Office equipment and entertainment : apples and oranges . ”
“ Trust me – I ’ve been in the music industry for a while – no one ’s going to listen to music on their computer . ”
Other people at the meeting presented their ideas , and she shot them down as well , with the same dismissive contempt .
At some point during the increasingly futile brainstorming session , I remembered something that I ’d brought back from the Macromedia User Conference .
I reached into my laptop bag and fished out a floppy disk .
“ Here , check this out , ” I said , slotting the diskette into my laptop .
“ It ’s something called Shockwave , which lets you embed multimedia applications inside web pages . ”
“ We do n’t think there will be much interest in the world wide web outside of technical people .
The pictures are tiny , you ’re stuck with default fonts , and your customers have to go buy a modem .
Too much tech hassle , too little payoff . ”
“ You should give this a look , ” I insisted .
“ The company that makes the tool we use to write multimedia software is using MPEG layer 3 [ the term “ MP3 ″ had n’t made common parlance yet ] compression to squeeze music files into less space .
There ’s a small multimedia program on this floppy , and a whole three - minute song .
It would normally take about 8 floppies to hold this song . ”
I put the disk in my laptop and launched the Shockwave application , which started a tune playing .
“ Sounds like crap , ” she said .
“ And who ’s the band ?
The Spin Doctors ?
They ’re so over . ”
“ Ignore the band , ” I said , trying to remain patient .
“ Just think of the possibilities .
This three - minute single is only a megabyte in size .
It fits on a floppy , which you can hand out , or you ’d be able to download it in a reasonable amount of time .
The download will be even faster on the new 56 K modems . ”
“ Blah , blah , blah , ” she said , making that opening - and - closing hand gesture signifying pointless chatter .
“ It only means something to you because you ’re a techie .
I ’ve seen the market research , and I will tell you now :
People are not going to be getting their entertainment from computers or the internet .
It ’s going to come from set - top boxes and MiniDisc recharging stations at their record stores . ”
At this point , I decided that discretion was the better part of valour .
“ Well , you seem to have all the market research , so maybe the best thing would be for you to come up with ideas for an interactive application , and then we can hammer out the details with you in a later meeting . ”
“ I think that would be a good idea , ” she said .
She rose from her seat to leave the room , shaking her head .
“ I do n’t know about you , ” I said to the others after confirming that she was out of earshot , “ but I think the music industry needs to be destroyed . ”
Ngawang Tenzin Jangpo is a revered figure of Tibetan Buddhism A religious leader in Nepal 's Everest region has criticised security measures ahead of the Olympic torch 's arrival on top of the world 's highest mountain .
Ngawang Tenzin Jangpo told the BBC that the government had gone too far in the precautions it was taking before the torch arrives at the summit .
Nepal says it will use force to prevent anti-Beijing protests during the Olympic torch relay up Mount Everest .
The torch is scheduled to be brought up from the Chinese side in early May .
Nepal is determined to prevent protests which may damage relations with China .
Ngawang Tenzin Jangpo , the Rinpoche or Reincarnate , of Tengboche Monastery , is the man from whom Nepalese and foreign climbers of mountains in the region traditionally seek a Buddhist blessing .
' Talking about guns '
He told the BBC's Charles Haviland that the Everest region was a " zone of peace " and that he was surprised by government moves to send security personnel into the region with arms for the torch relay .
" The home ministry has sent a huge number of army and police with guns and has also given them permission to open fire , " he said .
" So in this country of peace , which has the world 's highest peak , the home ministry is talking about guns .
I am surprised to hear that .
I am so sad . "
Ngawang Tenzin Jangpo said he was " very worried " about the development .
" It may be that the Chinese government has put pressure on our one to use guns .
Or it may be that our own government , our own country , wants to use them . "
Nepal says the increased security measures on the mountain , including baggage searches , are necessary .
On Wednesday an American man was sent down from base camp after being discovered with a pro-Tibet flag which insulted China .
Such items have been banned from the Sagarmatha ( Everest ) National Park .
' UN should monitor ' Nepal has also brought in rules to stop summiteers carrying items such cameras and other electronic devices beyond base camp before 10 May .
Nepali police have been quick to quash anti-China protests Ngawang Tenzin Jangpo said it was highly unlikely that pro-Tibet protesters would reach the top of the mountain .
" I think it would be better that the United Nations should look after this issue , should monitor the Everest region , if there 's any threat of shooting and disharmony , " he said .
The Olympic torch is not being taken anywhere near the Nepalese base camp .
But Nepal 's military and police have been deployed in extra numbers on the southern flank of the mountain because of sensitivities over the torch .
Nepal does not want to alienate China , one of its two neighbours and a country it depends on for foreign aid and diplomatic support , our correspondent says .

Midwestern prairie would be allowed to invade from the north .

For a variety of reasons , it seems worthwhile to do a kind of combined recap of my recent talks for the AIA in Baltimore and at the University of Pennsylvania .
If you were present at either one of those events , then this should hopefully serve as a nice trip down memory lane ; if you were n't there , this should give at least some idea of the topics covered , themes discussed , images seen , and so on .
Of course , if this sounds even remotely interesting , I 'd be more than happy to give a similar talk at a venue near you ...
I 've been having a blast doing these things .
In any case , I was in Baltimore two weeks ago on a joint invitation from the AIA and Preservation Maryland , to discuss architectural preservation , broadly conceived , with at least some relation to Baltimore proper .
So I began my lecture with a story from the science journals back in fall 2005 .
It turns out , we learned , that a specific highway junction north of Baltimore – where I -95 and I -695 meet – is topologically unique , exhibiting something called " non-trivial braiding . "
However , because of that structure 's inefficiency as a traffic conveyor , the merging on - and off - ramps were going to be rebuilt , reconnected , and otherwise altered beyond mathematical recognition .
Its topology , in other words , would be ruined .
A little bit of roadwork , and that mathematical object would be gone .
" I do n't want to encourage more cars onto the roads , " New Scientist wrote , " but if topology and beauty mean anything to you , get out there and enjoy I - 95/695 now .
It may soon be too late .
" So the question becomes : at what point do we preserve something not for its historical value but for its ?
If a bridge , or a highway overpass , becomes functionally obsolete , is it still subject to the rules of architectural preservation – whether or not it 's mathematically unique or culturally intriguing ?
Surely infrastructure is just infrastructure – i.e. when it breaks you replace it ?
You don'tinfrastructure .
Or do you ?
Meanwhile , at what point does theof culture and history trump theof function and design ?
And should mathematicians have any say ?
Perhaps there 's a middle ground here .
Perhaps we can , in fact , preserve something like a highway traffic exchange without forcing people to use its outdated twists and turns .
This brings us to the idea of the If we could remove the intersection , for instance , from everyday use and simply build around it , we could then stabilize it as a ruin – turning it into a kind of abstract sculptural form , like something by Barbara Hepworth – and , at the very least , create an interesting site for mathematically inclined tourists .
For visual reference here I mentioned architect Alberto Campo Baeza 's 2002 proposal for a Mercedes Benz Museum .
Might Campo Baeza 's structure be a model for what the I -95/695 intersection would look like if it was detached from the highway system and left alone , to be surrounded by new freeways ?
It'd be a kind of modern - day Stonehenge , made from on - ramps , surrounded by wildflowers , with well - designed signs to explain its fine geometry .
Loops of concrete in space .
Of course , there are other stabilized ruins – and here , trying to keep things regional , I pointed out Philadelphia 's Eastern State Penitentiary , highlighting photographs taken there by Shaun O'Boyle .
We see some examples of O'Boyle 's work here in this post – and O'Boyle , of course , was featured in BLDGBLOG 's earlier look at Bannerman 's Island " After 142 years of consecutive use , " the penitentiary 's website explains , " Eastern State Penitentiary was completely abandoned in 1971 , and now stands , a lost world of crumbling cell blocks and empty guard towers . "
It was one of the only two U.S. sites that Charles Dickens went out of his way to visit , on a trip in 1842 ; the other was Niagara Falls .
So if stabilization is a viable preservation strategy , then what are its limits ?
What is too small to worry about – and what is too large even to consider ?
Back in the late 1990s , photographer and urban sociologist Camilo José Vergara controversially proposed that a " skyscraper ruins park " be built in downtown Detroit .
In his book American Ruins , Vergara suggested that , " as a tonic for our imagination , as a call for renewal , as a place within our national memory , a dozen city blocks of pre-Depression skyscrapers be stabilized and left standing as ruins : an American Acropolis .
" Continuing this line of thought in a later article for , Vergara wrote :
Of course , fantasies of ruined cities are alive and well , so to speak .
One need only look as far as the disastrous film I Am Legend , or turn to Alan Wiseman 's recent bestseller The World Without Us to see that the appeal of dead cities never quite fades .
Indeed , I 'm tempted here to pitch a new breed of entertainment complex to some oil - rich emir or investment group : the idea is that you would build a ruined city on the shores of an artificial island somewhere south of all the luxury developments in Dubai , and you 'd invite tourists to explore those haunted canyons of steel and broken glass .
For the low - low price of only $ 75,000 a day , you can rent the entire park for yourself – and thus be Will Smith for a day , wandering through ruined department stores and sunbathing in weed - filled plazas .
At the very least , imagine the political implications of such a park : touring the ruins of the west by visiting Dubai – where the shattered remnants of Euro - America are nothing but a theme park for global tourists .
With recognizable buildings from London , New York , Chicago , Paris , Rome , and so on , I suppose it'd be a little like the film Resident Evil : Extinction , where we see the lost lights of Las Vegas buried in desert sand .
Only here it's a simulacrum of the entire western world , and it's laid out as waste at the feet of Dubai 's glass towers and air - conditioned boulevards .
In any case , with accidentally good timing , we moved on from there into a discussion of architect Albert Speer 's notorious plans for the Nazi super - city of Germania : a vision of what Berlin would become , given the presumed global triumph of Hitler and his skeletal empire .
Of course , Speer 's by now well - known architectural theory was that all buildings should be designed so that they will look good in the future as ruins .
He called thisI say " good timing " here , because Germania is actually the focus of a well - publicized exhibition in Berlin , going on right now , called Myth Germania .
It comes complete with a detailed model of Speer 's urban vision – bits of which can be seen here in old photographs .
Although ruined cities appear again and again here on BLDGBLOG – and will continue to do so – there is a stage beyond ruin , something that comes after dereliction and abandonment .
As long as we are willing to think along geological timescales , in other words , then we can talk about what I 've called urbanWhat will our cities look like when they have
Who else but New Scientist approached this very topic nearly a decade ago , explaining that , hundreds of millions of years from now , many of our cities will indeed become fossils .
Thesewill be " a lot more robust than [ fossils ] of the dinosaurs , " geologists Jan Zalasiewicz and Kim Freedman wrote , and those fossils will consist of “ the abandoned foundations , subways , roads , and pipelines of our ever more extensive urban stratum ” – becoming “ future trace fossils ” of a lost form of life .
The already subterranean undersides of our modern cities , from Tube tunnels to secret government bunkers , “ will be hard to obliterate .
They will be altered , to be sure , and it is fascinating to speculate about what will happen to our very own addition to nature ’s store of rocks and minerals , given a hundred million years , a little heat , some pressure ( the weight of a kilometer or two of overlying sediment ) and the catalytic , corrosive effect of the underground fluids in which all of these structures will be bathed .
" Plastics , for instance , “ might behave like some of the long - chain organic molecules in fossil plant twigs and branches , or the collagen in the fossilized skeletons of some marine invertebrates . ”
A hundred thousand Evian bottles , then , might someday be transformed by compression into a new quartz : vast and subterranean veins of mineralized plastic .
Of course , all of this depends on the future tectonic fates of certain regions .
Los Angeles , for instance , “ is on an upward trajectory , ” the geologists explain , “ pushed by pressure from the adjacent San Andreas Fault system , " and so it is " doomed to be eroded away entirely . ”
But if a city is flooded , buried in sand , or otherwise absorbed downward , then “ the stage is set to produce ideal pickling jars for cities .
The urban strata of Amsterdam , New Orleans , Cairo and Venice could be buried wholesale – providing , that is , they can get over one more hurdle : the destructive power of the sea . ” Rather than talk about , then , which is so Romantically 18th century , why not strive forinstead ?
Tens of millions of years in the future , when all of this urban infrastructure has turned to sludge , and radiative terrestrial heat has cooked old bricks into something resembling trace fossils , Can we design for this fate ?
Can we plan urban fossils ahead of time ?
Can we give our constructions
A British company is poised to construct the world 's first floating wind turbine , in a move that could herald a new generation of cheaper , less problematic wind energy .
Blue H , a firm registered in the UK but based in Holland , aims to anchor its prototype device 12 miles off the coast of southern Italy later this month .
The company is one of several racing to build commercial - scale floating wind turbines that sit in deep water far from land .
These turbines benefit from more powerful winds and avoid many of the issues that afflict existing wind farms .
Neal Bastick , head of Blue H , said the Italian prototype would be " virtually invisible " from the shore , and that the company plans to build a full scale floating 90 megawatt wind farm in the region .
Blue H also wants to build them off Scotland and the northeast US .
Bastick said the floating windmills would be more economic to install than existing offshore turbines , which sit on fixed foundations in the seabed .
They could minimise problems with planning , as well as having less impact on shipping , military radar and coastal seabird populations .
Electricity would be sent ashore using undersea cables .
The Blue H prototype will float a turbine platform on the sea surface and fix it in position using strong chains linked to heavy weights on the sea bed .
Changing the length of the chains could allow the turbine to operate in water depths between 50 m and 300 m , enough to take it far out into the deep ocean .
The Blue H prototype turbine platform was launched in December 2007 and needs to be towed out to sea and connected to its seabed counterweight .
Bastick said : " Within a few years I would very much like to be placing these off Britain . "
( Watch the company 's film of the launch here . )
Britain is seen as a key market for such technology because of the consistent winds around its coast .
In June , the UK government said that it would need to build up to 7,000 wind turbines at sea to help meet EU renewable energy targets .
The Norwegian companies Statoil and Statkraft are also developing floating windmills .
Carl Erik Hillesund , vice president for offshore wind development for Statkraft , said : " We need some new industrial thinking on the technology .
Up to now , people have just focused on taking onshore wind turbines and putting them offshore .
That has caused a lot of hassle and mistakes . "
He said the floating technology could be sited more than 200 miles from the coast .
" You could put them between the UK and Norway .
That would be no problem .
They would be out of sight and much more flexible . "
Statkraft is also bidding to build new wind farms in British waters , but Hillesund said it was too early to say if the floating wind turbines would be used .
The company aims to build its first full scale prototype by 2011 .
As part of a consortium called Windsea , it is developing a floating triangular platform , with a three to four - megawatt turbine mounted at each corner .
The platform would be anchored to the sea bed , but by a single chain so it could rotate as the wind changed direction .
Statoil takes a different approach : fixing a conventional turbine to a concrete buoy , anchored to the sea bed with three cables .
Called Hywind , the company aims to switch on a 2.3 megawatt prototype device in autumn 2009 .
Perhaps the most elegant design is being worked on by another Norwegian company called Sway .
It mounts its turbine on an elongated floating mast , the bulk of which sits below the water .
Connected to the seabed by a metal tube , the turbine mast is designed to sway with the wind and waves , and can lean at an angle of up to 15 degrees .
It could launch a prototype in 2010 .
You know how there was a question of whether or not we 'd ever see the Chevy Beat for sale in North America ?
The answer to that question is looking more like a big fat yes .
Of course , a subcompact like the Beat makes perfect sense in a landscape where gas is selling for well over $ 4 a gallon in many areas .
Our quasi - confirmation comes not from El Generalissimo , however , but from the set of Transformers 2 , which was recently given its tagline : Revenge of the Fallen .
In the photo above , next to Bumblebee , is the Chevy Beat -- partially covered , but the Beat nonetheless .
You know what putting it in the movie does , right ?
It makes people want it .
Last summer , it was the Camaro .
Next summer , it looks like GM 's gonna make the Beat a big star .
You can see the above photo and more from the set at the Transformers Live Action Movie Blog .
Thanks for the tip , Cory !
A FEW weeks ago I argued , to the consternation of many commenters , that government intervention in mortgage markets might be warranted .
My view was that home prices were likely to overshoot on the way down , with potentially catastrophic effects .
Falling prices destabilise borrowers leading to default , defaults roil credit markets , and tight credit sucks any willing buyers out the market , perpetuating the downward spiral .
This diagnosis is gaining ground in the economic community , but proposed solutions continue to differ .
In the New York Times today , Edward Leamer agrees that the market is in desperate need of buyers , and that lower prices and cuts in the federal funds rate are insufficient to deliver them .
Mr Leamer goes on to suggest that a massive tax credit to first - time homebuyers -- of something like $ 25,000 - - is needed .
Colour me sceptical .
While a tax credit of that magnitude would create a powerful incentive to buy , it would have little effect on markets if desiring buyers are unable to secure a mortgage loan .
The credit would essentially lower home prices to new buyers by $ 25,000 , but if low prices are n't able to solve the problem , as Mr Leamer says , then the subsidy is useless .
Meanwhile , John Makin of the American Enterprise Institute argues in the Wall Street Journal that significant action is needed now to forestall a collapse , generating massive government intervention -- including , perhaps , the nationalisation of the nation 's mortgage business .
His prescription to the problem is inflation ; money should be printed until real home prices are low enough to entice new buyers .
I think Mr Makin neglects the extent to which Fed policy is already allowing this to happen , and I think he underestimates the pain that will ultimately result from squeezing inflation back out of the economy .
He is right , however , that enough inflation will solve the problem .
Crucially , the expectation of higher prices generally could influence consumers who now see home price trends as uni-directional .
It seems to me that cheaper and more effective options are available .
Primarily , it would be nice to see an effort to orchestrate an end to unnecessary defaults , and secondarily , it would be useful to ensure that mortgage loans are available , at reasonable interest rates , to willing and qualifying buyers .
Both of the above could be accomplished by allowing the Federal Housing Administration to provide affordable refinancing options to struggling homeowners ( screened to exclude those who acted with obvious irresponsibility in borrowing ) , and to extend ready credit to new buyers .
If that still leaves the market with no buyers , then maybe other , more drastic , measures should be taken .
For now it 's clear that absence of credit is obstacle one to housing recovery .
By all means , tackle that problem first .
Hours after Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger announced his latest budget revisions Wednesday , he sat down with Times editors and reporters to share his thoughts on taxes , the entertainment business and more .
Below are excerpts of his remarks .
You can find the audio gallery here .
California ’s tax system ( MP3 )
Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger :
We do n’t have a revenue problem in the long run , because we have a 5 % increase if you average it out over 10 years , the last 10 years , we have a 5 % increase in revenues .
So there ’s really no reason why we should be in financial trouble .
It ’s only because , as I said , when there ’s a spike in revenues they grab off that money and spend it and commit it to ongoing programs .
And then everyone expects that this will now continue , but in fact it does n’t because , as Davis experienced , the next year it was down and the revenues were flat .
Then all of a sudden , everyone was scrambling and everyone thought that we were -- and we were in a disastrous situation , obviously .
What we want to do , kind of , is eliminate that problem and say any revenues that come in that ’s beyond 5 % goes into a rainy - day fund , and keep it there .
And when the revenues are down like right now we can use this rainy - day fund to supplement the shortfall and soften the blow , not that you can solve the problem , but soften the blow .
My approach on this is : Look , you guys have been in this mess now for at least three decades .
I mean , Deukmejian went through it , Davis went through it , Pete Wilson went through it , I ’m going through it .
When do you ever get the point that there ’s something wrong with the system ?
And you always scream that they ’re balancing the budget on the backs of the poor and look at the cuts we have to make and this and that is a disaster , when in fact , you can fix the system and then never have that problem again .
As I said , in January I tried to make them recognize to not do what they always do , which is to look at the budget as just one year .
Let ’s go and really put the work in it , and let ’s go and fix this once and for all so we do n’t have those kind of swings .
And I have talked also to [ Assembly Speaker Karen Bass ] about , you know , finding a way of stabilizing the revenue itself through our tax system , because our tax system is really outdated .
We have a tax system that is so much counting on the income tax and the capital gains tax , so we see these huge swings .
There are so many things that we do n’t tax at all , so we ’re loading up the responsibility on this one sector that is kind of shrinking ....
So let ’s analyze that ; maybe there ’s a way of easing that in , maybe there ’s a way we can stabilize revenues ....
So me as a Republican , I recommend that , so it takes a little bit of pressure off the Democrats who feel like , “ Oh , if I mention that , then it looks like special code for tax increases and all those kind of things . ”
So I said , “ Look , you ’re the luckiest people . ” I said , “ You have a Republican governor that can push those things that maybe just you ’re always , you ’re known for pushing . ”
But I think , and I think everyone knows , that our tax system does n’t work , that we should update it .
Even the most conservative economists say that .
Tax incentives for studios ( MP3 )
Jim Newton , L.A. Times :
One of the things that ’s been a bit of a local story the last couple weeks -- it ’s sort of vaguely economic -- which is these TV productions that leave for different parts of the country .
Most recently , the “ Ugly Betty ” show is going back to New York .
Is there a need for California to offer better tax incentives to keep productions here ?
And is there anything more that you could be doing on a personal level to try to keep them here ?
Schwarzenegger :
Well , first of all , you ca n’t go to someone -- I mean , we could in “ Terminator 3 " when we saw that it was $ 8 million more to shoot in Los Angeles than in Vancouver .
I said , “ Stop , guys .
Do n’t move to Vancouver . ”
I put in a million and a half dollars of my own money back into the production , and that motivated the director to put in 500,000 and the producer a million .
The wardrobe department said , “ Well , we buttered up the budget a little bit ; here ’s $ 300,000 . ”
Then the stunt department said , “ Hey , we also buttered it up a little ; here ’s 500,000 . ”
Then all of a sudden , $ 8 million were put together .
So that was an unusual situation because I asked , and I said , “ I need to stay here ” .
But you ca n’t go to , you know , a studio executive and say , “ Look , I know you ’re going to get hit at the end of the year with $ 24 million or $ 100 million or so , but just for me , can you keep production ? ”
It does n’t work this way .
They want to see action .
And for four years I ’ve asked the legislators to get a tax incentive for our movie industry .
I told them that the money does not go to the producers , because they make their deal -- that million or 2 million or $ 5 million deal -- if they go and shoot in London , in Australia , in South Africa , it makes no difference .
So it ’s not for , like they say , the fat cats in Hollywood or something like that ; it is more the make - up artists , for the guy that pulls the cable , the guy that does the stage setting , the guy that is building the stage , the plumber , the carpenter -- those are the guys that I see everyday .
I see 150 guys on the set , on a normal set , and for bigger movies , the Terminator movies , I see 600 people on the set .
On a normal set , there ’s 150 people ; I ’m worried about them .
The reality of it is , you ’re helping tens of thousands of people that are out of work and that ca n’t afford , you know , their homes , their rent and all of those things .
And , when they stay in town with their productions in this state , it creates a tremendous amount of revenues : over $ 200 million in Los Angeles , $ 280 million or something like that , we created in economic stimulation here in Los Angeles by staying here from “ Terminator 3 . ” I think one has to look at that .
Some say this is a tax incentive , and some say this is a tax loophole .
That ’s why you hear so many times , you know , “ Why do n’t they close the tax loophole . ”
So I said , “ We ’re trying to close the tax loopholes ; I ’m open for it . ”
But I said , “ Prove to me that it does n’t have a negative economic impact . ”
I said , “ If we find one that does not create jobs or revenues , fine , close it , get rid of it .
But if it does create jobs and revenues for the state , then , we have to balance it out and see , does it make sense the amount of tax incentives we give ?
Or does it not make sense ?
Maybe we have to reduce it , but we do n’t get rid of it . ”
Immigration and redistricting ( MP3 )
Lisa Richardson , L.A. Times :
Have any businesses or chambers of commerce come to you and asked you to take a position on immigration raids on worksites that have been going on recently ?
Schwarzenegger : No .
Richardson : No ?
Schwarzenegger : No .
Richardson : Just wanted to know .
Schwarzenegger : I get a lot of requests from the chamber and from businesses to push for immigration reform .
And we get a lot of push about , you know , the problem that if we do n’t have immigration reform , and we are very tough on the border - which we are in California , we have the National Guard there - and because of that , it reduced the crossings .
But because of that , a lot of businesses are suffering now .
So what everyone likes is not to have illegals working for them ; but what they like is to have the chance to go and hire these people legally .
But they do n’t get the visas because there ’s a cap on that so it ’s a very frustrating system , and it ’s not good for anybody .
It ’s not good for the Mexicans , it ’s not good for us , it ’s not good for our businesses , and especially with the chaos of the students ’ visas .
We have students that are studying from all over the world , and then the next day they have to go home .
I think it ’s crazy for them not to have a visa so they can stay a few years and so we can use their brain power that they actually got in California or in the United States and use them here for a few years and then let them go home .
They want to stay here and we need them .
That ’s one of the most common complaints in Silicon Valley .
So we really need immigration reform , and it ’s really - it ’s a disaster in Washington .
There was such hope when [ House Speaker ] Nancy Pelosi went in ; they thought that all those things would be changed , and there would be , finally , they would get things done .
Nothing is getting done .
You know , this is why I think redistricting is so important , because I think what you see now with the budget -- it ’s that there are the extremes that have to come out .
One has to complain that there ’s too many cuts and they have to do all this , because they ’re way to the left .
And the other ones have to right away say , “ Oh , I think I smell something about taxes in there .
Even though they ’re not going to use it , but there ’s some word , ” they think , “ the T - A - X in there .
How could he .
He betrayed us . ”
So there ’s extremes .
That ’s not in the middle ; I ’m in the middle .
I can see the plusses of the Democrats , I can see the plusses of the Republicans , and I feel enriched because I can combine both their ideas and go down the middle road .
So I think that if we have the redistricting done , [ and ] the people approve it in November , that will over the next few years bring people more and more to the center , because they will be competitive .
There will be Democrats and Republicans that will have to now compete and now campaign against each other .
And then it is who has the best ideas rather than being locked in the way it is now .
As the role of the Internet has grown , there have been persistent fears that the less wealthy in society would be left out , due to lack of access to hardware , the Internet , or broadband .
Although these concerns have lessened as dropping prices and public access programs have increased Internet use across the socioeconomic spectrum , a study in the Journal of Applied Developmental Psychology suggests that a new divide is becoming apparent : the wealthier and better educated are better equipped to find and evaluate material on the Internet .
The researchers surveyed 160 parents in the Boston area , evenly divided between males and females .
Participants were binned into three groups according to their education and income ; in all but one minor instance , the results from the middle - income group fell neatly between the high - and low - income subjects .
Participants answered surveys regarding their web browsing habits and performed a search for information while narrating their thought process to a watchful research assistant .
A digital divide was apparent in Internet use habits ; wealthier individuals accessed the web daily at a rate that was over double that of the lowest income group .
The researchers focused on parenting information , where the divide was also apparent : every high socioeconomic status individual had looked for information on children and families , while only 63 percent of the low status group had .
The divide played out in interesting ways when it came to searching for information .
Those who searched at Yahoo and MSN were evenly distributed across income groups .
Over half the high - income parents , however , used Google , while only 8 percent of low - income parents did — they apparently preferred AOL search .
The authors suggested that this difference arose from the fact that high - status parents were over four times more sensitive to search engines returning irrelevant results ( the authors consider Google the gold standard for search engines ) .
Other aspects of the divide extended beyond choice of search engine .
70 percent of high - status parents went back to the original list of search results after hitting an irrelevant site ; less than half of low - status parents did the same .
They were also twice as likely to tweak search terms when they ran into a set of results they were unhappy with .
Finally , those higher up the socioeconomic ladder were more likely ( 43 percent ) to trust information from universities and research organizations than those at the bottom ( 16 percent ) .
Given that , in this study population , education and socioeconomic status were linked , one obvious conclusion is that higher education helps individuals develop a skill set that includes the use of the Internet as an information retrieval tool .
The authors explicitly call this aspect of the digital divide a " skills deficit , " and suggest that training in the basics of successful searching should be made widely available .
This is especially important because the users lowest on the socioeconomic scale were the most happy with the information they retrieved , even though their search habits set them up to retrieve less reliable information .

During the April 16 debate between Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama , moderator George Stephanopoulos brought up “ a gentleman named William Ayers , ” who “ was part of the Weather Underground in the 1970s .
They bombed the Pentagon , the Capitol , and other buildings .
He ’s never apologized for that . ”
Stephanopoulos then asked Obama to explain his relationship with Ayers .
Obama ’s answer : “ The notion that somehow as a consequence of me knowing somebody who engaged in detestable acts 40 years ago , when I was eight years old , somehow reflects on me and my values , does n’t make much sense , George . ”
Obama was indeed only eight in early 1970 .
I was only nine then , the year Ayers ’s Weathermen tried to murder me .
In February 1970 , my father , a New York State Supreme Court justice , was presiding over the trial of the so - called “ Panther 21 , ” members of the Black Panther Party indicted in a plot to bomb New York landmarks and department stores .
Early on the morning of February 21 , as my family slept , three gasoline - filled firebombs exploded at our home on the northern tip of Manhattan , two at the front door and the third tucked neatly under the gas tank of the family car .
( Today , of course , we ’d call that a car bomb . )
A neighbor heard the first two blasts and , with the remains of a snowman I had built a few days earlier , managed to douse the flames beneath the car .
That was an act whose courage I fully appreciated only as an adult , an act that doubtless saved multiple lives that night .
I still recall , as though it were a dream , thinking that someone was lifting and dropping my bed as the explosions jolted me awake , and I remember my mother ’s pulling me from the tangle of sheets and running to the kitchen where my father stood .
Through the large windows overlooking the yard , all we could see was the bright glow of flames below .
We did n’t leave our burning house for fear of who might be waiting outside .
The same night , bombs were thrown at a police car in Manhattan and two military recruiting stations in Brooklyn .
Sunlight , the next morning , revealed three sentences of blood - red graffiti on our sidewalk : FREE THE PANTHER 21 ; THE VIET CONG HAVE WON ; KILL THE PIGS .
For the next 18 months , I went to school in an unmarked police car .
My mother , a schoolteacher , had plainclothes detectives waiting in the faculty lounge all day .
My brother saved a few bucks because he did n’t have to rent a limo for the senior prom : the NYPD did the driving .
We all made the best of the odd new life that had been thrust upon us , but for years , the sound of a fire truck ’s siren made my stomach knot and my heart race .
In many ways , the enormity of the attempt to kill my entire family did n’t fully hit me until years later , when , a father myself , I was tucking my own nine - year - old John Murtagh into bed .
Though no one was ever caught or tried for the attempt on my family ’s life , there was never any doubt who was behind it .
Only a few weeks after the attack , the New York contingent of the Weathermen blew themselves up making more bombs in a Greenwich Village townhouse .
The same cell had bombed my house , writes Ron Jacobs in The Way the Wind Blew : A History of the Weather Underground .
And in late November that year , a letter to the Associated Press signed by Bernardine Dohrn , Ayers ’s wife , promised more bombings .
As the association between Obama and Ayers came to light , it would have helped the senator a little if his friend had at least shown some remorse .
But listen to Ayers interviewed in the New York Times on September 11 , 2001 , of all days : “ I do n’t regret setting bombs .
I feel we did n’t do enough . ”
Translation : “ We meant to kill that judge and his family , not just damage the porch . ”
When asked by the Times if he would do it all again , Ayers responded : “ I do n’t want to discount the possibility . ”
Though never a supporter of Obama , I admired him for a time for his ability to engage our imaginations , and especially for his ability to inspire the young once again to embrace the political system .
Yet his myopia in the last few months has cast a new light on his “ politics of change . ”
Nobody should hold the junior senator from Illinois responsible for his friends ’ and supporters ’ violent terrorist acts .
But it is fair to hold him responsible for a startling lack of judgment in his choice of mentors , associates , and friends , and for showing a callous disregard for the lives they damaged and the hatred they have demonstrated for this country .
It is fair , too , to ask what those choices say about Obama ’s own beliefs , his philosophy , and the direction he would take our nation .

Louise Brown , the first test - tube baby , was born 30 years ago this month after being conceived outside the body using in vitro fertilization ( IVF ) .
Helen Pearson asks what developments in reproductive medicine could have an equivalent impact in the next three decades .
Davor Solter , developmental biologist at the Institute of Medical Biology ( IMB ) in Singapore
The goals will remain the same in that we 'll be trying to give children to those who can't have them and remove children from those who do n't want them ( see ' Looking back ' ) .
I think IVF has gone about as far as it can .
Next I expect that germ cells — sperm and eggs — will be successfully derived from induced pluripotent stem ( iPS ) cells [ cells that have the potential to develop into any of the body 's cell types ] .
It will be possible to make iPS cells from skin cells , to make germ cells from these , and then combine them to make human embryos .
It means every person regardless of age will be able to have children : newborn children could have children and 100 - year olds could have children .
It could easily happen in the next 30 years .
I have no idea if the technique will be used , but it means you could have millions of gametes that could be combined at will .
Today you can't experiment on human embryos because it 's considered morally repugnant — and they are difficult to get .
If embryos could be grown in culture like any other cell line , this latter problem would disappear .
It would mean you could introduce any kind of genetic modification .
The cell lines could be used to correct a mutation or to engineer an improvement , and used to make a mutant embryo for research purposes .
They 'd become like any other type of cell line .
They would become objects and would be used as objects .
I have no idea what kind of moral value or rights we would give to those embryos .
We 'll probably go through the same agonizing we did with IVF .
It could be terrible to begin with , but then it 'll become a fact of life .
Maybe 20 –30 years from now we 'll read in newspapers that someone made 20,000 embryos and studied their development , and we 'll decide it 's OK .
Another thing I predict for this brave new world is the use of artificial placentas .
In essence , it would eliminate all the limitations we have now : you could have as many or as few progeny as you want .
I have no idea how easy it would be .
I can visualize a fetus floating freely in fluid and the umbilical cord attached to a machine .
But I do n't know how much implantation is necessary .
The fetus floats freely , but for the blastocyst [ early - stage embryo ] , the placenta might be necessary for normal morphogenesis [ organ development , for example ] .

Alan Trounson , an IVF pioneer and director of the California Institute for Regenerative Medicine in San Francisco .
IVF was a gigantic step .
We did n't realize it at the time ; people did n't think it would work that well .
We never envisaged that it would expand so dramatically around the world .
Ethics keeps moving .
What was once seen as dangerous goes on to be seen as within the confines of acceptable risk .
Probably the major development in the field will come from something we 've never thought about .
I think it will be possible that we 'll be able to extend the fertile period for women by producing germ cells from iPS technology , or by a variant of nuclear transfer , so somatic cells [ which make up most of the body 's cells ] become germ cells and are refreshed genetically .
I think this will happen , and it raises a lot of ethical issues about safety and the children .
There will be concerns raised over whether the fertile period should be extended beyond its natural point .
I think people should be given the choice .
The idea needs first to be established in animal models .
We need to look at lifespan because we do n't know the impact of reprogramming cells in this way .
Another issue is whether we should bank cells from people when they are very young to avoid the accumulation of genetic errors that occur as we get older .
We might see a move towards artificial chromosomes and ' genetic cassettes ' that can be inserted at the embryonic stage to correct particular diseases , such as Huntington's .
These might be inducible cassettes that can correct for an abnormality that occurs late in life and switched on at that time .
Also I think there will be further expansion of low - cost IVF , especially for women in developing countries who experience social discrimination with infertility .
If you remove all the expensive stuff and use low - cost drugs ( such as clomiphene ) and remove just one or two eggs , and only transfer one embryo , it can be done for less than US$ 100 .
Susannah Baruch , director of reproductive genetics at the Genetics and Public Policy Center at Johns Hopkins University in Washington DC
Right now preimplantation genetic diagnosis ( PGD ) is used during IVF to look for single gene disorders in , for example , a family in which a child has already died .
I think genetics will continue to play a big part in assisted reproductive technology .
The bigger question is : what will people be testing for ?
There 's speculation that people will have designer babies , but I do n't think the data are there to support that .
The spectre of people wanting the perfect child is based on a false premise .
No single gene predicts blondness or thinness or height or whatever the ' perfect baby ' looks like .
You might find genetic contributors but there are so many environmental factors too .
More likely is that you 'll have a set of embryos and you 'll know every single thing about every gene in every embryo .
For example , one embryo will have three genes associated with tallness , two for weakness , three for poor vision and some for disease ; and the second embryo will have some other set .
They 're very complicated data .
This is not creating a baby from scratch .
None of us is a perfect specimen and none of our embryos will be either .
I think you 'll end up with a lot of information available to parents and it's less obvious how useful that information will be and how many parents will want it .
I think the technology will be there within ten years to be able to know without harming the embryo , but I do n't know whether it will become widely used .
There are bound to be some parents who want it , and then the dilemma is deciding what you tell your children about the choices you made .
Will people choose IVF to get that genetic option ?
IVF is expensive and uncomfortable .
The old - fashioned way is cheaper and more fun and that wo n't change in 30 years .
Alastair Sutcliffe , a paediatrician who studies the health of children after IVF at University College London
Litigation is a big driver in medicine .
With the increasing availability of IVF , there will be more emphasis on safety .
Not enough is known about the long - term health of the Louise Browns of this world — if there is a problem , it will be unexpected .
The concern is over whether the culture media used to nourish the cells and embryo before implantation has epigenetic effects [ changes to the way a person 's genes are expressed ] .
For example , there is some evidence that Beckwith Wiedemann syndrome is more common in children conceived through IVF , but whether this is a true effect is unclear .
I always say it 's rare — but if your child 's got it …
And the fertility of those IVF children as they grow up is of interest .
What are the subtle effects ?
I want to look at epigenetic markers in these people .
I 'm one of the few people who can do this because of the cohort of children that I have .
I think it 's a quantum leap to say that because a couple was infertile the child will be too .
Scott Gelfand , director of the Ethics Center at Oklahoma State University in Stillwater
There is some research aiming to increase embryo survival and the likelihood that IVF will work .
There are also people who are working on the other end — at the moment babies can only survive from around 22 weeks , but in future fetuses this could be extended to those that are 12 weeks .
Someone could join these two advances together and we could have complete ectogenesis [ in which the fetus develops outside the body in an artificial uterus ] .
I find it interesting and scary .
Those who work on artificial - womb technology are n't talking openly about it anymore .
My guess is it 's a potential lightning rod in our culture .
There are some very interesting moral and ethical implications associated with artificial wombs .
Certain conservatives might think it should n't be used but some might think that it could meet the test of Roe vs Wade — that it protects the privacy of the woman while preserving the rights of the fetus .
If an artificial womb were developed , the government could pass a law that requires people who have a termination of pregnancy to put the fetus into one of these wombs .
That 's the fear of many pro-choice theorists .
There are around 1 million abortions per year in the United States and there would have to be labs throughout the country , but if we put all these in artificial wombs and then put them up for adoption we would have one million more babies .
It would be a nightmare .
When I talk to some anti-abortionists about that , they really shudder .
Even in terms of insurance : if it became economically competitive with other forms of gestation , insurers might compel a person to use it to avoid premature birth or fetal alcohol syndrome .
It 's something that really needs to be talked about .
Will it happen ?
Dolly was a complete surprise to everybody …
Miodrag Stojkovic , stem - cell biologist at the Prince Philip Centre of Investigation in Valencia , Spain
Will we see a cloned baby ?
It could happen any day because of a lack of regulation [ in some countries ] .
To my knowledge people are already trying to do reproductive cloning .
Technically it is possible — a paper this year showed that you could derive human blastocysts after nuclear transfer [ in which the nucleus of one cell is transferred to another cell ] and our previous work has shown it is possible to grow human embryos to the blastocyst stage too .
The only problem is the logistics of getting hold of enough viable human oocytes [ eggs ] .
If we can make human oocytes from stem cells , it might be easier .
The field is developing so fast that some people can't follow what happens and are scared .
There are plenty of movies in which scientists clone humans and use their organs for tissue donation , but this is not the reality .
There is no medical need to clone a human .
If we can make artificial gametes there would be no need to do it .
The future is not about reproductive cloning , that 's a very , very detrimental technique .
Humans are getting more and more lazy when it comes to reproduction .
Male fertility is declining and parents are deciding to have their first child at 40 .
We need to learn what the embryo needs to result in a pregnancy — you can have excellent embryos in IVF and no pregnancy .
But this can only be answered with human embryos .
There is plenty we do n't understand about embryo–mother communication .
I do n't think 30 years will be enough to answer those questions .
Zev Rosenwaks , director of the Center for Reproductive Medicine and Infertility in New York
I see the technology going towards possible eradication of infertility altogether .
With nuclear - transfer technology or cell modification , I think we 'll be able to generate sperm and eggs for anybody .
I think we 've potentially reached the limit of biology in terms of the female 's eggs , so artificial gametes might overcome that .
In the best cases , success rates for IVF can exceed 70 % with one cycle .
The limitation is that we can't ensure the embryo is normal .
I think there will be methods to evaluate the embryo for its viability and genetic competence in a non-invasive way , without having to remove cells .
Cell - culture media is one way , as are micro-imaging techniques that look at chromosomal make - up .
It could increase the success rate of IVF if we were better able to select the best embryo with markers such as metabolomics or with imaging techniques we can't even imagine today .
We can already take a cell from an embryo to create a cell line .
In the future , this may become routine .
Régine Sitruk - Ware , reproductive endocrinologist and executive director of research and development at the Population Council in New York

If we look at centres in reproductive sciences funded by the National Institutes of Health , there are more than twenty on IVF and only a handful on contraceptive research .
It 's more politically correct to help people get babies than the reverse , but it 's important to have a balance .
Many current contraceptive methods have side effects or they 're not effective .
We can do better .
We 're hoping it might be possible for men and women to alternate taking contraceptives and that we can develop non-hormonal methods with fewer side effects that are very specific in targeting an enzyme or protein in the reproductive process , such as one that stops the ovum from maturing , or sperm from entering the egg .

WASHINGTON ( CNN ) -- Congress can force White House aides to testify under subpoena , a U.S. District Court ruled Thursday , rejecting Bush administration claims of immunity .
Former White House Counsel Harriet Miers is not immune from congressional subpoenas , a judge ruled Thursday .
The House Judiciary Committee has been seeking to force former White House Counsel Harriet Miers to testify before Congress about the firing of nine U.S. attorneys in 2006 .
The White House has been resisting , claiming she can not be compelled to appear .
But the White House position " is without any support in case law , " Judge John D. Bates wrote in a 93 - page opinion released Thursday .
He said the notion that " Miers is absolutely immune from compelled congressional process " is " unprecedented . "
But , Bates added , the ruling does not mean that Miers and Joshua Bolten , the White House chief of staff from whom House Democrats have demanded White House documents , could not assert executive privilege during congressional testimony .
The court " resolves , and again rejects " the notion that senior White House aides are absolutely immune from subpoena , but the " specific claims of executive privilege that Ms. Miers and Mr. Bolten may assert are not addressed -- and the court expresses no view on such claims , " Bates wrote .
In a hearing in June , Bates had urged the White House and Congress to resolve their dispute via negotiations .

He also expressed concern the clock would run out because he expected an appeal of his ruling no matter which way he decided .
That could keep the dispute in the courts until a new Congress is elected in November .
The subpoenas expire when this Congress leaves office .
Rep. John Boehner , an Ohio Republican and the House minority leader , appeared to agree on Thursday .
" I 'm sure it 'll be appealed and it'll go on into next year and it'll become a moot issue , " he said .
Rep. Lamar Smith of Texas , the senior Republican on the House Judiciary Committee , called the ruling a " victory for Congress , " but urged congressional Democrats and the administration to " seek a reasonable compromise " rather than continue to fight the matter in court .
The House Judiciary committee filed suit against Miers and Bolten in March after the Department of Justice said it would not pursue contempt charges against them for failing to obey the subpoena .
The White House has insisted the firings of the nine U.S. attorneys were legal .
But Democrats said the central questions behind the dismissals -- who decided the prosecutors should be ousted , and why -- remain unanswered .
The position is supposed to be an apolitical one .
Democrats accuse the administration of political motives in replacing the nine officials .
White House press secretary Dana Perino said the administration is reviewing Thursday 's ruling .
House Speaker Nancy Pelosi , a California Democrat , said she was " pleased " by the ruling , though she said had not had a chance to study it .
All About Harriet Miers • The White House
Charlie Clark was talking about his Zope3 experiences and why it is a great framework to work with and here is my try on a summary :
He started with a brief history of Zope2 , how it started , how the CMF came up , introducing new concepts , like Filesystem development , Skinning support and a standard set of tools .
Zope3 was then meant to overcome problems in Zope2 and the CMF .
Development started in 2001 and aimed to be a „ Zope for developers “ .
It was a complete rewrite and complete redesign .
In the meantime Plone and other projects such as Ruby on Railes and others raised in popularity .
The business view
If you are a company it is important to get paid for your programming work .
You will always have a technology lag though because you usually cannot be always on the cutting edge with all people .
You try to differentiate yourself from the market by IP , packaging up your software etc .
But do n’t bet your business on it !
( did n’t get the rest though unfortunately )
Is Zope right for you ?
What is available ?
Plone is out there but migrating Plone versions is a pain but might get better .
You can also use CMF and Zope2 to have more flexibility but in fact you maybe directly should look at Zope3 but maybe not the whole thing directly .
Reasion : The Joy of using Python .
Do n’t Panic !
Zope3 is big but not complex .
It just is different and it takes a while to get used to it .
Some figures :
Plone objects have about 750 attributes when you instanciate them , CMF objects about 350 , Zope3 objects about 50 , mostly less .
The less attributes you need to understand , the better .
What ’s good about Zope3
First : No acquisition .
Back then it was quite a great invention in a CGI environment but unfortunately acquisition can have unpredicted sideeffects ( esp. regarding security ) .
In Zope3 it has been removed and you might need to get used to it .
The basic principle : Explicit is better than implicit .
Zope3 also has the Component Architecture which is great in itself but sounds rather complicated .
The amount of configuration probably is what keeps people away from Zope3 right now .
But configuration also has it ’s benefits because programmers and computers know exactly about what ’s going on here .
One question :
Do I need components in a one - off site ?
This is a loaded question which can create a lot of discussions .
But when you use it you can later get a lot of flexibility .
Also remember that maybe in your next project you might want to reuse part of what you did for the one website .
Using components then makes it easier .
Everything is an interface
One of the key concepts is an Interface , which is not just a specification but also a membership card .
It ’s a way to get to stuff .
Documentation considered harmful ?
Documentation for Zope3 is right now in READMEs mainly .
It is unfortunately not as well documented as other projects which is a barrier of entry for many people .
The code is readable but some of the concepts are somewhat abstract esp. for people who never used adapters etc .
But there is a great book : Web Component Development with Zope 3 by Philipp von Weitershausen .
For Plone there is of course Martin ’s book which also explains parts of Zope3 like adapters etc .
Zope 3 in 5 minutes
Write your interface Write your content type Configure your content type Views Configure your view
Our experience
PHP programmers can migrate to Python
HTML developers are very happy with ZPT
Allow two months to transition
He then demoed a simple reimplementation of a Plone document type with Zope3 mechanics .
He defined an interface , create a content type which derived from PortalContent of the CMF and configured it .
He then showed the browser part of it where the views get defined .

BURIED in the news a few weeks ago was an announcement by a small Californian firm called Amyris .
It was , perhaps , a parable for the future of biotechnology .
Amyris is famous in the world of tropical medicine for applying the latest biotechnological tools to the manufacture of artemisinin , an antimalarial drug that is normally extracted from a Chinese vine .
The vines cannot produce enough of the stuff , though , so Amyris 's researchers have taken a few genes here and there , tweaked them and stitched them together into a biochemical pathway enabling bacteria to make a chemical precursor that can easily be converted into the drug .
But that is not what the announcement was about .
Instead , it was that Amyris was going into partnership with Crystalsev , a Brazilian firm , to make car fuel out of cane sugar .
Not ethanol ( though Brazil already has a thriving market for ethanol - powered cars ) , but a hydrocarbon that has the characteristics of diesel fuel .
Technically , it is not ordinary diesel , either : in chemist - speak , it is an isoprenoid rather than a mixture of alkanes and aromatics .
But the driver will not notice the difference .
The point of the parable is this : biotechnology may have cut its teeth on medicines , but the big bucks are likely to be in bulk chemicals .
And few chemicals are bulkier than fuels .
Where Amyris is leading , many are following .
Some small firms with new and interesting technologies are trying to go it alone .
Others are teaming up with big energy firms , in much the same way that biotech companies with a promising drug are often taken under the wing of a large pharmaceutical company .
The big firms themselves are involved , too , both through in - house laboratories and by giving money to universities .
Biofuels , once seen as a cross between eccentric greenwash and a politically acceptable way of subsidising farmers , are now poised to become big business .
Grassed up
The list of things that need to be done to create a proper biofuel industry is a long one .
New crops , tailored to fuel rather than food production , have to be created .
Ways of converting those crops into feedstock have to be developed .
That feedstock has then to be turned into something that people want to buy , at a price they can afford .
All parts of this chain are currently the subjects of avid research and development .
Some biofuels were already competitive with oil products even at 2006 oil prices ( see table 5 ) .
The R&D effort will bring more of them into line , as will any long - term rise in the price of crude oil .
As far as the crops themselves are concerned , there are three runners at the starting gate : grasses , trees and algae .
Grasses and trees are grown on dry land , but need a lot of processing .
The idea is to take the whole biomass of the plant ( particularly the cellulose of which a plant - cell 's walls are made ) and turn it into fuel .
At the moment , that fuel is often ethanol .
Hence the term “ cellulosic ethanol ” that has gained recent currency .
Algae , being aquatic , are more fiddly to grow , but promise a high - quality product , oil , that will not need much treatment to become biodiesel .
One of the leading proponents of better grasses is Ceres , a firm based in Thousand Oaks , California .
The species it has chosen to examine — switchgrass , miscanthus , sugarcane and sorghum — are so - called C4 grasses .
These are favourites with the biofuel industry because they share a particularly efficient form of photosynthesis that enables them to grow fast .
Ceres proposes to make them grow faster still , using a mixture of “ smart ” breeding techniques ( in which desirable genes are identified scientifically but assembled into plants by traditional hybridisation ) and straightforward genetic engineering .
The chosen grasses also thrive in a range of climates .
Switchgrass and miscanthus are temperate .
Sugarcane and sorghum are tropical .
Ceres proposes to extend their ranges still further by creating strains that will tolerate heat or cold or drought or salt , allowing them to be grown on land that can not be used for food crops .
That will make them cheaper , as well as reducing the competition between foods and biofuels .
Trees , meanwhile , are the province of firms such as ArborGen , of Summerville , South Carolina .
Like Ceres , ArborGen is working on four species : eucalyptus , poplar , and the loblolly and radiata pines .
It is applying similar techniques to those used by Ceres to speed up the growth of these trees and to increase their tolerance of cold .
Although creating raw materials for biofuels is not this company 's only objective ( paper pulp and timber are others ) , it sees such fuels as a big market .
Algae , too , are up for modification .
One problem with them is harvesting the oil they produce .
That means extracting them from their ponds , drying them out and breaking open their cells .
This process is so tedious that some companies are considering the idea of burning the dried algae in power stations instead .
One firm that is not is Synthetic Genomics , the latest venture of Craig Venter ( the man who led the privately funded version of the Human Genome Project ) .
Dr Venter hopes to overcome the oil - collection problem by genetic engineering .
Synthetic Genomics 's algae have been fitted with genes that create new secretion pathways through their outer membranes .
These cause the algal cells to expel the oil almost as soon as they have manufactured it .
It then floats to the surface of the pond , allowing it to be skimmed off like cream and turned into biodiesel .
The algae are also engineered to make more oil than their wild counterparts .
Harvesting useful fuels from vascular plants , as grasses , trees and their kind are known collectively , is a trickier business .
These plants are composed mainly of three types of large molecule .
Besides cellulose , there are hemicellulose and lignin .
Each is made of chains of smaller molecules , and all three are often bound together in a complex called lignocellulose , particularly in wood .
There are many ways these long - chain molecules might be turned into fuel , but all of these processes are more complex than for algae .
As chart 6 shows , turning sunlight into biofuel involves three steps , though different methods may miss out some of these steps .
Algae can make the leap from start to finish directly , whereas vascular plants cannot .
One way of dealing with them is to dry them and then heat them with little or no oxygen present .
This is called pyrolysis and , if done correctly , results in a mixture of carbon monoxide and hydrogen called “ syngas ” ( short for synthesis gas ) .
With suitable catalysts , syngas can be turned into fuel .
This is the approach taken by Choren Industries in Freiburg , Germany , and Range Fuels in Treutlen County , Georgia .
In both cases the feedstock is chippings and other leftovers from forestry and timber - mills .
Choren is making hydrocarbon diesel and Range ethanol .
Both factories , therefore , are steps on the road to making fuel from trees .
Syngas can also be turned into ethanol by bacteria of the genus Clostridium ( a group better known for the chemical used in botox treatment ) .
That is being done by Coskata , a firm based in Warrenville , Illinois .
General Motors ( GM ) likes this idea so much it has bought a share of the company .
An alternative to the syngas method is to break the cellulose and hemicellulose up into their component “ monomer ” molecules .
That is easier said than done , particularly if lignin is involved , since lignin is resistant to such conversion .
The amount of coal in the world is proof of its resilience .
Coal is composed mainly of lignin from plants that failed to decompose completely and were fossilised as a result .
Many firms , however , have developed enzymes that break down biomass in this way .
Iogen , of Ottawa , Canada , was one of the first .
Its enzymes decompose cellulose and hemicellulose into sugar monomers .
( The lignin is burned to generate heat for the process . )
Abengoa , a Spanish firm that is also involved in solar energy , uses this approach as well .
Sugar and spice
Once you have your sugar , you can ferment it .
These days that need not mean using yeast to make ethanol .
A whole range of bugs , some natural , some engineered , can now be deployed to make a whole range of products .
Amyris 's souped - up micro-organisms ( some are bacteria , some yeasts ) turn sugar not into ethanol but into isoprenoids , at a cost competitive with petroleum - based diesel .
LS9 , based near San Francisco , uses a similar method but is turning out alkanes ( for petrol ) and fatty acids ( for biodiesel ) .
It , too , is starting to scale up production .
Synthetic Genomics is doing something similar , though the firm is cagey about which fuel is being produced .
In each case , however , what is made is a chemical precisely tailored to its purpose , rather than the ad hoc mixture that comes out of a refinery .
The rival companies thus argue that their products are actually better than oil - based ones .
Illustration by Ian Whadcock
At least one firm , Mascoma , of Cambridge , Massachusetts , employs a single species of bug , Thermoanaerobacterium saccharolyticum , both to break down the biomass and to digest the resulting sugar .
Mascoma will use both grass and wood as feedstocks .
In May it signed deals with GM and Marathon Oil .
It is also possible to use purified enzymes to do the conversion from sugar to fuel , as well as from biomass to sugar , and at least two firms are working on applying them to the whole process .
Codexis , based in Redwood City , California , has created a range of enzymes by a method akin to sexual reproduction and natural selection .
Last year it signed a deal with Shell to use this technique to produce biofuels of various types .
And a Danish firm , Danisco , has teamed up with DuPont to do the same thing with its own proprietary enzymes .
Shell is also involved in a project to turn sugar into hydrocarbons , this time by straight chemical processing .
It is putting up the money .
The technology ( the most important part of which is a set of proprietary non-biological catalysts ) is provided by Virent Energy systems , of Madison , Wisconsin .
Which of these approaches will work best is anybody 's guess .
But their sheer number is proof that the most radical thinking in the field of renewable energy is going on in biofuels .
It is in this area that the most unexpected breakthroughs are likely to come , says Steven Koonin , BP 's chief scientist .
BP is backing one of the biggest academic projects intended to look into biofuels , the Energy Biosciences Institute ( EBI ) , to the tune of $ 500 m , which suggests that the company 's board agrees with him .
The EBI is a partnership of the University of California , Berkeley , the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory and the University of Illinois .
One of the people involved , Steven Chu , the head of the Lawrence Berkeley laboratory , is a man with a grand vision .
This vision is of a “ glucose economy ” that will replace the existing oil economy .
Glucose , the most common monomer sugar , would be turned into fuels and maybe even the bio-equivalents of petrochemicals — bioplastics , for example — in local factories and then shipped around the world .
That would be a boon to tropical countries , where photosynthesis is at its most rampant , though it might not play so well to James Woolsey 's security fears , since it risks replacing one set of unreliable suppliers with another .
However , there is plenty of biomass to go around .
A study by America 's Departments of Energy and Agriculture suggests that even with only small changes to existing practice , 1.3 billion tonnes of plant matter could be collected from American soil without affecting food production .
If this were converted into ethanol using the best technology available today , it would add up to the equivalent of 350 billion litres of petrol , or 65 % of the country 's current petrol consumption .
And that is before specially bred energy crops and other technological advances are taken into account .
If America wants it , biofuel autarky looks more achievable than the oil - based sort .
And if it does not , then the world 's hitherto impoverished tropics may find themselves in the middle of an unexpected and welcome industrial revolution .

The state of Texas leads the nation in throwing money at sex-education programs that preach abstinence , the
has reported -- $ 17 million in state funds and $ 3 million of your Texas tax dollars .
( As we 've noted
, HISD says it does n't keep track " centrally " of how much it spends on abstinence programs ; it 's done only on a school - by - school basis that apparently is impossible to track .
Or at least impossible to track when you 'd rather not talk about the subject . )
Amazingly , Texas ' policy of teaching only " DON'T DO IT !!!!
EVER !!! " does n't seem to be working .
A recent federal study showed that 53 percent of Texas high schoolers had had intercourse , compared to 48 percent nationally .
Teaching kids abstinence is n't working ?
Sounds impossible .
( In Bizarro World , anyway . )
We 've prepared a highly scientific chart that explains the situation .

The last shall be first and the first shall be last Jesus of Nazareth Nobel Laureate Buckminster Fuller�s introduction to his Critical Path is titled , Twilight of the World�s Power Structures .
Published in 1981 , Fuller�s book predicted the end of the world�s power structures during a process where humanity would undergo a crisis of unprecedented proportions .
In 1991 , the Soviet Union and communism collapsed and now with the severe contraction in credit markets , capitalism is in similarly deep trouble ; and .
Fuller�s 1981 prediction about the demise of the world�s power structures certainly cannot be good news for those who attended the 56th Bilderberg meeting held June 5 - 8 in Chantilly , VA .
The Bilderberger are believed by many to be the world�s ruling elite , those who determine the world�s direction �at least the western world�s , as attendees are overwhelmingly from Europe and the US ( Europe 2:1 US ) .
In truth , however , the majority of attendees at the Bilderberger meetings are not the ruling elites but their minions �the well paid servants of money and power who toil 24/7 on their behalf , the bankers and corporate CEOs who shepherd the collective wealth of their masters , thereby gaining position and power for themselves in the process .
This fact , however , should not take away from their considerable influence in today�s world .
That world , however , is today in a highly precarious state ; for , if Fuller�s prediction is true , the Bilderberger�s world is now about to collapse .
MARSHALL THURBER�S CHECKERBOARD GAME Marshall Thurber who was a close friend of Buckminster Fuller recently unveiled his new Checkerboard Game at the Positive Deviant Network ( the PDN www.posdev.net ) .
A gamesmeister whose Blocks Game ( which literally �melts � the right / left brain into a unified state ) is the foundation of his long - running Money & You seminar ( now taught internationally including China ) , Thurber�s new Checkerboard Game reveals the dynamics behind the formation of financial and power elites .
The setting itself was rather extraordinary .
The Positive Deviant Network was in Dunkirk NY to view one of four prisons where PDN member Dr. Cherie Clark ( who received her PhD based on her study of Buckminster Fuller�s principles of Synergistics ) co-heads Shock Incarceration http://www.ncjrs.gov/pdffiles/shockny.pdf , a course based on Buckminster Fuller�s principles , the 12 step addiction program and superlearning techniques ( 80 % of Shock Incarceration graduates starting with an average of 5th grade education receive their GEDs ( high - school equivalency ) in 6 months with 12 hours of classroom time per week ) .
Where the average prison program lasts only 2 - 3 years , Shock Incarceration is now in its 21st year after having successfully graduated 37,000 inmates , significantly lowered New York State �s recidivism rates , saved the state of New York over $ 1 billion dollars and transformed countless lives in the process ( Dr. Clark is also the president of Doing Life International , http://www.doinglife.com/company.html).
The connection between The Checkerboard Game and Shock Incarceration was obvious .
The creation of financial elites such as the Bilderbergers creates a world where elites continue to coalesce financial and political power at the expense of others .
The rich get richer and the poor now go to prison .
The Checkerboard Game and Shock Incarceration reflect that simple but increasingly ubiquitous truth .
If you have the chance to play The Checkerboard Game you should do so .
And if you �re ever incarcerated by the state of New York and have a chance to take Shock Incarceration ( the US is now the world�s # 1 jailor so your odds are increasing ) the same advice holds .
Buckminster Fuller�s influence in both is obvious .
THE BILDERBERGERS & THE PAPER BOYS
A fortune composed of paper is like a house built on sand
At the very same time the Positive Deviant Network was meeting in northern New York in early June , the Bilderbergers were meeting in northern Virginia ; and , while the PDN was looking at ways to alleviate the problems of the powerless , the Bilderbergers were looking at ways to extend the power of the already powerful .
In attendance at the Bilderberg meeting were Ben Bernanke , the Chairman of the Federal Reserve System , Henry Paulson , the US Secretary of the Treasury , Timothy Geither , President and CEO of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York , Jean - Claude Trichet , President of the European Central Bank , and Robert Zoellick , President of the World Bank .
It is no coincidence that so many high ranking �public servants � were openly attending a private meeting of the western world�s financial elites .
Public servants in name only , public bankers are the handmaidens of the private elites , and in so doing serve their own interests as well .
It is also no coincidence that bankers play such a prominent role in the affairs of the Bilderbergers , the western power elite .
Prior to the introduction of the bankers � debt - based money in England in 1694 , the east and the west were �separate but equal� .
The bankers , however , were to significantly change that dynamic .
After central banking was introduced by the Bank of England , the relationship between the east and west shifted dramatically .
England in its Faustian pact with the bankers was able to fund its navy and military with debt - based money and in a version of national gang violence , sic imperialism , imposed its will on much of the world .
The 18th , 19th , and 20th centuries reflected this great shift in power .
The 21st century , however , will not .
By the end of the 19th century , England �s time as the preeminent world power had run its course .
In 1870 , England �s balance of trade went negative and its Treasury had increasing difficulty in paying the enormous bills of the British Navy and the bankers took careful note of this turn of events .
So , in 1913 , the European bankers extended their operations to the US via the creation of the Federal Reserve System , the US version of the Bank of England�s central bank .
The Federal Reserve System , a consortium of private European and American banks , would issue the same debt - based money in America as had the Bank of England in Britain and the bankers would continue their power and influence in America as they had in England and Europe .
Now , however , in the 21st century , America �s run at the table of fortune is coming to an end as did England �s one century before .
In 1970 , America �s balance of trade went negative ( as did England �s in the 1870s ) and again like England , its military budget would consume more and more of its national wealth .
In 2008 , the world of the Bilderbergers is now suddenly and unexpectedly threatened .
The western power base built on the foundation of central banking has encountered an unexpected problem .
The debt - based western world of the Bildebergers has now collided head - on with the savings - based world of the east .
CAPITALISM IS NOT COMMERCE THE COIN OF THE REALM BECOMES THE CON OF THE REALM Capitalism is the description of the wholesale introduction of credit into the world of commerce .
Prior to the introduction of the Bank of England�s debt - based money , the words �banker � and �capitalism � did not even exist .
The previous description of banking was �money - lending� , an avocation made possible by the charging of interest on the lending of gold .
The utterly brilliant ascent of the money - lenders was made possible by their pact with government , first with King William of England , wherein private bankers would be allowed to issue public currency on which they could charge interest just as they had previously with gold �and government could then spend whatever it wished of the public�s money , usually on war .
The advantages are obvious , at least to the bankers and governments .
Over time , however , the credit based �money � turns into debt on which compounding interest is levied .
In this system , time is the enemy as time compounds debts as well as the amount of paper money causing a continual debasing of previously issued currency .
THE MORE PAPER MONEY PRINTED THE LESS ITS VALUE
The ultimate seduction of credit lies in its ability to deceive the debtor into believing that it is real money he or she has .
It is not .
Credit and debt are two sides of the same coin , albeit a coin of highly dubious origin .
The two - sided coin of credit and debt was substituted for gold and silver in an arrangement that served bankers and government , not producers and savers ; and , much to the chagrin of the Bilderbergers and their bankers , the rest of the world , sic producers and savers , are now beginning to catch on to this increasingly obvious truth .
The recent rapid rise in the price of oil is a reflection of the intention of oil producers to no longer automatically trade their limited supply of oil for an unlimited and continually devaluing supply of paper money .
The current volatility in the price of gold and silver is a reflection of the death throes of the Bilderberger�s regime of paper money .
No paper money system has ever lasted , all have ended in failure and disaster and this present system will end the same way �no matter what efforts are exerted on the behalf of paper money .
IT�S YOUR CHOICE PAPER , GOLD , OR SILVER
It was the bankers of the west that invented this game of charades where credit and debt masquerade as money .
It is a charade that has lasted three hundred years .
All games end , however , and this game is ending now , gratis of the universe whose intelligent hand Buckminster Fuller saw everywhere , even in our mistakes .
Bucky maintained that mistakes are an integral part of learning ( see Fuller�s Mistake Mystique , see http://www.flighttogenius.com/mm_ebook.pdf ) ,
Fuller maintained that the universe evolves by mistakes , learning ever more as it does so �and that includes mankind �no matter how dissociated our minds think we are from the originating phenomena of life .
In early June , as we in the Positive Deviant Network walked through Lakeview Prison in Dunkirk , NY , we saw a slogan prominently painted on a wall .
In that prison , especially , its truth was obvious : LEARNING IS HAPPENING
And , so it is .
It is a lesson the bankers and the Bilderbergers will soon understand .
POWER IS NO MORE CONTROL THAN CREDIT IS MONEY Note II : I will be speaking at Professor Antal E. Fekete�s Session IV of Gold Standard University Live ( GSUL ) July 3 - 6 , 2008 in Szombathely , Hungary .
If you are interested in monetary matters and gold , the opportunity to hear Professor Fekete should not be missed .
A perusal of Professor Fekete�s topics may convince you to attend ( see http://www.professorfekete.com/gsul.asp ) .
Professor Fekete , in my opinion , is a giant in a time of small men .

Only a small number of Palestinians have been allowed through the border
Egyptian border police have used water cannon to stop thousands of Palestinians from forcing their way over the border from the Gaza Strip .
The Palestinians threw rocks at troops , who have allowed only a small number of people through the crossing since temporarily re-opening it on Tuesday .
The opening was intended to help those stranded or needing medical treatment .
Gaza has been under a tight Israeli blockade for a year , since the militant Hamas movement took control .
The Egyptian authorities are sending reinforcements to the Rafah crossing and are threatening a total closure , according to unnamed security sources , quoted by Reuters news agency .
Cement delivery
Earlier , Israel reopened three goods border crossings with Gaza , a day after it closed them in response to a Palestinian rocket attack .
Israeli military officials said five truck - loads of cement would be allowed into Gaza during the day - the first such delivery for a year .
About 26 sick Palestinians would also be taken to Israel for medical treatment , officials said .
Israel and Palestinian militants who control Gaza have accused each other of breaking a truce agreed in June .
During that time , rocket fire at nearby Israeli towns by Palestinian militants has decreased , although there have been just a handful of attacks since the truce .
Since the blockade , Israel has only allowed in goods for humanitarian purposes , which has prevented any rebuilding of Gaza 's war - torn infrastructure .
Every once in a while , an article gets posted somewhere in the blogosphere about how Microsoft needs to release a complete Windows rewrite , something along the lines of what Apple did with Mac OS X .
Most people realize that Microsoft is in no position to pull a stunt like that at the moment ; it 's hard to see Microsoft phasing out support for a billion - Windows - PC - strong user base , but that day may one day come , perhaps thanks to robust virtualization technology .
But in the meantime , Microsoft has settled on rewriting bits and parts of the Windows operating system as it sees fit , with Vista being one of the biggest rewrites ( a fact which partially explains the many hardware and software compatibility issues XP 's successor experienced at launch ) .
Speculation around a non-Windows operating system in the works at Microsoft has been present for years , but recent trustworthy tidbits of information have found their way into the hands of Microsoft ZDNet bloggers Mary Jo Foley and Ed Bott .
First , let 's look at similar projects .
MinWin , the slimmed - down Windows core was first shown at a demo last year that briefly discussed how Microsoft was optimizing the aging NT kernel .
Singularity , on the other hand , is an experimental microkernel and operating system project started in 2003 for which Microsoft posted the source code back in March .
Unfortunately for those interested in a complete rewrite , Singularity was developed exclusively for research purposes and is not intended for practical use .
Codename Midori ( I wish Microsoft named it " Doors " instead ) is a derivative of Singularity that is meant to supersede Windows , and it is more than just a research project .
Still , it is not ready to be previewed and it definitely has not got anything to do with Windows 7 .
Microsoft has put aside substantial resources and has put many bright people behind the project , which is headed by Eric Rudder , but other than that , very little is known .
If it ever does debut , it will probably become available some time before CEO Steve Ballmer retires , nine or so years from now .
According to Foley , one theory is that Midori is another " Cairo " attempt , Microsoft 's object - oriented operating system that never saw the light of day .
Foley expects Midori to look more like Windows than anything else , and that really is n't much of a surprise : if application compatibility goes out the door , Microsoft needs to at least maintain some sort of user interface familiarity .
Bott , on the other hand , believes that Midori wo n't be replacing Windows at all , and instead will exist alongside the world 's most popular operating system .
Bott looks at some Windows history to conclude that Midori will likely debut as something along the lines of Windows NT back in 1993 : a complete rewrite that took years to adopt because Microsoft made sure that new versions of both Windows and Windows NT were released .
Bott gives three possibilities for where Midori might be used : special - purpose computers such as those that currently run Windows Media Center or Windows Home Server , virtual server machines , and high - performance workstations .
Either way , the Windows platform as we know it today should remain untouched ; Windows 7 's successor is not going to be Midori .
What 's your take :
If Midori does indeed arrive one day , what approach makes the most sense for Microsoft ?

By Stephen Leahy
FORT LAUDERDALE , U.S. , Jul 10 ( IPS ) –
One third of reef - building corals already face extinction because of climate change , the first - ever global assessment has found .
Reefs are made up of hundreds of coral species , and a two - year study to determine the current status of corals has discovered that 231 of the 704 species assessed will be “ red- listed ” Thursday .
This means these 231 species meet the International Union for Conservation of Nature ( IUCN ) Red List Criteria for species at risk of extinction in the near future .
Previously , only 10 species of corals had been red-listed , mainly because no proper assessment had been done before .
“ We were not expecting the numbers to be that high , ” said Suzanne Livingstone of the IUCN ’s Global Marine Species Assessment ( GMSA ) in Norfolk , Virginia .
The paper was published Thursday in Science .
If the same assessment of corals had been done 20 years ago , only 13 of the 704 species would have been red-listed , Livingstone told IPS at the 11th International Coral Reef Symposium ( ICRS ) in Fort Lauderdale , Florida .
However , in that short time span , climate change has warmed the oceans and begun to make them more acidic and corals are suffering .
“ It ’s frightening when you think about it , ” she said .
Coral reefs are often called the rainforests of the oceans for the richness of species they harbour , representing 25 to 30 percent of all marine species .
Millions of people , including many in developing countries , derive their livelihoods from fishing , while around 2.6 billion people get their protein from seafood , according to studies done by the United Nations Environment Programme ( UNEP ) .
Coral reefs also help mitigate beach erosion and have high recreation value for tourism .
UNEP estimates that a typical coral reef can absorb up to 90 percent of the energy of wind - generated waves , thus protecting coastal areas from damage .
The economic value of reefs globally is estimated at 375 billion dollars , Brian Huse , executive director of the Coral Reef Alliance , a U.S. - based NGO dedicated to protecting the health of coral reefs , told IPS in a previous interview .
“ When corals die off , so do the other plants and animals that depend on coral reefs for food and shelter , and this can lead to the collapse of entire ecosystems , ” said Kent Carpenter , lead author of the Science article , GMSA Director , IUCN Species Programme .
The rate at which corals are approaching extinction is far faster than any previous extinction event in Earth ’s history , Carpenter told IPS .
“ It ’s the most alarming finding for biodiversity in the marine realm , ” he said , adding that only amphibians are at greater risk , also due to climate change .
Staghorn corals face the highest risk of extinction , with 52 percent of species listed in a threatened category .
The Caribbean region has the highest number of highly threatened corals ( endangered and critically endangered ) , including the iconic elkhorn coral ( Acropora palmata ) which is listed as critically endangered .
The high biodiversity “ Coral Triangle ” in the western Pacific ’s Indo - Malay - Philippine Archipelago has the highest proportions of vulnerable and near - threatened species in the Indo - Pacific , largely resulting from the high concentration of people living in many parts of the region .
Not all of the world ’s 845 reef - building corals could be assessed .
Carpenter says there was n’t enough data to evaluate how 141 species are doing .
While climate change is the primary global threat because it warms ocean temperatures beyond corals ’ heat tolerance , pollution and overfishing are also major stressors that amplify and accelerate the impact .
Another problem for corals is ocean acidification .
However , since scientists only recently discovered that carbon emissions from burning of fossil fuels are turning the oceans more acidic , it has n’t been fully assessed in this study , said Livingstone .
“ Ultimately it is a combination of all these impacts on corals , ” she said .
12 years ago I blogged about …
Yesterday , I got an unexpected package from Google .
It contained a “ thank you ” letter , a Polo - Shirt and a USB card reader .
The whole story began a few weeks ago , when I had a call on my answering machine and a mail in my inbox from the legal department of Google Germany .
A Google lawyer asked me if he could talk with me on the phone .
I immediately wrote him back and we talked later that day .
It turned out the whole thing was about my gBrain extension for Firefox .
He was very friendly , and explained that he was contacted by the guys in Mountain View , asking him , if he could ask me if I could stop distributing it .
Talk about bureaucracy .
g Brain is a Firefox extension to automagically bookmark all pages you visit at the Google bookmark service .
This effectively moves your browser history from your browser instance to a central place on the net ( Google ) where it is easily searchable from every computer .
I had n't think to long about that request , because
I did not use the extension my self anymore
It was n't very popular either
Google could have blocked it them self easily instead of asking me
So I agreed to abandon it , but my curiosity was aroused .
I asked him about the exact problem with extension , but him being just the message bearer had no idea .
But he offered to ask a Google engineer to contact me .
I did not really expect it , but the next day I got a call from Jeffrey Korn at Google California .
He explained that he was the one responsible for building the Google Bookmarks and Google Web History tools .
The problem with my extension was something I had n't imagined : a scaling problem .
Hehe , Google had scaling problems .
The gBrain extension creates a lot of bookmarks .
Several thousands a month .
And the Google bookmarks system was never made with this amount in mind .
What made things worse ( and I did n't knew that ) , the bookmarks are connected to the normal web search .
Whenever you use the web search , it checks it against your Google bookmarks .
You can easily imagine what problems can come up when you have a several 10 or even 100 thousands of bookmarks …
Jeffery also made a few suggestions how the extension could be changed to make use of their Web history service instead of the bookmarks system .
This would avoid the scaling problems .
I may consider it some day .
But why am I telling this ?
Because I 'm amazed how Google handled this .
Instead of just blocking my extension at their side , or sending me a cease and desist letter1 ) they contacted me and asked .
This is more than you can expect from many other corporations .
Even after the whole thing was resolved , they had one of their engineers call me to explain the whole thing .
Well … and a few weeks later I even good a nice present .
Thanks Google .
IT almost seems like a gag worthy of “ Borat ” : A smooth - talking rookie senator with an exotic name passes himself off as the incumbent American president to credulous foreigners .
But to dismiss Barack Obama ’s magical mystery tour through old Europe and two war zones as a media - made fairy tale would be to underestimate the ingenious politics of the moment .
History was on the march well before Mr. Obama boarded his plane , and his trip was perfectly timed to reap the whirlwind .
He never would have been treated as a president - in - waiting by heads of state or network talking heads if all he offered were charisma , slick rhetoric and stunning visuals .
What drew them instead was the raw power Mr. Obama has amassed : the power to start shaping events and the power to move markets , including TV ratings .
( Even “ Access Hollywood ” mustered a 20 percent audience jump by hosting the Obama family . )
Power begets more power , absolutely .
The growing Obama clout derives not from national polls , where his lead is modest .
Nor is it a gift from the press , which still gives free passes to its old bus mate John McCain .
It was laughable to watch journalists stamp their feet last week to try to push Mr. Obama into saying he was “ wrong ” about the surge .
More than five years and 4,100 American fatalities later , they ’re still not demanding that Mr. McCain admit he was wrong when he assured us that our adventure in Iraq would be fast , produce little American “ bloodletting ” and “ be paid for by the Iraqis . ”
Never mind .
This election remains about the present and the future , where Iraq ’s $ 10 billion a month drain on American pocketbooks and military readiness is just one moving part in a matrix of national crises stretching from the gas pump to Pakistan .
That ’s the high - rolling political casino where Mr. Obama amassed the chips he cashed in last week .
The “ change ” that he can at times wield like a glib marketing gimmick is increasingly becoming a substantive reality  sometimes through Mr. Obama ’s instigation , sometimes by luck .
Obama - branded change is snowballing , whether it ’s change you happen to believe in or not .
But if you think that the sweet dust of artificial sweetener mixed into your food and drinks is safe and does n’t carry any health risk , then you ’re seriously mistaken .
Sold under the leading brands Equal and NutraSweet , aspartame is armed not just with its marketing charms , but also with the slick maneuverings of the multi-billion artificial sweetener industry and government agencies that often fail to walk their talk of consumer safety .
With hopes of striking a responsive chord , I ’d like to tell you today : “ Sweet ” is n’t all there is to aspartame and these artificial sweeteners entering your body .
Aspartame Failed To Win FDA Favor For 20 years ; What Finally Led To Its Approval ?
Discovered by chemist James M. Schlatter in 1965 by pure accident , aspartame and its intrigue - laced approval tells many a tale about corporate America , the contingent blessings brought by the cyclamate and saccharin bans , and the arbiters of government power .
This report will enable you to shun the myths on aspartame ’s approval and to know the dirty political and regulatory tricks in the whole approval process .
For 20 years , the FDA gave aspartame products the thumbs down mainly for the following safety issues and reasons :
Flawed data
High cholesterol levels
Fluid loss in your body
But pharmaceutical giant G.D. Searle – the makers of the NutraSweet and Equal
brands – did not back down and knew that all it took was flexing political muscle .
Read about how Donald Rumsfeld , the same powerful political figure in the Bush administration , proved instrumental in the FDA approval of aspartame in 1981 and the political appointments leading to it .
But more than these , the deceptive studies on aspartame safety are already a distressing truth in themselves .
Yes , there are alarming animal lab testing results ( and lack of testimony for safe human use ) that you are yet to know about aspartame ...
Did you know that ...?
Aspartame Can Sabotage Your Weight Loss Efforts !
If you ’re trying to shed the extra pounds and you happen to make a trip to the supermarket , you might have to be more wary of picking out products marketed as “ reduced calorie , ” “ sugar - free , ” and “ diet , ” thus containing aspartame or other artificial sweeteners .
Get this free report and know more about how aspartame and its components are possibly instructing your body to store fat and bringing down your serotonin levels , blocking the road to weight loss .
What They Fail – Or Downright Refuse – To Tell You About Aspartame
Artificial sweeteners have been hailed as the savior of diabetics and those with persistent weight - loss efforts .
Part of the first generation of these is aspartame , which is 180 times sweeter than sugar .
As of 2008 , more than 6,000 products , consumed by over 100 million worldwide , contain aspartame .
They include the following :
Carbonated softdrinks
Chewable vitamins
Sugar - free cough drops
Tabletop sweeteners
Yogurt
Most people think that they already know these “ healthy , ” aspartame - based products like the back of their hands .
Truth is – and an ugly one at that – there are scientifically backed evidences and lab results showing the dangers and unproven safety of aspartame use .
The deceased lab animals tested for aspartame safety can vouch for this : tumors have developed in animal bodies , which were misleadingly rendered as “ normal swelling ” in the FDA - published report by Jerome Bressler in August 1977 .
Human reports to FDA , too , have associated aspartame to minor adverse reactions and life - threatening conditions that include :
Migraines
Change in vision
Nausea and vomiting
Insomnia / sleep problems
Abdominal and joint pains
Change in heart rate
Depression
Memory loss
Seizure
Brain cancer
More than these complaints to the FDA , there are also around 10,000 documented reports of aspartame side effects and over 900 published studies on the health hazards .
And there ’s more you ’d be thankful to know !
There 's More You 'd Care To Know About Aspartame
I ’m long been alarmed about aspartame and artificial sweeteners in general , but also brimming with so much hope that good information can reach you early .
There are more that you ’ll discover in this free report , including :
Adobe , Google and Yahoo are about to make it easier to build rich multimedia websites in the Flash file format ( SWF ) without sacrificing any “ Google juice ” ( and , um , whatever the Yahoo equivalent is ) .
Both search engines have been developing ways to fully index Flash content without requiring any extra effort from a website owner .
Previously , search engines indexed the “ static ” text and links on a site , falling far short of capturing all the content .
“ It ’s like reading the index of a book , rather than the book itself , ” says Justin Everett - Church , a senior product manager for Flash .
Now , Google and Yahoo will read the whole darn book — namely , they ’ll use web crawlers to play through all of a Flash website ’s possible “ states , ” and make that content available through their search results .
The previous “ invisibility ” of much Flash content to search engines has been a complaint from Flash developers and site owners , Everett - Church says .
Bill Hunt of advertising company Ogilvy tells me this move will particularly benefit “ big brand ” companies like jewelery maker Tiffany & Co. , which has built a fancy shopping website in Flash .
Until now , much of the site ’s content , such as individual product pages , was invisible to search engines — they could only be seen by navigating the site itself , and would n’t turn up in Google searches .
For example , it ’s less - than - ideal that the top Google result when you search for “ Tiffany gold ring ” is overstockjeweler.com , rather than the Tiffany website .
This may be an even more significant announcement for businesses that have considered building Flash websites , but did n’t want to sacrifice their search rankings — now , if Google and Yahoo live up to their promises , no one will have to make that choice , removing one of Flash ’s big drawbacks .
Everett - Church says that Google has already started tweaking its search results , while Yahoo ’s development is a little further behind .
Both companies are seriously pursuing this integration , he says , but I ca n’t help noticing that for now , this is yet another advantage that Google has over Yahoo .
It ’s hardly a huge setback , but it ’s not like Yahoo has much ground left to lose .
Vaginal microbicides currently in clinical trials may be the only weapon that will protect women against infection from HIV .
Yet , under likely circumstances , these microbicides may be of more benefit to men than women , according to a new UCLA AIDS Institute study .
The study , which used novel mathematical models to simulate clinical trials and population - level transmission of HIV , appears July 7 in the online issue of Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences .
" At the moment , there is absolutely nothing that women can do to protect themselves from HIV -- condoms are not in women 's control , " said senior study author Sally Blower , professor of psychiatry and biobehavioral sciences at the Semel Institute for Neuroscience and Human Behavior at UCLA and a member of the UCLA AIDS Institute .
" Drug companies are developing vaginal microbicides to provide direct protection to women and basically empower them so women have some preventive measure that 's under their control . "
Microbicides are compounds that can be applied inside the vagina to protect against HIV and other sexually transmitted diseases .
Pharmaceutical companies are currently conducting trials of second - generation microbicides that are based on antiretroviral , or ARV , drugs , Blower noted .
The UCLA study raises concerns that microbicides could lead to drug resistance if they are used by HIV - positive women and that this risk may be masked under current clinical trial designs -- necessitating significant caution if the microbicides are licensed for use by the general public .
The researchers developed the mathematical models to determine if ARV - based microbicides that could cause moderate to high levels of drug resistance might pass clinical trials .
They used epidemiological , clinical and behavioral data to construct models for both clinical trials and heterosexual transmission of HIV .
advertisement
The models were based on the Phase 3 clinical trial for second - generation microbicides now under way in South Africa , Tanzania , Rwanda and Belgium .
This trial is a 12 - month , placebo - controlled study involving 10,000 participants .
The researchers developed simulations for two scenarios : one for high - risk microbicides , in which there is a high probability that the vagina will absorb dapivirine , the ARV drug in the microbicide ; the other for low - risk microbicides , with a low probability of absorption .
The team created the two scenarios because it is not currently known if ARV - based microbicides will be low - or high - risk .
The researchers found that men would likely benefit more than women if the microbicides ' efficacy for women was less than 50 percent and if adherence was less than 60 percent .
This would occur if HIV - positive women used microbicides and developed drug - resistant strains of HIV that are then less likely to be transmitted to men .
In the high - risk scenario , for instance , the microbicide could prevent infection in up to 21 percent of women and up to 27 percent of men .
In the low - risk scenario , the microbicide would be of less benefit , preventing infection in up to 17 percent of women and 18 percent of men .
" The antiretroviral drugs within these microbicides are the same as those used to treat people who are infected with HIV , so there is great expectation that these microbicides will be very effective , " said first author Dr. David Wilson , of the National Centre in HIV Epidemiology and Clinical Research at Australia 's University of New South Wales .

" But the concern is that these microbicides are going to lead to drug resistance , " he said .
The concern about drug resistance arises from the fact that women in the current clinical trial are being tested once a month for HIV infection and those found to be infected are dropped from the trial , according to researchers .
" Since monthly testing will take place in the dapivirine trial , we predict that few , if any , cases of acquired resistance will arise during the trial , even if the drug is readily absorbed ( i.e. , the microbicide is high risk ) , " the researchers write .
" Therefore our analyses have shown that high - risk microbicides could pass Phase III trials , as their potential to cause resistance will be masked by frequent testing . "
Other authors of the study are Paul Coplan , of the University of Pennsylvania School of Medicine , and Mark Wainberg , of McGill University 's AIDS Centre at Montreal 's Jewish General Hospital .
The International Partnership for Microbicides , the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases , and the Australian Research Council funded this study .
In 1762 , Bishop Robert Lowth did a grave disservice to the English language when he published his Short Introduction to English Grammar .
Rather than basing his grammatical rules in the usage of the best educated speakers and writers of English , he arbitrarily chose to base them on the Latin grammatical system .
The result is that many modern usages in English , particularly an alarming number of rules of normative usage and Standard Written English , are based upon those false origins .
These very rules continue to plague us to this day as they are still used as the foundation of many modern school English curriculums .
And so , with this list , I hope to finally put an end to many of these foolish rules .

10 Between is for two only
The “ tween ” portion of “ between ” is a reference to the number 2 , but the Oxford English Dictionary says this : “ In all senses , between has , from its earliest appearance , been extended to more than two . ”
Many pedants try to enforce the use of “ among ” when speaking of groups larger than two .
Even the pickiest speaker does not naturally say , “ A treaty has been negotiated among England , France , and Germany . ”
9 Till versus ’til
Because ’til looks like an abbreviation for “ until ” , some people believe that this word should always be spelt ’ til ( some do n’t object to leaving off the apostrophe ) .
However , “ till ” has been in regular use in English for over 800 years , longer than ’til .
It is completely correct English to say “ till ” .
8 Persuade versus convince
Some people have the strange belief that you must “ persuade ” someone to “ convince ” them , but you cannot “ convince ” a person .
In fact , persuade is a synonym ( means the same thing ) for convince – and this usage goes back to the 16th century .
It can mean both to attempt to convince , and to succeed in convincing .
It is not common anymore to say things like “ I am persuaded that you are an idiot ” – though this is also correct English .
7 Healthy versus healthful
While it is admittedly logical and traditional to make the distinction between these two words , but phrases such as “ part of a healthy breakfast ” have become so common nowadays that they can not be considered wrong ( except by pedants ) .
It is also interesting to note that in English , adjectives connected to a sensation in the viewer ( such as happy ) are often transferred to the object or event they are viewing , for example : “ a happy coincidence ” or “ a gloomy landscape ” .
6 Off of
For most Americans , the natural thing to say is “ Climb down off of [ pronounced “ offa ” ] that horse , Tex , with your hands in the air ” ; but many U.K. authorities urge that the “ of ” should be omitted as redundant .
Where British English reigns you may want to omit the “ of ” as superfluous , but common usage in the U.S. has rendered “ off of ” so standard as to generally pass unnoticed , though some American authorities also discourage it in formal writing .
But if “ onto ” makes sense , so does “ off of . ”
However , “ off of ” meaning “ from ” in phrases like “ borrow five dollars off of Clarice ” is definitely nonstandard .
It is also quite common in New Zealand to use “ off of ” as well – presumably as a result of the English being spoken in the Empire at the time of New Zealand ’s founding .
5 None : singular or plural ?
Some people insist that since “ none ” is derived from “ no one ” it should always be singular : “ none of us is having dessert . ”
However , in standard usage , the word is most often treated as a plural .
“ None of us are having dessert ” is perfectly fine .
I spent many days debating this point with my Ancient Greek tutor via email quotations of its use as a plural ( my tutor believed it to be singular only ) .
Neither of us could convince the other but I firmly stand by my belief that it can be used as both plural and singular .
????!
4 Who and That
There are actually many instances in which the conservative usage is to refer to a person using “ that ” rather than “ who ” : “ All the politicians that were at the party later denied even knowing the host ” .
This phrase is actually more traditional than “ politicians who ” .
It appears that this issue has sprung mostly from the politically correct idea that it is demeaning to refer to a person as “ that ” rather than “ who ” .
In some sentences it is clearly better to use “ that ” : “ She is the only person I know of that prefers whipped cream on her cereal . ”
And in the following case , it would be ridiculous to use “ that ” for “ who ” : “ Who was it that said , ‘ A woman without a man is like a fish without a bicycle ’ ? ”
3 Sentence Starting with a Conjunction
It offends those who wish to confine English usage in a logical straitjacket that writers often begin sentences with “ and ” or “ but . ”
True , one should be aware that many such sentences would be improved by becoming clauses in compound sentences ; but there are many effective and traditional uses for beginning sentences in this way .
One example is the reply to a previous assertion in a dialogue : “ But , my dear Watson , the criminal obviously wore expensive boots or he would not have taken such pains to scrape them clean . ”
It would be wise to make it a rule to consider whether your conjunction would sound more natural in the previous sentence or whether it would lose its emphasis by being demoted from its place at the start of a new sentence .
2 Sentence Ending in a Preposition
If you want to keep the crusty old - timers happy , try to avoid ending written sentences ( and clauses ) with prepositions , such as to , with , from , at , and in .
Instead of writing “ The topics we want to write on , ” where the preposition on ends the clause , consider “ The topics on which we want to write . ”
Prepositions should usually go before ( pre-position ) the words they modify .
On the other hand , if a sentence is more graceful with a final preposition , leave it that way .
For instance , “ He gave the public what it longed for ” is clear and idiomatic , even though it ends with a preposition ; “ He gave the public that for which it longed ” avoids the problem but does n’t look like English .
A sentence becomes unnecessarily obscure when it is filled with “ from whoms ” and “ with whiches ” .
The famous witticism usually attributed to Winston Churchill makes the point well : “ This is the sort of English up with which I will not put . ”
1 Split Infinitives
For the hyper-critical , “ to boldly go where no man has gone before ” should be “ to go boldly … ”
It is good to be aware that inserting one or more words between “ to ” and a verb is not strictly speaking an error , and is often more expressive and graceful than moving the intervening words elsewhere ; but so many people are offended by split infinitives that it is probably better to avoid them except when the alternatives sound strained and awkward .
There are some very obvious times that the split infinitive is far superior :
Murders are expected to more than double next year .
( split infinitive )
Murders are expected more than to double next year .
( intact infinitive )
However , you could say : “ Murders are expected to increase by more than double next year ” – but there is absolutely nothing wrong with the split infinitive example above .

Progressive taxation , no matter how much one might be opposed to it , is simply qualitatively different than the elimination of private ownership of the means of production .
Government regulation , even if it interferes with the economy , is not the equivalent of total nationalization of the economy .
These are not minor distinctions , but fundamental to the very definition of what Soviet Communism was , and why it had the outcomes it did .
The attempt to tie Democrats and liberals ( the latter of which was a term of abuse within the Soviet political structure ) is incredibly ignorant of the actual history and structure of Soviet Communism .

Bats are dying off by the thousands as they hibernate in caves and mines around New York and Vermont , sending researchers scrambling to find the cause of a mysterious condition dubbed " white - nose syndrome . "
STRANGE MARKINGS , BEHAVIORS STRANGE MARKINGS , BEHAVIORS
" We really do n't know what is killing these large numbers of bats , " says biologist Jacques Veilleux of Franklin Pierce University in Rindge , N.H. " All we have are symptoms . "
He says that chiefly they are :
White fungus on the wings of almost all the affected bats and on the faces of about half .
Emaciation of the body - fat stores that bats typically live off of during hibernation .
Clusters of hibernating bats migrating oddly close to cave entrances during winter .
Starving bats leaving caves during the day in the winter .
Biologists are stumped by a plague that has killed tens of thousands , and perhaps hundreds of thousands , of bats this year in Northeastern states .
The cause of " white - nose syndrome , " so named because of the white fungus that appears on bats ' noses and wings , remains a mystery .
And the plague is still killing bats , alarming scientists who had considered it a winter syndrome .
" The surprise for us has been finding out that bats are still dying , " says biologist Susi von Oettingen of the U.S. Fish & Wildlife Service office in Concord , N.H. Biologists combing summertime roosts report finding six species of bats affected by the syndrome in New York , Vermont , New Hampshire , Massachusetts and Connecticut , she says .
" I 'm continuing to get calls on a daily basis from cities and residents reporting dead bats , " says Scott Darling of the Vermont Department of Fish & Wildlife .
Spot surveys are being done in the five states , but conservation officials wo n't get a solid sense of further losses until later this month when male bats begin returning to caves , Darling says .
One bat can eat more than a pound of night - time insects in a week .
White - nose syndrome threatens the endangered Indiana bat , Darling says , and agricultural pest numbers may explode without bats .
In the winter , ill bats appeared to burn up their stores of fat too early in hibernation ; many others left the caves too early and froze to death .
At a meeting of bat biologists in Albany , N.Y. , last month , scientists agreed on a research plan to find out whether the syndrome 's cause is a fungus , unknown disease or environmental contaminant .
They received guidance from bee researchers , who are trying to unravel their own mystery syndrome , called colony collapse disorder , which has devastated the nation 's bee population , says microbiologist David Blehert of the U.S. Geological Survey 's National Wildlife Health Center in Madison , Wis .
IN THE CAVES : Northeast bat population is in its own kind of hell MORE INFORMATION : White - nose syndrome First spotted in four New York caves in 2007 , the bat syndrome spread to 24 caves by March , killing 90 % of the bats in some locations .
A big worry is that bats , which can travel hundreds of miles in the summer , will spread the syndrome , von Oettingen says .
Researchers suspect Pennsylvania may be the next outbreak site .

Right now on CSPAN , in the House of Representatives , Dennis Kucinich ( Democrat , Representative from Ohio's 10th District ) is presenting , for the second time a resolution calling for the impeachment of President Bush .
Watch it live on CSPAN 's website .
Jorge needed some help , so for several thousand dollars , he hired two professional " transporters " — imposing men trained in a whole repertoire of negotiating skills and takedown maneuvers .
One morning last November , they drove to a group home where Jorge 's eldest son was being held .
Brian was just 15 years old then but already six feet tall .
All cheekbones and muscles , with long hair and dark , serious eyes , he looked like a young Johnny Depp .
He was deemed violent .
A flight risk .
As the transporters stood in the background , Jorge tensely informed the boy that he was being moved across the country to a different , more secure psychiatric facility .
Immediately .
Would he like to get anything from his room ?
Since there were few things he cared about in the world , Brian grabbed his sneakers and a couple of other possessions .
Then off he went , sandwiched by his escorts , to catch their plane .
Days later , Jorge surprised 14 - year - old Matthew .
At home on the family ranch near Gainesville , Jorge told the straw - haired blond boy that he , like his brother , was being sent to a faraway residential facility for indefinite treatment .
The boy surrendered peacefully .
Considering the stunts he'd tried in the past — like trying to murder his mother — Jorge felt a huge relief .
Then there was James .
Once his brothers disappeared , delivered to institutions in separate states , the 13 - year - old with the thick blond hair and mischievous eyes knew what was coming .
Because of scheduling issues , though , it would n't be until the next month .
During those quiet weeks , James busied himself by plotting a chilling revenge .
What could he do that would have the maximum , spirit - crushing impact ?
He gathered some supplies and headed into the horse stalls .
Jorge and his wife , Debbie ( New Times is not using their last name in order to protect the identities of the children ) , say that if they 'd known in 1998 what they know now , they never would have adopted the brothers .
The Department of Children and Families hid reams of information about brutal sexual abuse the boys had suffered in their first years of life , and when that abuse caused a rare but severe psychological disorder , the agency wavered and stalled rather than provide proper care .
DCF had barely recovered from disturbing news stories in recent years about foster parents molesting children in their care and young wards of the state disappearing into the system — here was another sad example of the historically troubled agency failing the very children it claimed to protect .
Now , even after a protracted , eight - year - long lawsuit has drawn to a close , Debbie and Jorge remain in legal / political limbo with $ 10 million at stake .
The boys are finally in treatment — but no one 's sure it will help at this stage .
In hindsight , experts say that the children should have been separated from their trauma bond and given intensive psychological care — ten years ago .
" My youngest child entered foster care when he was one month old , " Debbie says .
" He 's coming out the other side a sociopath . "
1998 was a vastly more hopeful time for the family .
They were a couple who wanted to have a positive impact on the world .
They had already adopted one boy — 11 - year - old David — and the plan now was to take in three brothers who'd arrived in the foster care system as the children of shockingly neglectful parents .
Everyone was excited about the first meeting .
Debbie , Jorge , and David would head over to John Prince Park , where , on the playground , they would " accidentally " bump into adoption workers and the three boys .
No need to tell the kids this could become their " forever family . "
Best not to get anyone 's hopes up .
It was a chilly February afternoon .
Jorge and David tossed a ball with the three siblings as Debbie looked on .
Brian , who at 6 was the oldest , was always the most serious of the children .
Talkative 5 - year - old Matthew was already a charmer .
The baby , James , was 3 .
Under normal circumstances , the adoption process includes a number of test visits to make sure kids and parents warm up to each other .
But after their very first sleepover at Debbie and Jorge 's Boynton Beach home , Brian , Matthew , and James cried and begged not to return to their foster home .
So that was it ; they moved in .
DCF expedited the adoption , and it was finalized July 24 .
As part of the turnover , adoption counselor Myra Zuc­lich gave Debbie and Jorge some paperwork — birth certificates , Social Security cards .
" The stack was a quarter - inch thick , " Debbie says , pinching a forefinger and thumb .
The papers included one abuse report detailing an incident that had caused the children to be taken from their birth mother .
It was possible the oldest boy had been sexually abused in her care , Debbie remembers Zuclich saying , but no one had ever been charged .
These days , Debbie and Jorge do their best to sound chipper .
They are pretty good fakers .
Debbie , a 49 - year - old with reddish - blond highlights and flawless pale skin , retains her teacherly voice , though she has n't worked in a school in years .
She has mastered the ironic chuckle .
Jorge , also 49 , has a gentle presence .
A Cuban -American with bushy black eyebrows and , stunningly , just a few gray hairs at his temples , he exudes unfailing politeness .
His voice has that 1950s sitcom - dad quality , like Ward from Leave It to Beaver .
Jorge remembers the classes that prospective foster and adoptive parents were required to take .
" It was a weeding - out process , " he says .
Some people seemed motivated by the financial boost they could get from fostering , a few hundred dollars per child per month .
" You could tell they were thinking : Am I going to work at McDonald 's or do foster care ? "
Many participants were scared away when they heard about the challenges that might lie ahead .
" I think our class started with 45 people in it , " Jorge recalls .
" There were eight at the end . "
Debbie and Jorge , though , felt well - prepared for more kids .
Their first adopted son was a black child whose mother had died of cancer and whom they knew through their church .
Debbie had been a teacher and principal at a school for children with special needs ; Jorge was a successful salesman and youth minister .
A study conducted by DCF described a loving and idyllic family with a lively cast of animals : three cats , dogs who were used for pet therapy with disabled children , and Merlin , an African gray parrot who " sounds exactly like Jorge . "
It said right there on the home study :
To complement their mixed family , Debbie and Jorge were open to accepting children — they could probably take one or two — with " mild - to - moderate medical , developmental , and / or behavioral needs . "
Debbie says now that , because they already had a son , they specified " absolutely no sexual acting out at all . "
They turned down a few children with behavior problems they did n't feel they could handle .
Then one day , DCF adoption specialist Zuclich came to tell them about three amazing little boys — the sort who rarely ever became available .
According to Debbie , " She said , ' I 'm not supposed to show you , but here is their picture . ' "
The couple was hooked .
Debbie remembers the first few meals with the boys .
" They were grabbing fistfuls of spaghetti , " she says .
They did n't understand the concept of utensils .
They hoarded food .
When she helped them take baths , she noticed they were skinny and bruised , " like refugees . "
Other signs were more disturbing .
Brian , the oldest boy , suffered from nightmares .
Matthew maintained an air of defiance , never , ever acknowledging blame .
Little James was always biting .
All three wet their beds and seemed obsessed with grabbing at each other 's genitals as though it were some sort of power play .
" They would rage and scream for two to three hours at a time at the top of their lungs , " Debbie says .
Each boy could be cruel to pet cats and dogs .
With a therapist 's help , Debbie and Jorge learned coping techniques .
They let the boys take food to their rooms until the hoarding stopped .
They set a rule to stay arm 's length apart .
To deal with extreme tantrums , the parents calmed the boys by sitting them in a chair and physically retraining them , wrapping their arms around from behind .
About six months after the adoption , Debbie was cleaning the house and moving furniture around .
The bed made a squeak .
Little James , then 4 , looked terrified .
That was the sound he heard before the bad man came to get him , he muttered .
Upon further questioning , he reported : " Hector slept with me . "
Hector Rosa was his former foster dad .
" I pulled Matthew aside , and he told me the same story , " Debbie says .
The bed always made a telltale squeak when Rosa lifted himself off one boy and went for the next .
Hector Rosa was a DCF - vetted foster parent who had been in charge of Brian , Matthew , and James just before their adoption .
The three boys moved in with Debbie and Jorge , making way for an 11 - year - old girl .
According to court documents , Rosa customarily passed out on the recliner in his small house in Palm Springs .
From there , he said , he could best guard the eight kids .
" Hector the Protector , " his wife liked to call him .
A police report notes that it was nearly midnight in December 1998 when Hector 's wife , Yolanda , roused herself from bed to grab a bottle for the 1 - year - old baby .
She stumbled into the living room and was surprised not to see Hector .
She padded over to one of the kids ' rooms .
Yolanda turned the doorknob .
She looked at the bottom bunk .
Then screamed .
" I can't believe you did this ! " she yelled .
" It 's not what you think ! "
Hector shouted , jumping up .
Yolanda lurched for the phone and dialed 911 .
" I just caught my husband molesting one of the foster children ! " she cried hysterically .
" I just caught him ! "
She recounted what she had seen :
Her husband , a 49 - year - old property manager , 5 - foot - 9 and around 200 pounds , under the blue sheets , moving his hips .
Beneath him : the 11 - year - old foster girl .
Hector ran to the bathroom and vomited on the floor .
By the time two officers arrived , Rosa had abandoned his plaid , semen - stained boxer shorts and thrown on a pair of jeans .
He nervously rattled on about how sorry and embarrassed he was .
He insisted there 'd been no penetration .
One of the officers read him his Miranda rights .
Still , he continued to babble .
He told the police he'd fondled the girl on about eight occasions .
" I think I need help , " he stated weakly .
Hector Rosa had already been jailed for that incident when Debbie called DCF to report that her boys may have been sexually abused .
She says she was told not to worry ; Rosa was locked away .
He would later be sentenced to life in prison without parole .
" Could n't anyone have told me ? " Debbie asked , incredulous .
" Would a phone call have been so difficult ? "
After her boys were interviewed by authorities , three additional charges of lewd assault were filed against Hector .
He pleaded no contest to one charge and had ten years tacked on to his life sentence .
Weeks later , however , he withdrew his plea , and he is still fighting his cases from prison .
Because the boys lived in fear that Hector would come back and kill them for telling — James had night terrors about it —
Debbie brought them to his sentencing hearing so they could see him in shackles .
In the courtroom , Brian lowered his head and let out a satisfied " Yesss ! " Matthew stared Hector in the eyes .
When they got home , Debbie says , little James asked who would watch the bad man when the guards slept at night .
Debbie reassured him : " You are safe . "
The family moved to a new home with separate bedrooms for each of the boys , but their frustrating behavior continued .
The boys destroyed furniture , tortured pets , smeared feces on the computer , and , when separated , would tear out electrical sockets to tunnel into one another 's rooms .
Debbie was horrified to walk in on the children all naked together .
Regardless of age , an orgasm " is ten times more potent than cocaine , " one of the boys ' therapists later said in a deposition .
It would not be surprising if , after being exposed to sexual stimulation , they felt compelled to continue it .
Debbie and Jorge installed a security system so they'd know if the kids were trying to get out of bed .
Realizing they might be in over their heads , Debbie quit her job to stay home and care for the boys .
Although Jorge had become a full - time youth minister who opened missions abroad , he stopped traveling for work .
The couple says they asked the state to provide additional , post - adoption psychiatric services but were met with the attitude :
Too bad ; they 're your kids now .
One serendipitous day , Debbie was browsing in a bookstore and noticed a volume out of place on a shelf .
She moved to slide it out of the way and was struck by its title : High Risk : Children Without a Conscience by Dr. Ken Magid and Carole A. McKelvey .
The book described a psychiatric diagnosis that had been around for decades but remained relatively unknown : reactive attachment disorder .
Kids who do not receive adequate parenting in the early stages of life , the book explained , had no foundation for healthy emotional development .
Such children — kids who were abused , neglected , kept in hospitals , or rejected by mothers with depression — would show little in the way of bonding as they aged .
They would often turn aggressive and violent .
They would release their anger on caretakers .
Debbie remembers thinking : " My God .
These are our kids ! ' "
Even now , reactive attachment disorder remains underresearched .
ATTACh.org ( the Association for Treatment and Training in the Attachment of Children ) , the preeminent organization focusing on the disorder , has only 380 members — 60 percent clinicians , 40 percent parents — according to its executive director , Lynn Wetterberg .
She estimates that there are fewer than ten residential centers in the country equipped to handle patients diagnosed with the condition .
Debbie and Jorge became convinced that their children needed such treatment after they were diagnosed with RAD .
They say they begged DCF for additional services only to be denied because the kids '
Medicare would n't cover the bill .
It was only after they wrote to then - Gov. Jeb Bush , using Hector Rosa as leverage , that then - district administrator of DCF Paul Brown invited the couple in for a meeting .
Brown authorized money for the whole family and two therapists to attend a two - week session at a treatment center in Colorado that specialized in RAD .
It costs around $ 10,000 per session .
" I just want to feel like I did one decent thing , " Debbie remembered Brown telling them .
She was surprised when he added a suggestion :
They ought to sue DCF .
The next day , she says , Brown resigned .
" He said the system was too broken to fix . "
To prepare for the family 's visit around Christmas 2000 , therapists in Colorado requested the boys ' records directly from DCF .
Adoption worker Zuclich sent them : not just a quarter - inch stack but boxes and boxes , with a DCF provision that the files not be shared with the parents .
Nestled in a conference room surrounded by the Rocky Mountains and evergreen trees , therapists sorted through documents .
They looked sympathetically at Debbie and Jorge .
The information they were reading stunned them .
Goodness , would they like to share , but professional regulations prevented them from breaking DCF 's orders .
Debbie and Jorge watched helplessly .
Their furor grew .
They wanted to know what those papers said .
" That was the moment of truth for me , " Debbie says .
" Up until then , I 'd just thought we'd been dealing with incredibly incompetent people .
Then I realized they had actually been hiding things .
It had all been a setup . "
" When we left there , " Jorge says , " we got a lawyer . "
Here 's a taste of what was in those boxes — information that Debbie and Jorge would see only years later .
According to one document , the boys ' biological mother , Mary , told DCF workers she 'd been raped by at least six people over the course of her life — including four family members .
But it was an encounter with a man at a California truck - driving school that produced her beautiful dark - haired son Brian .
Then again , documents also showed she was a liar .
Mary fell for a troubled 27 - year - old divorcé and had two more babies in two more states .
The family was living in a car in Georgia when child protective services there got on their case .
They gave authorities the slip by crossing the state line into Florida .
According to a time line in the boys ' file , the family did not stay undetected for long .
The children were taken into state custody in Palm Beach County on November 8 , 1994 , when " Brian 's arm was broken by a parent in a fit of rage . "
He was two years and nine months old at the time .
The baby , James , was only a month .
Examinations showed signs of physical and sexual abuse .
The time line shows that , in keeping with standard procedures , the boys were placed together in a foster home of a woman named Alix Holley while Mary was allowed supervised visits in hopes of reunification .
Some excerpts :
2/27/95 : " No visits until parents are clear of scabies . "
3/29/95 : " Brian 's teeth all rotten . "
4/27/95 : " Saw all three children .
Impetigo and ringworm cleared up . "
4/28/95 : The foster mother reported " aggressive / physical behaviors , head banging , self - inflicted , will hurt animals . "
8/29/95 : Foster mother reports " behaviors real bad .
Giving oral sex to each other . "
10/26/95 : During a visit , " Brian said to [ biological ] mom , ' Do n't hurt me . ' "
Ongoing entries describe Holley 's growing suspicions that the boys were being abused in the care of their mother .
When the court approved continuing visits despite her objections , Holley would cancel or dawdle in bringing the boys to appointments .
On February 23 , 1996 , Holley seemed " extremely concerned about continuing the visits . "
She threatened to sue the department .
Although correspondence that was later released would show that other workers shared her concerns , Holley was deemed a nuisance for interfering .
" She thrives on this type of controversy that makes her feel important , " a caseworker wrote in a memo .
The boys were soon shuffled again .
Plans for reunification with Mary were scrapped on June 2 , 1997 , when , according to notes , " James was the victim of physical abuse when the mother intentionally bit him at the therapist 's office . "
Mary was arrested and agreed to terminate her parental rights .
She planned to move back to Georgia .
She was five months pregnant at the time .
Documents in the boys ' file would show that Brian was separated from his brothers , who landed in an immaculate , three - bedroom , one - bath house in Greenacres .
Nancy Garcia and her husband took in $ 2,035 a month between his job at Publix and their Social Security checks .
They got some extra income caring for 12 foster kids that year , sometimes five at a clip .
An abuse report details the time that a DCF worker went to check on the home after the boys complained about being kept in a chicken coop .
A therapist confirmed the presence of such a structure in the yard , but when asked about it , Nancy Garcia said she only threatened to put the boys in a cage after they refused to go to bed .
In a separate incident , the Garcias admitted to putting tape on Matthew 's mouth " as a reminder to stop talking . "
The couple sometimes warned the children by rolling up a newspaper and smacking it against a hand .
The toddlers were troublemakers , Nancy Garcia reported .
" You can't spank them ; what else am I supposed to do ? "
According to the paperwork , a district staffing specialist forwarded concerns about the Garcias ' " inappropriate discipline techniques " to the relicensing unit , who in turn referred its concerns to a home educator .
But the home educator had left her job , so the case was closed .
The Garcia home was later described as " above satisfactory " and relicensed .
But the troublesome boys were clearly not wanted , so workers sought a new placement .
Hector Rosa and his wife had room for three kids .
In 2002 , Debbie and Jorge filed a lawsuit against DCF based on " negligence " and " wrongful adoption . "
During the years that it moved along at a glacial pace , however , something curious happened to the boys .
They grew .
Matthew , the middle child , was about 8 when he sidled up to Debbie .
" He said , ' Mommy come here , ' " she remembers .
He told her he had been lifting weights .
" Guess how much I weigh now , " he whispered .
" ' I 'm getting bigger , and I 'm getting stronger , and I will kill you .
When the knife goes in , you 'll know it . "
Debbie tried to hide her panic .
She 'd learned that attachment disordered kids often took out their hostility on the person closest to them .
Any loving gesture repulsed them .
They were especially mean to women , and their favorite target was mom .
" It 's like a porcupine , " therapist Lori Angulo would later explain in a deposition .
When a person gets emotionally close , " they act out .
They can pull you in for a little bit , and you think you 're getting closer .
And then if they become vulnerable at all , they will sabotage that . "
Debbie and Jorge engaged the boys in activities that even privileged kids would envy .
The family camped , canoed , and swam with dolphins .
They all did yoga at the YMCA .
Since little James loved Curious George , a real monkey came to his birthday party .
Brian decorated his bedroom with an astronomy theme , and when the Kennedy Space Center opened its Hall of Fame , Brian and Matthew cut the ribbon .
They met some of the world 's most famous astronauts .
The family even rented a pasture in Boynton Beach and bought two miniature therapeutic horses , Dakota and Magic .
Debbie , a talented photographer , would later take pictures of James in a field with the creatures .
In the sepia - toned images , he wears a cowboy hat , and the sun pours down like honey .
The pictures would haunt them years later .
The boys ' bad behavior had no particular trigger .
" Not a rhyme or reason , " Jorge says .
" You could go to dinner and feel like it was a good day . "
They 'd play chess or talk about world events , and minutes later , violence would erupt .
Therapists described both parents as cooperative and patient .
Angulo called them " loving ... to a fault . "
They would need to watch out for themselves .
Debbie was delighted one day when Matthew , without prompting , brought her a glass of root beer .
How thoughtful .
She spent the next two days in the bathroom , violently ill .
Matthew would later admit to collecting chicken blood from uncooked dinners and spiking her drink .
He got the idea when she 'd lectured the kids about salmonella , and he had tried it a couple of times , he said , before getting the formula right .
Socializing became a problem .
Debbie and Jorge allowed visits with friends who had kids , but every venture ended in allegations .
They stole something or bit someone or touched other children in ways that could lead to lawsuits .
The family retreated .
They abandoned church .
Isolating the boys at home became a necessity , therapists believed .
The house was transformed with aquariums and LEGO stations .
Angulo described it as " a velvet - lined steel box . "
" James at 7 did n't know the letter a , " Debbie says .
" After being homeschooled for a year , he was reading at middle - school level .
Now he can read a novel a day . "
Each of the three boys , she says , has a genius IQ .
James is a member of Mensa .
The problem , Debbie says , was that " as they got bigger and stronger , they became more dangerous . "
With a little laugh , she ticks off a list of offenses :
They broke her jaw .
They stole from her purse .
They went into her closet and scissored her clothes .
Debbie says she carried the internet modem with her wherever she went so they could n't download porn ( they always chose violent , misogynist sex scenes ) or steal people 's credit - card info .
She would n't go to the bathroom unless Jorge was home .
She watched the boys in the rearview mirror while driving lest they pull off a surprise attack .
The family relocated to the ranch outside of Gainesville .
There , they could keep more therapeutic animals and be closer to relatives .
Once , though , the boys set a fire at Jorge 's parents ' home by putting a broom on the stove .
Eventually , even family members backed off .
Although they had at first resisted residential programs , Debbie and Jorge began to relent .
They enrolled Matthew in a military - style academy , but he was sent home , declared a danger to officers and cadets .
At one group home , Brian poured a chemical in a girl 's lip gloss to burn her .
They boys entered boarding schools , boot camps , and mental hospitals only to be expelled .
Soon , the family ran out of options .
Home with only Debbie , the brothers hid knives and hammers inside the walls .
In 2006 , the parents found the word die carved under their bedroom window .
" It 's like they were POWs and we were their captors , " Debbie laments .
Brian was the size of a man now .
Debbie and Jorge longed for the days when hugging the boys in a chair was a technique that actually worked .
Systems of punishments and rewards had lost their effect .
The couple sometimes turned to police ; Matthew alone was arrested eight times .
They used the Baker Act to have the boys placed under observation in mental hospitals .
Debbie has a recurring dream .
" Matthew is chasing me around the car .
And I reach in my purse , and I pull out a gun and I shoot him .
And then " — she swallows and looks away — " he turns into a child again . "
She does n't chuckle when she says this .
She cries .
Debbie and Jorge felt close to the DCF workers who'd inspected their house and investigated their past .
" During the home study , they 'd ask about the most intimate details : ' How is your sex life ?
Oh , you 're infertile ?
How does that feel ? '
It was like therapy . "
That these same individuals would purposely deceive them felt like " the ultimate betrayal . "
The boys ' therapists and their family lawyer , Lance Block , however , characterized DCF employees as well - intentioned people stuck inside a flawed system .
When Myra Zuclich , the DCF adoption worker , was deposed , she explained that she had 40 kids to see each week for an hour apiece .
Normal work hours did n't even allow time for travel .
For unfettered access to a copy machine , she had to work through the night .
The system was a maze of adoption , placement , and licensing units and finance people .
In the scheme of things , Zuclich said , she was " a little person " with no decision - making power .
Her motivation was to find the boys a good home .
She did not follow up on concerns about the chicken coop , however , because it was " not my jurisdiction , " and while she'd had her own suspicions about Hector Rosa , she did not pass them on because " nobody ever gave me information on things like that . "
When choosing paperwork to share with the parents , she says , she followed instructions and sent whatever documents her bosses picked out .
During testimony , other workers described a similar runaround .
The case was set to go to trial last November —
" It would have been a monster verdict , " Block says — but the night before it was to begin , DCF settled with the family for $ 10 million , almost all of it to be put in a trust fund for the boys ' future treatment .
" That 's unprecedented , " says Block , who has handled the case pro bono for eight years .
It may have also been a bargain :
An economist who is an expert on institutional care estimated that the boys ' lifetime care would cost $ 75 million if fully funded .
Debbie and Jorge fought for a stipulation in the settlement agreement that each parent receive $ 350,000 .
" We went from making over $ 100,000 a year , " Debbie says , " and then I stopped working in my 30s , just as my career was getting under way .
Now I 'm in my late 40s , and it 's like , ' Oh my gosh .
My career is missing !
My life is missing ! ' "
The funds could also help offset costs incurred over the years , like therapeutic animals , wall repairs , and transporters .
For now , however , the award stands only on paper .
Because of " sovereign immunity , " state payouts are limited to $ 200,000 , no matter what attorneys hash out .
Sovereign immunity can be waived , and bigger settlements disbursed , only if a state representative sponsors and the Legislature then passes a claims bill .
That happens only a fraction of the time .
One claims bill that was passed this year — a well - publicized $ 18.2 million payout to Marissa Amora , a 9 - year - old who needs permanent care after being abused under DCF 's watch — had been reintroduced three consecutive years before passing .
Debbie and Jorge and their attorney say that the state became markedly more responsive after Jeb Bush left office and Secretary Bob Butterworth took over the Department of Children and Families in January 2007 .
They felt at least minor validation when Butterworth spoke during a hearing on their behalf .
" The new policy under my administration is a policy of openness , " he remarked , " and one where we admit mistakes and compensate those damaged as a result .
The department could and should have done a better job . "
Despite the bigwig weighing in , however , legislators from around the state , each consumed with their own constituents ' concerns , declined to pass the claims bill before the legislative session ended in May .
Tight budget this year , so sorry .
The main reason Debbie and Jorge accepted the settlement was an agreement that the state would send the boys away — immediately — for treatment , however belated .
Last December , after Brian and Matthew had gone , little James shipped out too .
He was 13 .
From his new home , he spoke to Debbie by phone .
She was happy to hear him show some apparent compassion when he asked how the horses were doing .
Maybe the program was already working .
" Make sure you feed them , " James said .
He repeated it the next time they talked .
In January , Debbie was driving home from town .
As she approached her property , she noticed several of her miniature horses lying on the ground .
She drew closer .
Bodies were sprawled on the hill .
" Ten , " she says .
" He wiped out ten . "
The boy would later confess to swiping rat poison from a neighbor 's farm and slipping it into a container of horse feed during the weeks he waited to be sent away .
It was only a matter of time until Debbie fed them from that particular bag .
Some of the horses they 'd had since James was little .
Four cats also died from the poison .
" He told his therapist that the horses got what they deserved , " Debbie says .
He also said he had planned to kill Debbie in one of the horse stalls .
A search of the stall yielded a knife .
The boys ' treatment requires parents to remain involved , so almost every other weekend , Debbie and Jorge get on a plane .
But the kids , Debbie says , " still feel , ' These people need to be destroyed . '
A therapist told me , ' Brian feels like if you 're dead , his pain will go away . ' "
When they arrive at Brian 's center , he resists seeing them .
Someone read about the settlement in the newspaper and told him he 's a millionaire now .
He scoffs at any explanation that the money is earmarked for therapy .
Matthew , Debbie says , " loves me the most and hates me the most . "
Seeing him can make her nervous , especially when she thinks of the chicken - blood incident .
When she visits , he is seated in a chair lower than hers , and she remains close to the door .
James , the horse poisoner , has been asked to leave his current facility .
Staff there cannot keep other residents safe with him around .
Debbie and Jorge are looking for a place that will take him .
Once again , their options are few , and they need a facility that accepts Florida Medicare .
If the settlement money were available , the task might be easier .
They look forward to the next legislative session .
" Are [ legislators ] going to come through on their promise ? " Debbie asks .
" Or hold us off for another year ?
And another year ? "
In May , Debbie and Jorge received about a dozen bankers ' boxes of documents about their children .
Some of the documents seem ludicrous now , evidence of an ineffective system .
There 's a letter from DCF thanking Hector Rosa for his " unselfish dedication . "
There 's also a 1996 memo in which a therapist wrote that the boys ' case " should be monitored by your most experienced case worker because it has the potential to be a newspaper article that would be detrimental to [ DCF ] . "
Other papers , though , hint at additional worlds of abuse .
Like the handwritten notes alluding to another child in Hector Rosa 's care who was bruised and acted out in school .
Documents explain that Hector and Yolanda Rosa had been abused when they themselves were children .
The lawsuit uncovered other sad epilogues .
A caseworker in Georgia called Myra Zuclich once looking for history on the boys ' biological mom .
Remember , she 'd been five months pregnant ?
That child had died .
An adult rolled over and suffocated it during sleep .
People often wonder :
Why did n't Debbie and Jorge just give the kids back ?
" Give them back to who ? " Debbie barks .
" To the people who abused them ?
To the system that failed to keep them safe over and over and over again ? "
Jorge acknowledges that no matter how much the children fight off their affections , " they mean something to us . "
Love , Debbie concedes , has become a somewhat awkward concept .
" I still love them with the knowledge that they do n't love us back . "
A lawyer and spokesperson for DCF , Florence Rivas , says that the department has always had a policy of full disclosure .
It 's regrettable that it was not enforced four administrations ago , she says , but it is being emphasized under Butterworth 's tenure .
Debbie , though , says that " ultimately , our family was sacrificed . "
Debbie and Jorge try to remain optimistic .
They note that their oldest , often - overlooked son had a difficult childhood but is a productive 21 - year - old now .
Perhaps the other three boys will gain something in treatment , even if it 's only a year before Brian turns 18 and ages out — or can sign himself out — of his program .
Maybe they 'll come out of therapy calmer , less angry .
But things could go the other way too .
Experts say child abuse is a tough cycle to break .
Many agree that the best hope for attachment disordered kids is intervention in early childhood .
Without it , they say , the next stop is often the prison system .
Debbie says the boys , who are not allowed to speak to New Times because doing so would interfere with their treatment , are " articulate and friendly and charming .
They could sit in a room and talk to you about the news .
Then they can turn around and hurt somebody and never feel it .
My fear is that it will be a woman .
I do n't want someone else 's daughter to pay the price . "
It is possible that upon release , one of the boys could try to make good on his threats .
One form of self - defense would be for Debbie and Jorge to go into hiding .
" To be honest , " Debbie says , " it 's something we 've talked about . "
They 'll see how they feel in a year .
For now , they take things day by day .
Lately , they 'd been feeling good .
They thought they 'd gotten over the death of the horses .
But just today , a pregnant one miscarried .
The stillborn foal was deformed .
" It never stops , " Debbie says .
So they keep their emotions in check , just in case more heartbreak lurks around the bend .
Best not to get anyone 's hopes up .
U.S. law enforcement authorities helped facilitate a $ 32,000 ransom payment in Mexico for a relative of a U.S. congressman who was kidnapped last week by gunmen in Ciudad Juarez , a border city with rampant drug smuggling , gunfights and corruption .
Erika Posselt , a Mexican national described only as “ a relative of the wife ” of Rep. Silvestre Reyes , Texas Democrat and powerful chairman of the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence , was abducted June 19 from an auto glass store she owns in Juarez .
Held for three days , U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement ( ICE ) agents - at Mr. Reyes ’ request - helped arrange her safe return .
Saying they would kill Mrs. Posselt if a $ 500,000 ransom was n’t paid , the kidnappers negotiated with Mrs. Posselt ’s brother in Juarez and agreed to release her for $ 32,000 - in U.S. and Mexican currency .
According to a confidential ICE memo , Mrs. Posselt was heard yelling in the background on one phone call between her brother and her captors .
The family raised the money , according to the memo .
On June 21 , two men on a motorcycle collected the ransom money at a Juarez street corner but sped off and eluded investigators who had staked out the drop site .
Mrs. Posselt was released several hours later , and Mexican authorities quickly transferred her to their American counterparts , who rushed her to El Paso , Texas , for “ security reasons , ” according to the ICE memo .
No arrests have been made .
U.S. policy prohibits federal agencies from negotiating with kidnappers in ransom demands for U.S. citizens .
It is not clear how the policy pertains to the involvement of U.S. agencies in the kidnapping of noncitizens such as Mr. Reyes ’ relative .
But some law enforcement authorities on Thursday said the Mexican case could have set a dangerous precedent .
Sandalio “ Sandy ” Gonzalez , a retired U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration senior executive service supervisor who headed all of DEA ’s operations in West Texas and New Mexico , said it was natural to reach out to help a relative , but U.S. authorities lacked jurisdiction in the case .
“ The question to ask is whether ICE would have gotten involved if it had been a U.S. citizen or someone not related to a member of Congress , ” he said .
“ The answer , of course , would be no . ”
Michael Cutler , a retired U.S. Immigration and Naturalization Service senior agent , called the involvement of Mr. Reyes ’ office “ questionable . ”
Noting that Mr. Reyes is a retired Border Patrol sector chief , he said federal agents always have been admonished to “ never use your badge to accomplish a personal goal . ”
Washington layer Joseph DiGenova , former U.S. attorney in the District , said cross - border law enforcement operations are generally coordinated by the U.S. Attorney General ’s office .
He called the Reyes case a “ bizarre use of U.S. law enforcement resources .
“ There is absolutely no fundamental basis for U.S. law enforcement to be involved but for the request of the congressman , ” he said .
“ Not only is it highly unusual , but it raises serious questions . ”
Mr. DiGenova said the only reason ICE became involved is because Mr. Reyes is “ the chairman of the House Intelligence Committee . ”
Mrs. Posselt was released three days after an aide to Mr. Reyes , chairman of the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence and a former U.S. Border Patrol sector chief in El Paso , sought help from the ICE assistant attache in Ciudad Juarez .
The agency responded by pledging the “ full assistance ” of its El Paso field office and coordinating a meeting with the Chihuahua state police in El Paso “ to recover the kidnapped victim . ”
Mr. Reyes ’ office had no comment Thursday when asked about the matter .
ICE officials also declined to comment and said the investigation is continuing .
According to the memo , ICE agents ultimately enlisted the help of Mexican state and federal law enforcement officials in Mrs.
Posselt ’s return , but limited their role to providing their Mexican counterparts with what the memo described as “ technical and logistical assistance . ”
One of the first officials ICE contacted “ to coordinate efforts to recover Ms. Posselt ” was Patricia Gonzalez , the attorney general in Chihuahua , the state where Juarez is located .
That contact was followed by meetings in El Paso between ICE officials and Chihuahua state police .
The ICE memo , sent to Homeland Security Assistant Secretary Julie L. Myers , who heads ICE , said the agency ’s technical operations division in Washington was contacted to help coordinate support .
After her release , Mrs. Posselt was interviewed at the ICE field office in El Paso by ICE agents and Mexican prosecutors , the memo said , and “ Mexican officials are pursuing leads relating to the possible location where Mrs. Posselt was held . ”
Juarez has been overrun by violence as powerful drug cartels battle federal and state law enforcement officials , and one another , for control of lucrative smuggling corridors into the United States .
Hundreds of killings have been reported since 2006 .
Over the past 15 years , more than 400 women have been killed in Juarez , their bodies dumped into ditches or vacant lots , and more than 4,000 have been reported missing .
Few of the cases have been solved , and family members of the other victims do n’t think their killers will be brought to justice .
The memo also noted that a $ 56,000 ransom for a separate kidnapping was being delivered while the money was taken to the drop spot for Mrs. Posselt ’s release .

Militants say they are fighting for the rights of poor Nigerians
An attack on two oil pipelines in Nigeria 's oil - rich Delta region has cut production and raised the price of oil .
Oil giant
Shell confirmed it had stopped pumping crude oil through a major pipeline but did not say how much was being held back .
The pipeline attacked by militants carries 130,000 barrels per day , according to Reuters news agency .
Nigeria 's oil production had been creeping back up to its Opec quota of 2.2 m barrels a day .
A series of violent attacks in recent years had led to a 20 % cut in Nigeria 's output .
Production , which dropped early this year to 1.7 m barrels , rose above 1.9 m last week .
The Movement for the Emancipation of the Niger Delta ( Mend ) claimed responsibility for the attacks .
They attacked a major trunk pipeline in Nembe Creek , Shell confirmed .
The location of the second attack is yet to be confirmed .
Mend told journalists last week they would attack two major pipelines in order to prove they were not being paid protection money to stay away from oil infrastructure .
The head of the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation last week admitted to paying militants to allow repairs to a pipeline .
The NNPC later said he had been quoted out of context and the money had gone to communities , not to militants .
Kidnaps Earlier , five foreign oil workers seized in Nigeria by militants were freed , security officials told the BBC .
The group , thought to be Russians , were kidnapped on Thursday on the way to a deep offshore oil field .
' Blood oil ' dripping from Nigeria
The boat was hijacked just after leaving its navy escort and taken to a creek in the swampy Niger Delta .
It was the second group of foreigners to be kidnapped and then released in the past four days in the Delta , which has seen a recent surge in violence .
Two people were shot and wounded and eight foreign oil workers kidnapped on Saturday .
The eight , also believed to be Russians , were released hours after they were taken from a tanker on the Bonny River .
In both cases , security officials said no ransom had been paid .
More than 200 foreign oil workers have been kidnapped in the Niger Delta over the past two years , but they are often released after payment of ransom .
The group of five released on Monday worked for the oil services company Saipem .
It is believed the tanker which came under attack belongs to Global Gas and Refining Ltd , a Nigerian subsidiary of US - based Global Energy Inc , which has been stationed along the Bonny river for more than two years .
It is not known who carried out the kidnappings .
Mend ended a unilaterally announced ceasefire after British Prime Minister Gordon Brown said the UK would help train the Nigerian military amid efforts to tackle violence in the Delta .
The militants say they are fighting to ensure that Niger Delta residents see more benefits of the oil wealth .
But some are criminal gangs , making money from ransom payments and stealing oil .

What are these ?
A nationally - known figure is mounting a challenge for a House seat , and an aide to the incumbent is cracking wise ?
“ It looks like Congressman Knollenberg is running against death and taxes , ” Mike Brownfield , the congressman ’s campaign manager , told The Detroit News today .
It ’s funny because it ’s about Jack Kevorkian , the Michigan doctor who took the euthanasia debate into his own hands by helping terminally ill people end their lives .
What he did in one of his 130 cases got him 8 years in prison for second - degree murder .
About 10 months after his release , he decided to enter elective politics with a vow to bring “ honesty and sincerity instead of corrupt government in Washington . ”
The move sparked national headlines and much local doubt , but he hit the pavement anyway to collect signatures for a petition to get on the ballot as an independent .
On Monday , a local elections official gave Mr. Kevorkian the green light , thus inserting him into a tight race between Mr. Knollenberg , the Republican incumbent , and Gary Peters , his Democratic rival .
But the biggest name in the race was immediately labeled a “ a very minor factor ” by one political guru talking to The Detroit News .
Electoral prospects notwithstanding , more than 3,200 people in the district backed his candidacy .
What kind of people signed on the dotted line for Jack Kevorkian ?
The Oakland Press found several enthusiastic supporters , but not many people who were tepid : the debate was divided between “ wholehearted support and wholehearted condemnation . ”
Those who passed on the chance to sign the petition did so in a friendly way , except for one man who reportedly threatened the 80 - year - old candidate in June while covering a petition sheet with a big X .
In a test of his sway with the local police , Mr. Kevorkian obtained the man ’s license plate number and filed a police report .
Instead of springing into action , though , officers gave him a lecture on priorities .
“ We are n’t going to be doing anything with it , ” a police official said .
“ It ’s a minor crime .
We have major crimes to investigate . ”
Much to the disappointment of more than 100,000 users , Latvia 's largest BitTorrent tracker has been shut down by the authorities .
Following a joint operation by Lativa 's Economic Police and a local IFPI - affiliated anti-piracy agency , two administrators were placed under arrest .
File.lv , Latvia ’s largest BitTorrent community , was taken offline a few days ago .
The 100,000 member tracker reportedly went dark after a joint effort by the Latvian Economic Police and the IFPI - affiliated Latvian Music Producers Association , otherwise known as LAmpA .
According to various Latvian reports , the site was taken down and two of the main administrators placed under arrest .
Other gaming and sport related projects connected to the tracker also disappeared .
Reports suggest that up to 40 servers were seized .
The two admins , believed to be known as FileX and Tralivali , are believed to have been detained by the Economic Police , an outfit similar to the Dutch FIOD - ECD which was involved in the closure of OiNK .
As usual , rumors are circulating that prolific uploaders are also being investigated , although that is far from certain at this stage .
Reports indicate that in 2007 , admin ‘ FileX ’ received a letter from a German media company which requested the shutdown of File.lv .
Failing that , it was demanded that File.lv should at least block users with a German IP address , with legal action threatened should they not comply .
It ’s unclear whether or not the site complied with the request , or if the threatened action is connected to the site ’s recent disappearance .
Almost exactly 12 months ago , the Economic Police and public prosecutors met up at a ‘ cyber - crime ’ summit in Sigulda , Latvia , to discuss how piracy on the Internet could be detected and recorded in a fashion acceptable to the courts .
One of the guest lecturers at the meeting was Jeremy Banks , head of Internet anti-piracy operations at the IFPI .
With this news about File - lv , it sounds like it took them a year to get organized .
If you are Latvian and have any further updates , please email us at [ email protected ]
Update :
It appears that most of the other well known Latvian trackers that were hosted in Latvia at the time of the raid have now temporarily shut down as a precaution .
This is the first time in Latvia there have been actual arrests in connection with a torrent site .
Update2 : Additional details coming in from this report .
According to the site ’s host , 3 servers were seized .
Additionally , it ’s being reported that the site used a “ buy upload credits via SMS ” system .
During their annual summit meeting in Japan , the G8 members agreed to get the Anti-Counterfeiting Trade Agreement ( ACTA ) ready for implementation by the end of the year .
The agreement , pushed by multimillion dollar companies , will open the doors to a digital police state , much to the pleasure of the MPAA and RIAA .
This May we already posted about the leaked ACTA proposal , and it now seems that the final agreement will be ready sooner than we had hoped .
Fresh out of the G8 meetings ‘ Declaration on the World Economy ‘ , passages under the heading ‘ Protection of Intellectual Property Rights ’ suggest member states want the international anti-piracy agreement ready for implementation sooner than some expected , as it reads :
We encourage the acceleration of negotiations to establish a new international legal framework , ACTA , and seek to complete the negotiation by the end of this year .
This date is consistent ( surprise , surprise ) with that which the US Trade Representative has set as its own timetable for ACTA .
Together with some insider information that was obtained by TorrentFreak , this does n’t sound promising .
How will ACTA affect P2P users ?
So what does this mean for P2P users ?
The honest answer is that it ’s hard to be sure .
The degree of secrecy surrounding the ACTA negotiations is astonishing , blocking attempts at a variety of levels to develop a counter - strategy .
The process is deliberately avoiding both the World Trade Organisation ( WTO ) and World Intellectual Property Organisation ( WIPO ) , which now have enough member countries suspicious of the “ anti- piracy maximalist ” agenda to make ACTA ’s progress impossible .
At a recent EU meeting following the June ACTA negotiations in Geneva , a packed room of “ stakeholders ” — that is , industry representatives — were desperately trying to get information on what had made it into the June draft of ACTA while revealing as little as possible , publicly , about what they themselves wanted in it .
The Commission — on first - name terms with these industry reps , showing only too well how well regarded they are in this policy - forming process — has basically indicated that no - one will see the text of ACTA until it ’s ready to sign .
Also at this EU meeting , it was made absolutely explicit that ACTA is in large part about updating legal frameworks to take account of P2P and developments on the Internet .
The previous regime to deal with IP and piracy , TRIPS was 12 years old , officials said , and the Internet had ‘ not existed in the same way ’ when TRIPS was drafted .
In this respect , the hints we have about what might make it into ACTA from a list of suggestions the RIAA obtained by Knowledge Ecology International ( which has been double checked for veracity ) are very important .
More than any other lobby , of course , the RIAA is dealing with issues specifically related to the Net .
This gives some pointers of where ACTA could go if the anti-piracy and IP lobbies get their way .
Getting your iPod though customs …
RIAA ’s proposals for ACTA go well beyond U.S. law on the enforcement of copyrights online .
As earlier reported , they want ‘ competent authorities ’ to be able to take action at borders over pirated copies without the need for a complaint from a rights holder .
An official at the EU meeting ridiculed the ‘ iPod search ’ stories about ACTA , pointing to the EU ’s own border measures — but given U.S. border agents are already retaining and searching large amounts of laptops at borders , this is another burden for travelers who are already harassed by ridiculous “ security ” measures in the Homeland and beyond .
Those dismissing such ideas as ‘ merely ’ the wish list of the rabid anti-piracy lobbies take note : although there has only been one draft of ACTA made so far ( and no one outside the secretive gang involved has been able to see it ) , reliable sources say there is text relating to the border measures provisions .
So at least one of the RIAA ’s wishes seems , in some form , to have already made it in .
The RIAA ’s wish list for online enforcement of its ‘ rights ’ is also of great concern , not least because it implies that they would get access to private data from ISPs in order to be able to see what we ’ve been sharing .
As the year goes on , it ’s becoming clear that the P2P / IP debate is merging with the surveillance and privacy debate in ways that I think many people had n’t forseen .
We need to understand fast that enforcement of copyright is one of the main levers being used to drive a wedge into our data privacy at the international level .
RIAA and MPAA want to police the Internet
In general , what the RIAA want is ‘ harmonization ’ ( read : extension of US law over the whole world ) of the tricky Grokster ‘ inducement ’ provisions that make providers of software liable if they can be seen as inducing infringing behavior in users .
As I know personally from discussions with the RIAA about projects like VODO , interpretations of what constitutes contributory liability are very broad in the States .
What the industry wants to do is chill the rapid innovation that led to products like Napster and BitTorrent by rendering entrepreneurs uncertain about the legal status of their activities .
The fact that BitTorrent is the most efficient media reproduction and distribution system in history , used by hundreds of thousands of producers to distribute their own work outside the clutches of the corporate media cabals is , of course , not part of the picture here .
This is precisely about media conglomerates ’ desire to hang on to the tatters of their empire .
The RIAA ’s ACTA would also continue the trend towards ISPs and search engines to weed out infringing users .
RIAA expects ISPs to filter infringing materials and police offending P2 Pers , cutting off their access if necessary .
Again this points to mass surveillance of internet use that , in the light of the wiretapping controversy alread raging in the States , is utterly unacceptable in Europe or anywhere else .
How We Can Slam On The Brakes
So what can be done , and what hope do we have over ACTA ?
Well , firstly , there are internal contradictions in the process that might make its progress less than smooth .
The inclusion of the ‘ 3 strikes ’ rule for kicking P2P users from their ISP contract is a case in point — the European Parliament is actually very suspicious of the 3 strikes rule and the UK government is reportedly desperately looking for alternatives to this political hot potato , which only months ago was portrayed as a fait accompli .
This raises the possibility of a showdown between ACTA and the European Parliament .
Secondly , the European Commission has no mandate to implement criminal sanctions on copyright matters – this is down to the individual member states who will be very wary about antagonizing their electorates .
Since these criminal sanctions are seen by players like the RIAA as a key ‘ virtue ’ of ACTA – without which it would be a ‘ dodo ’ – the shakiness of the legal base for inclusion of criminal sanctions is a big issue .
Thirdly and relatedly , the secrecy around ACTA is a potential pitfall .
A mandate should have been obtained from the Commission to negotiate the Treaty , but if it exists it has been declared too secret , or at least ‘ confidential ’ to bring out .
Since this document would very likely have to include a rationale for allowing the Commission to negotiate beyond its power on criminal sanctions , it may be rather suspect .
European TorrentFreak readers should immediately write to your MEP in your Member State and ask them to request a copy of the mandate , so that we can get a copy of it online and look at how the EU justifies negotiating an ACTA that includes criminal measures .
Since the US wants ACTA to be signed before Bush leaves office , a derailing tactic like this has a good chance of working .
ACT against ACTA before it ’s too late …
One of the biggest crises facing the United States today is healthcare .
There are approximately 47 million people in the United States who have no medical insurance .
Millions more have inadequate insurance coverage , cannot afford their premiums or deductibles , and have no access to dental care .
In the wake of recent international disasters ( Myanmar and China to name the most recent ) , much publicity has focused on foreign aid .
The U.S. spends billions of dollars every year to help those less fortunate in other countries .
But are they doing enough for their own citizens ?
CBS reported on an unusual occurrence in Tennessee in February of this year .
Remote Area Medical , originally founded to provide medical aid to remote parts of the world , set up a free clinic in an exhibit hall in Knoxville .
Within hours , they had all the work they could handle as people drove hundreds of miles to camp in the parking lot , hoping to be allowed access to the free medical , dental , and optometry services offered by volunteers .
According to the American Medical Association ( AMA ) , nearly 65 % of approximately 518,195 post - residency patient care physicians provided care to the indigent in 1999 .
In a Board of Trustees Report , the AMA Foundation discussed methods to support health services for the uninsured .
Out of their recommendations it is apparent that many physicians are willing to volunteer their time and expertise to caring for indigent patients .
However , they are often required to pay for their own licensing requirements and insurances .
Because many of the physicians who volunteer are retired , these fees ( which can be quite steep ) are sometimes a deterrent to volunteerism .
One way to help those patients who cannot afford healthcare would be to take advantage of retired doctors who want to serve the poor .
States could pay licensing fees for these volunteer doctors , and could also provide insurance coverage in return for a minimum number of hours of service .
Some states have taken the initiative in offering licenses free of charge to volunteer physicians who serve only indigent patients or who serve in areas that are underserved .
Some states offer licenses at a reduced fee .
Some states have adopted legislation to limit liability of volunteers .
The Volunteer Protection Act , passed in 1997 , sets a minimum national standard for immunity laws for volunteers .
Although it sets limits on awards , it still does not provide full protection and physician volunteers , or the organizations they work for , are still responsible for medical liability insurance .
With a large number of retired physicians who are civic - minded , states could go a long way towards easing the burden of the uninsured by making it easier for retired physicians to do what they do best .

In a conventional sewage works , nanoparticles should really be bound in the sludge and should not represent a major problem in the aqueous effluent .
This is not true , however , as shown by a new study of the ceramic model material cerium dioxide .
An astonishing amount was able to leave an experimental sewage works and thus could possibly enter bodies of water .
The industry needs large amounts of cerium dioxide ( CeO 2 ) to grind computer components and mobile phone camera lenses or the lasers in CD players .
Thousands of tons of this substance are used throughout the world .
But what happens when this or other nano - substances get into the environment , especially sewage , and thereby enter sewage works ?
Is the problem solved because nanoparticles largely agglomerate , i.e. clump together ?
Particles survive unbound
Not at all , according to a new study by the research group led by Wendelin Stark , Assistant Professor at the Institute for Chemical and Bioengineering , which has just appeared in the journal “ Environmental Science and Technology ” .
The majority of the cerium dioxide particles actually do bond to the surface of bacteria in the sewage sludge and can thus be removed from the water .
However , far more particles than was assumed are able to pass through the biological separation stage .
Stark says , “ Intuitively , we presumed that practically 100 percent of the cerium oxide particles would remain trapped in the sewage sludge .
After all , the particles should form clumps and sink to the bottom . ”
Therefore at the start of the project they had thought that all the particles could simply be precipitated out .
However , through numerous experiments in a test sewage plant , the scientists discovered that up to six percent by weight of the particles entered the sewage works effluent .
Since the experiments were carried out at relatively high nanoparticle concentrations ( 100 ppm ) , the researchers suspect that agglomeration , i.e. clumping together , is likely to be impeded even more at lower concentrations .
Therefore oxide nanoparticles that get into the effluent must not be regarded as unproblematic , because the route taken by the particles after the sewage works has scarcely been researched up to now .
Bacteria help nanoparticles
The researchers at ETH Zurich , the University of Applied Sciences Wädenswil and the BMG Engineering AG Company then began a series of experiments to find out how the oxide nanoparticles pass through the sewage plant almost unimpeded .
Here again , the resear­chers met with a surprise .
Stark stresses that , “ The particles disperse astonishingly well and do not agglomerate entirely as was assumed . ”
The bacteria living in the activated sludge involuntarily share responsibility for this dispersion .
They excrete soap - like substances to avoid forming clumps with one another .
However , these anti-clumping agents and other components of the aqueous effluent also stabilise the nanoparticles .
Thus a proportion of the material is not sufficiently agglomerated and can leave the sewage works practically unchanged .
For Wendelin Stark , this research work is a stroke of luck from which all the participants have profited greatly .
The work arose from an initiative by co-author Robert Bereiter , a member of the staff of the University of Applied Sciences Wädenswil , and René Gälli of BMG Engineering .
The researchers were able to carry out the tests in the company ’s own experimental sewage plant under real conditions and in accordance with OECD standards .
The sewage sludge for the experiments originated from the activated sludge tanks of the Werdhölzli plant , Zurich ’s biggest sewage works .
Disposed of with the sewage sludge
Elisabeth Müller and Roger Wepf from the Electron Microscopy Centre ( EMEZ ) of ETH Zurich prepared electron microscope images of sewage sludge with nanoparticles , showing impressively that the nanoparticles accumulate at the surface of the bacteria .
At the same time , a large proportion of the nanoparticles remains in the sewage sludge .
In Switzerland this sludge is incinerated , but in other countries it is still used as fertiliser .
Cerium dioxide is a popular model compound for studies of this kind , and is also used industrially in rapidly increasing amounts .
Titanium oxide , a white pigment and an ingredient in many suncreams , behaves in a similar way to cerium dioxide and is already used in huge quantities .
Under the experimental conditions both substances are stabilised in a way similar to that in a sewage works .
Other soluble nanoparticles , e.g. iron oxide , are stabilised to a distinctly lesser extent .
This is why they are also easier to remove from the environment .
Wendelin Stark says , “ However , we are still at the beginning of nano - safety research .
Further investigations must follow . ”
After six years , Todd D. could n't take the tedium anymore — his company refused to change with the times , and Todd wanted something more engaging .
Seeing an opening at a publishing company , it sounded like the ideal change .
He'd be going from a big software company to a more progressive publishing company with a software department ; a good place for him to show his chops and actually make a difference .
He aced his interview , as did the company — they 'd proudly told Todd that they were happy to work with cutting - edge technology , had brand - new hardware , and a near - zero turnover rate .
It was a no - brainer for him to accept their offer .
As he was about to head in to his first day of work , he got a call from HR .
" Hi , Todd ?
I forgot to mention the dress code earlier .
You 'll have to wear a jacket and tie . "
Ugh , he thought , wondering if his suit was in presentable shape .
At his last job he'd show up in a t - shirt and shorts .
I guess I 'll have to go shopping tonight .
He dusted off his old suit , found a tie that did n't completely clash , and hopped in his car .
If having to wear a suit would be the worst thing about his new job , it would n't be so bad .
Arriving to the office , he was escorted to his new cube .
His wooden cube .
One of the owners ' sons liked to work with wood and had been contracted to build several things around the office — all of the cubes , some shelves , some tables — all of which conveyed the feeling that one was working in a coffin with shelves .
It sucked , but Todd could deal with it .
Next , he was shown the time tracking application , and introduced to the company 's related policies .
" OK , so you 're just getting in , so you click here to punch in , " the well - dressed woman from HR began .
" And when you need to punch out , like if you 're using the restroom or something , you click here . "
" Wait , " Todd began .
" I 'm supposed to punch out when I use the restroom ? "
She chuckled , " of course !
I mean , unless you plan on getting work done in the restroom !
You have to punch out any time you 're not working . "
" So if I 'm making a phone call ? "
" You punch out . "
" If I 'm stopping by the snack machine for a candy bar ? "
Todd asked in disbelief .
" You punch out . "
She seemed to think Todd was a slow learner , while Todd just could n't believe the absurdity of the policy .
It was becoming clear that she thought they should both punch out for the discussion they were currently having .
Ugh .
That 's pretty draconian .
At least I 'm salaried , he thought .
" Also , " she continued , " you have to get forty hours of punched - in time each week .
Otherwise you get docked or will have to make it up over the weekend . "
... But I 'm salaried , Todd thought .
" And if I work more than 40 hours ? " he asked .
" That 's good ; that 's what we want . "
She went on to explain what happens if more break time than is allowed is taken .
That is , every day you get 30 minutes for lunch , 15 floating minutes for other breaks ( bathroom , snack machine , etc. ) .
If you needed more than 45 minutes , you had to get a special dispensation from your boss .
In Todd 's case , his boss was the owner 's son , Quincy — who had never , ever given out a special dispensation .
If you were on fire , you 'd better finish your shift before you stopped , dropped , and rolled .
Todd was given internet access , but warned that it was closely monitored and that a lot of sites and services were blocked — for example all major free email services , all major news sites , instant messaging clients , etc .
Todd later found a program that he could use to bypass the filter and access GMail , however .
As his training was wrapping up , he was asked if he had any questions .
" Well , just one , " he said , noticing that no one had left office supplies on his desk .
" Where can I get a pen ? "
" Oh , we 'll have to get you one tomorrow . "
This 'll be good , Todd thought .
" Janice has the key to the supply cabinet , and she 's only in once a week . "
Janice was the boss 's wife .
" She 'll be in from 11:00 to noon tomorrow .
I 'll show you where the line starts . "
He 'd have to wait in line for the one hour window to get any office supplies .
And if you missed the window , you did n't get any supplies — you should 've planned better , slacker .
Either wait until next week or buy it .
After work .
At your own expense .
And to put the icing on the cake , you had to punch out while you were waiting in line .
The Last Straw
After two weeks in his coffinlike cube , Todd and the other developers were summoned to the warehouse .
As a publishing company , they had a lot of " magazine junk " that they sold — t- shirts , logo'd stuffed animals , hats , and other similar tchotchkies — and they were practically swimming in the crap .
" The reason I called you all down here is that we need to take inventory of all our promo items , " his boss began .
" So why 'd you bring all the developers down here ? "
Todd asked what everyone was thinking .
" The warehouse staff is busy fulfilling orders .
Fulfilling orders makes us money ; fixing bugs in our software does n't .
I 'm going to need you guys to count and sort everything . "
Todd rolled his eyes , knowing that most of the warehouse staff were friends with the boss 's sons and had probably leveraged that to get out of inventory duty .
Todd knew that protesting this would get him nowhere , as they already had a crappy work environment with crappy management .
" Can we at least wear something more comfortable while we work ? "
" ... I did n't say anything about our dress code changing , " the boss replied with a sinister smile .
All of the developers had their changes put on hold and started going through dirty , grimy boxes under the boss 's unblinking eye .
Todd 's suit got covered in dust , cardboard fibers , and bits of tape , not to mention that everyone was getting sweaty in the hot warehouse in suits and ties , climbing up 20 feet of shelves ( that had been cobbled together by the owner 's son ) , carrying 50 lb boxes of stupid crap that no one could ever want .
Todd figured that his boss had a printout of OSHA regulations and had made it his goal to break every single one .
By the end of the day , everyone 's clothes were ruined ( as were their spirits ) .
Todd was so fed up and pissed off that he decided he'd treat himself to the unthinkable — leaving three minutes early .
He figured that he'd earned one hundred and eighty seconds of malfeasance , plus he could n't take another minute of being sweaty and miserable in his coffin cubicle .
All that he had on his mind was his frustration , and the desire to treat himself to a good dinner , a long shower , and an early bedtime .
The following day , Todd was called into his boss 's office .
" Todd , do you know why you 're in here ? "
Before he could answer , his boss continued .
" You 're in here because you left three minutes early yesterday .
Why do n't you walk me through what you were thinking . "
Again , before he could answer , his boss answered for him .
" I know what you were n't thinking .
You were n't thinking ' I should ask for my boss 's permission to leave early .
I think I should be allowed to leave whenever I please . ' "
The voice he was giving to Todd 's internal monologue had a nasally , sing - song tone .
" And , " he continued , " you were also thinking , ' I should n't have to do any work .
I should be allowed to use the internet whenever I want , however I want . '
Yeah , we know you 're looking at blocked web sites . "
He leaned forward in his chair .
" Listen , Todd .
You 've got a bad attitude .
It 's almost like you do n't like working here . "
That was the first thing he 'd gotten right so far .
At this point , Todd decided to end the relationship by formally giving his two minutes ' notice .
On his way out , he suggested his boss do something anatomically impossible .
On Hardball today , Matthews talked about Obama 's excellent interaction with the military in Afghanistan and Iraq .
The Politico's Roger Simon , a Villager extraordinaire said that the middle east trip is going swimmingly so far .
Andrea Mitchell did confirm that Maliki indeed backed Obama on his Iraq plans because he brought up Obama 's name by himself in his interview over the weekend earlier in the interview , but then she said a very odd thing about his " message management " as some footage of Obama played in the background on MSNBC .
Download Download ( h/t Heather )
Andrea :
Let me say something about his message management .
He did n't have reporters with him .
He did n't have a press pool .
He did n't do a press conference while he was on the ground either on Afghanistan or Iraq .
What you 're seeing is not reporters brought in , you 're seeing selected pictures taken by the military , questioned by the military and what some would call fake interviews because they 're not interviews with a journalist so there 's a real press issue here .
Politically it 's smart as can be , but we 've not seen a Presidential candidate do this in my recollection ever before .
I do n't think journalism is the prime thing that we recruit them and pay them for .
She was upset because she was n't " present " during these interviews .
You mean you were n't able to get a gotcha moment ?
When she says " what some would call " I guess she means herself .
Will Andrea go on a limb and say every interview on FOX News is not legitimate when Cheney , Bush or McCain appear ?
How about when she joins O'Reilly ?
Or when someone is interviewed on a blog ?
The Daily Show has some very interesting interviews , does that not count ?
Is the military not capable of performing interviews ?
Where does she draw the line ?
Saying they are " fake interviews " really goes too far .
I 've emailed Obama 's campaign for a response .
Splenda is not satisfying — at least according to the brain .
A new study found that even when the palate cannot distinguish between the artificial sweetener and sugar , our brain knows the difference .
At the University of California , San Diego , 12 women underwent functional MRI while sipping water sweetened with either real sugar ( sucrose ) or Splenda ( sucralose ) .
Sweeteners , real or artificial , bind to and stimulate receptors on the taste buds , which then signal the brain via the cranial nerve .
Although both sugar and Splenda initiate the same taste and pleasure pathways in the brain — and the subjects could not tell the solutions apart — the sugar activated pleasure - related brain regions more extensively than the Splenda did .
In particular , “ the real thing , the sugar , elicits a much greater response in the insula , ” says the study ’s lead author , psychiatrist Guido Frank , now at the University of Colorado at Denver .
The insula , involved with taste , also plays a role in enjoyment by connecting regions in the reward system that encode the sensation of pleasantness .
Although Splenda elicits less overall activity within the brain , the researchers were surprised to find that the artificial sweetener seems to inspire more communication between these regions .
“ Looking at the connection between the taste areas , Splenda is stronger , ” Frank says .
He suggests that when we taste Splenda , the reward system becomes activated but not satiated .
“ Our hypothesis is that Splenda has less of a feedback mechanism to stop the craving , to get satisfied . ”
If that theory plays out , there could be implications for those who use artificial sweeteners as a weight - control aid .
Recent research indeed suggests a correlation between artificial sweetener intake and compromised health .
In one large survey , diet soda consumption was found to be associated with elevated cardiovascular and metabolic disease risk .
A different study reveals a possible mechanism behind this effect : rats that were fed artificially sweetened yogurt in addition to their regular feed ended up eating more and gaining more weight than rats that ate yogurt with real sugar .
The study ’s authors suggest that exposure to an artificial sweetener may undermine the brain ’s ability to track calories and to determine when to stop eating .
“ There is good evidence that the brain responds differently to artificial sweeteners , and you should take that into account when designing weight - loss programs , ” Frank says .
The team plans to extend this research to elucidate mechanisms that underlie eating disorders .

4 Reasons Why Germany Is A Renewable Energy Success Story
July 29th , 2008 by Ariel Schwartz
–> Also see our much newer article : 10 Huge Lessons We ’ve Learned From Solar Power Success In Germany .
And keep an eye on all of our Germany stories to really stay up to date on Germany ’s renewable energy success .
A few weeks ago , I visited Intersolar North America , an exhibition for photovoltaics , solar thermal technology , and solar thermal architecture .
The exhibition , which was previously only held in Germany , had an understandably large German presence ( including a large beer garden ) .
During my time there , I stopped by the German Energy Agency booth , and was quite impressed with what I found .
So , without further ado , here are 4 reasons why we should be paying a whole lot of attention to the Germany renewable energy market .
1. Germany has the world ’s largest wind power sector — but had barely any notable wind power at all 16 years ago .
With over 20,600 MW of installed capacity , Germany is the world ’s wind power leader .
And they accomplished this feat pretty quickly , having had less than 100 MW in 1992 .
The second place wind leader , Spain , only has approximately 12,000 MW of capacity .
2 . The country has the world ’s second largest solar power market , despite having extremely cloudy weather .
Germany comes in as number 2 for solar power , with 750 MW of peak capacity as of 2006 .
However , it is far and away the European leader for photovoltaic capacity , with a capacity of 3063 MW .
Additionally , the world ’s largest solar cell producer ( Q - Cells ) is located there .
Oh , and the country also has the largest solar thermal market in Europe .
3 . Over 214,000 people work in the German domestic renewable energy industry .
With 2.3 million renewable energy workers worldwide , Germany once again takes the cake as a pioneering country .
Last year , German companies accounted for 38 percent of the total wind energy market .
4 . They have progressive renewable energy laws .
The German government has just agreed on a new climate change legislative package with the goal of reducing CO2 emissions up to 36 percent by 2020 .
German Environment Minister Sigmar Gabriel calls it the biggest climate change package in the world .

CHICAGO ( Reuters ) -
The latest U.S. natural disaster is triggering fresh rounds of concern and debate about how to repair America ’s aging infrastructure .
The topsoil of a corn field is washed away near Cambridge , Iowa , June 27 , 2008 .

The worst Midwest flooding since 1993 has generated images of swamped towns , cracked roads , washed - out bridges , overwhelmed dams , failed levees , broken sewage systems , stunted crops and water - logged refugees .
The losses are in the billions of dollars and still mounting , as the costs of crop losses alone send shocks through the inflation - wracked world food system and threaten insurers .
The disaster has reminded policymakers of the decrepit state of U.S. infrastructure , stirring concerns similar to those following the deadly Minneapolis bridge collapse in 2007 and the flooding of New Orleans after Hurricane Katrina in 2005 .
Even before the latest flooding , a group representing engineers said the United States needed to spend about $ 1 trillion more than it does now to bring infrastructure up to par with modern needs and standards .
“ The patch - and - pray approach simply wo n’t succeed , ” said David Mongan , head of the American Society of Civil Engineers .
But the group also said its five - year cost estimate was outdated and does not count the price of new roads , rails , and sewers required by a growing population , nor the cost to repair damage inflicted by the recent Midwest floods .
President George W. Bush has asked Congress for $ 1.8 billion to boost funds for flood recovery but it is unclear how much of that money will end up in infrastructure repair .
Presidential candidates vying to succeed him have each promised quick action in Congress and offered some ideas for the larger task of repairing infrastructure .
Democratic presidential candidate Barack Obama has proposed creating a $ 60 billion fund for infrastructure projects , funded by money saved by a promised withdrawal from the war in Iraq .
“ This can be the moment when we make a generational commitment to rebuild our infrastructure , ” Obama told business executives in Pittsburgh last week .
EVERYWHERE YOU LOOK
Each need sounds dire : new wastewater treatment so sewage does not taint the same waterways that supply drinking water ; repairs or replacements for thousands of corroded bridges ; new and repaired dams and levees that will not fail ; and upgrades to airports and air traffic control .
“ We need profound changes , ” said engineer Kumares Sinha of Purdue University .
“ We ca n’t live in a fool ’s paradise . ”
While rising economic powers China and India build highways and other large projects , U.S. infrastructure -- once the envy of the world -- has fallen into decline , Sinha said .
Two federal commissions since Katrina have tackled the issue and Congress is mulling proposals for a full - scale assessment of the nation ’s infrastructure needs and an infrastructure “ bank ” to loan money for projects .
But Sinha and other experts said the analysis should go deeper to reflect an economy likely to face higher fuel prices for the foreseeable future .
Policymakers need to consider new methods of reducing road congestion , for example , whether by charging more to use them or exacting fees for entering city centers , which will generate revenue for mass transit .
The nation also may have to reconsider its lukewarm commitment to passenger rail service , experts said .
Government funding for some infrastructure needs has declined , such as for wastewater plants .
Municipalities hike taxes or fees to repair ancient pipes prone to bursting .
“ Everybody is drinking somebody ’s waste water , ” said Susan Bruninga of the National Association of Clean Water Agencies .
The state of Illinois is weighing its first capital improvement project in a decade , hoping to back $ 31 billion in bonds by leasing the lottery and building a casino in Chicago .
More immediate priorities will emerge as Midwest floodwaters recede .
People in some small towns in Indiana and Illinois are still virtually cut off because of flooded or damaged roads , officials said .
Bridges that were already suspect received a battering from surging floodwaters , requiring thorough inspections .
Scores of river levees were overtopped or gave way , while others were weakened and may need replacing , said Timothy Kusky , a flood expert at Saint Louis University .
A repeat of the flooding is likely because climate change will make the Midwest wetter in the next 30 years , he said .

Sales of organic foods and beverages are expected to average about 18 % growth through 2010 , though growth recently has been slowed by the economy .
High gas and food prices appear to be nibbling away at the high growth rates long enjoyed by organic and natural food makers and sellers .
Sales growth has slowed but remains strong because of the loyalty of core organic buyers , some industry executives say .
They also say new customers are tougher to attract , given that organics can cost 10 % to 50 % more than non-organic rivals .
" Most of us are seeing slightly slower growth , but we 're still seeing growth , " says Gary Hirshberg , CEO of Stonyfield Farm , a leading organic yogurt maker .
He expects 18 % revenue growth this year , up from 16 % last year but down from 24 % - plus in past years .
Others also recently reported slower growth than Wall Street analysts anticipated , including Whole Foods Market , the largest retailer of organic and natural foods , and Lifeway Foods , maker of dairy drink Kefir .
In a weak economy , " New organic customers will be more cautious , " says George Siemon , CEO of Organic Valley Family of Farms , the USA 's largest cooperative of organic farmers .
Siemon also says existing organic buyers may cut purchases of discretionary items , such as organic ice cream , but stay true to basics , such as organic milk and meat .
He earlier targeted 24 % growth this year for Organic Valley .
Now , he 's looking for 22 % .
The co-op had 30 % growth last year .
Sales of organic foods and beverages are expected to reach $ 24 billion this year , and average about 18 % annual growth through 2010 , says the Organic Trade Association .
Almost 70 % of U.S. shoppers bought something organic over a recent three - month period , says Laurie Demeritt , president of market researcher The Hartman Group .
She says Hartman 's consumer survey earlier this year showed that organic use has been leveling off since 2006 , a trend she expected to continue this year , given the economy .
Market researcher Information Resources , in a May survey of 1,000 consumers , also found that 52 % said they were buying fewer organic products because of cost .
Organics are also seeing increased competition from " locally grown " products , whether they 're organic or not , Demeritt says .
Organic companies , meanwhile , face more rivals as retailers have launched organic brands , says Hirshberg .
Wal - Mart and Wegmans say organic sales are holding steady .
One consumer who 's economizing is Sara Smith of Walnut Creek , Calif .
She 's recently gone from buying organic at least half the time to only when products are on sale or if there 's no alternative .
She and her husband are attorneys , but with three kids and higher expenses , " I 'm trying to cut back . "

Many people reading this blog from states with moderate housing prices have a very hard time understanding how a family earning $ 100,000 a year is having a challenging time staying in the middle class ranks .
The idea of a six - figure income certainly does n’t connote the same wealthy status as it did a decade ago .
But where is all the money going then ?
Now that we are quickly approaching the great Wal - Mart voucher stimulus revolution and will see our accounts increase by $ 600 to $ 2,400 depending on our family situation , once we look at the cost of monthly items we realize that this money is a drop in the bucket for most Americans .
In fact , there is so much debt out there that many are now saying they ’ll use the money to pay off current debt or save ; certainly not the intention of what the current government has in mind .
They would love nothing more if you went and blew your stimulus check on a new laptop or stove and one month later , are back in the same spot .
This is the problem with deficit spending on many levels .
At a certain point debt will crush an economy if it is not handled properly .
We have done an abysmal job managing debt over the past few decades and now we are seeing the after effects of this .
Today I want to put out a hypothetical budget for a family with 2 kids earning $ 100,000 a year and show you how easily it is to go into debt .
This data is conservative and I will talk about a few of major line items later in the article .
So now I present to you going broke on $ 100,000 a year :
We ’ll go into detail on a few line items .
First , I want to show you that the above family is running a deficit of $ 1,076 per month .
Nothing unusual from the above profile .
Family bought a modest home in Southern California , has 2 cars , and has many of the items we would associate with middle class living .
They also save a modest amount for retirement in their 401 ( k ) and pay taxes unlike Blade .
They have additional expenses with healthcare , feel the pinch of higher gasoline , and are seeing their grocery bill increase .
We are assuming that the above family purchased a $ 385,000 home here in Southern California with a down payment of $ 35,000 .
As many of you may know , over the past decade many families bought with zero , 3 , or 5 percent down so we are in fact being conservative with the above number .
If we were to use a smaller down payment the actual monthly debt would increase .
$ 385,000 does not buy much home in Southern California .
In fact , only until 2008 and the ongoing correction in prices , was $ 385,000 considered chump change and you ’d be lucky to get a condo for this price in a safe neighborhood with good schools , something a family with kids would be concerned about .
Where did I get this $ 385,000 number ?
I simply pulled it out of data from March 2008 sales :
“ The median price paid for a Southland home was $ 385,000 last month , the lowest since $ 380,000 in April 2004 .
Last month ’s median was down 5.6 percent from February ’s $ 408,000 , and down a record 23.8 percent from $ 505,000 in February 2007 .
That peak median of $ 505,000 was reached several times last spring and summer . ”
You ’ll also notice that prices for Southern California are now back down to April 2004 levels .
Of course prices at this point were in a bubble so assuming we are at a bottom is naïve and ignoring the actual foreclosures and trends that we will be seeing for another few years .
California property taxes are capped at 1 percent of the assessed value of the home plus local area bonded indebtedness :
“ In 1978 , California voters passed Proposition 13 , which substantially reduced property tax rates .
As a result , the maximum levy cannot exceed 1 % of a property ’s assessed value ( plus bonded indebtedness and direct assessment taxes ) .
Increases in assessed value are limited to 2 % annually . ”
In the above we are using a 1.25 % tax rate which includes local area bonds , again a somewhat conservative assessment .
I want to point out that I ’ve been hearing on the radio companies looking to help you reassess your property to lower your rate .
Through Proposition 8 ( not to be confused with Preparation H ) you can do this on your own :
“ · You must demonstrate that on January 1 , the market value of your property was less than its current assessed value .
You must file a claim form for a Decline - in - Value Reassessment Application ( Prop.8 ) with the Assessor between January 1 and December 31 for the fiscal year beginning on July 1 .
If December 31 falls on a Saturday , Sunday , or a legal holiday , an application is valid if either filed or mailed and postmarked by the next business day . ”
So save yourself some money and do it yourself .
Just run the numbers , in the end you are probably saving a few hundred dollars to maybe a thousand a year .
Why not use your rebate check to reassess your property !
The ironic fact about this is you are still going to pay an appraiser to tell you your property is worth less which if you own a home in Southern California and bought in recent years , is probably the reality .
The next item we are looking at closely is fuel prices .
People drive around a lot in Southern California especially in Los Angeles .
The current Los Angeles average is $ 3.85 a gallon :
We ’ll assume that you tack on 15,000 miles per year per car .
I put on a bit over this and your numbers of course will vary .
We ’ll assume that both cars get 25 miles per gallon .
So how much money are you spending a year on fuel ?
( 15,000 /25mpg ) = 600 gallons x $ 3.85 = $ 2,310 per car X 2 = $ 4,620 per year or $ 385 per month
I ’ll leave the $ 300 per month fuel cost since you may have more economical vehicles and may also drive less but the above equation is simply to give you an idea that we are being extremely conservative here .
Plus , how many mega gas guzzlers do you see on the freeway or streets in your neighborhood ?
Clearly the price can go much higher .
You know many people forget to include the additional costs of owning a home .
When plumbing goes bad you have to pay to get it fixed .
If your roof needs to be replaced , that comes out of your wallet .
What about lawn services ?
Garbage pickup ?
There are many other unforeseen costs associated with owning a home which many people simply do not factor into their budget .
They simply assume the principal and interest is all they ’ll need to worry about .
Also , which impacts both homeowner and renter , is the rise in energy costs for homes .
Again this eats away at your bottom line .
That rebate check makes no impact for the average American because the above line items seem like they are here to stay for the foreseeable future .
What if you want to send your kids to college ?

Where are you going to save for that given that the above hypothetical family is already running a $ 1,076 deficit ?
If you pull back on say cable that will create job losses in certain areas connected to this field .
Maybe you cut back on clothing .
Retailers are already seeing this pain .
And in fact , that is what we are seeing even with the recent announcement that Target is seeing an increase in their charge - off rate :
Calculated Risk : “ Target Corp. , the second - largest U.S. discount chain , said it wrote off 8.1 percent of its credit - card loans in March as consumers grappled with job losses and the biggest housing slump in a quarter century .
Defaults during the month totaled $ 55.5 million , the Minneapolis - based retailer said in a regulatory filing today .
The charge - off rate was 6.8 percent in February . ”
And there you have it .
Going broke with a $ 100,000 income .
And these people are n’t the folks leasing BMWs or Lexus cars but living a more modest middle class lifestyle .
The fact of the matter is , life just got a whole lot more expensive because your green dollar in your wallet is magically disappearing and we do n’t need David Blaine for that kind of magic .
You can thank the true magicians on Wall Street and Washington D.C. for that .

Fabiana Murer of Brazil competes during her women 's pole vault of the athletics competition in the National Stadium at the Beijing 2008 Olympic Games August 18 , 2008 .

BEIJING ( Reuters ) -
The women ’s Olympic pole vault final was held up on Monday when Brazilian Fabiana Murer could not find the pole she wanted to jump with .
Murer said she was forced to use a pole that was too long as she failed in her three attempts to clear 4.65 meters , after she was unable to find the right pole among those she had brought to the stadium .
“ It was n’t possible .
I had to have that one pole .
It was n’t on the track and I do n’t know where it was , ” she said .
The 27 - year - old Murer said she intended to protest to Beijing organizers .
At one point during the dispute Murer stood on the runway blocking the path of China ’s Gao Shuying , who was preparing to jump .
Murer rummaged through the poles and talked with officials and her coach for 10 - 15 minutes before competition restarted .
The competition was won by Russia ’s Yelena Isinbayeva with a world record leap of 5.05 meters .
In a Tuesday interview in Britain , Sky News editor Adam Boulton asked George W. Bush : “ There are those who would say look , lets take Guantanamo Bay , and Abu Ghraib , and rendition and all those things and to them that is the complete opposite of freedom . ”
BUSH : “ Of course , if you want to slander America . ”
This is the same tripe Bush has been shoveling ever since the Abu Ghraib photos first surfaced in 2004 .
Anyone who accurately labels Bush ’s policies slanders America .
Sadly , there are still some Americans who swallow this crap .
Unfortunately , Bush has gotten away with bastardizing American freedom for six years now .
It ’s great that a British journalist had the guts to ask Bush the kind of question that American White House correspondents almost never touch .

ON A dazzling morning in April , the Playa de Bakio , a Spanish fishing boat , limped into paradisal Port Victoria in the Seychelles , damaged by grenades .
Its crew of 26 was shaken .
A Spanish military aircraft flew them to momentary fame in Spain .
The fishermen had been held by Somali pirates for a week and freed after a ransom of $ 1.2 m — so it was rumoured — was paid , in contravention of Spanish law .
The boat , a big industrial vessel known as a purse seiner , was easy prey .
The pirates attacked on a speedboat launched from a mother ship , a captured Asian fishing ship known as a longliner .
Once on board , they regaled the crew with tales of famine in their villages .
Some of the Spaniards felt sorry for them .
When one of the pirates stripped his shirt off , “ he was all bones , no meat at all , ” said a Basque crewman .
The Spaniards were less enamoured of the pirates when they threatened them with machineguns and knives .
“ They valued life less than cockroaches , ” said the skipper .
The boat was fishing for skipjack tuna — a staple for sandwiches — across the Indian Ocean .
Critics suggested that it was too close to Somali waters , but the boat 's log recorded it as 247 nautical miles ( 457 km ) off Somalia 's shore when the pirates struck , well outside the official economic exclusion zone that extends 200 nautical miles .
Spain banned its fishermen from entering Somali waters two years ago .
The boat 's insurance would have been void if it had done so .
Longliners , which are quite small , do fish illegally in Somali waters , especially in the months after October when monsoon winds draw tuna from across the Indian Ocean .
Packed with ice , they try to catch a few tonnes of the more valuable sort of tuna , known as bigeye and yellowfin , while the bigger purse seiners like the Playa de Bakio , most of which are European , sweep up hundreds of tonnes of less valuable skipjack tuna outside Somalia 's waters .
Many cheating longliners are from Taiwan and Indonesia ; others are from Sri Lanka , Thailand and elsewhere .
With blurred markings , they transfer their catch at sea to bigger cargo ships or bribe officials to land their catch illegally in African ports .
There may be a thousand or more of them in the Indian Ocean , unchecked and untraceable .
Some buy licences from Somali warlords .
A few arm their boats with anti-aircraft guns big enough to blow an approaching pirate skiff out of the water .
Jolly Roger , Somali- style
While these so - called “ bio- pirates ” strip Africa 's waters of a valuable and sustainable resource , the more conventional pirates terrorise one of the world 's busiest shipping lanes .
All ships heading south after passing through the Suez Canal must ply the waters between Somalia , a failed state , and Yemen , where civil strife has been increasing .
This is now one of the world 's most dangerous passages .
The International Maritime Bureau advises ships to keep 200 nautical miles off Somalia .
As the attack on the Playa de Bakio shows , that is not far away enough .
There were at least 50 recorded pirate attacks in it last year ; some go unreported after ransoms have been paid .
This year 's tally is likely to be twice as high .
In the past ten days , a Ukrainian and a German ship have been freed after paying ransoms to Somali pirates thought to be $ 800,000 and $ 750,000 respectively .
Piracy is plainly spreading more widely across the Indian Ocean .
Tanzania reported 14 attacks off its shores last year .
Officials in the Comoro Islands say pirates are looking to use their country to attack tankers passing through the Mozambique Channel .
The costs of avoidance are high .
Captain Twalib Khamis , harbour master of Mombasa , Kenya's ( and east Africa 's ) busiest port , says that avoiding pirates adds two or three days ' sailing for container ships passing through the Gulf of Aden to Mombasa .
Higher insurance premiums push costs up even higher .
There are knock - on effects too : most cruise ships , for instance , feel obliged to steer clear of east Africa altogether .
But the pirates ' biggest victim has been Somalia itself .
Some 2.6 m of the country 's 8 m people depend on food aid that comes by sea .
French , Danish and Dutch naval ships have escorted ships carrying food from Mombasa to Mogadishu , Somalia 's capital , for the UN's World Food Programme , but it is a fragile supply line .
In May , a Jordanian freighter , the Victoria , carrying sugar for displaced people , disappeared 56 km ( 35 miles ) off Mogadishu before being freed a week later .
It is hard for the UN to find shipowners willing to take the risk without an armed escort .
After Somalia 's collapse into civil war in 1991 , some Somalis began to steal the odd small fishing boat .
These days the pirates are a lot more sophisticated and better organised , with powerful speedboats , mother ships in the high seas , heavy weapons , satellite equipment , and negotiators abroad who handle ransoms .
They target bigger ships at night , lighting up the sky with tracers , heavy - machinegun fire and rocket - propelled grenades .
Captured vessels are usually sailed into Somali waters until a ransom is paid .
A Danish icebreaker , the Svitzer Korsakov , bound for Kamchatka in Russia 's far east , recently spent six weeks off the Somali coast after pirates captured it ; its crew was fed with goats ferried from the parched shore and slaughtered aboard .
The Ukrainian ship freed last week had been held for nearly seven weeks .
Blow them out of the water
In June a unanimously - backed UN Security Council resolution tabled by France and the United States made it legal for foreign navies to chase pirates into Somali waters and , if need be , sink them .
But many Somalis are loth to co-operate .
Their feeble government lacks the clout to tackle pirates in such places as Haradheere , in central Somalia , where many hail from .
Somalis ask why the UN is so worried about the fate of foreigners at sea , while it does so little to help Somalis on land .
In any event , Somalia is not the pirates ' sole base .
They operate out of Yemen too .
Pirates from both countries have teamed up with smuggling gangs based elsewhere in Africa who deal in ivory , rhino horn and diamonds from Africa 's interior , says Christian Nelleman , a UN anti-poaching expert .
The illicit goods pass through Somalia and on to Yemeni ports such as Mukalla and Balhaf , thence across Yemen 's rugged Hadhramaut mountains and on by various routes to China .
So far foreign navies have had only occasional successes .
Earlier this year a French yacht , Le Ponant , was seized by pirates with a crew of 30 while sailing from its winter waters in the Seychelles to the Mediterranean .
France 's president , Nicolas Sarkozy , ordered Djibouti - based French commandos into action .
A ransom of $ 2 m was paid .
The pirates freed the yacht and dispersed .
One group , speeding away through the Somali desert in a jeep , was tracked down by a French helicopter , shot up , and extradited to France to face trial .
Western intelligence services are less worried about the growing cost to global shipping than the possibility that the pirates may link up with , or turn into , Islamist terrorists .
The Americans are paying Lloyd 's List , a London - based shipping newspaper , for data on shipping movements in the area .
They have captured Abd al - Rashim al - Nashiri , al - Qaeda 's mastermind for attacks at sea , and are seeking the death penalty for him .
He is accused of organising the attack on the USS Cole in Aden in 2000 , when 17 American sailors were killed , and another on a French tanker , the Limburg , in 2002 .
Port security in Aden and Mombasa has been stepped up .
African governments have yet to realise that they will have to do more themselves .
East Africa does not have a single warship in good shape .
Tanzania 's navy chief , Brigadier Said Omar , says that his fleet never reaches the high seas ; its operational range is 20 nautical miles .
When asked to describe his ships he laughs sadly .
“ Ships ?
We do n't have ships .
We have very old , very small boats . ”
Peter Kivuyo , Tanzania 's police marine chief , says his force might reach five nautical miles offshore “ if the waves are small ” .
His men do not even have binoculars .
After President George Bush visited Tanzania earlier this year , some hints were dropped — so far to no avail — that some high - speed interceptor boats might come in handy .
Africa may have to look to South Africa , the continent 's sole coastal country between the Red Sea and the Cape with a proper navy .
Western governments seem reluctant to invest in anti-pirate measures .
So far the pirates seem well ahead in an increasingly lethal and costly game .
Inspired by the discussion of my fable , and specifically a comment of Ronald de Wolf , today I decided to do some amateur political science .
Specifically , I created a scatterplot that ranks 156 of the world ’s countries ( those for which data was available ) along two axes :
Their “ political freedom ” , as rated by Freedom House ‘s 2008 Freedom in the World survey .
This is a 0 - to - 100 scale , which includes 60 points for various civil liberties ( such as freedom of speech and freedom of religion ) and 40 points for various political rights ( such as transparent elections ) .
( Note that I used the raw scores , rather than the less informative 1 - to - 7 rankings . )
Their “ economic freedom ” , as rated by the Heritage Foundation and Wall Street Journal ‘s 2008 Index of Economic Freedom .
This is also a 0 - to - 100 scale , which ranks the sorts of things libertarians and laissez - faire economists love : free trade , deregulation , privatization , low taxes and tariffs , low or nonexistent minimum wage , etc .
The motivation was simple .
Among educated people , political freedom is universally acknowledged as both good and important , whereas economic freedom ( as defined by Heritage and the Wall Street Journal ) is not .
Indeed , a huge fraction of the disagreement between liberals and conservatives — at least over economics — seems to boil down to a single question :
Is economic freedom ( again , as defined by Heritage / WSJ ) the friend or enemy of political freedom ?
On one side of this question , we have Milton Friedman :
Historical evidence speaks with a single voice on the relation between political freedom and a free market .
I know of no example in time or place of a society that has been marked by a large measure of political freedom that has not also used something comparable to a free market to organize the bulk of economic activity .
( From Capitalism and Freedom , quoted by Wu and Davis )
On the other side we have anti-globalization activists like Naomi Klein ( author of The Shock Doctrine ) , who say that “ economic freedom ” simply means the freedom of multinational corporations to exploit the public , and as such is incompatible with political freedom .
Klein argues that free - market economic policies almost never win democratically , and hence the ruling elites have had to force these policies on unwilling populations using strong - arm tactics of the World Bank and IMF , cynical exploitation of wars , hurricanes , and other disasters , and ( when all else fails ) state - sponsored torture and murder .
My modest goal was to use the available cross-country data to test these two hypotheses .
But before we get to that , a few caveats .
Caveat # 1 : I know full well that the questions I ’m talking about have already been studied in great detail by professional political scientists .
Google Scholar turned up Lundström 2005 doing a correlational study between the Freedom House index and various components of the Economic Freedom of the World index ( which is similar to the Heritage index ) , as well as Wu and Davis 1999 , Wu and Davis 2005 , Berggren 2003 , Carbone 2007 , and lots more .
( Though see also Doucouliagos 2005 for evidence of publication bias in this area . )
So why bother to reinvent the wheel ?
A few answers :
This project was really just a way to procrastinate .
I like making charts .
My methods were somewhat different from those in the published literature .
Rather than using the accepted methodology of the social sciences — which consists of reducing all questions to chi-squared significance tests — I felt free to use my own Doofus Methodology , which consists of staring at graphs and seeing if something pops out at me .
After careful deliberation , I decided on the latter methodology for three reasons .
First , ultimately I only care about correlations that are strong enough to be obvious to the naked eye .
Second , I might actually know something about some of the countries in question — they ’re not just interchangeable data points — and given how informal this study was anyway , I saw no reason to jettison that knowledge .
Third , as we ’ll see , when we ’re asking about the best forms of government , doing regression analysis on all the countries that happen to exist today can be seriously misleading .
To put it bluntly , the majority of countries are so abysmal in terms of both economic freedom and political freedom , that trying to gain insight from them into a hypothesized tradeoff between the two freedoms is like studying a remedial class of second - graders to find out whether algebraic or geometric insight is more important for winning the Fields Medal .
It ’s the outlier countries , the Singapores and Icelands , that should interest us at least as much as the pack .
Caveat # 2 : The problems with the Freedom House and Heritage surveys — and for that matter , any surveys that try to rank countries on some linear scale of “ freedom ” — are evident .
Indeed , reading the survey methodologies , I found plenty of things to complain about , as I ’m sure you would as well .
Nevertheless , both surveys struck me as ( 1 ) having reasonably consistent methodologies , ( 2 ) being reasonably well - accepted by social scientists , and ( 3 ) giving results that agree pretty well with intuition , for most of the countries I know something about .
So lacking a better alternative , I decided to go along with these indices .
Just to double - check , I also looked at the Freedom House index versus the Economic Freedom of the World index , and the plot was extremely similar to the one versus the Heritage index .
Caveat # 3 : A major limitation of my scatterplot is that it only looks at the world of 2008 , and disregards a vast wealth of historical examples ( Chile under Pinochet , the US under Reagan… ) .
Future research by amateur procrastinating bloggers should clearly take the available historical data into account as well .
Granting all of this , what can we potentially learn ?
1. Political and economic freedom are correlated .
Any doofus could have predicted this , and lo and behold , it ’s apparent from even a glance at the data .
Looking at the countries in question , it seems clear that part of this correlation is due to both freedoms being correlated with economic development , i.e. “ having your national shit together . ”
In a country like Denmark , you can criticize the government and start a business .
In a country like North Korea , you can neither criticize the government nor start a business , at least without being shot .
The studies I linked to above claim some evidence that this obvious correlation has a causal component , as follows : by and large , economic freedom helps make countries richer , and being richer helps make them more politically free .
Assuming that claim is correct , score one for Milton Friedman .
2 . A wide range of economic freedom levels is compatible with a “ near - maximal ” level of political freedom .
Let ’s look only at the countries on the far right of the scatterplot — those with “ US - or - above ” levels of political freedom ( Australia , Austria , Bahamas , Barbados , Belgium , Canada , Chile , Cyprus , Czech Republic , Denmark , Estonia , Finland , Germany , Iceland , Ireland , Luxembourg , Malta , Netherlands , New Zealand , Norway , Portugal , Spain , Sweden , Switzerland , UK , US , and Uruguay ) .
Here the correlation between economic and political freedom seems to disappear entirely , or even become slightly negative .
The economic freedom scores of these countries range from 64.3 to 82.4 , which is almost half of the total spread across all countries on earth ( excepting a few dictatorships like North Korea , Cuba , and Zimbabwe ) .
More to the point , this list includes countries commonly regarded as “ socialist ” in contemporary political debate ( like the Scandinavian countries ) , and countries regarded as “ capitalist ” ( like Australia , Chile , and the US ) .
Thus , the idea that countries that already have a high level of political freedom , would increase their political freedom even more by lowering taxes , privatizing industries , etc. , does not seem to be borne out by this dataset .
3 . There might be a “ Pareto curve of freedom ” : that is , a basic tension between economic and political freedom that prevents them from being maximized simultaneously .
I ’ll admit that the evidence on this point is inconclusive .
Firstly , there are n’t enough data points ; secondly , the lack of any example of a country maximizing both freedoms is obviously not an impossibility proof .
A true believer in Ayn Rand ’s utopia , like a true believer in Marxism , could always disregard any empirical finding by saying that the right experiment has never been tried yet , and would self - evidently succeed if it were .
However , if we do construct the “ Pareto curve of freedom ” for the Freedom House / Heritage data , what we find is this :
Iceland , with economic freedom score of 76.5 and political freedom score of 100
Canada , with economic freedom score of 80.2 and political freedom score of 99
Ireland , with economic freedom score of 82.4 and political freedom score of 97
Singapore , with economic freedom score of 87.4 and political freedom score of 49
( The US is conspicuously not on the Pareto curve , though wounded patriots can console themselves that it ’s the only country of anywhere near its population size that comes close . )
Note that Hong Kong is not in this dataset , since as part of China , it is n’t ranked separately by Freedom House .
However , Heritage gives Hong Kong an economic freedom score of 90.3 , which is the highest in the world ( Singapore is # 2 ) .
The political freedom score for China itself is a dismal 18 .
So , if we assigned Hong Kong the point ( 18,90.3 ) , that would be a fifth point on the Pareto curve .
To check the robustness of the Pareto curve , I recalculated it using the Economic Freedom in the World index in place of the Heritage index .
The result was basically similar : clustered on the right we find Finland , Iceland , and Luxembourg maximizing political freedom , then Canada , then Switzerland , then New Zealand , and then , as before , Singapore way off on its own maximizing economic freedom .
To confirm the hypothesis of a tradeoff between economic freedom and political freedom , what we ’d need in the dataset are “ more Singapores ” — or better yet , some countries that interpolated between the Western democracies and Singapore .
Conversely , to disprove the tradeoff hypothesis , all it would take is a single country that dominated the rest of the world on both axes , with the political freedom of Scandinavia and the economic freedom of Singapore .
I find it interesting that no such country seems to exist , not even a small city - state or island .
Incidentally , the tradeoff idea is not necessarily rejected by libertarians .
Friedman himself stressed that “ political freedom , once established , has a tendency to destroy economic freedom . ”
To put it bluntly , if poor people can vote , one of the main things they vote for is to redistribute money to themselves .
There are then three possibilities : either redistribution takes place ( and economic freedom as defined by Heritage and the Wall Street Journal goes down ) , or the poor majority is violently suppressed ( and political freedom goes down ) , or the government is overthrown .
Amusingly , Friedman and Klein seem to be in complete agreement on this central point : it ’s just that one of them laments it while the other relishes it .
In summary , I conjecture that the relationship between economic freedom and political freedom is similar to that between jogging and health .
In general , we expect people to be healthier the more they jog , with at least part of the relationship being causal .
But it does n’t follow that jogging 20 hours per day is healthier than jogging one hour ; indeed the former might even be detrimental .
Of course , people could accept all this ( even find it plunkingly obvious ) , and still vehemently disagree about the quantitative aspect : exactly how far out is the Pareto curve ?
How much jogging is too much ?
As usual , it ’s the complexity - theoretic questions that are the interesting ones .
The tragedy is that you never even get to those questions if you ’re too hung up on computability .
Despite all the logical and historical arguments against third party campaigns , insurgent candidates say they ’re compelled to run to give the people a " real choice " when major parties become indistinguishable .
Ignoring the increasingly profound ideological gulf between Republicans and Democrats on foreign policy , economics and social issues , minor party activists dismiss these old political organizations as " Tweedledum and Tweedle - dumber , " or " Republicrats and Demicans " – power hungry hacks who serve the same corporate masters and only pretend to disagree .
Former Alabama Governor George C. Wallace ran his entire 1968 campaign ( as standard - bearer for the hastily assembled " American Independent Party " ) based on the slogan that " there ’s not a dime ’s worth of difference " between his two opponents , Nixon and Humphrey , claiming they both kowtowed to the same " pointy - headed intellectuals . "
In retrospect , any comparison of the careers , character and ideology of Richard Nixon and Hubert Humphrey reveals that even in that pre-inflation era , the value of their differences amounted to more than ten cents .
But aside from the substance of Wallace ’s complaint , the impact of his relatively successful backlash - to - Civil Rights campaign ( he won 13.5 % of the vote and carried five Southern states ) shows the futile nature of the third party strategy .
The next time out the Democrats nominated ultra-liberal George McGovern , now underlining their big differences with Nixon by moving further away from , not closer to , Wallace ’s right wing , blue collar positions .
By that time the Governor himself had rejoined his old party and enjoyed considerable success in Democratic primaries in ‘ 72 , before a bullet from a would - be assassin cut short his campaign .
In any event , Wallace remained a Democrat ( and returned to the governorship ) , even swallowing his segregationist principles to endorse Jimmy Carter in 1976 .
Other " give ‘ em a choice " campaigns produced similarly negligible long - term results .
" Outsider " Ralph Nader claimed in 2000 that he could see scant difference between insiders Bush and Gore , and so he drew a crucial 2.7 % of the electorate .
Four years later , Republican Bush and Democrat Kerry utterly ignored Nader ’s issues while each drawing millions more votes than their parties had won four years before , but Nader himself got less than one - sixth the ballots he claimed in 2000 .
This year , with four different minor party contenders begging for money and attention to make national races , the situation has become more embarrassing than usual .
Each of these worthies ( Cynthia McKinney and Ralph Nader on the left , Chuck Baldwin of the Constitution Party and Bob Barr of the Libertarians on the right ) insists that McCain and Obama are so similar that the people need another choice .
But the Republican and Democratic nominees have actually diverged sharply on just about everything -- Iraq policy , negotiations with Iran , protecting the Bush tax cuts , federal spending , earmarks , government takeover of healthcare , windfall profit taxes , tax simplification and flatter taxes , abortion , gun rights , gay marriage , oil drilling off the coast , nuclear power , choice in education , defending radio from the fairness doctrine , surveillance of terrorist suspects , the Patriot Act , you name it .
On each of these issues McCain and Obama pointedly disagree .
In fact , they contrast with one another far more dramatically than the lefty candidates ( Nader and McKinney ) disagree with one another , or the purportedly right wing candidates ( Barr and Baldwin ) split on the issues .
Both of the Killer B's claim that they must run to offer some meaningful choice not provided by McCain or Obama , but if you 're Bob Barr ( heaven forbid ! ) is it really so necessary to offer an alternative to Rev. Baldwin ?
Comparing the fringe candidates to one another explodes their oft - repeated claims that they run to provide choice and underlines their deepest similarities : none of them stands a chance of carrying even a single state and they 're all motivated by self - righteous narcissism rather than some high - minded commitment to the issues .
If major party candidates do tend to sound similar themes in the last weeks before an election it ’s because they ’re competing for the same moderate , centrist swing voters who end up deciding every close race .
These confused , timid and uncertain souls who end up deciding at the last minute usually get to pick the new president , as unpleasant as that reality may sound .
Third party " choice " candidates can’t magically mobilize mass support by positioning themselves outside the political mainstream .
Contenders with any chance of victory tend to concentrate on the mushy middle not because their corporate puppet masters order them to do so , but because that 's where they can fish most effectively for available votes .
Even rare candidates with strong , solid ideological commitments ( Ronald Reagan is the best example ) campaign as mainstreamers and consensus builders because , very simply , there 's no other way to win .
In fact , many recent third party movements have criticized Republicans and Democrats not because they ’re too similar , but because they ’re too different – too polarizing , partisan and extreme .
" Middle of the Road " independent contenders like John Anderson in 1980 and Ross Perot in ’ 92 and ’ 96 made no attempt to push the parties to the left or the right , but rather schemed to attract the incurably undecided , confused and independent voters who waffle and dither , somewhere between donkey and elephant .
Dreams of running various above - the - fray , vaguely post - partisan figures ( like Colin Powell or Mike Bloomberg or Chuck Hagel ) persistently animate minor party activists who do n’t hope to give voters a new choice , but instead want to help them avoid any choices at all by offering ill - defined , split - the - difference candidates .
The apparent and appalling contradictions in popular pleas for a new national party -- – pleas that simultaneously attack the big parties as too close and too far apart – expose the essential silliness of the fringe candidate compulsion .

Universal Die Casting Company – closed their doors the last time February 21st , 2008 .
Founded in Los Angeles , California in 1931 , Universal Die Casting Company produced parts in brass and bronze in sizes ranging from 1 /2 ounce to 20 pounds .
Universal Die Casting Company produced parts for many industries such as : swimming pool brushes , spas , plumbing hardware , aircraft and irrigation equipment .
Universal Die Casting Company moved from the original location of 5001 Santa Fe Avenue in Los Angeles , California to 2052 East Vernon Avenue Los Angeles , California where the doors finally closed .
Universal Die Casting Company was another good manufacturing company that closed their doors in California .
Universal Die Casting Company had an auction for their equipment on Thursday , February 21st , 2008 at 10 AM .
Most of the die casting company competitors including Kinetic Die Casting Company , attended the auction but no one is happy to see another small die casting company that struggled everyday to stay in business – Close Down .
Good bye Universal Die Casting Company .

The number of US soldiers " stop - lossed , " or forced to serve past their agreed terms of enlistment ( from an additional few months to over a year ) , has reached 58,000 in the past six years , NBC reports .
" Many lawmakers and critics claim the Army has used ' stop - loss ' as a back - door draft to make up for the shortage of soldiers for the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan , " reports Jim Miklaszewski .
" It is going to destroy the morale of our troops , " adds Rep. Christopher Shays ( R- CT ) .
" We 've got to stop it . "
Ed Janosik , a retired infantry major of the U.S. Army , writes that the stop - loss policy is an insult to U.S. troops .

Exxon Mobil reports biggest quarterly profit ever in U.S. Exxon earns record $ 11.7B , misses expectations
Shell also reports massive profit despite decline in oil production
Exxon Mobil beat its own record for the highest quarterly profit ever hit by a U.S. company -- posting $ 11.7 billion for the second quarter this year with an 8 percent drop in production -- but it could n't top Wall Street 's expectations .
The Irving - based behemoth 's $ 2.22 of net income per share missed the analysts ' consensus of $ 2.52 , but it was a 14 percent increase from the $ 10.3 billion , or $ 1.83 per share , posted in the second quarter of last year .
It also beat the company 's all - time quarterly record of $ 11.6 billion in the last three months of 2007 .
Excluding a $ 290 million charge related to the $ 508 million punitive damages award for the 1989 Exxon Valdez spill set by a recent U.S. Supreme Court decision , quarterly earnings rose 17 percent to $ 11.9 billion , or $ 2.27 per share .
Revenue was $ 138 billion , up from $ 98 billion a year ago .
" We expect that these results will be viewed negatively today , " Simmons & Co. International said in a note to investors .
Exxon shares fell $ 2.61 , or 3 percent , to $ 88.77 in midday trading today on the New York Stock Exchange .
Exxon 's announcement came a few hours after Royal Dutch Shell reported a 33 percent increase in second quarter profits at $ 11.56 billion , or $ 1.87 per share , up from $ 8.67 billion , or $ 1.38 a share .
However , The Hague - based company 's profits were $ 7.83 billion excluding one - time items and gains or losses from inventories .
Shell 's oil and gas production fell less than 2 percent .
Shell 's shares fell $ 2.22 , or 3 percent , to $ 71.47 in midday trading on the NYSE .
Last week Houston - based ConocoPhillips announced a 13 percent increase in net income during a quarter in which oil prices rose to $ 140 a barrel from $ 100.98 .
London - based BP announced a 28 percent increase in profits on Tuesday .
San Ramon , Calif . - based Chevron will round out results announcements among the world 's largest oil companies on Friday .
Rex Tillerson , Exxon Mobil 's chairman and CEO , said in a statement that record crude and natural gas prices were partially offset by lower refining and chemical margins , lower production volumes and higher operating costs .
The company spent $ 7 billion in the second quarter on capital and exploration projects , up 38 percent .
But Exxon Mobil spent $ 8 billion buying its own stock .
``We are demonstrating our commitment to return cash to our shareholders , '' : Henry Hubble , vice president of investor relations , told analysts today .
`` The way we think about the buyback , it 's a distribution .
We view it as nothing more than a distribution . ''
The 8 percent drop in oil and gas production stemmed largely from the company 's decision last year to walk away from its Venezuela operations last year rather than agree to terms giving majority control to that country 's government - owned oil company , Petroleos de Venezuela , or PDVSA .
Other factors included a Nigeria labor strike and lower entitlements under production - sharing contracts with other countries .
Excluding those items , production fell 2.5 percent , the company said .
Exxon Mobil 's refining segment earned $ 1.5 billion , down $ 1.8 billion from the second quarter of 2007 .
A refining margin is the difference between what companies pay for crude and the selling price of gasoline and other products made from it , and those margins have been squeezed amid skyrocketing oil prices .
Companies that are particularly refining - heavy have felt the squeeze more than others , including Houston - based Marathon Oil , which said today it 's considering splitting off that part of the company .
`` If you see a rapid run-up in crude prices like we saw , there 's always some compression that goes on , '' Hubble told analysts .
`` That generally will have a negative impact on the margins we capture . ''
New York oil futures , which had never traded as high as $ 112 before the second quarter , surged to a record $ 143.67 in June .
Each $ 1 gain in the price of oil boosts Exxon Mobil 's net earnings by 11 cents a share , according to William Featherston , an analyst at UBS Securities LLC .
Natural gas rose even faster than oil in this year 's first half , and the average second - quarter price jumped 50 percent to $ 11.47 per million British thermal units .
Exxon Mobil 's output is about 60 percent crude and 40 percent gas .
Oil and gas sales account for more than 80 percent of profit .
On Capitol Hill today , Democrats decried the oil industry 's blockbuster profits , with Sen. Charles Schumer , D - N.Y. arguing ``It 's Christmas in July '' in the board rooms of the major oil companies .
Democrats noted that between 2004 and 2007 , the five largest oil companies coughed up nearly $ 181 billion to buy back their stock and boost the value of their investors ' existing shares -- 18 times what they spent for research and development in the same period .
`` What 's good for Exxon Mobil is not good for America , '' Schumer said .
In a bid to blunt some of the criticism , the American Petroleum Institute , the oil industry 's trade group , took out full - page advertisements in the Washington Post and a variety of Capitol Hill publications .
Exxon Mobil 's refineries can process 6.3 million barrels of oil a day , or 7.3 percent of the world 's crude supply .
Retail gasoline prices increased 27 percent to a second - quarter average of $ 4.10 a gallon in the U.S. , which accounts for more than half of Exxon Mobil 's worldwide sales of the fuel .

Special Report
NEW YORK ( CNNMoney.com ) --
In what could turn out to be the most expensive bank failure ever , troubled mortgage lender IndyMac Bank was taken over by federal regulators on Friday .
The operations of the Pasadena , Calif . - based bank - once one of the nation 's largest home lenders - were shut down at 3 p.m. by the Office of Thrift Supervision and transferred to the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp .
According to the FDIC , 10,000 IndyMac customers could lose as much as $ 500 million in uninsured deposits .
The agency says the failure will cost the Deposit Insurance Fund between $ 4 billion and $ 8 billion , based on preliminary estimates .
" It 's possible this will be the most costly bank failure in history , but it's too soon to say , " FDIC Chairman Sheila Bair said in a conference call late Friday night .
The failure could also affect premiums paid by all banks for deposit insurance , she added .
IndyMac , with assets of $ 32.01 billion and deposits of $ 19.06 billion , is the fifth bank to fail this year .
Between 2005 and 2007 , only three banks failed .
And in the past 15 years , the FDIC has taken over 127 banks with combined assets of $ 22 billion , according to FDIC records .
" There will be increased failures , but it will be within range of what we can handle , " Bair said .
" People should not worry . "
IndyMac marks the largest bank collapse since 1984 , when Continental Illinois , which had $ 40 billion in assets , failed , according to FDIC records .
The two most expensive failures were in 1988 : American Savings and Loan Association in California ( $ 5.4 billion ) and involved First Republic Bank in Texas ( $ 4 billion ) .
What now for IndyMac customers ?
Bair said that the FDIC will try to sell IndyMac as a complete entity within 90 days .
When a bank shuts down , traditional bank accounts are insured to at least $ 100,000 .
Some accounts such as annuities and mutual funds are not insured at all .
Individual Retirement Account funds are insured to $ 250,000 .
Customers with uninsured deposits will get at least half that money back , and they could get more back , depending on what the FDIC gets when it sells the bank , said Bair .
IndyMac customers will have their funds transferred to a new entity - IndyMac Federal FSB - controlled by the FDIC .
They will have uninterrupted customer service and access to their funds by ATM , debit cards and checks .
However , customers will have no access to online and phone banking services this weekend , according to the FDIC .
Service will resume on Monday .
Loan customers were advised to continue making loan payments as usual .
For additional information , the FDIC has established a toll - free number for customers of IndyMac Federal Bank , FSB .
The toll - free number is 1-866-806-5919 and will operate today from 3:00 p.m. to 9:00 p.m. ( PDT ) , and then daily from 8:00 a.m. to 8:00 p.m. thereafter , except Sunday , July 13 , when the hours will be 8:00 a.m. to 6:00 p.m.
Customers also may visit the FDIC's Web site at http://www.fdic.gov/bank/individual/failed/IndyMac.html for further information .
How it got to this point
IndyMac specialized in loans it had long argued were of minimal risk : low documentation loans to residential mortgage borrowers .
On Tuesday , IndyMac - which had 33 branches - announced that it was firing 53 % of its workforce and exiting its retail and wholesale lending units .
Last year , the lender was ranked 11th in residential mortgage origination , according to trade publication Inside Mortgage Finance .
More importantly , IndyMac also disclosed that regulators no longer considered it " well capitalized . "
As a result , since Tuesday , the bank was n't able to accept brokered deposits , or short - term investments in large dollar amounts from brokers seeking the highest return on certificates of deposit .
Over the past two years , IndyMac dropped over 95 % in stock price , or about $ 3.5 billion in market capitalization .
Shares traded down nearly 10 % on Friday to close at 28 cents .
IndyMac lost $ 184.2 million in the first quarter and announced on Monday that it was expecting a wider loss for the second quarter .
It lost $ 614 million last year stemming from its focus on the Alt - A mortgage sector , where it originates loans to borrowers who fall between prime ( or conforming ) and sub - prime on the credit spectrum .
The lender 's chief executive , Michael Perry , had long argued that it was being unfairly punished given its relatively paltry exposure to sub - prime mortgages .
Rising Alt - A and prime mortgage delinquencies likely were enough indication for investors that the housing crisis had moved beyond the weakest borrowers .
Even worse , with the securitization markets in collapse , IndyMac had no way to get new loans off its books .
As it turned out , IndyMac was a leader in loans requiring little income and asset documentation , a category that has had disastrous levels of delinquencies at other troubled lenders .
What loans the bank had made recently were to borrowers with well - documented assets and income , but those are sharply less profitable with respect to fees and interest income .
IndyMac , in its filing on Monday , said it would focus on its reverse mortgage business , retail branch network and mortgage servicing operations .
But the growth restrictions placed on IndyMac by regulators and the banks and brokerages it did business with , as well as the sharply higher borrowing costs , placed the profitability of even its non-mortgage - related banking efforts in doubt .
Even efforts to prop up the bank hurt it .
Last month , Sen. Charles Schumer , D - N.Y. , wrote a series of letters to regulators in Washington and California asking them to take steps to prevent the bank 's " likely collapse . "
In response , about $ 100 million in customer deposits has been withdrawn from the bank , according to one of its filings .

This is the “ Field Poll , ” as Markos calls it “ the only poll that matters in California . ”
A majority of registered Californian voters oppose changing the constitution of the most populous U.S. state to bar gays from marrying , according to poll released on Wednesday .
The Field Poll survey found 51 percent against approving a possible November ballot measure to prohibit gay marriage , with 43 percent in favor .
A slightly differently worded question on the same issue found 54 percent opposed and 40 percent in favor .
The poll follows a state Supreme Court decision this month that barring homosexuals from marrying violated the California Constitution .
Opponents of same - sex marriage have intensified efforts to put a state constitutional amendment on the ballot in November .
It ’s only a matter of time , with youth overwhelming support granting marriage rights to gay couples , which is why the right - wing homophobes want constitutional amendments .
They are quite literally trying to stop the public from eventually approving of gay unions , even if the majority of the public agrees it ’s okay and wants to do it .
Their hands will be tied by these onerous constitutional amendments .
If you just leave it up to the people , there ’s no need for an amendment .
Or , you could have an amendment that stop courts from requiring gay marriage but would permit the legislature to approve it ( not that I ’d approve of such an amendment , but still ) .
PORTLAND , Ore.  “ I talked to Senator Clinton last night , ” Gov. Bill Richardson of New Mexico said on Friday , describing the tense telephone call in which he informed Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton that , despite two months of personal entreaties by her and her husband , he would be endorsing Senator Barack Obama for president .
“ Let me tell you : we ’ve had better conversations , ” Mr. Richardson said .
The decision by Mr. Richardson , who ended his own presidential campaign on Jan. 10 , to support Mr. Obama was a belt of bad news for Mrs. Clinton .
It was a stinging rejection of her candidacy by a man who had served in two senior positions in President Bill Clinton ’s administration , and who is one of the nation ’s most prominent elected Hispanics .
Mr. Richardson came back from vacation to announce his endorsement at a moment when Mrs. Clinton ’s hopes of winning the Democratic nomination seem to be dimming .
But potentially more troublesome for Mrs. Clinton was what Mr. Richardson said in announcing his decision .
He criticized the tenor of Mrs. Clinton ’s campaign .
He praised Mr. Obama for the speech he gave in response to the furor over racially incendiary remarks delivered by Mr. Obama ’s former pastor , the Rev. Jeremiah A. Wright Jr .
And he came close to doing what Mrs. Clinton ’s advisers have increasingly feared some big - name Democrat would do as the battle for the nomination drags on : Urge Mrs. Clinton to step aside in the interest of party unity .
Maxine Waters Threatens to Socialize the Oil Companies
Cross posted on Grizzly Groundswell
Sorry , I am a couple of days late on this one .
During last week ’s congressional hearing with oil executives Maxine Waters threatened to socialize the oil companies .
Here is the video :
Well , she obviously realized that she slipped up by showing where she really stands politically by using the word “ socialize . ”
She said the magic word , bit the poison pill and it was bitter .
Did you see how quickly she tried to move away from that word ?
She then could not find the word that she really intended to use , and that word is “ nationalize . ”
Not that nationalize is any better of a word than socialize , they both mean the same thing .
What they mean is exactly what Maxine Waters went on to say , that she wanted the government to take over and run their companies for them .
She has admitted what many of us already know , that Democrats are socialists at heart .
She was then compared to , and rightfully so , Hugo Chavez and Venezuela .
Of course I am sure she considered that a compliment , being compared to one of her heroes and all .
The best part of the video is watching the two people behind her as she stumbles her way through her ridiculous statement .
As soon as she says the words “ take over ” watch the guy behind her start to smile and then hide behind her , this is followed by a woman who then enters the picture and covers her smile with her hand .
They are laughing at her .
Maxine Waters made a fool out of herself , but at the same time she showed us her true feelings .
What really set her off was the oil executives laying the blame of high gas prices at the foot of congress for not letting them actually drill for more oil .
Oil that is plentiful on our own land .
China is drilling off of the coast of Florida and we are not allowed to because of the environmentalists .
And her answer is A GOVERNMENT TAKEOVER !
A billion acres of farmland around the world have been abandoned and could now be used to grow biofuel crops , a new study suggests .
One of the criticisms of biofuels such as ethanol from corn or rice is that the crops eat into land that could be used to grow food , which is increasingly in short supply globally , causing frustration and hunger that have led to protests and riots .
The alternative of clearing forests to grow biofuel crops is unacceptable to many .
Yet somewhere between 1 billion and 1.2 billion acres of agricultural land is lying fallow , the study finds .
That compares to about 3.8 billion acres that are currently in use .
The researchers caution , however , that biofuels will be no magic bullet to resolving possible energy crises in the future .
" Our results showed that if you used all these abandoned agricultural lands , you might obtain up to 8 percent of current energy needs , " said Elliott Campbell , a postdoctoral fellow in biology at Stanford University and lead author of the report .
" So this result is basically showing us that biofuels could be a meaningful , but a small portion of our total energy future . "
The study , based on satellite imagery and historical maps , is detailed today in the online edition of the journal Environmental Science & Technology .
It was funded by the Carnegie Institution and the Global Climate and Energy Project at Stanford .
Land has fallen out of agricultural production for a variety of reasons .
In some instances , new technologies or infrastructure have made land with better soil available , as when farmers in the eastern United States left their farms for the richer prairie soils of the Midwest .
Elsewhere , soil erosion or depleted soil nutrients have forced farmers away from plots that could still support other crops such as switchgrass that could be used for biofuel .
" These abandoned agricultural lands are distributed throughout the world , in places with a variety of different climates , " Campbell said .
" So the type of plant species that might give you the most biomass per year would probably depend on the local climate . "
July 15 , 2008  -- Wendy
Whitaker may not be allowed to live in the 100 - year - old bungalow she owns with her husband .
The 28 - year - old was forced out of the house in 2006 and cannot volunteer at her local church .
She says she was arrested for returning home to do her laundry .
Whitaker is a sex offender :
When she was a 17 - year - old high school sophomore , she had oral sex with a 15 - year - old boy .
Whitaker pleaded guilty in 1997 to sodomy and served five years of probation .
But she and her husband have been forced to move several times in the last two years because Georgia 's sex offender registry laws prevent offenders from living within 1,000 feet of a school , church , playground , school bus stop or other place where children congregate .
Though she thought recent changes to the state 's sex offender laws would let her return to her home , last week , she was told to move again because the house is too close to a church .
She says she and her husband have had to put their careers and family on hold because they have moved so many times .
" I know what I did was wrong , but do I really deserve to keep going through this over and over ? " said Whitaker , who is the lead plaintiff in a federal lawsuit challenging the constitutionality of the registration laws .
" Does my husband deserve it ?
I 'm being punished over and over again . "
Though Georgia 's supreme court in November struck down as unconstitutional an earlier version of the law , the state legislature quickly passed a new version that keeps intact most of the law 's strictest provisions .
The new law , still considered one of the nation 's toughest sex offender laws , went into effect this month .
It is one of a rash of laws enacted by state legislatures in the last several years that restrict where sex offenders can live , and in some cases , bars them from living within 2,500 feet of schools .
" I think it 's an excellent step toward protecting the children of Georgia from sex offenders , " said State Sen .
John Wiles , one of the co-sponsors of Georgia 's law .
But unlike many states , Georgia does not distinguish between different types of sex offenders , treating those like Whitaker the way it would any other sex offender .
What 's more , several experts have argued that many laws targeting sex offenders have backfired , leading to clusters of offenders living in the few areas where they are welcome .
" There is not a shred of evidence to suggest that residence restrictions are effective , " said Sarah Geraghty , Whitaker 's lawyer at the Southern Center for Human Rights .
" There is evidence that residence restrictions destabilize people on the registry and encourage people to abscond . "
Fewer than 10 percent of sex crimes against kids are committed by strangers , according to Justice Department statistics ; the majority of sex crimes are committed by a person the child knows .
Within three years of their release , about 5.3 percent of sex offenders committed another sex crime , according to a Justice Department study .
" Each case should be dealt with on a case by case basis , " said Glynda Gowen , also a registered sex offender who'd molested a 12 - year - old boy , who faces possible eviction from her mother 's home .
" But they 're not doing that .
They 're putting us all in one category and treating us the same . "
Gowen , who has diabetes and heart disease and underwent a quadruple bypass last year , said she will have nowhere to go if forced out of her mother 's house , which is near a church and a park .
" I do n't know what I 'll do , " said Gowen , who said her doctors have told her to live with other people in case of emergency .
" I can't work , I have no money coming in . "
The new Georgia law makes an exception for those who bought their homes before July 2006 .
Though Whitaker and her husband bought their house in January 2006 , her name was not put on the deed until last year , prompting a local sheriff to order her to leave within 48 hours .
The sheriff has agreed to let Whitaker stay in her house until the case is resolved , her lawyer said .
In 2006 , Whitaker and her husband moved in with her brother - in - law .
They were then forced to move out of state , she said , because the brother - in - law 's home was too close to a bus stop .
After the state supreme court struck down the law , they moved back to their home in Harlem , Ga . " We 've had to pay a mortgage in our house and then rent places to live .
It 's a strain on our marriage , " she said .
Whitaker has asked a federal court for an injunction barring the government from kicking her out .
In court papers , the state attorney general said she should seek relief from being evicted in the state courts .
Wiles , the state senator , said that while certain individuals may have compelling stories , " we deal with laws that impact all citizens .
A balance was struck .
This is a law that was designed to protect all citizens and that 's what this law does . "
A month ago , I decided to go out and find all my ex-boyfriends , to see what has happened to them , and to conduct a live - action autopsy of our relationships .
I was so excited : I would have an excuse to ring them all up and stalk them .
I 'm back !
I 'm a journalist !
And , contrary to the expectations of everyone who knew me before I stopped drinking six years ago , I am alive !
There are 15 I remember , and 10 I can name .
First there is David , whom I knew when I was 13 .
I used to stand at parties drinking vodka , like a small Judy Garland , drooling at his Aryan blondness .
Google gave me his phone number , at a law firm in the City .
" It 's an interesting idea ... can I call you back ? " he said .
He never did .
Oliver , whom I dated at Oxford , actually screamed at the suggestion .
" No ! No !
No !
I do n't want to do that .
Do n't ask me again .
Ever . "
So how about Alan ?
He blacked my eye at university because I was sleeping with his friend .
He whispered down the phone that he never wants to talk about Oxford again .
Small twinges of guilt began to seep into my jolly game .
Had I hurt these men ?
I will have to dive deeper , deeper than I want to .
So I look for Adam on the internet , and within a week we are lunching at a cafe .
I met Adam when I was 14 and gadding around town with a would - be party girl called Amanda , who was terribly embarrassed about the fact that her father was a taxi driver .
I was terribly embarrassed that my father was a dentist .
So we got on .
One night in a pub in Camden , we bumped into Adam .
He was 19 and tall and gaunt and looked as if he had escaped from a hospice .
I thought he was cool because he smoked pot and lived in Muswell Hill , so I mooned around after him .
I was from Norbiton - a satellite of Kingston upon Thames , a satellite of a satellite - and I was an outcast at school because I was afflicted by the Four Social Horsemen of the Apocalypse : fat , needy , Jewish and top of the class .
Adam would sit in his squat - all the furniture was made of cardboard boxes , decorated with cans of Tennent's , and strange men with beards wafted in and out - and read philosophy .
I used to give him blow jobs while thinking about the plot riffs in Jilly Cooper novels .
He appeared to dislike me , yet he was always prepared to stick his hand up the ra-ra skirt I 'd stolen from Miss Selfridge .
I had the impression that he was too drugged to ask me to leave .
I stand outside the cafe , peering at every passerby , thinking , " Is it him ? "
I remember very well those sad little journeys to Muswell Hill .
It always seemed to be raining .
I used to get the bus to Richmond and then the train to that exotic , half - imagined destination , north London .
We would , for some reason , get into a bath with no water in it , and touch each other .
We did n't have sex , because I was too young .
The only thing I remember him saying to me was when I turned up with a bunch of flowers for him : " You are the bringer of dead roses . "
He started to avoid me , and I got the message .
He was so thin when I knew him , and now - as he walks towards me - he 's stocky .
He has a beautiful face , except he still has no lips .
I feel a glow of covetousness ; I still want him to want me .
( Did he ever really want me ? )
I half get up to kiss him , but I can't get up further because the table is jammed between us .
We sit down .
" You look beautiful , " he tells me .
" I remember our relationship very well .
Lots of oral sex , " he says .
And I think , " Yuck . Sleazy . "
He starts to tell me that he runs a software business and he made £ 3,000 last week .
He says he is married to a woman he describes as " unique " .
When did we last see each other ?
He tells me a story I had forgotten .
Years later , I had rung him up , and we'd gone to the pub , eaten Thai food and got pissed .
At that time , I was a drinking alcoholic .
Then we went back to his house to have sex for the first time .
Afterwards , as we lay in bed , he said , in the flat drawl of a genuine sadist , " I 'm marrying my girlfriend . "
I talk to him , listen to him , and I realise that I never knew anything about him .
I had no idea who he was .
I just took this man and threw all my fantasies on to him ; me paint , he wall .
" At that time , I was doing loads of cocaine , " he says .
" That 's why I was so thin .
At one point I was down to eight stone . "
He looks at me , half - closes his eyes and , as if he is seriously wondering , asks why we never got together .
Because you showed no interest in me ?
" Well , I was on a lot of drugs ... "
And he opens his eyes .
" Your party trick was pissing me off , so I would tell you to fuck off , " he murmurs .
" That 's all you were interested in . "
Then he says , " I 'm not going to tell my wife I 'm here . "
He gives me a shifty , conniving look .
Is he ...?
I am surprised , but I am always surprised when somebody wants to have sex with me ; I usually assume men take off my clothes because they are looking for my wallet .
I smirk .
You 're not coming back to my flat , Adam .
" Yes , I am .
Let 's go . "
We walk in the park , then go to a gallery .
We are behaving like teenagers , trying to impress each other , and we are almost angry at each other for being so excited .
We are on a date , and it is much more fun than it used to be , because we are not in a damp squat infested by cardboard furniture and strange bearded men .
He walks me to the tube and I clutch his shoulders and hug him .
He bends his head and gives me a slightly slimy kiss on the mouth .
" When can I call you without being a stalker ? " he asks .
I feel triumphant .
My 14 - year - old has beaten his 19 - year - old to a pulp ; somewhere , my Miss Selfridge skirt is cheering .
Another day , another ghost .
I met Matthew at school when I was eight and he was 10 .
I thought he was wonderful because he was the only one of the older boys who talked to me .
Then we lost touch until I bumped into him at a station when I was 16 .
He had become beautiful : half - Irish , half - black , perfectly symmetrical features .
" Come to my house tomorrow night , " he said .
He lived in a house on Richmond Hill .
All I really remember now was that I was desperate to lose my virginity .
I must have told him that before adding , coquettishly , that I would never , never have sex with him .
" Let 's watch TV instead , " he said .
We smoked dope , listened to music and drank hot chocolate with cream .
Within a few weeks , the virginity was dead .
I was the most terrible faker .
I went , " Ah , ooh , ah , ooh , ooh . "
Then he told me , in passing , that he was in love with a boy called Henry .
We split up not long after because he was sleeping with half the street : man , woman or postbox .
One night , at a party , I met the boy he loved - Henry .
He looked like the hero of High School Musical .
I sat and whined about how badly Matthew had treated me .
This was only foreplay : I was wooing him .
The fact it would hurt Matthew made me want him more .
When I called Matthew to brag that I had shagged Henry , he fell for me .
It was a sign of respect .
For a year , we spent all our time together .
He was very affectionate and he swept me up into a narcissistic fantasy of himself .
I was his girlfriend , but he still liked sleeping with other people .
We began to have threesomes .
I came from the most boring background in the world and this seemed thrilling .
And now he is walking towards me in Euston station .
He is 36 , but still looks 12 .
In an Indian restaurant , he tells me he worked as a fundraiser for a major political party and is now a consultant .
He is married to a man .
So you 're gay , I say , chewing a piece of naan bread .
" Bisexual , " he says .
" I kissed a girl 10 years ago . "
How did it end between Matthew and me ?
One night his friend Ian came round for a threesome , and Ian and I sloped off together .
The next day , Matthew got his older brother to scream down the phone : " Fuck off , you 're so boring ! "
" I know I hurt you , " he says , " but I was just a kid .
If I was n't gay , I think I would have liked to have made a life with you . "
I goggle at him , and ask what he did n't like about me .
" Your vicious desire to be miserable was very annoying , " he says laconically .
" And the way you seduced men I wanted to sleep with - that was very , very annoying . "
He laughs .
He has to go to work .
We part with a hug .
It feels uncomplicated , and warm .
I was not to hit real misery until I returned to the heterosexuals - and to the men I knew when I was drinking .
And so on to Jon .
I met him in the college bar in Oxford during freshers ' week in 1994 .
He was sitting on his own with a bright red bassoon in his lap , looking angry .
So I went back to his room and slept with him .
We had sex intermittently for two years .
He was very distant .
We would lie in bed smoking a post - shag fag and he would say , " I 'm going for a run now . "
And then run away .
Memories come to me in patches of fog .
My drinking became alcoholic the week I met Jon , and the story of our relationship is the story of the growing sickness .
I stand outside the station in Cornwall waiting for him .
He runs a sheet music shop called Kershaw Music , he told me on the phone .
He is married and has a three - year - old daughter called Emily .
I feel nervous : he remembers things about me that I do not .
He arrives in a big , battered Mercedes and greets me jovially .
We go and sit on the beach and stare out to sea .
Jon always said he nearly failed his finals because of me .
What did you see in me , Jon ?
Do you remember I had my first blackout outside your door when you would n't let me in ?
You had to call the porter to remove me .
Looking at the ocean , he says , " I thought I would be able to have sex with you .
You were available . "
He does n't say it callously , just matter - of - factly .
Why did he keep sleeping with me ?
He sighs .
" I thought things would be different .
I would think , ' This time Tanya is not going to behave in a crazed manner . '
And you always did .
After a while , you seemed very calm again , so I would sleep with you again .
You were so persistent .
You just knocked on the door until I opened it .
I think the record was about an hour and a half .
You were a bit like the Terminator . "
He says it ended because he " finally realised that every time I slept with you , it unleashed a torrent of emotion that could n't really be stopped by anyone , least of all me . "
He turns to me , and says , blinking through his glasses , " I am trying to make this sound nonjudgmental , but I think it is tragic that you would quite like to be married but you spend an awful lot of your time going in the other direction .
But " - is this a shrug of guilt ?
- " we had fun , did n't we ? "
I am sitting and looking at him , and thinking that I still want him .
I want to kiss him .
While we are being photographed , I roll on top of him .
He takes it well , smiles , and pushes me off .
" You 'd have to work jolly hard to get me into bed now , " he says .
He takes me to the shop to meet Jacqueline , his wife .
She is small and slim , with short , brown hair .
She seems unfazed about the article , very relaxed , and friendly .
He has married the opposite of me .
I find I feel no jealousy towards her , although I do feel a little towards his daughter , Emily , who sits in a cardboard box playing with a roll of toilet paper .
He is wonderfully tender towards her .
He drives me to the station , and waits on the platform to wave goodbye .
The sadness is growing , but I keep going .
When I was 23 and drinking a bottle of vodka a day , I started having an affair with Nat , an enormously fat trust - fund boy .
He was a kindly Jewish prince , who would purr , " You think you want to go around drinking , but really you want to marry me . "
I used to get drunk in his kitchen and try to make his lunch , drunkenly stabbing vegetables until he took away the knife .
But I was looking for an abuser .
I drank more and more and got angrier and angrier .
One night I remember driving with him .
It was raining over Cricklewood .
I said , " Do you love me ? "
Nat stared at the road and said , " No . " I ran out of the car on Mill Lane and never spoke to him again .
Last week , I emailed him and he rang me later that day .
I was surprised by what he said .
" I think about you all the time .
I wanted to ring your mother and ask her how you were so many times , but I was so worried she would have to say , ' Tanya is dead . ' "
Would you see me again ?
" I am desperately nervous about seeing you because I am worried I will fall in love with you again , " he says .
Nat always was a specialist in yearning .
He is not interested in going out with women ; he prefers to sit and yearn , and be despised .
I do n't like this ; he is too like me .
He says he wo n't see me , but he starts ringing two or three times a day , and very late at night , as if the past 10 years never happened .
This annoys me - I work now !
Why do n't you ?
He whispers into the phone in a way that feels very pornographic .
He whispers , " I still masturbate over you .
Do you remember the sex ? "
I try to whisper filth back but my fanny is n't in it .
I stop taking his calls .
I turn instead to the final man on my list .
I met Tony at the conference of a minor and quite mad political party in 2004 .
I went outside and I saw this desiccated thing lying on the pavement , smoking .
Tony looked like no one I have ever seen .
He was Rice Krispie - coloured ; he had wide - spaced , green eyes , a large mouth and the most awful teeth rotting inside it .
He was wearing an opera cloak and a monocle .
I sat down next to him .
He had a ridiculously posh , drawling voice , like a Disney villain .
He explained he was a writer - thrillers , non-fiction .
Before I knew it , I was going to find a cheap hotel with this older man , his outfit flapping in the wind , as if he was a big , needy bat .
The next morning we went out for breakfast , then sat in the gallery at the conference and held hands .
He began to ring me every day , sent long , romantic emails , and eventually lured me to his house in the country , a wonky old place that stank of tobacco .
We began to see each other all the time .
I bought nice bedding and roast chickens and flowers every Friday night .
We watched French movies and read novels .
He got up in the morning and wrote poetry , ash from his roll - ups falling on to the carpet in a little pile .
All he seemed to eat was meat , like a snake .
At the beginning of our relationship , he told me he went to orgies , and hinted that he wanted me to join him .
I knew I could n't do it : it would send me crashing into bottles of vodka .
So I did n't .
But he spoke to the depraved part of me .
Now , suddenly , he is standing at the door to my flat , as charming and sweet as ever .
" Hello , Mary Poppins , " he says .
" I am here for a spot of deja spew . "
He sits down and I immediately just want to touch him .
Why ?
I feel that if you cut him open , you would find maggots .
But I still want him .
My maggots want to mate with his maggots .
My maggots are lonely .
So I lay my head in his lap ; he pulls my hair , and sighs .
" Unfinished business . "
He says , " You 've put on weight . "
And within minutes , the black chemistry is back , and I find myself saying , " Move in with me , Tony . Stay . "
I think I am insane as I say it .
He might be the love of my life .
I just do n't have much of a life .
And then he starts telling me an anecdote and I remember why it ended .
" I was at a party last year where I saw a young girl dressed as Miss Muffet get fucked by 16 people . "
On Christmas Eve , I arrived after a long train journey and was unpacking when I found a Polaroid of a naked woman on the dresser .
She was lying on bedding that I had bought for him .
I walked out and never came back .
We hold hands .
Then I stroke his face , which still feels very soft , kiss his neck , and chuck him out .
And I weep .
I have been meeting younger versions of myself .
And I can see a pattern with a clarity that I never did before .
It 's out of my memory and on a page now : I am drawn to men who can't - or wo n't - reciprocate my feelings .
I am a loser - cruiser .
I am Carrie Bradshaw with an axe in her head .
So I call the man I have been referring to as " my boyfriend " for six months .
He is n't really my boyfriend , of course ; he is like the rest .
He is living in Fulham with somebody else , the mother of his infant son .
I say , I can not see you any more .
One day you are going to ring me up and tell me your girlfriend is pregnant again , and you will come round and tell me how much money you are spending on nappies .
Then you will shag me , and I will hold your head and want to pull it off .
I do not want this , I say .
Can I go and at least try to find Mr - Let 's - Go - To - Ikea - And - Have - A - Child ?
Shall I try the Jewish guy in IT with the giant jaw ?
My mother 's friend 's cousin who is a solicitor ?
Perhaps with some more therapy ...?
He sighs down the phone .
" I wish you 'd go out with someone normal , " he says .
" Do you think you can ? "

July 23 , 2008  --
A federal appeals court struck down as unconstitutional a Clinton - era law that would have forced websites with adult material to verify visitors ' ages , dealing another blow to the government in a 10 - year court battle over net censorship .
The 3rd U.S. Circurt Court of Appeals upheld on Tuesday a 2007 lower - court decision that the Child Online Protection Act violated the First Amendment since it was not the most effective way to keep children from visiting adult websites .
Both courts also found that the standards for material that had to be hidden from open browsing were so loosely defined that any content not suitable for a four - year - old would have been hidden behind a age - verification firewall .
" Unlike COPA , filters permit adults to determine if and when they want to use them and do not subject speakers to criminal or civil penalties , " the court wrote .
The Justice Department has been defending COPA since its passage in 1998 , when the ACLU and others filed suit against the censorship law and won an immediate injunction .
Since then , the court battle has made its way twice to the Supreme Court , though the government has never won any clear battles in the dispute .
COPA makes it a crime to knowingly post material that is " harmful to minors " on the web for " commercial purposes " without having some method -- such as a credit card -- to verify a visitor 's age .
Critics assailed the law for infantilizing the internet and requiring website operators -- including news sites -- to live in fear of prosecution if even a small part of their website contained adult material .
COPA was intended to be a narrower version of the 1996 Communications Decency Act , which would have catastrophically extended the rules of television ' decency ' to the internet had the Supreme Court not emphatically rejected it in 1997 .
In its ruling , however , the appeals court did not see much of a difference between the two laws .
" It is apparent that COPA , like the Communications Decency Act before it , 'effectively suppresses a large amount of speech that adults have a constitutional right to receive and to address to one another , ' Reno , 521 U.S. at 874 , 117 S.Ct. at 2346 , and thus is overbroad .
For this reason , COPA violates the First Amendment , " the judges wrote .
" These burdens would chill protected speech . "
The ACLU 's Chris Hansen , a First Amendment lawyer for the rights group , applauded the decision .
" For years the government has been trying to thwart freedom of speech on the Internet , and for years the courts have been finding the attempts unconstitutional , " Hansen wrote in a statement .
" The government has no more right to censor the internet than it does books and magazines . "
The Justice Department is not pleased with the decision and is reviewing its options , according to spokesman Charles Miller .
" We are disappointed that the Third Circuit Court of Appeals struck down a Congressional statute designed to protect our children from exposure to sexually explicit material on the internet , " Miller said .
The ACLU , suing on behalf of Salon magazine sexualhealth.com and the owner of the Urban Dictionary website , successfully argued that the law criminalizes constitutionally protected speech , would drive pornography sites to non-U.S. servers , and prevent the spread of health information due to people 's unwillingness to register to read sensitive information .
They also argued the law would apply to anyone who wrote about mature subjects who also happened to have Google or Yahoo ads on their personal blog .
For its part , the government says the law was intended to apply to pornographic websites , not news sites .
It also argues COPA 's age restrictions would work with content filters .
The government is likely to appeal Tuesday 's decision for a full hearing at the appeals court or to the Supreme Court .
My friend is a rock , she was wonderful , I do n't know if it was an act , or she was surpressing her feelings , but I wish I was in that place ....
I 'm still not , and this seemed harder on me than it was for her ?
Like I said , it brought up all those hidden feelings that I mostly keep burried deep inside , and do n't let out for fear that the sobs will come again , and I wo n't be able to stop .
The last funeral service that I attended was for my Dad , and this brought all those memories back again .
It was hard for me to be there , but I would n't have been anywhere else , than there showing my support for my friend ....
No matter how hard it was for me .
Now , on the way home , I had to pass the entrance to the National Cemetary where my Dad is burried , and I felt like I had to go , even though I have n't been in a while .
If you know these National Cemetaries , you know that there are vast amounts of markers across the land , all flat with no definition ....
As I pulled up to where I park on the circular road , I was puzzled as to where my Dad 's grave was ?
It was n't because I do n't know .... just that there are so many piled into this one area of land , and this land is completely covered in snow !!
I can't see anything but white !
I realize without even getting out of my truck , that I will never find my Dad 's marker in all this snow !!
I know the general area of where he is .....
But , when I have gone before , I still have to look around a bit before I find his marker .
I feel so lost ............
I feel so alone ............
I want to get out and go down the hill and over to the trees and walk upwards like normal , but there is snow and ice everywhere and I know that even if I did get down the hill without falling , I would have to scrape the snow away in many different areas before I find the one I am looking for .....
I just sit and cry .........
I fully expect a warmth to enfold me , to let me know it is alright ....
But it never comes ........
I just feel cold .......
And sad ........
I do n't know how long I sat there , but I realize that I will not be able to visit his grave today .
I am thinking things to him in my mind , and hoping he hears me ?
I blow a kiss in the general direction of his grave ..... curse the snow , and drive away .
I am crying on the ride home ..... this has been an emotional day for me ....
And then I get pulled over for speeding .....
Did n't even realize that I was ?
But I was .
I was n't paying attention to my speed , and only when I saw the patrol car , did I look down and say " awwwww Sh*t "
And then the blue lights came on .
I did n't hesitate .... just pulled over , I knew it was me that he wanted ....
Why not ?
Nothing else is going right .....
I reached for my purse to get my license , and had it ready for him as he cautiously approached my window .
Then I reached for the glovebox to get the registration .
I had read that you should wait for them , so they do n't think you are reaching for a weapon , or hiding something .
( neither of which I would do )
He tells me that he has me doing 56 mph in a 40 ....
I have nothing to say but " okay "
I know that I am wrong ....
Great news .... this ticket will be through the roof !!!
Again , why not ?
He takes my license and registration and says he will be right back .......
I just sit there thinking what a dope I am ....
How did I let my emotions get the best of me ?
Why was n't I paying better attention ?
At least I always wear my seatbelt , so I wo n't get written up for that !
He comes back , and says that he is giving me a written warning , and " try to slow down Ma'am "
Serious ?
I just nod , because now the tears are rolling down my cheeks again , and I wonder how I got out of that ?
I pull away , and only when I get home do I look at the warning , and see that he has put that I was doing 49 in a 40 , so that justifies the warning instead of giving me the ticket that I deserved .
Sometimes you just have to wonder what is watching over you ?
Was it because I was co-operative ?
Was it because I was quiet ?
Was it because I had been crying ?
Was it because I was agreeable ?
Or was it something else ???
Till Next Time ,
Take care ,
Kat

The welterweight division has long been celebrated as one of mixed martial arts ' finest , and with good reason .
It 's a division with a rich history , great fighters and classic fights .
It has been , and continues to be , ultra - deep and ultra-competitive .
However , much of the success that the 170 - pound division has enjoyed in the past could perhaps be attributed to Zuffa 's stranglehold on the weight category .
For years now , the vast majority of the top welterweights have fought in the Octagon .
Even in the heyday of the UFC vs.
Pride rivalry , Japan 's wholesale lack of emphasis on the division made it a no- brainer where the world 's top welters aspired to be .
This Saturday , on CBS no less , Elite XC will stage a rather remarkable bout between Jake Shields and Nick Thompson to crown its first welterweight champion .
No , not remarkable in the sense that it's one of this year 's must - see fights , or for the chance that it may overtake the likes of Kawajiri - Alvarez and Torres - Maeda in fight of the year discussion .
The fight is remarkable for the plain and simple fact that it pits an entrenched top - 10 welterweight against a borderline top - 10 welterweight outside of the UFC .
With the UFC 's dominance over the 170 - pound class , worthwhile welterweight fights outside the Octagon have been hard to come by .
For your reminiscing or educational pleasure , here are seven of the finest , given some configuration to their relevance at the time , and / or overall in - fight awesomeness .
Many longtime MMA fans are purists .
They are alienated by the imposition of the Unified Rules and fondly reminisce about the days of vale tudo .
In truth , the vale tudo years were largely dominated by outdated style vs. style matchups , sweaty guys in too - small No Fear shorts , fighters breaking their hands almost instantly and " fights " featuring a half hour of head butts from the guard .
The first meeting between " Pele " and " Macaco , " however , is the most brilliant exception the sport could ask for .
In the glory days of vale tudo , rivalries were drawn on stylistic battle lines , pitting Brazilian jiu - jitsu against luta livre in an enduring , bloody battle .
Pele and Macaco were not enemies by association but strictly competition :
When Patino was hyped as the " next Rickson , " Landi - Jons took offense and was determined to affirm his status as Brazil 's best when they met in the BVF 's 176 - pound tournament in Sao Paulo .
The bout seemed set for insanity from the get - go .
Pele mocked Macaco 's fighting stance , Macaco taunted Pele with back flips and the two stared at each other from eight feet away for what seemed like an hour .
Macaco was the aggressor early , scoring with takedowns , threatening with submission attempts from the bottom and even intentionally pushing Pele through the ropes to send him tumbling onto the floor headfirst .
Although Macaco owned the first half of the bout , punishing Pele from the mount with an endless barrage of punches , Pele outlasted and overcame .
He eventually forced a tired Patino to the butt scoot , where Pele taunted him and punished him with kicks .
Pele then began operating surgically on the feet , exacerbating the fatigue of his foe and battering him with punches , kicks and knees .
Late in the round , Pele stuffed a Macaco shot and began to lasciviously gyrate his crotch against the head of his prone opponent in what has become perhaps the gold standard of MMA taunting .
Not long after , Pele chased Macaco across the ring with a volley of strikes , pinning him helplessly in the corner , where he delivered the fight - ending salvo of soccer kicks .
Pele got in one boot after the fact for good measure .
Although they met again four months later , with Pele splitting Macaco open for the stoppage victory , the beef between Landi - Jons and Patino has been squashed .
They 've since grown to be friends and have even trained together in the years since their feud .
However , their brutal battle endures as the finest modern vale tudo bout and one of the first truly great fights in the sport 's history .
The salad days of the WEF may seem like centuries ago , but it was only eight or nine years back that the promotion put on stacked shows that introduced many fans to the likes of Antonio Rodrigo Nogueira and Renato " Babalu " Sobral among others .
The clash between Jose Landi-Jons and Dave Menne in Evansville , Ind. , stands up to any of the fights that the promotion put on .
Although in contemporary focus Pele and Menne have been reduced to journeymen -- recognizable names for the resumes of the sport 's next generation -- eight years ago both were elite fighters in the weight range .
Pele had lost only once in his last eleven fights , a decision he dropped to Chuck Liddell in their 30 - minute vale tudo war , and had just dominated reigning UFC champ Pat Miletich to win the WEF 176 - pound title four months earlier .
Menne was in similar sorts , winner of 15 of his last 16 fights , with his sole loss coming in Japan to a larger Kiyoshi Tamura in his prime .
Menne 's barrage of leglock attempts and ground - and - pound gave him an early advantage .
Pele put his muay
Thai arsenal on display in the second frame , though , with nasty knees to the body from the clinch .
With things seemingly knotted even through two , the third round provided great two - way action .
Pele again showed his supremacy on the feet early , but Menne was able to put Pele on the floor again .
Both men showed no pretense of defense as they flurried in almost cartoonish fashion , with Menne throwing heavy punches on top and Pele viciously elbowing Menne in the head from the guard .
With just ten seconds to go and Menne seemingly owning a slight edge , Pele managed to scramble to his feet and land two atomic right hands , the last of which nearly knocked Menne out cold as the final bell tolled .
Despite the last - second theatrics , the judges returned with a razor - thin majority decision for Menne , who captured the 176 - pound crown .
A disgusted Pele exited the cage immediately at the decision 's unveiling -- a sentiment shared by many of the Evansville faithful , who only minutes earlier had been engaged in a deafening chant of " USA ! USA !
" While it would n't be his last major win ( just ask Matt Hughes ) , the loss did mark a turning point for Pele and perhaps an unwilling torch passing .
He would never quite regain the status he enjoyed as Brazil 's most dangerous export in the late 90s .
is remembered as the preeminent Japanese fighter of yesteryear .
However , eight years ago , Hayato " Mach " Sakurai was an undefeated pound - for - pound star and the reigning Shooto 168 - pound world champ .
During Mach 's undefeated streak , no performance was more outstanding , and no fight more dramatic , than his knockout victory over Frank Trigg Although Sakurai galvanized the crowd at Tokyo NK Bay Hall with early striking success , Trigg was soon able to bully his way into the clinch and put punches on Mach .
When Sakurai attempted to put Trigg on the mat , Trigg was able to astutely reverse , taking top position and dishing out more punishment .
The second round continued in much the same way , as Trigg continued to drop barrages of fists on Mach .
However , when " Twinkle Toes " began to chase Sakurai out of the scramble , the Shooto star turned the tide with a massive left hook that put Trigg on the floor .
A disoriented Trigg leaped to his feet and attempted to close in on Sakurai , only to find himself in the Thai plum , where Sakurai put him on his face again with a massive knee .
The uncharacteristically raucous Tokyo crowd swelled .
As a desperate Trigg attempted to grab Sakurai to hold on and recover , Mach swam to the clinch again , dragged a prone Trigg across the ring and delivered a pair of crushing knees that put him on his face for the final time .
The win solidified Mach as the premier welterweight in the sport .
He would lose his Shooto crown eight months later to an upstart Anderson Silva , and a severe car accident would see the former pound - for - pound stalwart flounder for four years until his revitalization in Pride Bushido .
Yet his comeback KO against Trigg remains one of the greatest moments in the career of one of Japan 's best prizefighters .
They had already met roughly two years earlier .
Fans already knew that Yves Edwards was a legitimate prospect and that Aaron Riley was anything but risk - averse .
But no one could have forecasted what was in store when the two met again in Evansville , Ind. , with Riley looking for revenge for his prior loss and Edwards looking to snatch Riley 's 168 - pound HooknShoot title .
Both scored liberally with punches and kicks over the course of the bout , but Edwards dished out major punishment with vicious knees from the Thai plum , just as he had in the first meeting .
Riley scored by slamming Edwards to the mat repeatedly , pounding , passing guard and taking the back .
However , two insane chain - gun flurries of punches from Edwards in the second round nearly ended Riley 's night , filling his mouth with a pool of blood in horror - schlock fashion and leaving him in need of a third - round finish .
Riley nearly got the submission he sought twice in the third frame , first with a textbook far - side armbar from the top and later with a rear - naked choke as he took Edwards ’ back again .
However , the proprietor of Thugjitsu proved too elusive for Riley .
He escaped his submissions and returned to the feet , where he landed some late punches and knees .
While Riley believed in earnest he'd won the bout , his gory face told a different story .
Edwards took a razor - thin unanimous decision , winning by one point on all three judges ' scorecards .
Despite the loss , things were not as bad for Riley as they might have been .
Although Edwards had racked up nearly 4,000 dollars of dental damage in Riley 's mouth , Riley ’s friend and training partner Roman Roytberg , a dentist , fixed his teeth for free .
And while Edwards made his UFC debut on the back of the victory , Riley 's efforts would n't go overlooked .
The Indiana native would make his Octagon debut 10 months later against Robbie Lawler in a thrilling bout that solidified Riley 's blood - and - guts reputation .
Incredibly enough , just four days after Edwards and Riley had put themselves on the map with a classic , veteran Gil Castillo and upstart Nathan Marquardt met in a high - stakes bout that more than surpassed expectations and saved the evening for a crippled IFC card at the Table Mountain Casino .
Two top - 10 fighters at the time , Castillo was undefeated and a local star in California , while the 22 - year - old Marquardt had become the middleweight King of Pancrase just 10 months earlier .
Their bout was n't just a local welterweight title clash :
In the crowd sat Dana White , ready to hand the winner a UFC contract and the chance to step up to 185 pounds to fight Dave Menne two months later in Las Vegas for the vacant middleweight crown of the new - look , Zuffa - owned UFC .
However , even more was needed from the two fighters when the co-feature of the event , a highly anticipated clash between local prospect David Terrell and veteran Jeremy Horn , was nixed when the ever - mercurial Terrell disappeared from the arena just before fight time .
Castillo and Marquardt delivered the goods with 25 minutes of well - rounded action , highlighted by some sensational technical grappling .
Marquardt 's striking and strength allowed him to put the first two rounds in the bag , much to the joy of the Pancrase representatives who had flown in from Japan to support their champion in hostile territory .
Castillo showed his MMA maturity in the third stanza , though .
Marquardt took him to the mat with a crisp trip takedown , but Castillo got to his feet and put Marquardt on the floor with a flawless fireman 's carry .
The moment marked a turning point in the fight .
Marquardt , who sustained a back injury in the bout , could n't find the submission finish he sought from the bottom .
Castillo stayed one step ahead over the final 15 minutes to take a well - earned decision in a fantastically competitive bout .
While Marquardt would move up to 185 pounds for good , becoming a perennial top middleweight , the win stands as perhaps the best moment in Castillo 's career .
The Cesar Gracie product would go on to lose his title bid against Menne in a lackluster fight on the dismal and disastrous UFC 33 card in Vegas .
Castillo was halted on a cut in his last major fight , a November 2002 challenge against Matt Hughes for the UFC welterweight title in another uninspired , forgettable fight .
It seemed like yet another mocked Midwestern MMA card .
A Victory Fighting Championships show at a small casino in Council Bluffs , Iowa .
A card in which every fight , save for a testicularly painful no contest between John Halverson and John Strawn , ended with an elementary first - round submission .
As though self - parody could n't be any more forthcoming , Travis Fulton had barely hit his opponent before his foe wanted out in a 20 mere seconds .
and Spencer Fisher , however , seemed wholly unsatisfied with such a laughable , stereotypical script .
Both Fisher and Neer were undefeated as pros and tabbed as the next big thing out of the Midwest .
Fisher had the Miletich pedigree but also uncommonly natural , powerful striking and a slick submission game .
Neer had won over hearts and minds in the area with his rugged and innumerable beatdowns of local competition as an amateur at the Toad Holler , a small nightclub in Des Moines .
While Fisher entered the bout as champion , it was hard to discern a favorite .
It seemed the two had each led their own enormous , partisan armies into the arena , polarizing the Harrah 's Casino .
The 25 minutes of raw and relentless action that transpired defies textual description .
While both men showed skills on the floor , the action on the feet is what crystallized the bout as a classic .
At the end of the first round , Neer followed Fisher back to his corner as a reminder that he would go nowhere over the next 20 minutes , and " The Dentist " was true to his word .
Furious toe - to - toe action over the next four rounds produced an in - cage climate of unhinged emotion and braggadocio , as Neer and Fisher talked trash to each other while they set about tearing each other apart .
Fisher even harkened back to the first encounter between Pele and Macaco , humping Neer 's head as he sought a takedown .
After five thrilling rounds and a strong case for more five - rounders in MMA , a highly contentious and debatable split decision went to Fisher .
While the two produced a bout that behooves all MMA fans to track down , there is a measure of misfortune herein .
Both have since cut to 155 pounds and are lightweight contenders inside the UFC , but they 've become best friends and training partners under the Miletich banner .
That means we 'll likely never get to see them craft another classic in the cage .
and Jake Shields first met on another major Shooto card , Aug. 10 , 2003 in Yokohama , on the night that Joachim Hansen upset Takanori Gomi to become Shooto world 154 - pound champion .
Their first go - around was certainly nothing to remember .
It was the most forgettable fight on an otherwise sterling card , as Shields laid on top of Kikuchi for 15 dry minutes to hand him his first loss .
Eleven months later , Shields had avenged an early career loss to Ray Cooper in Hawaii to win the vacant Shooto world 168 - pound title and thereby raise the stakes for his second clash with Kikuchi at the outstanding 2004 Shooto year - end finale at Yoyogi National Stadium 's second gymnasium in Tokyo .
After 10 minutes of competitive back - and - forth grappling , Shields needed the third round in order to salvage a draw on the scorecards and retain his title .
After shaking Kikuchi off of his back early , Shields seemed to have enough time left to pound his way even on two of the judges ' scorecards .
However , after a late stand - up by referee Toshiharu Suzuki , Kikuchi came out firing .
He pushed Shields to his heels with punches and forced him into an ill - advised double - leg attempt .
Kikuchi capitalized by dropping hammerfists on Shields before taking the mount and pounding away as the bout drew to a close .
The last - minute salvo was enough to earn Kikuchi a unanimous decision , the Shooto world championship and the biggest win of his career .
Nearly four years later , the welterweight climate is much different .
Akira Kikuchi retired this past January after setbacks against Shinya Aoki ( fights that could arguably deserve a place on this list as well ) and Yoshiyuki Yoshida in an attempt to earn a UFC contract .
Shields has n't lost since falling to Kikuchi .
He ’s riding a nine - fight win streak , having finished his last five opponents .
More importantly , Shields has entrenched himself as the top welterweight outside of the Octagon -- a title he 'll look to affirm Saturday night against Nick Thompson

DEHSS Cancer Spirit Diary 5/12
I learned the meaning of civil liberty when I was a correspondent ( for a different paper ) in Moscow .
Reporting on Russia had its unique charms : the merry scorn which officials showed to the very idea of telling journalists , especially foreign ones , anything other than big , fat , Soviet - scale lies ; the dispiriting submission of most of the population to constant low - level oppression , as if that was the only way power could be exercised ; the disgusting cynicism of the cover-ups that , were they not so appalling , would almost be funny .
I remember one case of a border police official with a reputation for fighting corruption being reported as having " accidentally shot himself several times in the head while drunk " .
But of the petty indignities suffered by Moscow residents who look a bit foreign , the most common is the arbitrary identity check .
You are walking down the street and a Kalashnikov - toting policeman pulls you to one side and mutters a single word : " Dokumenty ! "
Show me your papers .
You hand over your passport ( no one is fool enough to walk around without it ) .
The bullet - head stares incredulously at it for a while and then thrusts it back at you with a gesture that says , " OK , Brit .
Walk on .
You were lucky this time . "
If you are not British , if you are a Chechen or an Uzbek , or a Russian without the correct stamp indicating your right of residence in the capital , being lucky would mean getting away with paying a bribe .
Being unlucky would mean a beating in the back of the police van .
And a bribe .
Being stopped for ID , even when your papers are in order , is an intimidating experience .
For a second , you shrink dramatically in scale .
You are an ant and the boot of arbitrary state power hovers over you .
Then you scurry on and gradually resume your stature as an autonomous individual , but not a free one .
The essence of the identity check is to reinforce a false idea of permission .
The street belongs to the state and you need to prove your right to walk down it .
In Russia , that relationship is hardly questioned by citizens .
Of course you depend on the Kremlin for its indulgence in allowing you to move around the country .
But in a democratic society , permission should work the other way round .
We , as free citizens , give our consent to a small group of people , chosen from among us , to wield power for a fixed term and on the condition that they do n't abuse it .
If we get up to no good , we give them licence to intervene – to use force if necessary – to stop us .
But the rest of the time , we do not need permission .
That is why , of all the various erosions of civil liberties introduced by New Labour , I find the idea of compulsory ID cards the most pernicious .
I do not need leave from the government to walk the streets .
They need permission from me to police the streets – my streets , our streets .
Fortunately , Britain is immeasurably freer than Russia .
The police generally do not wander around harassing people for ID to remind them who owns the place .
Let 's keep it that way .

FREAK Shots : Is Beer Bad for Science ?
The more beer scientists drink , the less likely they are to have a paper published or cited , according to a new study by Thomas Grim , an ornithologist at Palacky University , Czech Republic .
Grim surveyed the behavior of Czech scientists and found a correlation between amount of beer consumed and papers published .
But the Czech Republic may just be an strange exception , points out a New York Times article ; it beats Ireland as having the highest per capita rate of beer consumption in the world .
Or maybe , suggests ornithologist Mike Webster : “ Those with poor publication records are drowning their sorrows . ”
It probably does n’t matter if you ’re drinking Pabst or Vielle Bon Secours — the study did n’t mention the price of the beer making a difference .
Another study in Denmark ( which ranks eighth on the beer consumption list ) showed a correlation between high I.Q. and wine drinkers — and low I.Q. and beer drinkers .
Maybe Freakonomics is better read at a wine bar than a pub .
Rescuers found balloons used by Father Carli in April
DNA tests on a body found off Brazil 's coast this month match that of a priest who went missing trying to set a flight record , the authorities say .
Father Adelir Antonio de Carli lifted off from the Brazilian port city of Paranagua in April strapped to 1,000 brightly - coloured helium balloons .
The 41 - year - old Roman Catholic priest wanted to raise money to build a shelter for local lorry drivers .
His attempt went wrong when unexpected winds carried him out to sea .
The body was discovered by chance earlier this month by tugboat workers .
Father Carli was attempting to break a 19 - hour record for the most hours flying with balloons .
Father Carli's bundle of brightly coloured balloons was found floating in the Atlantic Ocean off Santa Catarina state , near the point where he last made contact with authorities on the ground .
Father Carli had said he was having difficulty operating his GPS device , and was " very cold , but fine " .
He was said to have reached an altitude of 20,000 ft ( 6,000 m ) , then descended to about 8,200 ft for his planned flight to the city of Dourados .
But he was blown off course by winds .
Before losing contact , he said he had to land in the sea as he was " losing height " .
In January , the priest used the same mode of transport to fly over 110 km ( 70 miles ) in four hours between Parana and the nearby Argentine city of San Antonio .
I wonder if Mr. McCain would have given the same answer had Mr. Stephanopoulos confronted him with the graphic video of the pastor in full “ Great Whore ” glory .
But Mr. McCain did n’t have to fear so rude a transgression .
Mr. Hagee ’s videos have never had the same circulation on television as Mr. Wright ’s .
A sonorous white preacher spouting venom just does n’t have the telegenic zing of a theatrical black man .
Perhaps that ’s why virtually no one has rebroadcast the highly relevant prototype for Mr. Wright ’s fiery claim that 9/11 was America ’s chickens “ coming home to roost . ”
That would be the Sept. 13 , 2001 , televised exchange between Pat Robertson and Jerry Falwell , who blamed the attacks on America ’s abortionists , feminists , gays and A.C.L.U. lawyers .
( Mr. Wright blamed the attacks on America ’s foreign policy . )
Had that video re-emerged in the frenzied cable - news rotation , Mr. McCain might have been asked to explain why he no longer calls these preachers “ agents of intolerance ” and chose to cozy up to Mr. Falwell by speaking at his Liberty University in 2006 .
None of this is to say that two wacky white preachers make a Wright right .
It is entirely fair for any voter to weigh Mr. Obama ’s long relationship with his pastor in assessing his fitness for office .
It is also fair to weigh Mr. Obama ’s judgment in handling this personal and political crisis as it has repeatedly boiled over .
But whatever that verdict , it is disingenuous to pretend that there is n’t a double standard operating here .
If we ’re to judge black candidates on their most controversial associates  and how quickly , sternly and completely they disown them  we must judge white politicians by the same yardstick .
When Rudy Giuliani , still a viable candidate , successfully courted Pat Robertson for an endorsement last year , few replayed Mr. Robertson ’s greatest past insanities .
Among them is his best - selling 1991 tome , “ The New World Order , ” which peddled some of the same old dark conspiracy theories about “ European bankers ” ( who just happened to be named Warburg , Schiff and Rothschild ) that Mr. Farrakhan has trafficked in .
Nor was Mr. Giuliani ever seriously pressed to explain why his cronies on the payroll at Giuliani Partners included a priest barred from the ministry by his Long Island diocese in 2002 following allegations of sexual abuse .
Much as Mr. Wright officiated at the Obamas ’ wedding , so this priest officiated at ( one of ) Mr. Giuliani’s .
Did you even hear about it ?
There is not just a double standard for black and white politicians at play in too much of the news media and political establishment , but there is also a glaring double standard for our political parties .
The Clintons and Mr. Obama are always held accountable for their racial stands , as they should be , but the elephant in the room of our politics is rarely acknowledged :
In the 21st century , the so - called party of Lincoln does not have a single African - American among its collective 247 senators and representatives in Washington .
Yes , there are appointees like Clarence Thomas and Condi Rice , but , as we learned during the Mark Foley scandal , even gay men may hold more G.O.P. positions of power than blacks .

A near half - century after the civil rights acts of the 1960s , this is quite an achievement .
Yet the holier - than - thou politicians and pundits on the right passing shrill moral judgment over every Democratic racial skirmish are almost never asked to confront or even acknowledge the racial dysfunction in their own house .
In our mainstream political culture , this de facto apartheid is simply accepted as an intractable given , unworthy of notice , and just too embarrassing to mention aloud in polite Beltway company .
Those who dare are instantly accused of “ political correctness ” or “ reverse racism . ”
The iPhone , the latest must - have gadget from Apple , fails to give users complete access to the internet , the Advertising Standards Authority ( ASA ) rules today .
It said the combined phone , music player and computer is flawed because of the absence of two common website programmes , Flash and Java .
As a result , the authority said Apple 's claim that the iPhone gave access to " all parts of the internet " misled customers about its power as a web browser .
Users of the iPhone cannot access the graphics , videos and games on many websites , including the BBC's , because of the absence of Flash .
Java 's absence deprives users from making use of website shortcuts , typically the copying of personal details on order forms .

Watch the ad
of the New York Times lists several examples of services that would be most hurt .
Smaller web - based services that consume a lot of bandwidth would shut down shortly after such a service would be introduced .
Among these would be popular internet video sites such as Revision3 , Viddler , and DailyMotion , which as of this writing are not owned by multibillion dollar companies such as the ever popular YouTube and Revision3 competitor CNET TV ( soon to be owned by CBS ) .
But this plan will eventually bring down the behemoths of the web , most notably Google and Microsoft .
Google
Google , with its vast financial savings would be fine at the start , with the ability to suffer losses longer than the smaller companies .
But these smaller companies depend on Google 's AdSense programs to generate revenue .
Google also makes money with AdSense , and it seems feasible that its primary revenue source will quickly dry up .
Google 's search engine likely wo n't take a hit , since it is low bandwidth , but as with every company , lost revenue equals cutbacks in both staff and services .
High maintenance Google offerings would quickly be shuttered , probably beginning with services such as Google Maps , Google Docs , and Google Reader , as those likely do not create any revenue due to the lack of ads on the services .
It is also possible , however , that Google could evolve and put ads on those services , but without their ad revenue , they would not be the same Google that the web community has come to know and love .
Microsoft
Microsoft , however , needs to be concerned the most .
They are now in three major playing fields - portable media with the Zune , games with the XBOX consoles , and operating systems with Windows .
The Zune is finally catching on , and Microsoft has finally begun a full - scale assault with ads promoting both the Zune and Zune Marketplace .
While Marketplace is n't the scale of Apple 's competing iTunes ( Apple , you best be concerned too ) , those video and music files are enormous .
Using a Mininova torrent for reference , the average Daily Show ( about twenty one minutes ) is 215 MB .
I frequently download the free " Countdown with Keith Olbermann " show , which is twice the length of a Daily Show episode .
In addition to Countdown , I also have NBC Nightly News in the podcast section .
Downloading only these two shows for an average of 23 days a month comes out to about 17 GB a month .
This is only for two shows .
The Marketplace is also very prominent on the XBOX 360 .
The 360 Marketplace is very similar to its Zune counterpart , but the files are much bigger .
It has , along with TV shows , feature - length films .
Feature length films on Mininova are about 700 MB each .
The recently posted Battlefield : Bad Company demo alone was 1.2 GB .
With bandwidth caps , consumers will not download movies , instead opting to go rent the DVD at Blockbuster , which is really a reversal of technological progress .
Going past the Marketplace , the big purpose for the 360 is online gaming .
The Wii's online is sparse , and the PS3s has yet to come to shape , but it is widely considered that the 360 is the best multiplayer console .
Of course , to have multiplayer , the 360 depends on the Internet to connect to servers .
The amount of bandwidth used varies ( hosting or not , game playing , game mode , opponents , etc. ) , but it can range from 10 MB per hour to 260 MB per hour .
PER HOUR !
Using a conservative figure of two hours per day for twenty four days a month , that 's another 13 GB .
Now , only downloading two podcasts and playing my XBOX , I am near the first level of the proposed cap : 30GB .
Current operating systems are still installed from CDs and are stored exclusively on the users hard drive .
It 's inevitable that Microsoft 's OS will become dependent on the web for nearly everything .
But just looking at today , Windows Update ( as well as the update tools on Linux and OSX ) uses quite a bit of bandwidth .
SP1 to Vista , for example , is 420 MB .
This does not count the other updates to the OS that are already released .
Overall , these are small , but when users are being crunched for bandwidth , they may end up using Linux , which will allow them to purchase more bandwidth .
It is critical for Microsoft to fight against bandwidth caps .
Google and Microsoft are two companies that are bitterly fighting against each other .
But they both rely on the internet to fund their core businesses .
Divided , they hardly stand a chance against AT&T , Comcast , Time Warner , and Verizon .
But together , they can stand up to them .
They must .
Although the web survived the stifling of AOL in the 90s , it will not survive another .
Today , I was perusing the web and wound up , as usual , on Digg .
One of the top dugg stories was about American ISPs throttling internet access .

Huge Failure Rate Found Upon Delivery of New Ballot Marking Devices from Sequoia Voting Systems
Nassau County Refuses to Accept More Failing Systems ...
Bo Lipari Byon 7/6/2008 , 11:30 am PT
Guest Blogged by Bo Lipari of New Yorkers For Verified Voting ...
You would have thought that since there have been so many documented problems in other states over the years that voting machine vendors would have gone out of their way to make sure new systems being deployed in the Empire State were thoroughly tested , met all state requirements , and worked flawlessly .
At a minimum , you would expect that any business fulfilling an enormous , multi-million - dollar contract to a new client would make sure the systems were , well , at least operational .
But , incredibly , you would be wrong .
The machines which ES&S and Sequoia are providing to New York State are failing initial testing at a rate which would astound anyone – unless you ’ve been following the voting machine industry for the last 10 years .
I discussed these problems on my July 2 , 2008 Voice of the Voters [ MP3 ] radio show with my guest , Bill Biamonte , Election Commissioner of Nassau County , the second largest Board of Elections in the state which serves over 870,000 voters .
In a June 26 letter to Judge Gary Sharpe , who ordered New York State to complete its Help America Vote Act implementation by 2009 , Nassau County reports the unbelievably high failure rates they ’re finding in the systems they ’ve received :
“ … of the 156 BMDs [ Ballot Marking Devices ] received by Nassau through June 26 , 2008 - after the SBOE acceptance tested them in Albany - have substantial operational flaws that render them unusable or that require major repairs .
29 were rejected immediately when they were unloaded from the truck because of obvious physical defects or damages , such as a broken side of the printer .
62 failed diagnostic testing because of problems with the USB cord and the printer .
And 42 failed Nassau ’s acceptance testing for a variety of reasons , such as nonresponsive key pads and battery failure .
Out of a total of 156 BMDs , only 23 can be used by voters in the condition they were received in . ”
On the radio show we broke an important story – on July 1 Nassau County wrote a second letter to the Court explaining that they will refuse to accept any more systems until the vendor resolves the huge number of problems with the systems :
“ In view of the foregoing , Nassau respectfully requests this Court to order the SBOE to demand that its vendor Sequoia immediately make arrangements to repair or replace the damaged or defective BMDs so that Nassau has adequate time to implement the BMDs in time for the September primary elections - elections that are now roughly two months away . ”
“ Nassau believes it has no sound alternative but to postpone delivery of its remaining BMDs until the problem is addressed .
We believe this is the only sensible course of action , given the strong likelihood that damaged BMDs will either have to be replaced or shipped elsewhere for repair and then shipped back to Nassau County , wasting precious time immediately before the primary elections . ”
As I said , if you ’ve been following the voting system industry over the last few years it wo n’t surprise you to hear of colossal failure rates , and $ 12,000 machines that wo n’t even start up .
This is why it ’s vitally important we continue our work toward citizen oversight of elections .
As part of this job , New Yorkers for Verified Voting , along with the League of Women Voters and many others worked long and hard in 2006 to get the state to adopt regulations that are among the most rigorous voting system certification requirements in the country .
It is due in great part to these regulations that it has been so difficult , and continues to be difficult , for the shoddy merchandise that the voting machine companies are foisting on us to be approved in New York State .
Now let ’s hope that Judge Gary Sharpe agrees that it would be a travesty of justice to force New York State voters to vote on broken systems , and that he turns a hard eye on the voting machine vendors who are taking our taxpayer dollars and selling us - let me be blunt - nothing but crap .

Assets the Federal Reserve agreed to accept in March from Bear Stearns Cos. to facilitate its sale to J.P. Morgan Chase & Co. are now valued about $ 1 billion less than estimated at the time of the transaction .
The decline , to $ 28.9 billion from $ 30 billion in mid-March , is n't yet enough to put U.S. taxpayers on the hook for any losses ; J.P. Morgan , under an agreement with the Fed , would take the first hit once the assets are sold .
In addition , the assets are expected to be sold over the coming decade in a way that is designed to minimize losses and market disruption .
Late last month , the Fed contributed $ 28.8 billion to a new firm , Maiden Lane LLC , to finance the assets and provide a loan .
J.P. Morgan supplied $ 1.15 billion , which would cover the first losses from any decline in the assets ' value .
Maiden Lane is a street running alongside the New York Fed 's headquarters .
The Fed agreed to extend the loan in March with Bear Stearns on the brink of bankruptcy .
Central - bank officials feared that the sudden downfall of the fifth - largest U.S. investment bank would wreak havoc on broader financial markets and the economy .
The Bear Stearns portfolio at the time largely contained mortgage - related assets , which are riskier than other investments , but did n't include subprime mortgage debt .
It was originally valued in part by Bear Stearns , while the recent valuation was conducted by the Fed and its adviser , BlackRock Inc .
The Fed plans to release an updated value of the portfolio quarterly .
大きなバストに憧れる女性が多いのは、プエラリアをはじめとするバストアップサプリメントが人気になっていることからも分かります。
実はイソフラボンにも、バストアップ効果が期待できるのです。
なぜイソフラボンにバストアップ効果があるの？
イソフラボンにバストアップ効果があるのは、女性ホルモンのうち卵胞ホルモンに似た働きを持っているためです。
女性ホルモンに は2種類ある
女性ホルモンは大きく分けると、卵子を育てる卵胞ホルモンと、妊娠しやすい体にしてくれる黄体ホルモンがあり、どちらもバストアップ効果を持っています。
バストアップサプリのうち、プエラリアは卵胞ホルモン、ワイルドヤムやチェストベリーは黄体ホルモンの似た働きを持っています。
これらのホルモンを「増やす」ことによってバストアップを狙っているのです。
イソフラボンは卵胞ホルモンに似ている
上述のようにイソフラボンにも卵胞ホルモンに似た働きがあり、食事やサプリによって摂取することは卵胞ホルモンを「増やす」ことにつながります。
プエラリアと同様、これによってバストアップを狙うことができるというわけです。
イソフラボンによるバストアップの注意点
ただ、イソフラボンのバストアップ効果に期待するならば、気をつけてほしいことがあります。
それは 「低温期に摂取してほしい」ということです。
妊活のために基礎体温を測っている人は知っているでしょうが、卵胞ホルモンの働きが強い時期は比較的体温が低いため「低温期」といわれています。
逆に黄体ホルモンの働きが強い時期は比較的体温が高い「高温期」と呼ばれています。
プエラリアを摂取して体調が悪くなったという口コミは結構ありますが、高温期に摂取してホルモンバランスを崩してしまったことが主な原因です。
イソフラボンはプエラリアと比較すれば効果は弱いですが、ホルモンバランスに影響を与える可能性が皆無というわけではありませんので、バストアップ効果を期待するならばプエラリアと同様、低温期に摂取するのがおすすめです。

This afternoon , Mr. Muñoz and his mother scrutinized the week ’s menus to figure out what they could scrounge from storage without upending the rest of the week ’s schedule .
After a quick survey of items on the porch , Mr. Muñoz decided on pasta with tuna .
Soon , pots on all four burners on the stove were bubbling with milk , pasta , and white and yellow rice .
While waiting for the chicken to warm , Ms. Zapata and her children began sorting bills on a chair in a bedroom ; no other space was available .
Electricity runs about $ 120 a month , and gas $ 100 every two months .
According to Mr. Muñoz , the family spends about $ 200 a week on the meals .
“ If I had a choice , ” he said , “ I ’d do a good breakfast with a proper budget .
And I ’d do lunch , too . ”
By 5 p.m. he was fading .
He slouched against the kitchen wall and closed his eyes for a moment .
Then he straightened up , poured his sixth cup of coffee of the day , and served himself a bowl of lentils over buttered rice .
This was his dinner , and as the workers do , he ate standing up .
By 8:30 , the truck was loaded .
“ Bye , Mami , ” Mr. Muñoz said as he gave his mother a kiss .
“ I love you . ”
En route , he stopped off at the International Ministerial Church of Jesus Christ in Woodside , as he does every night .
When he arrived on the corner , the men lined up in single file in front of the bed of the truck , which functioned as a counter .
He handed takeout containers to the men , who almost all returned for seconds .
One man stuffed plastic boxes of orange juice into his pockets to tide him over until the next meal .
Within 10 minutes , the truck was empty .
Mr. Muñoz tipped over the hot chocolate cooler .
“ I think there is a little bit left , ” he announced to one of the workers .
“ There is a little , brother .
You got the last drop . ”
NEW YORK 
Stocks shot higher Tuesday , gaining back the previous session 's sharp losses and then some , after a drop in oil prices and a rise in consumer confidence gave investors some hope for a letup in Americans ' financial woes .
The Dow Jones industrial average rose 266 points .
Oil prices tumbled more than $ 2 a barrel Tuesday , finishing at their lowest level in seven weeks as a stronger dollar and beliefs that record prices are eroding the world 's thirst for energy sparked another dramatic sell - off .
Light , sweet crude for September delivery fell $ 2.54 to settle at $ 122.19 on the New York Mercantile Exchange , extending their two - week - long retreat from record highs above $ 147 .
The prospect of lower energy costs for U.S. consumers , along with a modest uptick in the Conference Board 's July index of consumer confidence to 51.9 from 51 in June , came as welcome news to investors .
Consumer spending accounts for more than two - thirds of U.S. economic activity .
" The thinking is that oil prices are heading lower , and that 's obviously a positive for the market , " said Richard E. Cripps , chief market strategist for Stifel Nicolaus .
The drop in oil — which surpassed $ 4 a barrel at one point during the day — was a throwback to oil 's nosedive over the past two weeks and outweighed supply concerns touched off by a militant attack Monday on two Nigerian crude pipelines .
It was oil 's seventh decline in the last 10 sessions .
A stock bounce was hardly unexpected , though , after the Dow lost nearly 240 points Monday on worries about the sagging financial sector .
Wall Street is torn : Energy prices , if they continue on their downward path , could provide big relief to consumers and in turn help the economy , but credit losses keep mounting at the nation 's major banks .
The result is big swings in the market but little consistent direction .
" We 're living from one piece of news to the next , " said Alan Gayle , senior investment strategist for RidgeWorth Capital Management .
The market 's volatility , exacerbated by light summer trading volumes , is likely to continue unless it gets further evidence that oil prices are , indeed , on their way down , and that banks have already seen the bulk of their losses .
In a sign that there could be further asset markdowns for banks , Merrill Lynch announced late Monday that it was writing down another $ 5.7 billion and selling assets tied to risky debt at a steep discount to Lone Star Funds , a distressed debt investor .
Still , Merrill 's moves at least answered lingering questions about the health of the brokerage 's balance sheet .
And many analysts said the asset sale could help to finally establish a market for all the hard - to - value securities held by various financial institutions .
" The bad news is , there 's going to be write - downs .
The better news is , we can estimate those write - downs with better clarity , " said Alan Gayle , senior investment strategist for RidgeWorth Capital Management .
" Nevertheless , this is a hot summer in more ways than one ; this volatility reflects continued uncertainty .
We 're living from one piece of news to the next . "
The Dow gained 266.48 , or 2.39 % , to 11,397.56 .
Broader stock indicators also climbed .
The Standard & Poor 's 500 index rose 28.83 , or 2.34 % , to 1,263.20 , and the Nasdaq composite index rose 55.40 , or 2.45 % , to 2,319.62 .
The Dow and the S&P are now less than 20 % below their Oct. 9 record peaks — technically out of bear market territory .
The Nasdaq is less than 19 % below its Oct. 31 peak .
Still , another downturn will put the market back into bear territory , and some analysts would call an advance like Tuesday 's a bear market rally .
Advancing issues outnumbered by nearly 4 to 1 on the New York Stock Exchange , where volume came to 1.40 billion shares .
Bond prices fell after advancing a day earlier .
The yield on the benchmark 10 - year Treasury note , which moves opposite its price , rose to 4.05 % from 4.01 % late Monday .
The dollar was mostly higher against other major currencies , while gold prices fell .
Merrill , which plans to issue new stock to raise $ 8.5 billion , initially saw its stock drop .

How to Create a Website
Anyone can create a website ... in minutes .
Welcome !
My name is Ian .
I 've been creating websites since 1996 .
If you need to create a website , but do n't know where to start , you 've come to the right place !
Here , I explain how to create a website .
I also explain how to get your own domain name ( eg , yourname.com ) , and how to host your website ( make it available to the world ) .
There are two main approaches to creating a website .
Use an online website builder .
This is the easiest approach .
This allows you to create a website without actually having to learn all the technical stuff .

Build it yourself .
This is where you need to know things like HTML , CSS , JavaScript , and a multitude of other technologies before you even start .
Use an Online Website Builder
This is the easiest way to create a website .
Using an online website builder , you can build a website without needing to know all the technical stuff .
To use an online website builder , you simply log in to your account , pick a template , and add content .
It 's just like how bloggers use WordPress to create blog posts , however a website builder is better for when you need more control over where and how the content is displayed .
Website builders usually enable you to add stuff like forms , photo galleries , slide shows , and navigation bars to your website .
And adding such components is usually done within a few clicks .
A good website builder will also allow you to preview your changes before you publish them .
That way you can see what your changes will look like to your audience , before your audience gets to see them .
This allows you to experiment without worrying about it affecting your website users .
Example Website Builder
Here 's what ZappyHost 's Website Builder looks like while editing a restaurant themed website .
The toolbar allows you to quickly add components such as forms , images , social icons , and more .
You can also click Preview before you publish any changes , just to make sure you 'll see it exactly as it will appear to your users .
This website example uses the " So Thai " template , which includes all images .
You can always replace these images with your own or choose from thousands of stock images that are supplied with the website builder .
You can also switch themes at any time — there are hundreds of themes to choose from .
You can give your website a complete redesign with the click of a mouse !
The website builder is very intuitive , and you should n't have too much trouble using it .
In any case , here 's ZappyHost 's
Help page with a list of common tasks in case you need some help getting started .
Example Websites made with the Website Builder
Here are two websites that I set up within 5 minutes .
Both use ZappyHost 's online website builder .
I did this to show you how easily you can create a website using this system .
" So Thai " Theme
This first example uses a template called " So Thai " , which is perfect for restaurants , cafes , and other food based websites .
All photos come with the template .
I did n't change anything except the text .
So you can add your own text and photos , add a page or two , update the navbar if required , and you 'll have your own unique website in no time !
" Creative Portfolio " Theme
This second example uses a template called " Creative Portfolio " , which is great for displaying your creative work such as photography , graphic design , artwork , and other creative endeavors .
The portfolio page uses a carousel that enables users to scroll through your images .
But there 's nothing stopping you from using this template for any other purpose if you like the look .
As with any template , you can customize the navbar , upload your own photos ( or choose from the stock photos ) , add a contact form , and more .

Building your Own Website
You 've just seen how easy it is to create a website using an online website builder .
If you prefer not to use a website builder , you 'll need to build the site from scratch .
The rest of this article explains what 's involved in building a site from scratch .
Building a website from scratch requires a greater level of technical knowledge , but it provides you with the greatest flexibility .
You can create your website exactly how you want it to be without being restricted by templates , plugins , or other factors .
Creating your website from scratch will involve at least the following steps .
Register a Domain Name
One of the first things you should think about before you create a website , is its domain name .
A domain name is the thing that looks like this : yourdomain.com .
Your domain name represents the URL ( or permanent web address ) of your website .
Therefore , when anyone types your domain name into their browser , they will see your website .
Your domain name is one of the most important parts of your website .
It 's the only thing people need to know in order to visit your website .
Your domain name will also likely be one of the most enduring parts of your website .
You may go through many redesigns , and even many web hosts , but chances are , you 'll keep the same domain name throughout .
You get a domain name by registering it through a domain name registrar or hosting provider .
You simply check that your preferred domain name is available , then register it ( online ) .
Most hosting providers offer domain name registrations when you sign up for one of their hosting plans ( see below ) .
Domain names are registered on an annual basis , and you can usually register it many years in advance ( or set " auto - renew " ) .
Prices can range from between $ 10 to $ 15 up to as much as $ 35 or even $ 45 ( this is for the same product ! ) .
It does n't matter which domain registrar you check .
If a domain name is available , it will be available at all registrars that support that top level domain ( top level domain being the .com , .org , .info , etc part ) .
Similarly , if it 's unavailable at one registrar , it will be unavailable at all registrars .
Get a Web Host A web host ( or hosting provider ) , is a company that makes your website available for the world to see .
They have the equipment and technical skills to make sure your website is available to the world , 24 hours a day , 7 days a week .
Choose your hosting provider carefully — a good host will have excellent support .
A bad host can have almost no support at all !
If you 're new to creating websites , good support can reduce the stress that comes from doing something for the first time .
Also , some web hosts have an online website builder .
A good website builder can enable anyone to make a website — even a complete novice .
If you do n't need a website builder , you can build your website on your own computer , then upload it to your hosting plan when you 're ready to go live .
The common method of uploading website files is by FTP .
If you 'd like to learn more about web hosts , check out my web hosting tutorial .
Also check out ZappyHost 's hosting plans , where you can also register your domain name at the same time .

Build your Website
There are many different methods for developing websites .
Each developer has their own preference , but generally , you create your website " offline " first .
This is typically done on your own computer , or in a development environment ( if you 're in a team ) .
This enables you to be fully creative with your website .
You can try things out , break things , revert it back to a previous version , it does n't matter because nobody is watching ( except maybe the other developers ) .
Once you 're happy with the " offline " version of your website , you can upload it to the " live " server ( usually located at your hosting provider 's data center ) .
Once uploaded , the whole world can see your website .
Large development teams often have various stages that a website will go through before going " live " .
It might start on a development server , before being migrated to a test server , and then maybe even to a " staging " server , before finally being signed off for live deployment .
Either way , the " live " site requires web hosting and a domain name ( more on these below ) .
Although web building has changed significantly since the early days of the web , the fundamental technologies and concepts remain .
Here 's an overview of the basic skills required to build a website .
You can also fast - track your learning by downloading some free templates and studying how they 've been coded .
Combine this with an HTML tutorial here , a CSS tutorial there , and maybe even a JavaScript tutorial and you 'll be well on your way to becoming a professional front - end developer .
Taking it further , you could learn how databases work , pick up some PHP skills , a little JSON , and maybe even some Python and you 'll be able to start applying for jobs as a backend developer .
Add Content
If your website is a small , brochure type site , its content might be built into the HTML files .
If this is the case , every time you add new content , you 'll need to create a new file , then upload it to the server .
However , most modern websites have a content management system ( CMS ) .
This enables you to add content to the website without having to go through the development process mentioned above .
A CMS also allows non-technical people to provide content , so they do n't need to know how to create a whole website before they can simply publish an article on the site .
So if your website uses a CMS , adding content can be a continuous process that works independently of the website development process .
In other words , you can be developing a new website in your development environment , while content providers continue to update the existing site via its content management system .
When it comes time for you to upload your changes , you can do so without affecting their content .
However , if you make development changes to the database that holds the content , then you 'll need to migrate the existing ( live ) data into your new / updated database .
A Tip about Free Websites
You might occasionally encounter companies offering you a free website .
Basically you can sign up , and start building your website for free .
But ... a word of caution !
There are things they might not tell you when they 're trying to sell you a free website .
While a few companies will be completely upfront about these extra costs , others will fail to mention them ... until you 've signed up : Your " free " website does not have its own domain name ( eg , www.yourname.com ) .
If you want your own domain name , you 'll have to pay for it .
And you will probably pay more than you should .
) .
If you want your own domain name , you 'll have to pay for it .
And you will probably pay more than you should .
Your " free " website may have ads displayed all over it .
This enables the company ( not you ) , to earn money from your website .
To remove the ads , you will usually have to pay money for a premium package .
Most of the really good features are actually part of a " premium " package — which you have to pay for .
So , if you 're shopping around , check for those three things before you sign up .
If you do choose the free option , I would highly recommend that you get your own domain name .
Registering your own domain name is the best piece of advice I can give .
Without this , your website does not have its own " web address " .
This might not sound like much now , but later , once you 've built up a fantastic website with loads of content , you will see what I mean .
Without your own domain name , your " web address " is not actually yours , it 's the company who provides your " free " website .
If they decide to change something , you could lose all your hard work .
Imagine losing months , or even years , of hard work , just because you chose not to register a domain name !
Creating a Blog
Creating a blog is similar to creating a website .
You use exactly the same steps as outlined above .
However , there are some minor differences between blogs and websites .
Some hosting plans include a blog builder .
These are very similar to online website builders , but they use blogging software instead .
Blogging plans like this automatically create a blog for you when you sign up .
For example , this is what ZappyHost 's WordPress hosting does .

Shopping Carts & Ecommerce Websites
Websites with online stores are often referred to as " ecommerce websites " .
Ecommerce websites usually have a shopping cart that customers can add products to .
Once the customer is ready to purchase your product , they can proceed to the checkout where they can register as a customer , pay for the product , provide shipping details etc .
Ecommerce websites are a little more complex than basic websites .
For example , an ecommerce website usually needs to have an administration section where you can add / edit products to display on your storefront ( along with other details such as price , description , size / color options , etc ) .
The website also needs to enable customers to search your product catalog and purchase your products .
Because of the extra requirements of an ecommerce website , you will need more than a simple website builder .

Still not sure about how to go about creating a website ?

On the short list for John Sidney McCain 's v.p. is Bobby Jindal , Louisiana 's governor -- or as Chip Reid calls him , " Republican superstar " .
Governor Bobby defends intelligent design as " a legitimate scientific discipline that has a place in the nation ’s classrooms " in this video from CBS ’s Face the Nation , broadcast June 15 , 2008 .
To all those disappointed Hillary voters , is this who you 'd want in the White House , should McCain get elected ?
Unfortunately , due to the complicity of the Mainstream News Media , America is at a crossroads – one that most citizens are n’t even aware of ; our MSM is run by corporate interests , and even though some reporters would give anything to tell us the truth , they are stifled from reporting the real news by their corporate masters .
We have one or two reporters that deserve the Medal of Freedom for their honesty and tenacity , like Keith Olbermann for instance – but his audience is too small to make a real difference , and the news I ’m speaking of should dominate the media , in print , on the radio and on all of the nightly news reports , but instead , what we hear are bits and pieces of so - called news that fail to sound the alarm that America is dying , not a slow death , but our economy is close to a complete collapse , and if Bush and Cheney have their way , World War III could begin at any moment .
Yes , it ’s that serious , yet the MSM refuses to tell Americans the truth , traitors and cowards for refusing to honor their own beliefs in journalism and protecting the freedom and democracy that a “ free press ” traditionally provided to its subscribers .
The framers of our constitution understood that a free press was essential to the survival of our democracy , and even on our own government ’s website , these words are immortal and as true today as when our constitution was first written :
Copyrighted Image ?
DMCA
— C H A P T E R 4 —
Freedom of the Press
Congress shall make no law . . . abridging the freedom of speech , or of the press ?.
— First Amendment to the U.S. Constitution
Although a cherished right of the people , freedom of the press is different from other liberties of the people in that it is both individual and institutional .
It applies not just to a single person ’s right to publish ideas , but also to the right of print and broadcast media to express political views and to cover and publish news .
A free press is , therefore , one of the foundations of a democratic society , and as Walter Lippmann , the 20th - century American columnist , wrote , “ A free press is not a privilege , but an organic necessity in a great society . ”
Indeed , as society has grown increasingly complex , people rely more and more on newspapers , radio , and television to keep abreast with world news , opinion , and political ideas .
One sign of the importance of a free press is that when antidemocratic forces take over a country , their first act is often to muzzle the press .
Thomas Jefferson , on the necessity of a free press ( 1787 ) The basis of our government being the opinion of the people , the very first object should be to keep that right ; and were it left to me to decide whether we should have a government without newspapers , or newspapers without a government , I should not hesitate a moment to prefer the latter .
http://usinfo.state.gov/products/pubs/rightsof/press.htm
Without a free press , and I mean a news media that fulfills the obligation to our constitution who understand they are one of the first lines of defense against tyranny and despotism , liberty and democracy will not survive !
When “ the people ” are no longer are aware of the truth , and are fed lies and propaganda under the guise of it being “ news ” , it is impossible to hold - on to a democracy and the very essence of liberty and freedom - the spirit and principles which caused this great nation to be founded .
Our press has been compromised , and now the only thing left to save our country is the people themselves - and to accomplish this seemingly impossible feat , the responsibility falls directly upon those of us who are aware of the truth , and we must not shirk our responsibility to sound the warning to our relatives and neighbors , and above all , find the courage to do more than write and talk about the danger (s ) we face , but add action to our beliefs and help to bring about an awakening in the United States that will ring - out and reverberate throughout the country .
Yes , we can do it , but it wo n’t be easy , but the fruits of failure are so impossible to imagine that I believe the American people , acting together , can and will take action in support of our beliefs and work to restore our constitutional standards and the rule of law to a nation that has lost its way .
I ’m a firm believer in the separation of church and state , however , if a pastor knows that a tornado is heading directly toward his church , does he ignore it and pray that God will spare his congregation , or will he sound a warning for his parishioners to seek cover until the storm has passed ?
One of the ways that we can spread the word is through the real churches that believe in the true beliefs of Christianity - not the radical evangelicals that support war in the Middle - East to “ help ” bring - on the second coming of Christ ; if you believe in God , then you know that he does n’t need any help in bringing about his wishes - and ever since I was a child I was taught that “ God helps those who help themselves , ” and as grim as the real news is , we need all of the help we can get , and that includes America ’s thousands of churches whom truly adhere to the teachings of Christ .
We all know that Bush and Cheney are being urged by Israel to attack Iran , being told that if we do n’t do it , they will do it themselves .
The probability of war is so thick right now that it ’s being written about all over the world , yet Americans see little evidence in our own news that an attack is right around the corner , and the consequences of such an attack will forever change the face of the United States .
Do n’t take my word for it , read it yourselves , and then print this article and give it to your neighbor , and ask your pastor to sound the alarm as well .
As Americans who believe in the rule of law , like our Congress , it is our duty to help to stave off war , and hoping that Congress or someone else will do it has proven to be fruitless , akin to expecting President Bush to tell the truth instead of constantly lying to the public and destroying everything that Americans cherish and believe in , including our belief that no one is above the law , and that includes the President of The United States !
In the past 72 hours , the rhetoric is reaching a feverish pitch , and Congress is vacationing while our economy is crumbling and America is marching toward another war , this one which will make gas and food so expensive that it will cause riots and poverty that will make the Great Depression seem minor in comparison .
We have almost no food reserves , millions are losing their homes , and the task of feeding our families and keeping gas in our cars is becoming a national nightmare - and all of this has happened before the first bomb has fallen , which should make it obvious that if Bush attacks Iran , our ability to exist as a free and independent society will be compromised and likely lost forever !
Be honest with yourselves ; there ’s nothing left in the treasury , our troops are strained to the limit , and the United Nations has warned that attacking Iran will turn the Middle - East into a “ Ball of Fire ! ”
Read the war rhetoric that has been authored in the past few days , and whether you believe in God or not , it ’s time to enlist everyone you know , churches , unions , social groups , anyone and everyone that wishes to exist in a free and democratic society and warn them that we are directly in the path of a “ tornado ” of hate , loathing and greed , all of it brought upon us by a President that refuses to honor our Constitution and the rule of law .
It ’s also important to know exactly “ who ” President Bush is , and what his family has stood for , and by understanding their history , it becomes even more imperative to stop him dead in his tracks and instead of “ appeasing ” President Bush as happened in 1933 with Prescott Bush , this time we need to prosecute the fascists that are attempting to overthrow America !
Bush Fulfills His Grandfather ’s Dream David Swanson , June 27 , 2008
It ’s remarkably common for a grandson to take up his grandfather ’s major project .
This occurred to me when I read recently of Thor Heyerdahl ’s grandson taking up his mission to cross the Pacific on a raft .
But what really struck me was the BBC story aired on July 23rd , 2007 , documenting President George W. Bush ’s grandfather ’s involvement in a 1933 plot to overthrow the U.S. government and install a fascist dictatorship .
I knew the story , but had not considered the possibility that the grandson was trying to accomplish what his grandfather had failed to achieve .
Prescott Sheldon Bush ( 1895 to 1972 ) attended Yale University and joined the secret society known as Skull and Bones .
Prescott is widely reported to have stolen the skull of Native American leader Geronimo .
As far as I know , this has not actually been confirmed .
In fact , Prescott seems to have had a habit of making things up .
He sent letters home from World War I claiming he ’d received medals for heroism .
After the letters were printed in newspapers , he had to retract his claims .

Federal software contractors take note :
A federal appeals court in the US recently ruled that a software owner could n't sue the government for copyright infringement and anti-circumvention violations after the US Air Force refused to pay for a software license and cracked controls built into the software to control unauthorized use .
The owner of the rights to the software sued the Air Force in federal court , alleging copyright infringement and violations of the Digital Millennium Copyright Act , but the Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit held that the principle of sovereign immunity blocked the claims entirely .
The software in question was developed by a member of the Air Force , Sergeant Mark Davenport , in his spare time in order to modernize the manpower database in use by the air service .
He wrote the program at home , but always intended to use it in Air Force manpower applications .
As the process of developing the software continued , Davenport began distributing executable versions to his colleagues for testing purposes .
He always kept the source code on his home computer , though .
At some point in the process , Davenport added an automatic expiration date to the software that required the additional users to install the most recent version upon expiration .
Eventually , the program became popular in the Air Force 's manpower community , the senior brass approved of its use and Davenport received a promotion .
Everything looked great , but then the Air Force – apparently concerned that it had become too dependent on Davenport for support for the program – demanded his source code .
Davenport refused .
In response , the Air Force demoted him , cut his pay and excluded him from certain advisory groups .
Davenport still did n't turn over the source , however , and instead assigned all his rights in the program to the Blueport Company .
Blueport attempted to negotiate a license with the Air Force , but the Air Force refused and contracted instead with another company to replicate the program and modify the object code to avoid the auto - expiration feature .
Not so happy with that outcome , Blueport sued the Air Force for copyright infringement and DMCA violations .
The courts slammed the door shut on the lawsuit almost immediately , however , after determining that principles of sovereign immunity barred the suit from going forward .
Sovereign immunity basically states that the United States is immune from lawsuits , except in areas where it has given its consent to be sued .
The US has waived sovereign immunity in many areas – including copyright infringement – but it often does so with limitations or provisos .
The court of appeals found one such proviso applicable here , and used it to terminate the copyright component of the suit .
Because Davenport was in a position to induce the use of the software in question , the court argued , he could n't then turn around and sue for violation of his copyrights .
This does seem to make a little bit of sense , since otherwise a government employee could induce infringement of his personal copyrights , then sue the government and make a nice little profit .
In this case , though , the issues are n't quite so open and shut – Davenport was perfectly happy to let the Air Force use the software until they began demanding his source , demoted him when he did n't turn it over , and then hired someone else to reverse engineer the program from the object code .
Still , the court said , any ambiguity in the scope of sovereign immunity is construed in favor of the sovereign , so the plaintiff here was out of luck .
Even more interestingly , the court found that the DMCA contains no waiver of sovereign immunity whatsoever .
As a result , the portion of the lawsuit pertaining to the circumvention of the expiration feature was also jettisoned .
At first glance , this might also seem to make a lot of sense .
The government might need to bypass locks on software for purposes of national security , to further a criminal investigation , or to access information from legacy systems after companies stop supporting them .
The lack of any kind of sovereign immunity waiver , however , also lets the government get away with non-essential circumventions .
Government programmers , for example , could un - expire trial versions of software , thus avoiding having to pay for the full version and saving their departments money on pricey software license fees .
Congress could have easily waived sovereign immunity when drafting the DMCA and still kept provisos in place to deal with the national interests above , but chose not to do so .
Maybe Congress just likes free software , too . ®
MOSCOW , Russia ( CNN ) -- Russia 's Foreign Ministry Tuesday threatened a " military - technological " response if the United States deploys a missile defense system in former Soviet - bloc nations near Russia 's borders .
U.S. Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice and Czech Republic 's Karel Schwarzenberg toast the deal Tuesday .
The ministry issued the statement after U.S. Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice signed a deal Tuesday with her Czech counterpart , Karel Schwarzenberg , to place radar units for the system inside the borders of the Czech Republic .
The United States is also seeking a deal with Warsaw to place interceptor missiles in Poland as part of the system .
Rice cited possible nuclear threats from Iran as a reason for the program , which will go to the Czech Parliament for approval .
But Russia reiterated its concerns that the U.S. program would threaten its security .
" There is no doubt that the approachment of elements of the U.S. strategic arsenal to the Russian territory could be used to weaken the potential of our deterrent , " the ministry said in a written statement .
" If the real deployment of the U.S. strategic missile defense system begins near our borders , then we will have to respond using not diplomatic but military - technological methods , " it said .
Watch a report about Tuesday 's agreement »
Russia has proposed a joint global missile defense system that would include Russia , the United States , Europe and others , but the United States has been cold to the idea .
While en route to Prague , Rice told reporters that the United States wants the missile defense system to be " transparent " at all times to Russians .
" We want them to have a way of absolutely seeing for themselves what we know to be true , which is that these systems are in no way aimed at Russia , " she said .
The program has been the subject of several back - and - forths between Russia and the United States .
In April , former Russian President Vladimir Putin said he was encouraged by " confidence building " and " transparency " measures that the United States offered with respect to the program .
But he said that technical experts must decide if those measures are enough .
On Monday , U.S. President George Bush met with Russia 's new president , Dmitry Medvedev , on the sidelines of the Group of Eight summit in Japan .
Watch Bush meet with Medvedev »
" There are certain questions on our agenda where we agree , and these are matters pertaining to Iran , North Korea , " Medvedev said after the meeting .
" But then certainly there are others with respect to European affairs and missile defense where we have differences . "
Pentagon spokesman Bryan Whitman said the United States has made it " very clear " that the purpose of the missile defense system will be to address " emerging " threats from the Middle East .
" The U.S. has offered the Russians comprehensive cooperation and collaboration and offered unprecedented transparency with respect to missile defense systems planned for the European continent , " Whitman said Tuesday in Washington .
iReport.com : Protests over missile base deal
On Tuesday , Rice supported those claims and said the program was likely to continue after Bush leaves office in January .
" We 've made the point to our Russian colleagues that we all face a threat from states like Iran that continue to pursue missiles of ever - longer range , " she said .
" It 's hard for me to believe that an American president is not going to want to have the capability to defend our territory [ and ] the territory of our allies . "
Poland and the United States reached a tentative deal for the missile placement last week , but Rice and Polish Foreign Minister Radoslaw Sikorski , who was in Washington Monday , failed to finalize the agreement .
" There are still some issues , so I can't say for certain what the trajectory is , " she said on the plane to the Czech Republic .
" But I think it was a constructive meeting yesterday . "
The Czech Republic and Poland are former Soviet satellites that are now members of the U.S. - led NATO alliance .

English , Spanish and many other Western languages build most basic sentences around a simple blueprint : a subject followed by a verb and object ; for example , “ mice eat cheese ” .
Other languages , like Turkish and Korean , tend toward subject - object - verb construction , or “ mice cheese eat ” .
“ There ’s something pretty fundamental about these orders , ” says Susan Goldin - Meadow , a linguistic psychologist at the University of Chicago , who led the study .

Scientific charades
To determine whether these differences carry over to unspoken communication , Goldin - Meadow and her colleagues asked 40 native speakers of Chinese , Turkish , English and Spanish to mime scenarios shown on a computer screen using only their hands and body .
These included a boy drinking a bottle of soda and a ship ’s captain swinging a pail of water .
Regardless of the order used in their native spoken language , most of the volunteers communicated with a subject - object - verb construction .
“ We actually thought we were going to get gestures that just matched your speech , ” Goldin - Meadow says .
In a separate experiment , she asked volunteers to reconstruct a scenario using transparencies depicting different elements .
Again , people of all cultures tended to arrange the transparencies in subject - object - verb order .
Early signs
Goldin - Meadow argues that this kind of sentence syntax might therefore be etched into our brains .
Languages that veer away from this form , such as English , must have been influenced by cultural forces .
“ I think the results are exciting , ” says Carol Padden , a linguist at the University of California , San Diego , US .
Padden has documented the emergence of a new sign language in the last 70 years among a small group of Bedouins in the southern Israel .
So - called Al - Sayyid Bedouin Sign Language also builds sentences around a subject - object - verb construction .
“ Consistent word order appears early in a new sign language , ” she says .

Do you ever get the overwhelming urge to run your own country ?
Do you ever feel that everyone else is a fool and only you , and you alone , know what is good for the world ?
Ever feel the need to erect lots of statues of yourself ?
If you answer yes to any of these questions , then there ’s a good chance that you ’re turning into a dictator .
Hitler , Saddam , Stalin , Castro … and now , you .
Here are five simple signs to look out for if you ’re worried you might be turning into a dictator .
5 Absolute power , corrupts absolutely .
Power is a seductive mistress , an addictive thrill , one taste and you ’re left thirsting for more .
And with power comes the urge to conform the world to your whim , to bend reality to your designs , to forge your own heaven !
As the old saying goes : absolute power corrupts absolutely .
And you want that power !
You want to control absolutely everything !
One day you might be standing on the platform in the rain , waiting for a train which is a little late , the next you ’ve vowed to make the trains run on time ; not just your train , but all the trains in the country , all the trains in the world if you can get your hands on them !
It happens .
Just look at poor old Mussolini .
You have the power .
You are the law !:
When you get into an argument or debate you see it a little differently from normal people .
Most people recognise that whoever they ’re arguing with has a different point of view from themselves .
Not you .
When someone disagrees with you they ’re not just expressing their point of view , they ’re sowing the seeds of sedition , they ’re undermining civil stability and spreading enemy propaganda , they ’re practically begging to be taken out behind the chemical sheds and shot .
Dictatorship here you come .
4 Genocide :
It ’s not all bad , is it ?
One of the tell tale signs that you ’re becoming a dictator is when genocide no longer looks quite so bad .
I mean ok , you still do n’t think it ’s a good thing per se , but you start to think it has it ’s uses .
Those folks not too keen on towing the party line ?
Genocide – it ’s probably for the best in the long run .
The more the potential dictator thinks about it , the better genocide seems .
Never much liked the French ?
Genocide .
The skin tone / hair colour / traditional clothes of that ethnic grouping not matching the colour scheme your designer recommended for that bit of desert ?
Genocide .
Annoyed by old people ?
Genocide .
Squirrels stealing all the nuts ?
Genocide .
It ’s a slippery slope to dictatorship .
3 Groupies
Every good dictator needs their own set of groupies .
Hitler had his brown shirts , and then the SS .
Mussolini had his black shirts .
Saddam had the Republican Guard .
Seems it just feels nice to be surrounded by people who like you , people who are dedicated to you , people who would kill and die for you .
So , if you ever start feeling the need to surround yourself with a large group of very violent people , preferably all wearing the same colour shirts or sporting large 80 ’s aviator sun glasses ( even when they ’re inside ) or waxed moustaches , then you ’re in danger of becoming a dictator .

2 Eccentric ?
Moi ?
It ’s a well known fact that dictators are pretty darn eccentric and do n’t feel bad about imposing their little oddities upon their loyal subjects .
So if you ever feel the desire , just for the hell of it , or wonder what it would be like to : make beards illegal , have ‘ Hopping Wednesdays ’ , deport all the turtles , declare yourself a reincarnation of Napoleon or make everybody shave the left side of their head ; then you ’re well on your way to dictatorship .
1 Me , Me , Me .
Dictators are well known to be egomaniacs .
There seems to be a strange correlation between being a dictator and feeling the need to erect lots of statues of yourself in flattering and glorifying poses , to plaster every available flat surface with posters of yourself , to mint coins with your stately noggin printed on them , to put your face on all the stamps , on all the chocolate bars , to have your own three hours weekly television program .
In short , you really love yourself .
Of course dictators explain this strange egocentricity away by saying that it ’s just so that people know they care about them , to know that they are looking over and after their people .
Yeah , that explains why little Jimmy has to wake up screaming and sweating in the night to a poster of your dictatorial grin looking down on him from the bedroom ceiling .
So if you ever get the urge to start slapping photos of yourself all over the place , then you ’re probably becoming a dictator .

The analyst Carl Jung believed that personality type is determined by how people feel and sense the world around them .
According to Jungian theory , people with authoritative tendencies belong to the ISTJ , or Introverted Sensing Thinking Judging , personality type , as defined by the Myers - Briggs Type Indicator test .
ISTJ personalities are driven by a deep need for security .
They are conventional , respect tradition and tend to take a black - and - white view of the world .
People with this personality type sometimes have a negative reputation because they are perceived as being too rigid and as lacking empathy toward others but , on the plus side , they are hardworking and trustworthy , and care deeply about those they love .
Observe people 's workplace habits and behavior toward those who work for them .
Authoritarian personalities work tirelessly to achieve deadlines , have an unquestioning respect for company policies and objectives and expect the same level of hard work and discipline from others .
Authoritarian personalities in management positions tend to reward workers who follow the rules and can become so focused on meeting deadlines that they fail to take account of the needs and problems of those beneath them .
They take a practical approach toward tasks because they have difficulty understanding abstract or creative concepts and may be suspicious of people who think unconventionally .
Study how someone interacts with friends and family .
Authoritarian personalities are not naturally attuned to their own feelings or those of others .
They have difficulty expressing affection , although they care deeply about those close to them and are extremely loyal toward friends and family .
An authoritarian father , for example , may lay down strict rules and regulations for his children , while being a good provider and a responsible , caring parent .
Friends and family members who have this personality type tend to express their affection through actions rather than words .
Engage someone you suspect has authoritarian personality in conversation .
You can pick up a lot about someone 's personality by what they say in everyday conversation .
Look for clues that reveal respect for authority , a need for routine and a practical , logical worldview .
Someone who says , for example , that he takes his clothes to the dry cleaner every Friday night and expresses suspicion of outlandish , fanciful theories might well have an authoritarian personality .

By the time the Senate returns next Monday from its July 4 recess , some 55,000 more homes will have entered foreclosure .
And that ’s hardly the full picture of the growing calamity .
More than three million homeowners are currently at risk of default and millions more are expected to join them in the coming year as home prices drop , the economy falters and delinquencies rise .
Yet the Senate went ahead with its vacation last Friday without passing a foreclosure prevention measure .
The bill was expected to pass , but the vote was derailed by petty politics .
Senator John Ensign , Republican of Nevada , for example , demanded that the Senate add a multibillion dollar package of tax breaks for renewable energy .
Democrats balked  not out of opposition to the tax breaks , which rightly enjoy bipartisan support , but because Mr. Ensign wanted to tack them on to the foreclosure bill without paying for them .
That would threaten passage of the bill in the House , which is more committed than the Senate to pay - as - you - go governing .
This sort of delay achieves political ends , like denying Democrats the chance to campaign on the accomplishment during the recess , but it ’s exceedingly poor policy .
Foreclosures are feeding the nation ’s severe economic problems .
Turmoil in the financial markets is rooted in the collapse of the housing bubble and will not abate until house prices stabilize and sales pick up .
Even Americans fortunate enough to have a down payment and a willing lender are hesitating , understandably fearful of further price drops .
Rising foreclosures add daily to the glut of unsold homes , pushing prices down and foreclosures up in a vicious cycle .
That same financial turmoil , coupled with huge losses in home equity , has deprived many Americans of the means or the confidence to buy a new house or other big - ticket items , like cars .
In a recent Gallup poll , a majority of Americans said they were now worse off financially than they were a year ago .
That ’s the first time in the 32 - year history of the question that more than half the population has reported losing ground .
LONDON , England ( CNN ) --
Imagine every time you closed your curtains , you were capturing enough solar energy to power your laptop .
The technology is available , but no one 's packaged it up in a handy DIY kit at your local hardware store .
Solar textiles use the same technology as traditional solar panels to convert sunlight into energy .
Sheila Kennedy hopes to be the first .
She 's not an interior designer but an architect and professor in practice at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology who is convinced that solar textiles will revolutionize the way we collect and consume power .
" I 've been thinking about what happens when power and light become flexible , literally flexible , " she said .
She calls it " soft power , " as in the " soft energy path , " a term coined Amory Lovins in the 1970s as a way to describe a world where renewable energy would gradually replace the centralized grid .
Later , Joseph
Nye used the term " soft power " to describe the ability of persuasion , values and culture to influence change .
Kennedy 's work with soft power builds on both of these ideas .
For her , soft power is the ability of flexible materials to convert sunlight into energy .
" The soft power approach says there are some incredibly sensual , compelling , beautiful spaces and products that we can be producing using these emerging energy - harvesting materials , " Kennedy said .
Her Boston - based firm , Kennedy & Violich Architecture , has been working with thin - film photovoltaic material , a fabric that looks and moves like cloth but does the job of a solar panel .
" These are materials which can be prepared in the chemistry lab or can be found in nature .
They produce electricity when exposed to light .
They are very efficient and flexible , " she said .
" We are pairing the thin - film photovoltaic material with another semi-conductor material , the light - emitting diode ; they 're two sides of the same coin .
One takes a little bit of the energy of sunlight and transforms it into electricity ; some takes that electricity and turns it into light . "
Rechargeable batteries pocketed into the hem of the curtains gather energy that can be downloaded into a larger home battery .
" From a technical view , the thin - film has the potential to be produced in very high volumes , with a very low embodied energy and a low carbon footprint .
These new photovoltaic materials can be produced in the same way one might print and produce a newspaper , roll to roll .
That can make it very affordable , " Kennedy said .
Its limitations are its performance .
It 's less efficient that glass - based solar technology , but Kennedy predicts that 's going to change .
" Right now there 's research being done on developing sensitivities in thin - film that will allow the energy to continue to be harvested , even at night .
That 's going to revolutionize the applications for solar textiles , " she said .
The current technology can be found hanging in the Vitra Design Museum in Essen , Germany , in a prototype pre-fabricated home called the Soft House .
Farther south and west , the designers are taking their ideas from the Soft House and applying them to a research project for a Soft City .
Kennedy and her team have calculated that by covering just 10 percent of a roof area in Porto , Portugal , solar curtains could provide as much as 70 percent of the average electricity used by a typical household each day .
" It goes to show that you do n't need a very large area .
We 've calculated that 15 square meters would be enough . "
Kennedy envisions a future in which a single homeowner or a group of neighbors would decide to wean themselves off the centralized grid and power their homes using the energy they 've " harvested " themselves from the sun .
" You could look at it as a type of urban farming , " Kennedy suggested , adding that one of the reasons people are n't doing it now is not the lack of technology but old habits and inherited centralized building systems in architecture .
" Instead of tucking way electricity and lights in walls and accessing that with a plug , we have the possibility of thinking of a whole new experience for energy , energy - harvesting and for light . "
She talks about material that you could reel in from the roof and wrap around to make a new type of instant room , a Zip Room .
Plastic wall plugs would cease to exist ; instead you 'd harness your appliance into the surface or edge of the textile .
Her ideas may seem radical to homeowners who do n't give much thought to where their power comes from or how much it costs , which is why Kennedy is so keen to see the solar curtains in consumer - friendly packs on hardware store shelves .
" Energy - harvesting solar textiles are a very good beginning point .
I think that the notion of tying in a new technology with something very familiar really has its advantages if one 's about large - scale uptake and widespread adoption of a new energy regime . "
Regime may sound like a hard word to be used in the context of soft power , but as Kennedy says , it 's up to architects and designers to convince homeowners that there are more efficient alternatives to traditional homes .
Her firm is going one step further with the offer to work with developers and manufacturers who are interested in building digitally fabricated Soft House demonstration projects .
" My team is actively interested in speaking to people who are serious about realizing a pilot program that adapts the Soft House model to actual needs on urban or rural sites .
I do think the moment is now . "

Using a webcam , some cardboard , and a bag of Skittles , [ Kyle McDonald ] created this tangible interface for a beat sequencer .
The Skittles are dropped onto the rows which correspond to a drum channel and each Skittle represents an 1/8th note .
For such cheap components , the system seems to recognize the sequences pretty quick .
This is probably due to some clever programming with the processing back - end .
He claims his inspiration was the BallBearing sequencer , which uses the ball bearings as contact switches to determine the sequence rather than having a webcam analyze the surface .
It would be really nice to see this project expanded into a full blown instrument .
the webcam could allow for dynamic surfaces and he could certainly add more control to the system with some knobs and / or sliders .
He claims these features , and the source , will soon arrive .
WINNIPEG–Winnipeg has joined a growing list of Canadian communities where a confrontation involving a police Taser has ended in death .
Yesterday , a young adult male died in hospital after city police used a Taser to subdue him .
They had received a call for help from a residence at about 3:50 p.m .
" Upon attending , officers encountered a male at the rear of a residence , " said Const .
Jacqueline Chaput .
" This resulted in an officer deploying his electronic control device .
The male who was struck ... was conveyed to hospital in critical condition and he succumbed to his injuries in hospital . "
Officers appeared to be focusing their investigation on the lane behind a home owned by Peter Doyle , who wondered after the incident if the man had tried to steal his van .
" That 's the only thing I could think of as to why they'd be behind my garage , " said Doyle .
" ( The van ) does n't even work . "
A source told The Canadian Press police were on foot chasing a man , and he brandished a knife when officers tried to arrest him .
Chaput acknowledged the initial confrontation was serious enough that more than five cruisers were dispatched .
She did n't know how many times or where on his body the man was Tasered .
She said police summoned paramedics , putting a " rush " on the ambulance call .
Larry Crisostomo , 31 , who lives near the area , said he saw about eight officers and a couple of paramedics working on a man who was on the ground .
" They were all huddled around ... trying to revive him , and they had to give him the paddles ... , " he said .
Chaput said it 's the first time in Winnipeg a person has died after being Tasered , adding it 's too early to suggest the shock killed the man .
She said Winnipeg police follow strict guidelines on using Tasers .
" It was our executive members ' decision to continue with the use of electronic control devices despite some of the controversy that we 've seen all over the country , " she said .
Amnesty International Canada renewed a call for a temporary Taser moratorium last month after a man in Norfolk , Ont. , died in custody after being shocked by police .
Other deaths have drawn attention since a Polish immigrant died shortly after being Tasered by RCMP officers at Vancouver 's airport last October .
A public inquiry is to be held into that death this fall .
When Things Are Easy
It is easy to be happy and jubilant when things go well at your gambling session .
Winning always makes people want to come back to play more .
It seems that the more success we see , the more apt we are to consider gambling as one of the greatest activities of all time .
That being said , it can be rather difficult for people to see the joy of the online casino games when they lose .
Losing does not have to be bad .
It does have to mean the end of your gambling career .
Especially considering they are building a new casino in Toronto right now .
And we all know , it does serve as an opportunity to learn from your mistakes .
Those who take the time to learn what they need to from losses will certainly have a bit better of a time at it the next time they decide to give the games a shot .
Too often people develop a negative attitude toward gambling when they seem to be losing every time they play online casinos here .
It could be that this negative attitude is what is actually causing the losses to begin with .
When we are happy and really enjoying what we are doing , we will usually come out on top ; no matter what the activity is .
It is true that you cannot ' wish ' your way to winnings , but how we feel about the process is always determined by our attitudes going in .
If you ever feel as if you should not gamble because your mind is not in the right place , then it is important to just skip gambling for the day and come back when you feel better equipped to deal with whatever cards you will be dealt .
Understanding how your emotions play into successes and losses will go a long way toward being happy about any gambling experience you have ; win or lose .
Everything is mobile now , but is it of any use ?
It may seem like it was a million years ago but it really has not been that long since people needed to travel in order to play their favorite casino games .
Of course , people could always play poker , craps , or other types of card or dice games in their kitchens or in their basements ; but if people really wanted the real action or if they wanted to play slot games , they needed to go to a brick and mortar casino and sometimes that meant plane tickets , hotel rooms and all that goes with it .
Times have changed drastically over the course of the past 10 to 20 years and there are more changes that will dramatically change how we play these games in the future .
With the onset of mobile devices such as smart phones and tablets comes a whole new world of opportunities .
Sure , people have been able to play their favorite games on their computers for quite some time now but the mobile industry is really going to allow people to play from where ever they are in the world .
To many players this is very welcome news but to those who are not fond of the online casino industry it is news that they find very disturbing .
Believe it or not , there are many people who absolutely do not want to see a casino in every home and they are more than likely going to fight the mobile industry as much as they can because they 'd definitely will not want to see a casino in every once pocket or purse .
According to the latest online casino news there is and will continue to be a lot of opposition , there are many more people who crave the type of convenience that the mobile gaming industry can offer .
This type of convenience is like none other and those who spend a lot of time playing at a casino online on their phone will more than likely appreciate the fact that they can play with an actual chance at winning a great deal of money .
Of course , those who understand the idea of responsible gambling can help those who are brand new to the industry in learning how to protect themselves and how to gamble responsibly .
There really is a lot to learn and as you go a long you will find that there is a lot that the mobile gaming industry has to offer as well .
Most of the incidents investigated in Britain have been easily explained as misidentifications of stars and planets , aircraft lights , satellites and meteors , but some cases have raised national security or air safety issues .

On Dec. 26 , 1980 , for instance , several witnesses at two American Air Force bases in England reported seeing a U.F.O. land .
An examination of the site turned up indentations in the ground and a level of radiation in the area that was significantly higher than ordinary .
More witnesses at the same base reported the U.F.O. again on subsequent nights .
The deputy base commander reported that the aircraft aimed light beams into the most highly sensitive area of the base  a clear security breach .
On March 30 and 31 , 1993 , there was a wave of U.F.O. sightings over Britain .
One witness described a triangular - shaped craft that flew slowly over an air force base before accelerating away to the horizon in an instant , many times faster than a jet .
The British military reported , “ There would seem to be some evidence on this occasion that an unidentified object ( or objects ) of unknown origin was operating over the U.K . ”
On April 23 , 2007 , a commercial airline pilot and some of his passengers reported a huge cigar - shaped U.F.O.  the pilot estimated it to be a mile wide  near the Channel Islands .
At the time , air traffic controllers reported to the pilot that radar picked up something , but that it was “ unknown traffic . ”
In addition , there have been several incidents of near misses between U.F.O.s and known aircraft  enough to prompt the Ministry of Defense and the British Civil Aviation Authority to advise pilots , if they encounter anything , “ not to maneuver , other than to place the object astern , if possible . ”
World ’s First Commercial - Scale Tidal Power Turbine Begins Feeding Electricity to the Grid
July 17th , 2008 by Timothy B. Hurst
SeaGen more than four times the size of next largest tidal turbine
[ social_buttons ]
The world ’s first commercial - scale tidal turbine , developed by British tidal energy company , Marine Current Turbines , has delivered electricity onto the grid for the first time .
In principle , SeaGen works much like an “ underwater windmill ” with the rotors driven by the power of the tidal currents rather than the wind .
Conservative estimates suggest there is at least five gigawatts of power in tidal flows in Britain , but there could be as much as 15 GW .
The tidal current turbine , known as SeaGen , has briefly generated 150 kW of power onto the grid as part of its commissioning work , ahead of it achieving full capacity a few weeks from now .
SeaGen ’s power is being intentionally constrained to 300 kW during the commissioning phase , but once fully operational , it will generate 1.2MW of clean , renewable energy to the equivalent of 1000 homes .
The chosen site for the installation , Strangford Lough in Northern Ireland has a very powerful ( and very regular ) tidal pull and is recognized as one of the main tidal “ hotspots ” in UK and Irish waters .
Understandingly elated , Martin Wright , Managing Director of Marine Current Turbines said :
“ This is an important milestone for the company and indeed the development of the marine renewable energy sector as a whole .
The marine environment poses a number of unique technical challenges … so we are delighted that Marine Current Turbines has delivered yet another world - first in this sector .
It ’s a major technical break - through . ”
Environmental groups have voiced support for the project .
Robin Oakley , head of Greenpeace UK ’s climate and energy campaign said , “ Britain should be at the forefront of marine renewable energy development .
Our windswept island has huge renewable resources and we should seize the opportunities to secure energy from around our coasts . ”
Officials expect that the present testing and commissioning phase will be completed by the end of the summer when an official “ switch on ” will take place .
Marine Current Turbines ’ next undertaking , a 10.5 MW project off the coast of Anglesey , north Wales , is believed to be commissioned around 2011 / 2012 .

Grant Wilkinson converted replica guns into live weapons in a shed A man has been found guilty of turning replica guns into live weapons linked to more than 50 shootings , including the murder of Pc Sharon Beshenivsky .
Grant Wilkinson , 34 , was convicted at Reading Crown Court of seven offences of converting and supplying firearms linked to at least eight murders .
Wilkinson , of no fixed abode , adapted replica Mac - 10 guns in a shed in Three Mile Cross , near Reading , Berkshire .
Since the trial police have linked an east London killing to the factory .
Gary Lewis , 38 , of Bourne End , Bucks , was cleared of all charges .
Jurors found Wilkinson guilty of seven offences , which included conspiracy to convert imitation firearms , conspiracy to sell or transfer firearms , conspiracy to sell or transfer ammunition , two counts of possession of firearms with intent to endanger life , and two counts of possession of ammunition with intent to endanger life .
Eight murders linked to factory
Two charges against him of possessing a prohibited weapon were dropped .
Mr Lewis was cleared of all nine charges .
During the trial , jurors heard more than 50 shootings in London , Birmingham and Manchester were linked to the guns he converted and sold .
Eight of these were murders , mostly in London .
One of the guns was used during an armed robbery in Bradford , which led to the death of 38 - year - old Pc Sharon Beshenivsky in 2005 , although it was not the murder weapon .
The guns were also used in the murder of 15 - year - old Michael Dosunmu as he slept at home in Peckham , south - east London , in February 2007 , and the murder of music producer Richard Holmes in Chingford in November 2005 .
Police said a ninth killing in Limehouse , east London , at the end of July was also being linked to the converted guns , but this was not presented by the prosecution in court .
Det Supt Gary Richardson said : " These guns have been linked to 52 shootings , including nine murders , eight of which occurred in London . "
Using the name Grant Wilson , Wilkinson bought 90 blank - firing replica guns in July 2004 , which he told the registered dealer in Northolt , Middlesex , were props for a James Bond film .

Advertisement Guy Savage , of Sabre Defence Industries , said this seemed plausible as he had previously supplied Bond films .
Wilkinson then converted the guns in two outbuildings in the grounds of The Briars in Basingstoke Road , Three Mile Cross - a derelict property that Wilkinson took over and rented out to tenants .
Police said Wilkinson's " gun factory " was run on a " commercial scale " seldom seen in Britain .
The live weapons were later sold to criminals , prompting a noticeable rise in shootings over the coming years , the trial heard .
As many as 40 Mac - 10 submachine guns are still unaccounted for Evidence of the guns was found at The Briars and also in a field in Juniper Lane , Buckinghamshire .
The trial heard 39 other converted guns were recovered from London , Birmingham , Southampton and the West Country .
As many as 40 of the Mac - 10s are still unaccounted for and are believed to be on Britain 's streets .
Police have offered a £ 10,000 reward for their recovery .
Michael Dosunmu 's mother , Shakira Dosunmu , said she was begging for anyone with information about the whereabouts of the guns to contact police .
" You do n't know who is going to be the next victim , " she said .
Wilkinson denied all nine charges against him , claiming in his defence that he was working for a man called Kevin Danaher , who was murdered in May 2006 .
Speaking after the case , Det Ch Supt George Turner , of Thames Valley Police , said : " Although there is no Mac - 10 problem in the Thames Valley , the gun factory at The Briars appears to have been responsible for 90 % of Mac - 10 incidents and shootings since 2004 .

What are these ?
BOSTON – The sights , smells and happy chaos were familiar , as if borrowed from another era and another arena : Stale cigar smoke filled the air .
Champagne soaked the locker - room carpets .
Green and white confetti was everywhere .
Red Auerbach was not present for the moment in which the Boston Celtics restored their lost glory , but the party they threw Tuesday night at TD Banknorth Garden was unmistakably stamped with his outsize personality .
The Celtics did not just beat the Los Angeles Lakers , they crushed them – and left no doubt that the Larry O'Brien trophy belonged back in Boston after a 22 - year hiatus .
Accompanied by chants of " Seventeen ! " the Celtics routed their longtime rivals 131 - 92 to close out the finals in six games .
Sixteen green - and - white banners will soon have company in the rafters .
What ’s really causing rising oil prices ?
Published Jun 26 , 2008 7:43 AM
As the skyrocketing cost of energy continues to rapidly erode the standard of living of billions of workers around the globe , a handful of transnational oil companies are being given hundreds of billions of dollars in no -bid oil contracts in Iraq .
Exxon Mobil , Royal Dutch Shell , Total , BP and Chevron are reportedly in the last stages of finalizing a deal to take over production in Iraq ’s oil fields .
The deal is expected to be officially announced on June 30 .
The awarding of the no-bid contracts comes at a time when President George W. Bush is lobbying Congress to grant some of these same oil corporations the exclusive rights to oil exploration off the Atlantic and Pacific coasts of the United States .
The no-bid contracts in Iraq , and the attempt to hand to the oil giants exclusive drilling rights on the U.S. coasts , highlight the increasing monopolization of the world ’s most coveted resource .
Recently , there has been no shortage of explanations for the meteoric and record - breaking ascent of the price of oil .
But lost amidst all the talk of growing demand in China and speculation in the futures market is the fundamental contradiction of a natural resource that is essential to the daily lives of billions of people being owned and distributed by a small handful of private corporations .
Increasing monopolization of the oil industry has enabled oil giants like Exxon Mobil and Royal Dutch Shell to become price setters .
The average cost per barrel of producing oil for a company like Exxon Mobil or Shell has remained around $ 30 , if not lower , since 2003 .
In the same time frame , the price of oil has gone from $ 30 a barrel in 2003 to over $ 140 a barrel today .
That is the very definition of windfall profits .
The claim by the oil corporations that the price increase reflects the increased cost of oil exploration and drilling is an outright lie .
Exxon Mobil spends more money per year on buybacks of its own shares than on oilfield exploration and investment .
Exxon Mobil raked in $ 40.6 billion in profit last year .
That figure ranks as the biggest profit margin in the history of capitalism .
Royal Dutch
Shell raked in more than $ 30 billion .
In the same year , ballooning energy and food costs pushed billions of workers deeper into poverty , while 800 million people went hungry .
Accumulation of great wealth at the top of the socio- economic ladder has directly caused misery and starvation at the bottom .
In bouts of demagogy , U.S. ruling class politicians often blame foreign governments in OPEC for oil prices .
But transnational oil corporations like Exxon Mobil produce more oil per year than almost all of the OPEC state enterprises , the only exceptions being Saudi Arabia and Iran .
And the state oil company in Saudi Arabia , Saudi Aramco , which owns the rights to the world ’s largest proven reserves , has a board of directors that includes James Kinnear , former Texaco president and CEO ; Mark Moody - Stuart , former chair of Royal Dutch Shell Group ; and Peter Woicke , former vice president of the International Finance Corporation , a World Bank subsidiary .
Also , Western - based transnational oil corporations own and operate the vast majority of refineries needed to turn crude oil into fuel .
This only heightens their monopolistic grip on production .
The fact is that the majority of the world ’s oil is extracted , refined and sold by a small number of Western - based transnational oil corporations .
These corporations are using their price - setting capabilities to gouge workers all over the globe .
They want us busy pointing our fingers at Middle Eastern governments and unnamed speculators while they steal money from our pockets .
But while Exxon Mobil and Royal Dutch Shell may have raked in record - setting profits last year , their days of plenty are numbered .
Across the globe , workers are joining together to fight back against the monopoly capitalists and their relentless price gouging .
From striking truck drivers in the E.U. who have brought commerce to a halt , to street protesters in Southeast Asia who have shut down a number of cities , more and more workers are rising up in militant protest against sky - high fuel costs .
Increasing and intensifying these types of actions is the only hope of breaking the monopolists ’ grip on oil .
The shareholders of Exxon Mobil and Royal Dutch Shell should have no right to own this natural resource that millions of people need to heat their homes or drive to work .
Private ownership of oil is as ridiculous as private ownership of the ocean .
With a multinational iPhone 3G launch now successfully under its belt , electronics maker Apple Inc. is preparing to close out the year with a final phase of product introductions that will stretch over the course of the next two months .
Included on the company 's roadmap are new iPods , overhauled notebooks , and refreshed iMacs , according to people familiar with the situation .
They say availability of those products should follow that particular progression , with a handful of ancillary announcements staggered in between .
It will all kick off in September when the Cupertino - based firm attempts to dazzle the media through the showmanship of chief executive Steve Jobs , who will headline an event believed to be tentatively scheduled for the second week of the month .
Cheaper and slightly modified iPod touch players , new iPod nanos and related service announcements are expected to take center stage , as Apple emphasizes a particular focus on pushing adoption of its fledgling multi- touch platform and App Store .
However , and despite on - and - off - again background noise , the event will not give birth to a new breed of handheld multi- touch device , those familiar with Apple 's plans say .
At the same time , the scope of the event remains somewhat of an enigma .
Internet reports have failed to pinpoint a precise agenda , as it's unclear whether the the event will dual as a launch pad for Apple 's next - generation Mac notebooks , or whether those systems will be presented at a separate forum .
While those sources close to AppleInsider have not addressed the matter specifically , they were explicit in stating that availability of new MacBook and MacBook Pro systems would succeed the introduction of iPods at a different point in time — suggesting the Macs will come later in the month , if not the next ( October ) .
Of course , Apple could certainly choose to pre-announce the systems alongside iPods , but it would represent the first time the two distinct product lines share the same stage in nearly four years .
Expectations for the new notebooks have been outlined in a series of reports ( 1 , 2 , 3 ) over the year .
Both will see their first industrial design overhaul since adopting Intel processors over two years ago .
Most notable will be the 13 - inch MacBook 's metamorphosis from a plastic - wrapped portable to one clad in aluminum and stainless steel .
Like the upcoming redesign of the MacBook Pro , the MacBook will be highlighted by aesthetic revisions reminiscent of those used on the new MacBook Air and the latest aluminum iMacs , such as instances of matte black on portions of the casings and tapering around the edges to produce a slimming effect .
Internally , both are also rumored to sport a mysterious chipset that is something other than Intel Corp .'s Montevina .
( Note : this should not be confused with the CPU , or primary Intel processor . )
The new MacBook Pro ( pictured above ) will also sport a new form battery cover that spans the width of the system , also providing access to the notebook 's hard disk drive when released via a latch on the bottom of the casing .
Together , the redesigns of the MacBook and MacBook Pro are radical enough that they 'll warrant a special introduction .
Separately , Apple is also planning to refresh its line of 20 - and 24 - inch iMac seasons ahead of the holidays .
People familiar with these plans have described the refresh to consist of ' speed bumps ' rather than major internal or external changes .
Based on the roadmap presented to AppleInsider , these systems would debut later this fall following the release of the new MacBooks , making their way to market with little fanfare .
Apple 's Mac Pro , which has failed to make cut in consecutive holiday quarters , as well as the long - lost Mac mini , were not mentioned amongst the company 's plans for the remainder of 2008 .
However , that does n't necessarily preclude them from making an appearance ; AppleInsider can only report on what it has heard .
The Mac mini , in particular , remains an intriguing story .
After entering a state of indefinite limbo two and a half years ago , it was reported that the miniature Mac had all but been thrown to the wolves .
It was only amid increasing economic uncertainty earlier this year that signs of life were spotted in an area of Apple 's labs reserved for the company 's most cost - affordable system .

LXer Feature : 24 - Jul - 2008
The GNU / Linux operating system is blessed to have sound partition management tools like GParted which are very easy to use .
However , when it comes to the management of ' virtual partitions ' known as volumes , things are quite different .
There is Logical Volume Management , or LVM for short , however it can only really be used from the command line .
Also , it does n't integrate software RAID - except for striping .
I was quite optimistic when I started using volume management some four years ago , but not anymore .
Let me explain why I 'm disappointed .
The Problem
It all started when I installed Gentoo for the first time .
Or actually , my friend did it for me - since it was more difficult than installing OpenBSD , as the latter can be done in two minutes .
After Slackware , it was the second Linux distribution to touch the platters of my harddrive .
I was quite used to the rather rigid partition schemes of OpenBSD , in which /usr , / var , / tmp , / opt and / home all have their own partitions .
Not being experienced at all , I remember I thought " 1GB must be enough for /usr " only to find out it was n't if I installed a lot of applications .
Normally , such a thing would require re-installation of the OS if it was too difficult to re-partition the disk without losing data .
That 's when my friend said to me : " You know , in Linux there 's some way to prevent this kind of problem , by using a system in which you can dynamically resize partitions without even having to reboot your computer ! " .
The Solution
That 's when I learned about LVM , and I immediately wanted to try it .
I was encouraged when I found a guide how to install Gentoo on an LVM - system .
I found out the most important thing to make LVM work was the device mapper .
The device mapper makes virtual block devices ; which basically means virtual partitions .
On this virtual partitions , one can put a filesystem and mount that filesystem to use it .
Or - and that 's what makes Linux volume management so flexible - one can put another virtual partition on a virtual partition , in other words layer the virtual devices .
Using LVM was n't really hard : I just typed over the commands given in the HOWTO while changing some parameters to my liking , and in a short amount of time , Gentoo booted using my new LVM environment .
However , because I was using LVM1 back then , my system would n't boot at first .
Running lvchange -a y when the boot halted halfway cured this .
Not much later , my friend and I were once again in a contemplating mood , and my friend told " Did you know you can encrypt your harddisk in such a way that even most secret services ( almost ) can't decrypt them ? " .
I was eager to find out , and in no time I stacked up an encrypted virtual block device on top of the LVM virtual block devices .
OK , I had to type 32 characters everytime / home was mounted , but it gave a great feeling of privacy .
But I did came across a problem :
The Gentoo - init scripts assumed you would encrypt a physical partition and put virtual partitions on top of that encryped partitions .
I did it the other way around : I put my encrypted partition on top of virtual partitions , so I had to write a bash - script to mount my encrypted partition .
It was in the time of Fedora 2 probably ( though I had n't heard of Fedora back then ) , and I remember even the ' cryptsetup ' CLI - frontend was n't available back then .
I had to use the dmsetup command , which took lot and lots of parameters .
Yeah , I remember being glad when Christopher wrote cryptsetup .
I tried to hack the Gentoo - init scripts but failed .
Only one year later or so the Gentoo - init scripts were changed exactly in the way I tried : Making it possible to stack encrypted virtual block devices on LVM virtual block devices or the other way around both worked .
However , having Gentoo without experimenting does n't make much sense , so when buying a new computer I decided to take my volume management to the next level .
Finally , a GUI !
About the same time I learned about volume management , I learned about software - RAID too .
However , mastering the Linux ' mdadm commando looked quite difficult .
I was rather scared of the mdadm tool .
That does n't make sense at all for somebody who used the dmsetup commando to setup encrypted partitions , but choices are not always rational .
However , I found out about Enterprise Volume Management System , a graphical frontend which handles LVM2 , software RAID and even much more .
" That 's what I 've been looking for ! " I thought .
About reading some more , I even thought " Phew , this EVMS thing is going to save me a lot of time ! " .
Indeed it did , when setting up my new volume management scheme .
However , I could n't have foreseen the way it would screw up that very same scheme two years later .
The Scheme The scheme was quite complex for a home - PC ; but I 'll try to explain .
I had two 80 Gb / ~ 73GB hard drives .
Both Lilo and GRUB are not capable of booting from EVMS .
Therefore , one needs a non-EVMS partition to boot from , or an initrd , but I detest the latter .
However I wanted to use software - RAID on my two drives , which works best if the two partitions used are equal of size .
Therefore , I reserved the first 2GB of both drives for my small root - partition and I used the other 71 GB for my software RAID - drive .
That very same decision would cost me a lot of trouble later , but at that moment it seemed a good idea to do it that way .
EVMS put the two 71 GB partitions used for RAID in one software - RAID device named md0 .
One can directly make a filesystem on such an md-device , but instead I added all space on md0 to my LVM - container named c0 .
That LVM container can be seen as an aquarium with water : I can take out glasses of water of any size out of it , and put water from my glasses back in to the aquarium and after that into other glasses of water as much as I want .
Off course , there 's a maximum of water I can use :
The amount in the aquarium .
The glasses were my LVM virtual block devices , which contained the /usr , / opt and so on partitions mentioned earlier .
On top of those LVM virtual block devices I could have put another mapped virtual device , for example an encryption layer , but I was rather tired of typing 32 character passphrases every morning when I boot my computer .
I had to boot my computer because software - suspend did n't support crypto layers back then , and I would n't be surprised if it still does n't .
My new scheme worked really well .
In fact , it worked so good , when I built my second computer I decided to use two 80 GB drives also and used exactly the same EVMS scheme .
I even used the same names for the LVM containers and virtual block devices .
Not smart , as would be proven later .
Like always : Windows is the forerunner of trouble So , Everything worked like I envisioned , until I needed Windows .
Like usual , Windows also meant problems this time .
I needed AutoCAD which would n't run on Wine because the freakin ' thing needs SP2 .
Therefore , I tried to install Windows on my 2GB .
That was quite hard , but eventually I managed to do it by using space - saving tricks .
Being really economic , like a genuine Dutchman is ought to , I only used 300 MB of my other 2GB partition for Linux ' root partition .
That meant I had 1.7GB left , which was exactly enough to install AutoCAD .
All worked quite well , but then I wanted to install AutoDesk Inventor .
A real nightmare , ( also ) when it comes to hard disk requirements .
I figured out I needed 3.5 + GB to install it , so of course my almost filled two 2GB partitions were not enough .
" I need to add some of my EVMS - space to my Windows FAT partitions " I decided , but how would I do that ?
First I thought " EVMS is meant for easy volume management , so this can't be hard at all ; probably it is even very simple ' .
Boy was I wrong !
In theory , it goes like this : - First , you shrink your filesystems to add unused space to the LVM - container c0 .
- Then , since not all space of c0 is used , you can shrink c0 and at the ' end ' of c0 some GB of md0 are unused .
However , Windows can't use space on a Linux software - RAID disk .
- So therefore , that space should be freed from md0 also .
After that , some space on my physical partitions hda2 and hdb2 is n't used for md0 anymore .
- So I should be able to shrink hda2 and hdb2 .
With the space left , I should be able to .
- Use gparted to partition that space into new FAT - partions , possibly some E : , G : , K : or ' what else have you ' ?
drive in Windows .
Simple , huh ?
Well , until shrinking the LVM container all worked well .
But after I successfully shrunk my LVM container , I could n't figure out how to shrink the md0 software - RAID partition .
Turned out it was n't possible in EVMS .
And worse , IBM - the maintainer of EVMS - stopped to maintain it .
Now , here 's what would have made a lot of sense :
Buy a big external harddisk , take my two boxes with the two EVMS schemes , and backup everything to the external drive .
After that , build a better volume management scheme , preferably without the unmaintained EVMS .
Yes , that would have made a lot of sense ; it would also enable me to make sure both EVMS arrays would have exactly the same content .
But did I mention I 'm Dutch ?
Why would you buy something if by fiddling some extra hours you could save the bucks ?
Most of my files were duplicated on both disks anyway .
Screwing it up Instead of buying an external disk , I decided to take the two EVMS arrays , take the files of the smallest EVMS array which were not on the second and backup those to the second .
Then , all my files would be on the second array , and I could start over with my first EVMS array .
After that , I could move my data to the by then ' reschemed ' first array , and ' rescheme ' my second array .
Nonetheless , this required me two connect all four hard drives to my computer at the same time .
That was no problem ; my mobo supported that , and I booted from a Gentoo Minimal CD .
I thought the fun could start , when I noticed a problem : Both LVM containers were named c1 , so I only could use one of those at the same time .
Stupid .
Really stupid .
So I tried to rename one of them to c1 .
And failed .
EVMS would n't run my arrays anymore .
Instead of EVMS I tried using LVM2 directly now , but that did n't work and made things worse ; and as you can see when following the link help did n't turn up .
I finally decided to use mdadm to restart my software - RAID arrays but because it was the first time had I used mdadm ; I screwed up even more dramatically by using the force switch and - assume - clean and after that mounting my software - RAID device .
It only used one of the two RAID - partitions , so all my files were halved .
Mounting the failed RAID - device caused some important EVMS meta - data to screw up in such a way that finally I considered my 80 GB of files on that array as lost .
Sadly , it was the array that was the most filled with files .
On the bright side of things , this enabled me to wipe it all out and start again .
This time using LVM2 and mdadm from the start on .
Again , as in the ' old days ' , from the command line ...
Alternatives and Conclusion
Not much later , I saw somebody on LXer asking for a GUI for LVM .
That would be a very logical thing to ask .
EVMS is just that and much more , however I can't recommend it to anyone while it 's not supported anymore ; and as you can't shrink software - RAID partitions .
Then there is system - config - lvm , but it 's something from RedHat which is not in the repository of Gentoo , meaning Gentoo does n't support it .
Update : I was wrong , it is in the Gentoo repository , but hardmasked because it needs testing .
There 's also the Aperi project , but it 's not finished yet .
SunsZFS would be a solution , but GNU / Linux 's license is not compatible with the ZFS license , so that 's not an option for Linux either .
Which means , at this moment , you have to use RedHat or the CLI if you want to use LVM .
Kinda sad , I 'd say .
For now we can only hope someone makes a simple GUI for LVM available on all distro's , or - like open source works - and do it ourselves of course !

In a follow - up to research showing that psilocybin , a substance contained in " sacred mushrooms , " produces substantial spiritual effects , a Johns Hopkins team reports that those beneficial effects appear to last more than a year .
Writing in the Journal of Psychopharmacology , the Johns Hopkins researchers note that most of the 36 volunteer subjects given psilocybin , under controlled conditions in a Hopkins study published in 2006 , continued to say 14 months later that the experience increased their sense of well - being or life satisfaction .
" Most of the volunteers looked back on their experience up to 14 months later and rated it as the most , or one of the five most , personally meaningful and spiritually significant of their lives , " says lead investigator Roland Griffiths , Ph.D. , a professor in the Johns Hopkins departments of Psychiatry and Behavioral Sciences and Neuroscience .
In a related paper , also published in the Journal of Psychopharmacology , researchers offer recommendations for conducting this type of research .
The guidelines caution against giving hallucinogens to people at risk for psychosis or certain other serious mental disorders .
Detailed guidance is also provided for preparing participants and providing psychological support during and after the hallucinogen experience .
These " best practices " contribute both to safety and to the standardization called for in human research .
" With appropriately screened and prepared individuals , under supportive conditions and with adequate supervision , hallucinogens can be given with a level of safety that compares favorably with many human research and medical procedures , " says that paper 's lead author , Mathew W. Johnson , Ph.D. , a psychopharmacologist and instructor in the Johns Hopkins Department of Psychiatry and Behavioral Sciences .
The two reports follow a 2006 study published in another journal , Psychopharmacology , in which 60 percent of a group of 36 healthy , well - educated volunteers with active spiritual lives reported having a " full mystical experience " after taking psilocybin .
Psilocybin , a plant alkaloid , exerts its influence on some of the same brain receptors that respond to the neurotransmitter serotonin .
Mushrooms containing psilocybin have been used in some cultures for hundreds of years or more for religious , divinatory and healing purposes .
Fourteen months later , Griffiths re-administered the questionnaires used in the first study -- along with a specially designed set of follow up questions -- to all 36 subjects .
Results showed that about the same proportion of the volunteers ranked their experience in the study as the single most , or one of the five most , personally meaningful or spiritually significant events of their lives and regarded it as having increased their sense of well - being or life satisfaction .
" This is a truly remarkable finding , " Griffiths says .
" Rarely in psychological research do we see such persistently positive reports from a single event in the laboratory .
This gives credence to the claims that the mystical - type experiences some people have during hallucinogen sessions may help patients suffering from cancer - related anxiety or depression and may serve as a potential treatment for drug dependence .
We 're eager to move ahead with that research . "
Griffiths also notes that , " while some of our subjects reported strong fear or anxiety for a portion of their day - long psilocybin sessions , none reported any lingering harmful effects , and we did n't observe any clinical evidence of harm . "
The research team cautions that if hallucinogens are used in less well supervised settings , the possible fear or anxiety responses could lead to harmful behaviors .

If there were any doubt that the rules of the international game have changed for good , the events of the past few days should have dispelled it .
On Monday , President Bush demanded that Russia 's leaders reject their parliament 's appeal to recognise the independence of South Ossetia and Abkhazia .
Within 24 hours , Bush had his response : President Medvedev announced Russia 's recognition of the two contested Georgian enclaves .
The Russian message was unmistakable : the outcome of the war triggered by Georgia 's attack on South Ossetia on August 7 is non-negotiable - and nothing the titans of the US empire do or say is going to reverse it .
After that , the British foreign secretary David Miliband 's posturing yesterday in Kiev about building a " coalition against Russian aggression " merely looked foolish .
That this month 's events in the Caucasus signal an international turning point is no longer in question .
The comparisons with August 1914 are of course ridiculous , and even the speculation about a new cold war overdone .
For all the manoeuvres in the Black Sea and nuclear - backed threats , the standoff between Russia and the US is not remotely comparable to the events that led up to the first world war .
Nor do the current tensions have anything like the ideological and global dimensions that shaped the 40 - year confrontation between the west and the Soviet Union .
But what is clear is that America 's unipolar moment has passed - and the new world order heralded by Bush 's father in the dying days of the Soviet Union in 1991 is no more .
The days when one power was able to bestride the globe like a colossus , enforcing its will in every continent , challenged only by popular movements for national independence and isolated " rogue states " , are now over .
For nearly two decades , while Russia sunk into " catastroika " and China built an economic powerhouse , the US has exercised unprecedented and unaccountable global power , arrogating to itself and its allies the right to invade and occupy other countries , untroubled by international law or institutions , sucking ever more states into the orbit of its voracious military alliance .
Now , pumped up with petrodollars , Russia has called a halt to this relentless expansion and demonstrated that the US writ does n't run in every backyard .
And although it has been a regional , not a global , challenge , this object lesson in the new limits of American power has already been absorbed from central Asia to Latin America .
In Georgia itself , both Medvedev 's recognition of Abkhazia and South Ossetia 's independence and Russia 's destruction of Georgian military capacity have been designed to leave no room for doubt that the issue of the enclaves ' reintegration has been closed .
There are certainly dangers for Russia 's own territorial integrity in legitimising breakaway states .
But the move will have little practical impact and is presumably partly intended to create bargaining chips for future negotiations .
Miliband 's attempt in Ukraine , meanwhile , to deny the obvious parallels with the US - orchestrated recognition of Kosovo 's independence earlier this year rang particularly hollow , as did his denunciation of invasions of sovereign states and double standards .
Both the west and Russia have abused the charge of " genocide " to try and give themselves legal cover , but Russia is surely on stronger ground over South Ossetia - where its own internationally recognised peacekeepers were directly attacked by the Georgian army - than Nato was in Kosovo in 1999 , where most ethnic cleansing took place after the US - led assault began .
There has been much talk among western politicians in recent days about Russia isolating itself from the international community .
But unless that simply means North America and Europe , nothing could be further from the truth .
While the US and British media have swung into full cold - war mode over the Georgia crisis , the rest of the world has seen it in a very different light .
As Kishore Mahbubani , Singapore 's former UN ambassador , observed in the Financial Times a few days ago , " most of the world is bemused by western moralising on Georgia " .
While the western view is that the world " should support the underdog , Georgia , against Russia ... most support Russia against the bullying west .
The gap between the western narrative and the rest of the world could not be clearer . "
Why that should be so is n't hard to understand .
It 's not only that the US and its camp followers have trampled on international law and the UN to bring death and destruction to the Middle East , Afghanistan and Pakistan .
In the early 1990s , the Pentagon warned that to ensure no global rival emerged , the US would need to " account for the interests of advanced industrial nations to discourage them from challenging our leadership " .
But when it came to Russia , all that was forgotten in a fog of imperial hubris that has left the US overstretched and unable to prevent the return of a multipolar world .
Of course , that new multipolarity can easily be overstated .
Russia is a regional power and there is no imminent prospect of a serious global challenger to the US , which will remain overwhelmingly the most powerful state in the world for years to come .
It can also exacerbate the risk of conflict .
But only the most solipsistic western mindset can fail to grasp the necessity of a counterbalance in international relations that can restrict the freedom of any one power to impose its will on other countries unilaterally .
One western response , championed by the Times this week , is to damn this growing challenge to US domination on the grounds that it is led by autocratic states in the shape of Russia and China .
In reality , western alarm clearly has very little to do with democracy .
When Russia collapsed into the US orbit under Boris Yeltsin , his bombardment of the Russian parliament and shamelessly rigged elections were treated with the greatest western understanding .
The real gripe is not with these states ' lack of accountability - Russian public opinion is in any case overwhelmingly supportive of its government 's actions in Georgia - but their strategic challenge and economic rivalry .
For the rest of us , a new assertiveness by Russia and other rising powers does n't just offer some restraint on the unbridled exercise of global imperial power , it should also increase the pressure for a revival of a rules - based system of international relations .
In the circumstances , that might come to seem quite appealing to whoever is elected US president .

Potential next President John McCain ’s sick obsession with slaughtering brown people in the Middle East betrayed itself again yesterday when he responded to a question about exporting cigarettes to Iran by saying , “ maybe that ’s a way of killing them . ”
McCain was asked by a reporter , “ We ’ve learned that exports to Iran increased by tenfold during the Bush administration , biggest export was cigarettes , ” to which McCain snapped back , “ maybe that ’s a way of killing them , ” before laughing and chuckling , “ I meant that as a joke . ”

This is not the first time that McCain has expressed his bloodlust for seeing Iranians massacred .
During an April 2007 town hall meeting in South Carolina , one of McCain ’s fawning Neo -Con slug acolytes stood up and asked why “ we do n’t send an airmail message to Tehran , ” to which McCain responded , “ Remember that old Beach Boys song ?
Bomb , bomb , bomb , bomb Iran . ”
The whole audience snickered at the thought of innocent Iranian women and children being blown to bits for the good of the American empire .
Does a historical pretext even exist against which to measure potential Presidents who find killing hundreds of thousands of people funny ?
Hitler , Pol Pot , and Osama Bin Laden liked to talk about slaughtering masses of people on a regular basis , but they stopped short of cracking jokes about it .
McCain was subject to a barrage of criticism after his last outburst but he ’s gone on to repeat such comments without a care in the world .
Either the body politic is so jaded by 7 years of imperial Neo -Con bloodletting that McCain thinks such comments are tame in comparison , or he knows he ’s a ringer and has no chance anyway of beating the elite ’s chosen one for 2008 – Barack Obama .
Or he could just be one sick bastard .
That makes for presidential material these days .

Truly , sometimes I think there is nothing new on the face of the earth .
Here ’s a quotation cited by Mark Twain around the turn of the 19th century .
Read it and see if you do n’t recognize it from today ’s political discourse :
" Even if the war be wrong we are in it and must fight it out : we can not retire from it without dishonor . "
That war was in the Philippines .
Perhaps you remember it from your history books .
We " liberated " the country from the clutch of Spanish colonialism , but then decided we would just replace the Spanish rather than grant the people independence .
They resisted , and we fought a second war in the islands against Filipino patriots .
Today , all of our politicians , with few exceptions , take the same position in regard to Iraq :
Well , it may have been the wrong thing to do , but we ’re there and we ca n’t leave without a victory .
I heard the same refrain about the Vietnam War .
Whatever happened to the saying " Inglorious peace is better than a dishonorable war " ?
The only thing that delaying our departure from Vietnam accomplished was more casualties on all sides .
The only thing that delaying our departure from Iraq will accomplish is more casualties on all sides .
Why would it be a stain on our honor to end the occupation of Iraq and hand the country back to the Iraqi people to govern as they please ?
It is , after all , their country , not ours ; the oil is their oil , not ours .
Not one candidate has the guts to say , " As soon as I ’m president , I will order American troops to begin withdrawal . "
What happens after we leave is an Iraqi problem , not ours .
Americans had better get shut of their imperial delusions and fast , because we are following the path of every empire that has ever existed toward bankruptcy .
Do you really want high gas prices , food rationing , health - care rationing and unbearable debt ?
What kind of standard of living do you think we can maintain with a collapsed education system , a broken infrastructure , a debilitated manufacturing sector and a debt - imploded failed economy ?
George W. Bush has proven himself to be the worst president in American history .
He ’s piled up more public debt than all his predecessors combined .
He ’s ruined America ’s reputation among the nations of the world .
He ’s wearing out an Army far too small to do what he demands of it .
His diplomacy is a joke .
His administration is riddled with dishonest and incompetent people .
I do n’t know what world his little mind inhabits , but it ’s not the one the rest of us live in .
Rupert Murdoch , the media mogul , had the nerve to say recently at a meeting of the Atlantic Council what our own politicians are too cowardly to say — namely that our so - called North Atlantic Treaty Organization allies are not pulling their own weight .
They , of course , never have .
One reason we are so in debt is that the brainless in our country have been paying for the defense of Europe and Japan ever since the end of World War II .
That allowed Europe and Japan to modernize their factories while ours deteriorated .
We are no longer the arsenal of democracy .
In fact , most of our strategic weapons require imports .
If we continue to overplant grains and irrigate normally dry land , we will soon be dependent on imports for food .
It ’s all well and good that foreign car companies build plants here to take advantage of our relatively cheap labor ( compared with their own countries ) , but one should not forget that the profits from those countries flow back across the seas .
For a republic to survive , it needs a well - educated people with self - discipline and high morals , healthy agricultural and manufacturing bases , sound money and a frugal but wise government .
I do n’t see much of that around these days .

The Best of Charley Reese
( CNN ) -- Sen. John McCain said Wednesday that Iran 's missile test shows the need for an effective missile defense system , while rival Sen.
Barack Obama said it shows aggressive diplomacy , combined with sanctions , is necessary .
Sens . John McCain and Barack Obama offered differing views on how best to deal with Iran 's latest missile test .
" Ballistic missile testing coupled with Iran 's continued refusal to cease its nuclear activities should unite the international community in efforts to counter Iran 's dangerous ambitions , " McCain , the presumptive Republican presidential candidate , said .
" Iran 's missile tests also demonstrate the need for effective missile defense now and in the future , and this includes missile defense in Europe as is planned with the Czech Republic and Poland , " McCain said .
Watch McCain discuss sanctions against Iran »
Obama , who has faced criticism for saying he would talk with enemies of the United States , released a statement Wednesday calling for direct diplomacy and tougher sanctions .
" Now is the time to work with our friends and allies , and to pursue direct and aggressive diplomacy with the Iranian regime backed by tougher unilateral and multilateral sanctions . "
" ...
These missile tests demonstrate once again that we need to change our policy to deal aggressively with the threat posed by the Iranian regime .
...
Iran now poses the greatest strategic challenge to the United States in the region in a generation . "
Obama also said he will continue to push for an incentive package that seeks to deter Iran from its nuclear goals .
" It 's time to offer the Iranians a clear choice between increased costs for continuing their troubling behavior , and concrete incentives that would come if they change course , " he said .
Do n't Miss Iran sends warning with missile test
Iran sends warning with missile test Election Center : Iran
The reaction comes hours after Iran test - fired several missiles in response to what it says are threats from Israel and the United States , according to state - run Iranian media and a U.S. military source .
The state news agency Islamic Republic News Agency and Press TV reported that the naval forces of Iran 's Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps test - fired a Shahab - 3 missile during war games in the Persian Gulf .
The exercises come a month after Israel conducted a military drill in the eastern Mediterranean involving dozens of warplanes and aerial tanks .
The latest Iranian activities prompted concern from Israel and condemnation from the United States .
Obama -- while calling Iran a threat -- also criticized the Bush administration for talking tough against Tehran while increasing exports to the country .
Obama 's comments referred to a report from The Associated Press Tuesday that America 's exports to Iran have increased more than tenfold since President Bush took office .
" It 's that kind of mixed signal that has led to the kind of situation that we 're in right now , " Obama said on ABC Wednesday .
McCain did not criticize the Bush administration 's policy toward Iran but said , " The most recent missile tests demonstrate again the dangers it poses to its neighbors and to the wider region , especially Israel . "
Policy toward Iran became a primary issue on the campaign trail .
Neither of the candidates voted on a September 2007 Senate resolution calling on the administration to declare Iran 's Revolutionary Guard Corps a terrorist organization -- a measure that some Democratic critics , including Obama , believed could lead to war .
Although he missed that Senate vote , the Illinois senator heavily criticized his then - chief rival for the presidential nomination , Sen. Hillary Clinton , for voting in favor of the terrorist designation , saying it exhibited the " flawed " judgment she used during the vote to authorize the Iraq war five years ago .
" We know in the past that the president has used some of the flimsiest excuses to try to move his agenda regardless of what Congress says , " Obama told CNN in October .
Clinton criticized Obama , as did some Republicans , for saying in a CNN debate last summer that he would be willing to meet with the leaders of Iran , Syria , Venezuela , Cuba , and North Korea " without precondition . "
" I would , " Obama said at the CNN / YouTube debate last July .
" And the reason is this :
That the notion that somehow not talking to countries is punishment to them -- which has been the guiding diplomatic principle of this administration -- is ridiculous . "
The Obama campaign has since added nuance to that position , particularly regarding meeting with Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad .
" I would not say that we would meet unconditionally , " Obama spokesman and former Sen .
Tom Daschle said in May .
" Of course , there are conditions that we would involve in preparation in getting ready for the diplomacy .
" ' Without precondition ' simply means we would n't put obstacles in the way of discussing the differences between us , " he said .
" That 's really what they 're saying , what Barack is saying . "
McCain and Obama are getting foreign policy and national security advice from star - studded groups of veteran Washington hands .
McCain was one of the first Republican presidential candidates to assemble a team of foreign policy heavyweights .
At a fundraiser in spring 2007 , the Arizona senator listed Reagan and Bush I - era officials and conservative thinkers he regularly turned to for input , including Brent Scowcroft , William Kristol , Robert Zoellick , and George Schultz -- with a special emphasis on former Nixon Secretary of State Henry Kissinger .
" When I have a question about something that 's going on in the world , I call Dr. Kissinger , and he is able to connect the dots for me , " said McCain at the time .
Richard Armitage has also been a member of that group .
Robert Kagan , a major proponent of the troop surge in Iraq , has been listed as a leading foreign policy adviser by the campaign .
Former CIA Director R. James Woolsey , State Department veteran Richard Williamson and former national security official Peter Rodman are also key advisers .
Obama 's foreign policy team has found itself under an uncomfortable spotlight at times , as the International Crisis Group 's Robert Malley and Samantha Power , both unpaid advisers , resigned under controversy .
The presumptive Democratic nominee 's senior foreign policy team , led by Center for American Progress fellow and former Daschle adviser Denis McDonough , is heavy with names connected with the Clinton era , including former National Security Adviser Anthony Lake , former Navy Secretary Richard Danzig , and Susan Rice -- a former assistant secretary of state .
Since the end of the primary campaign , some of Clinton 's top advisers have also reportedly made their way to Obama 's circle , including former State Department official Robert Einhorn and Carter foreign policy adviser Stuart Eizenstat .
CNN 's Ed Hornick and Rebecca Sinderbrand contributed to this report .

Updated Google 's Docs and Spreadsheets disappeared today for close to an hour , proving that the world 's largest search engine is a long way from perfecting the art of online business applications .
Many businesses paid good money to look at this screen , which appeared - at least to people in Silicon Valley - from about 9am to 10am :
When clouds die
As a Google Apps Premiere customer , the San Francisco - based open source outfit MuleSource pays Google for the use of Docs and Spreadsheets , and it describes the experience as a game of chance .
" As businesses look to move their systems and applications into cloud - based services , we expect them to work minimally as well as if we ran them ourselves , " Mule Source CEO Dave Rosenberg tells us .
" With Google Apps , we are at the point of taking bets to see if the services will actually be up . "
Google 's error message kept telling Rosenberg to " Try again in 30 seconds . "
Say what you will about Microsoft Office , it 's never that cruel .
We 've asked Google why its cloud died .
But it has yet to respond . ®
Update
Google has responded , and the company wants you to know it fully realizes that when people pay for something , they expect to have access to it .
" For a short period this morning , our users had difficulty accessing Google Docs .
Some Google
Apps users were also affected , " the company says .
" We have now resolved the problem .
We know how important Google Docs is to our users , so we take issues like this very seriously . "
You ’re going to hear a lot of crazy talk in the mainstream media over the next few days about how Bill Gates and his original ‘ Microsoft Family ’ set out in the 1970 ’s to “ change the world and put a computer on every desk , in every home ” .
You ca n’t really blame the traditional journalists who copy and paste from Bill ’s resumé those same lines over and over into every news report and top of the hour radio bulletin , for trimming the detailed facts of what Microsoft actually did to achieve their lofty goals , down into a single sound - bite like this .
They are , after all , doing their cutting and pasting , 85 % of them at least , on a machine running Gates ’ Windows operating system .
What you are entitled to feel a certain degree of righteous indignation towards , is the collective amnesia we ’ve allowed ourselves to slip into about how many ideas Microsoft blatantly stole from far superior systems to the ones their name eventually became associated with having invented .
There was no such thing as desktop publishing , for example , before the Apple Mac .
There was no MS - DOS before Gary Kildall ’s CP /M – which Gates effectively sold to IBM before he ’d managed to source a line for line reversed engineered copy of it from someone else .
All of this might be fair game in the name of entrepreneurial spirit , you might say – but in the name of fair and balanced reporting , it might be nice to at least hear a sentence or two about the reality of how Gates came to rule the world , riding on the back of his less well known and certainly less financially well rewarded contemporaries , who often outshine him and many of whom simply lacked the Harvard business school face that fits , when it came to VC funding and his impressive instinctive for marketing and spin .
No one can doubt that Gates ’ new role as full time philanthropist , dedicated to helping the people in our world who need the most help , is anything other than a truly incredible and wonderful thing to do .
I respect him and his wife immensely for it .
I just wish he could find it in his heart to mention , at least once , in the face to face time he has already granted to certain journalists and will be giving more to in the future , some of the names of the people who performed so many of the dangerous stunts which make his performance look so convincing – many of whom were not Microsoft employees , but simply interested in computer science ; the misfit beardy weirdys , at the Mountain View home - brew computer club , who for the love of code contributed so much we mere users ca n’t begin to fathom .
These are the people who dreamed that one day everyone would own a computer – not because they wanted one company to rule us all , but because they believed that free enterprise and competition drives innovation .
That this is dependent upon having a level playing field which competitors can play a fair game against each other on , without a 85 degree leaning slope towards the goal mouth of the team with the most ambitious manager .
No one disputes that the Windows gravy train has been a very good thing for a great many people – but it might be more honest of the fawning hacks who squawk their drive - time radio copy at us everyday , about the legacy of the man destined to take the credit for other people ’s work , to point out at least once , that this does n’t necessarily make it a good thing for the tracks , station and driver to be owned and operated by Microsoft as well .
WASHINGTON ( Reuters ) -
He came into office touted as America ’s first “ MBA president , ” steeped in deregulatory zeal and determined to run the economy like a business .

But 7 1/2 years later , a rescue plan that President George W. Bush ’s administration had to devise for U.S. mortgage giants Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac has served to underline an already troubled record of economic stewardship .
With oil prices at record highs , the housing market imploding and the threat of recession looming , the crisis over the two mortgage giants is the last thing Bush needed in the twilight of his presidency .
And if Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac ’s troubles get much worse , he could be faced with the dilemma of deciding whether to bail them out -- anathema to his Republican free - enterprise roots -- or let them fail , with serious consequences for world markets .
How this all plays out could not only affect Bush ’s legacy , already weighed down by the unpopular war in Iraq , but may also have implications for his party ’s bid to keep the White House in the November presidential election .
“ The economy goes in cycles and it ’s hard to blame a president for finding himself at the bottom of one , ” said Stephen Wayne , a Georgetown University political scientist .
“ But you can judge Bush as a manager .
He has n’t been a very able one . ”
This was not the way it was supposed to be when Bush took office in 2001 .
His supporters hailed him as the “ MBA president ” -- Bush holds a masters of business administration from Harvard University -- who would manage the executive branch like a corporate CEO .
Bush , in fact , spent his first six years presiding over an economy that would be the envy of most presidents .
But Democratic critics say tax cuts he engineered early on mostly helped the rich and his administration was slow to respond to a credit crunch that led to the mortgage meltdown underlying the current economic slump .
As his departure from office nears , he faces the very real risk of a recession .
Despite that , Bush kept up efforts on Tuesday to reassure Americans about his policies , insisting the economy was showing “ remarkable resilience ” and that a $ 152 billion stimulus package was starting to have a positive impact .
He also stuck to his assertion that the rise in gasoline prices to more than $ 4 a gallon , a growing cause of consumer distress and an increasingly hot campaign issue , is a supply - and - demand imbalance for which he has no “ magic wand . ”
FANNIE AND FREDDIE
If Bush did n’t already have enough economic woes to worry about , he is now confronted by problems with the twin pillars of the U.S. housing market , Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac , which own or guarantee nearly half of all U.S. mortgages .
They are shareholder - owned but government - sponsored enterprises , known as GSEs , entities long a source of distaste for Republican free marketeers .
Investor fears over Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac ’s funding prompted the Treasury Department and the Federal Reserve to step in on Sunday with offers of bigger credit lines , equity purchases and access to central bank coffers if needed .
But shares of Fannie and Freddie dragged markets lower on Monday and continued to sink on Tuesday amid worries the steps would not be enough to avert broader financial fallout .
“ The crisis is far from over , ” said Jaret Seiberg , a financial services analyst with the Stanford Group .
“ There is still a lot more risk that may necessitate more direct government intervention . ”
It has been a problem years in the making , spanning Democratic and Republican presidencies .
But the pressure is now on the Bush administration to start sorting it out or else see its legacy further tarnished .
Though Bush insisted on Tuesday the government should not bail out private enterprises , analysts say it must remain an option , if only a last resort , to keep mortgage giants from collapsing .
It would not be the first time that Bush , who has often insisted on letting the markets run their course , had opted for intervention to avert a wider crisis .
In March , Treasury helped engineer JPMorgan Chase & Co ’s purchase of investment bank Bear Stearns to prevent it from going bankrupt and sending a shock through the world financial system .
But a Fannie - Freddie bailout would be more far - reaching , explicitly making the government the guarantor of millions of homes , an ironic bookend to an administration that came to power promising to keep its nose out of the private sector .
Night before Obama flies abroad , Rice bars embassies from aiding candidates John Byrne

Print This Email This ' If they want to rent a bus , show them where they can rent a bus '
The night before presumptive Democratic nominee Sen. Barack Obama ( D - IL ) left for Afghanistan , Iraq and Western Europe for a tour of US bases overseas , Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice issued a cable to US missions forbidding them from holding events for presidential candidates or arrange meetings for them .
Rice issued no such cable prior to foreign excursions by presumptive Republican nominee Sen. John McCain ( R - AZ ) .
In a cable sent late Thursday , according to a copy leaked to the Washington Times , Rice enjoined American diplomats to treat the candidates as " members of Congress visiting in personal or semi-personal capacities , " but " with additional restrictions based on rules related to political activity . "
" Provide de minimis assistance to the candidate with logistical arrangements , " said the cable , according to the Times .
" If the campaign staff wants to rent a bus for press , tell them where they can rent a bus . "
Rice did n't issue the same demands in advance of travel by Sen. McCain .
McCain visited the Middle East four months ago -- but officials told the paper they did n't make similar demands because he was part of an " official congressional delegation . "
" American embassies and consulates around the world are actively engaged in official visits by members of Congress and other government leaders , the paper noted .
" Diplomats meet the visitors at the airport , accompany them to meetings , most of which they have arranged , and host public events for them . "
Rice made an effort in her cable to distance herself from claims that her decision might have been influenced by politics .
" It is imperative that , in implementing these various requirements , we treat both major presidential candidates evenhandedly , " she wrote .
" Our interactions with the candidates need to be made in the context that they are also sitting U.S. senators and very important U.S. visitors with special security concerns . "
But she forbid them from any attempts to " hold or arrange receptions or public events for the candidate , " " arrange the candidate 's meetings " or " use official funds and resources , beyond a de minimis level , to support a political trip . "
Obama began his first on - the - ground inspection of Iraq since launching his bid for the White House Monday , with U.S. commanders ready to brief him on progress in a war he long opposed and Iraqi leaders wanting more details of his proposals for troop withdrawals .
He arrived in Afghanistan on Saturday .
His stops in Baghdad  and other areas of the country  marked the second major leg of a war zone tour that opened in Afghanistan .
The contrasts in tone and message were distinct .
Obama sees the battle against the resurgent Taliban and al - Qaida in Afghanistan as America 's most crucial fight and supports expanding troop strength to counter a sharp rise in attacks .
But Obama had stood against the Iraq invasion and now worries that an open - ended U.S. combat mission will sap military resources and focus  at a time when Iraq violence has dropped to its lowest level in four years .
Meanwhile , Sen. McCain told NBC that the US was winning the war in Iraq .
" I 'm glad that Senator Obama is going to get a chance for the first time to sit down with General David Petraeus and understand what the surge was all about , why it succeeded and why we are winning the war , " McCain said .
McCain said the Democrat " used his opposition to the surge as a way of gaining the nomination of his party . "
" I hope he will have a chance to admit that he badly misjudged the situation and he was wrong when he said that the surge would n't work .
It has succeeded and we 're winning the war , " he said .
He declined to note that Sen. Obama had made a visit to Iraq before .

MANSFIELD , La. 
They had to repeat the amazing number , $ 28.7 million , over and over , to make sure it was real and would not go away .
Even then , the members of the De Soto Parish Police Jury  the county commission  could hardly believe it .
They laughed , rocked back in their chairs , shook their heads , stared at the ceiling and muttered oaths to each other .
“ We have  $ 28.7 million , ” said the president , Bryant Yopp , to settle the matter , definitively if still incredulously .
It was nearly one and a half times the parish ’s entire annual budget .
A no -holds - barred , all - American gold rush for natural gas is under way in this forgotten corner of the South , and De Soto Parish , with its fat check from a large energy company this month , is only the latest and largest beneficiary .
The county leaders and everyone around them , for mile after mile , over to Texas and up to Arkansas , in the down - at - the - heels city of Shreveport and in its struggling neighbors , suddenly find themselves sitting on what could prove to be the largest natural gas deposit in the continental United States .
Already , several dozen people who own parcels of land over the field are becoming instant millionaires as energy companies pay big money for the mineral rights to the gas , which like other energy sources is worth far more than it was last year .
Jalopies are being traded in for Cadillacs , plans for swimming pools are being hatched in rusty trailers , and the old courthouse here is packed to the rafters day after day with oil company “ landmen ” ( and women ) , whose job it is to frantically search the record books for the owners of the mineral rights to land that has become like gold .
A major flaw in the way the internet works could lead to millions of people being targeted by criminals and has prompted the " largest security update " in web history , according to a leading security researcher .
The bug - described as " cache poisoning " - has led to some of the technology industry 's largest companies scrambling to come up with a solution before hackers discover how to exploit the flaw .
Dan Kaminsky , an American internet security specialist who uncovered the bug , has been working with major technology companies including Microsoft and Cisco to issue software patches to prevent attacks from working .
" This is the largest synchronised security update in the history of the internet .
The severity of this bug is shown by the number of those who are on board with the patches , " Kaminsky said .
The flaw exploits the internet 's address mechanism , known as the Domain Name System ( DNS ) .
This maps the names we associate with websites to the true numerical addresses of their internet servers , in the same way that a mobile phone 's address book associates names with telephone numbers .
DNS allows people to visit websites simply by typing in words - such as theguardian.com or google.com - rather than entering a string of unmemorable numbers .
The glitch allows hackers to inject themselves into the process , intercepting the name entered by the user and mapping it to a different internet address than the one intended .
This would potentially allow criminals to redirect web users to phishing websites even if they had entered the correct address in the first place .
" If a bad guy had found this before Dan did , it would have been very bad , " said Rich Mogull , a researcher at Securosis .
Kaminsky has refused to provide specific details about the flaw , instead offering the internet industry time to address the issue before he explains more .
But even though major technology vendors have released security patches , the US Computer Emergency Readiness Team ( CERT ) - an American agency which deals with major security breaches - said even these would not remove the possibility of hijacking entirely .
" It is important to note that without changes to the DNS protocol , these mitigations cannot completely prevent cache poisoning , " said US - CERT on its website .
" However , if properly implemented , they reduce the chances of success for an attacker by several orders of magnitude and make attacks impractical . "
Kaminsky said he would reveal more detail about the vulnerability at a computer security conference next month .
Mr Burgess , who lures the cats to his traps with rotten cheese , said : " If it 's got into my trap and it's a domestic cat , it should not be there .
Any cat that gets into my trap will be dealt with .

Politico :
Telecom companies have presented congressional Democrats with a set of proposals on how to provide immunity to the businesses that participated in a controversial government electronic surveillance program , a House Democratic aide said Wednesday .
Congress has been wrestling for months with an update to the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance
Act with the immunity issue the primary sticking point .
Many Democrats want the companies held accountable for participating in the program , which was initiated in the wake of the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks .
The White House , however , has insisted that the participation of the telecoms is crucial to monitoring conversations between potential terrorists .
President Bush has vowed to veto any bill that does not contain immunity .

Voice of America
August 18 , 2008
A new report says the United States has spent about $ 100 billion on private contractors to support operations in Iraq since the 2003 invasion to oust Saddam Hussein .
VOA ’s Michael Bowman reports from Washington .
At the height of last year ’s military surge in Iraq , the United States had roughly 168,000 troops deployed in the country .
But America ’s armed forces have been outnumbered by what some see as a private army funded by the federal government : contractors that provide a wide array of services , from security operations to rebuilding projects to logistical support .
Peter Orszag heads the Congressional Budget Office , which issued a report on the costs of private contractors in Iraq .
“ The federal government has awarded $ 85 billion in contracts for work in [ the ] Iraq theater through 2007 .
If you included this year , the total would exceed $ 100 billion : roughly one of every $ 5 for the cost of the war in Iraq , ” he said .

Fears of deflation , prominent a month or two ago , are now rapidly subsiding , and soon may disappear entirely .
Nevertheless , deflation is still a subject about which it is important to have a correct understanding .
Deflation is usually thought to be a synonym for falling prices .
There could be no more serious error in all of economics .
Calling falling prices " deflation " results in a profound confusion between prosperity and depression .
This is because the leading cause of falling prices is economic progress , whose essential feature is an increasing production and supply of goods and services , which , of course , operates to make prices fall .
Yet the term deflation is also closely associated with the phenomena of a plunge in business profits and a suddenly and substantially greater difficulty of repaying debts , with the consequence of widespread insolvencies and bankruptcies .
The plunge in profits and sudden sharp increase in the burden of debt are , of course , leading symptoms of a depression .
Hence , the proximate cause of prosperity , namely , increasing production and supply , comes to be confused with depression and the widespread impoverishment that accompanies depressions .
This , of course , is closely related to the absurdities of the overproduction doctrine , which claims that we are poor because we are rich .
What needs to be realized is that there are two distinct causes of generally falling prices .
One is the increase in production and supply , which should never , never be confused with deflation , depression , or poverty .
The other is a decrease in the quantity of money and or volume of spending in the economic system .
Falling prices is the only effect that they have in common .
They differ profoundly with respect to their other effects .
The essential things that need to be understood are that falling prices caused by increased production do not serve to reduce the general or average rate of profit in the economic system and do not make debt repayment more difficult .
Indeed , to the extent that such falling prices take place in the face of an increasing quantity of money and rising volume of spending , and result merely from the fact that the increase in production and supply outstrips the increase in money and spending , they are accompanied by a positive elevation of the rate of profit and a greater ease of repaying debts .
Precisely this would be the case under a gold standard , inasmuch as the supply of gold modestly grows from year to year as the result of continued and expanded gold mining operations , and the volume of spending in terms of gold grows commensurately .
In such circumstances , the average seller in the economic system would be in the position of selling at lower prices and at the same time have a supply of goods to sell at those lower prices that was larger in greater degree than prices were lower .
For example , if falling prices result from the fact that while the quantity of money and volume of spending in the economic system are rising at a two percent annual rate , production and supply are rising at a three percent annual rate , the average seller in the economic system is in the position of having three percent more goods to sell at prices that are only one percent lower .
His sales revenues will be two percent higher , and that is what counts for his nominal profits and his ability to repay debts .
His profits will be higher and his ability to repay debt will be greater .
There are lower prices here , but absolutely no deflation .
What wipes out profits and makes debt repayment more difficult is not falling prices but monetary contraction , i.e. , the reduction in the quantity of money and or volume of spending in the economic system .
This is what serves to reduce sales revenues , and , in the face of costs determined on the basis of prior outlays of money , causes a corresponding reduction in profits .
It is also what makes debt payment more difficult , in that there is simply less money available to be earned and thus available to be used for the repayment of debts .
It is monetary contraction , and monetary contraction alone , which should be called deflation .
Moreover , in the face of any given monetary contraction , the reduction in profits and increase in the burden of debt would in no way be diminished if prices did not fall .
Indeed , these phenomena would not be alleviated even if prices rose .
Prices would not fall if production and supply fell to the same extent that money and spending fell .
They would actually rise if production and supply fell to a greater extent than the quantity of money and volume of spending .
But irrespective of what might happen to production , supply , and prices , the same monetary contraction would cause the same reduction in sales revenues and , in the face of the same prior outlays of money showing up as costs , the same reduction in profits .
And it would cause the same increase in the burden of repaying debt .
The point is that falling prices are simply not the cause of a plunge in profits and increase in the burden of debt .
At most they can be the accompaniment of these things , when all three result from monetary contraction .
But they need not even be an accompaniment .
For the phenomena of plunging profits and a rising burden of debt , as I 've just shown , can also be accompanied by rising prices — to the extent that a reduction in production and supply were to outstrip the reduction in money and spending .
What deserves special stress is the fact that even when falling prices are the result of monetary contraction , rather than increases in production and supply , and are accompanied by actual economic hardship rather than by general prosperity , their specific contribution to the situation is not only not that of cause , but of remedy .
Falling prices in response to monetary contraction are precisely what enable a reduced quantity of money and volume of spending to buy as many goods and to employ as many workers as did the previously larger quantity of money and volume of spending .
Preventing the fall in prices , including a fall in wage rates , serves only to prevent the restoration of production and employment .
Let me put it this way .
Deflation is not falling prices .
It is monetary contraction .
Falling prices are necessary as a response to deflation , which is prior , and which exists whether prices do or do not fall , and can exist even if prices rise .
Falling prices in response to deflation are economically beneficial , in that they enable a reduced quantity of money and volume of spending to buy as much as the previously larger quantity of money and volume of spending bought .
In other words , the effect of falling prices is always positive .
They should not be confused with deflation or depression and are certainly not their cause .
On the contrary , as we have seen , they are a remedy for the effects of deflation .
And this is true even for debtors .
It is not the level of prices that makes it difficult to repay a debt , but the amount of money one can earn in relation to the size of the debts one must pay .
If the average member of the economic system can no longer earn as much money as he used to , and thus finds it more difficult to repay any given amount of money debt , then the fact that prices fall does not make him earn still less .
Rather it enables his reduced spending power to buy more .
His problem is in the relationship between the amount of money he can earn and the amount of money he must repay .
His problem is not caused by a greater buying power of that money .
( And here one can see the macroeconomic absurdity of the New Deal measures in the Great Depression to achieve recovery by compelling the burning of potatoes , the plowing under of cotton , and the slaughter of piglets .
Such measures had no power to increase sales revenues , profits , or the ability to repay debt in the economic system .
At most , they could increase the sales revenues of selected groups , to the extent that the demand for their specific products was inelastic , and equivalently reduce sales revenues elsewhere in the economic system .
Their effect on sales revenues was comparable to that of the so - called " oil shock " of the early 1970s , in which the sales revenues of the oil and other energy - producing industries rose , but at the expense of the sales revenues of the rest of the economic system , which correspondingly suffered .
They had no overall , economy - wide effect on sales revenues , profits , or the ability to repay debts .
All they served to accomplish on net balance was to make prices higher and reduce the buying power of the funds available — in other words , just to make life more difficult . )
Nor should the prospect of a fall in prices in and of itself be taken as the cause of an increase in the desire to save , still less of an increase in the demand for money for holding and thus of a monetary contraction .
To the extent that falling prices are the accompaniment of greater prosperity , the prospect of falling prices is accompanied by the prospect of greater prosperity .
The prospect of greater prosperity in the future provides an inducement to greater consumption in the present .
It should be understood as operating in the same way on present consumption as the prospect of coming into an inheritance .
It means that one 's future is better provided for and thus that one can afford to increase one 's consumption and enjoyment in the present .
This offsets the fact that every dollar withheld from present consumption will have greater buying power in the future .
In other words , the effect of falling prices caused by increased production on the degree of saving and provision for the future should be assumed to be neutral , because the prospect of greater future buying power of the monetary unit is offset by the prospect of greater future prosperity .
In such circumstances , the prospect of falling prices does not provide a basis for a rise in the demand for money for holding .
The case is different when the need for the fall in prices is caused by monetary contraction .
In this case , the failure of prices to fall , in the face of the anticipation that they will fall , to the extent necessary to clear the market of unsold supplies of goods and labor , leads to a speculative postponement of purchases , which increases the pressure on prices to fall .
Once prices do fall to the necessary extent , that is the end of the contraction .
Indeed , given the existence of a speculative withholding of purchases in anticipation of prices and wages falling to some necessary level , once that level is achieved , the speculative withholding of purchases comes to an end and there is an increase in the volume of spending .
In other words , the response to the necessary fall in prices and wages is economic recovery .
Provided the quantity of money in the economic system does not decrease , a rise in the demand for money for holding can have the very beneficial effect of increasing the degree of financial liquidity in the economic system , a valuable point which Rothbard made .
It serves to improve such vital measures of financial health as the cash balances businesses hold relative to their current liabilities .
It accomplishes this to the extent that it serves to bring down wage rates and prices and thus the dollar amount of current liabilities , which fall as the result of smaller outlays being made and thus smaller bills having to be paid .
The higher is the degree of such financial liquidity , the less is the danger of insolvencies and bankruptcies and thus the greater is the security against any need for further increases in such cash holdings .
The implication of this is that increases in the demand for money for holding are self - limiting , and that the demand for money for holding tends to stabilize at the higher level .
There is no process of its feeding on itself and endlessly increasing .
Indeed , what creates the need for a sudden , substantial increase in the demand for money for holding is the preceding artificial decrease in the demand for money for holding brought about by credit expansion .
Credit expansion leads businessmen to believe that they can substitute for the holding of actual cash the prospect of easily and profitably borrowing the funds they might require .
It also encourages a reduction in the demand for money for holding by means of the seeming ease with which inventories can be profitably sold in the face of the rising sales revenues it fuels , which makes it appear better to hold more inventory and less cash .
The rise in interest rates that credit expansion serves to bring about in the course of its further progress , as rising sales revenues raise nominal profits and thus the demand for loanable funds , also serves to reduce the demand for money for holding .
This is because the higher interest rates serve to make it worthwhile to lend out sums available for short periods of time that it would not have been worthwhile to lend out at lower interest rates .
To these factors must be added the influence of any prospect of rising prices that credit expansion may create .
And finally , the loss of capital that credit expansion engenders , as the result of the extensive malinvestment that it causes , serves to make credit less available and thus to create a still further demand for money for holding .
Avoid inflation and credit expansion , let the demand for money for holding be high , let prices and wages be adjusted to that fact , and the economic system will be secure from sudden increases in the demand for money for holding thereafter .
Similarly , the best reason in favor of an actual decrease in the quantity of money is that suffering it may serve to avoid a greater , more severe decrease later on .
This would be the case under a fractional - reserve gold standard that had not departed too radically from a one - hundred - percent - gold reserve .
In such circumstances , a reduction in the quantity of money in the form of fiduciary media could bring the quantity of money down to the supply of actual monetary gold and thus both retain the gold standard and avoid the need for a more severe and potentially catastrophic reduction in the quantity of money later on — the kind of reduction that occurred from 1929 to 1933 , after decades of expanding the supply of fiduciary media relative to the supply of gold .
Deflation , which , it can not be repeated too often , means monetary contraction , not falling prices , is at best in the category of a pain to be endured only in order to avoid greater pain later on .
It should never be , and virtually never is , regarded as any kind of positive in its own right .
Indeed , opposition to credit expansion , and to the fractional - reserve banking system that makes credit expansion possible , rests for the most part precisely on the fact they are responsible for deflation , which would not exist in their absence .
The most important point I have made , namely , that falling prices caused by increased production are not deflation and should never be confused with deflation , is illustrated by the following table , which can be taken as a summary of this article .

The European Union has proposed a plan to retroactively extend the copyright terms on musical recordings for another 45 years .
Apparently , it 's unfair for performers who recorded tracks in their twenties not to keep receiving money for them in their seventies ; under the current 50 - year copyright term , " this means that income stops when performers are retired . "
Funny — we thought that most retirees faced the same problem .
The whole plan has the whiff of grotesque entitlement about it .
Take , for instance , comments made earlier this week by bass player Herbie Flowers in support of an extension .
" The term of protection for performers has not kept up with life expectancy and it is high time it was changed .
I played on a couple of very successful tracks , including Lou Reed ’s ' Walk On The Wild Side ' and David Bowie ’s ' Space Oddity , ' and it would be unfair for me to stop receiving income for this performance after 50 years — probably just at the time when I will need it the most . "
One wonders why , knowing all this when he recorded the tracks fifty years ago , Flowers has n't been putting some of that money aside over the last five decades like everyone else who plans for retirement .
EU Commissioner Charlie McCreevy announced back in February his support for term extension , but the plan was not actually put forward until today .
It would extend protection from 50 years to 95 years for musical works , and apparently EU citizens should be grateful for such a modest retroactive extension plan ; composers and authors already get life plus 70 years .
The plan wo n't cause consumer prices to rise , which we know because a music - industry - commissioned study says so .
It 's probably true , since relatively few fifty - year - old recordings sell in any real volume , and most of these performers ' pay comes from radio performance payments now .
The high - profile Gowers Report , a lengthy copyright study commissioned by the UK government a few years back , recommended against just such a term extension , and the howls of music industry outrage ( " How can you cut off retirees during their most vulnerable years ? " ) sounded much as they do now .
The whole bizarre debate never seems to haul itself around to addressing the fact that everyone who participated in the current system did so knowing about the 50 - year term ; no one is in danger of " losing " anything they were once promised , and they 've had half a century to plan for the future .
McCreevey 's most compelling argument for the extension is that , in his view , " Copyright represents a moral right of the performer to control the use of his work and earn a living from his performance , at least during his lifetime . "
Sounds fair enough , though it raises the question of why McCreevey is n't simultaneously trying to retroactively lower the copyright term on books ?
The " poor retired musician " argument has been a staple of US lobbying efforts , as well , as artists have trotted up to Capitol Hill recently to demand that Congress force radio stations to pay recording artists ( and not just songwriters ) for playing their music .
No one wants to come out against old and starving musicians , of course , making this the perfect defense whenever rightsholders want to extend copyright terms or rake in more money .
In the EU 's case , though , an extra 45 years of protection wo n't even make that much money ( for the artists , anyway ) ; McCreevey 's own numbers show that it will produce € 150 to € 2,000 per year for an " average " artist , an amount small enough that it hardly seems worth locking up the building blocks of cultural creativity for another 45 years .
Fortunately , the proposal will allow works to enter the public domain if neither a record label nor a performer " shows any interest in marketing the sound recording " in the first year after the extension passes ( assuming that it does ) .

Activist : Obama defense of FISA support a ' stiff arm ' to constitution Nick Juliano
Published : Thursday July 3 , 2008

After more than a week of growing criticism of his support for a flawed surveillance bill , Barack Obama quietly responded late Thursday evening .
He 's not likely to quell his growing cadre of critics .
In a blog response posted just before 5 p.m. headed into a three - day holiday weekend , Obama reiterated his support for an update to the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act the Senate is expected to vote on Tuesday .
( No mention of the blog post seems to have been distributed to Obama 's normal press list , either . )
Obama says he is against a provision in the bill to give legal immunity to telecommunications companies that facilitated the National Security Agency 's warrantless surveillance of Americans as authorized by President Bush .
He vowed to support amendments that would strip immunity but would vote for the final bill regardless .
" It 's a stiff arm to the people that care about the Constitution , " said Mike Stark , a blogger and liberal activist who started a group on Obama 's social networking page to urge him to fix the FISA bill .
" It 's left a question in a lot of people 's mind about how committed he really is to change , " Stark told RAW STORY .
Responding to the 17,000 supporters who made the group the largest on my .
barackobama.com , the Democratic candidate said he was glad to hear their concerns but reminded them that they really did n't have any other choice in this election .
" I think it is worth pointing out that our agreement on the vast majority of issues that matter outweighs the differences we may have , " Obama wrote .
" After all , the choice in this election could not be clearer . "
Justifying his support for the FISA bill , Obama cited a provision in the latest version that provides FISA is the " exclusive means " through which a president can authorize surveillance .
Of course , the original FISA bill , passed in 1978 , had the same qualification , and three federal judges have ruled that President Bush did not have inherent authority to conduct warrantless surveillance like he claimed to have had .
He also noted the fact that surveillance authorizations under the Protect America Act , a stopgap FISA update Obama opposed when it passed last year , would expire in August .
Glenn Greenwald debunks this justification here .
If opponents of Bush 's warrantless wiretapping program can take any encouragement from Obama 's statement , it is that he does repeat earlier pledges to instruct his Attorney General to fully investigate just what Bush authorized , if he 's elected .
" Given the choice between voting for an improved yet imperfect bill , and losing important surveillance tools , I 've chosen to support the current compromise , " he writes .
" I do so with the firm intention -- once I m sworn in as President -- to have my Attorney General conduct a comprehensive review of all our surveillance programs , and to make further recommendations on any steps needed to preserve civil liberties and to prevent executive branch abuse in the future . "
Stark allowed that electing Obama remained the larger goal for him , but said the disappointment many feel about his decision to support FISA could linger even if he were elected .
" Of course I 'm going to vote for him in November , " he said .
But " we 're keeping score , and there 's going to be a time when he needs us .

We have long memories . "
NEW YORK ( CNNMoney.com ) -- General Motors announced plans Tuesday to shut four truck and SUV plants that employ thousands of workers .
It also said high gas prices are here to stay - and , with them , consumers ' growing preference for more fuel - efficient vehicles .
At a news conference in Wilmington , Del. , GM Chairman and CEO Rick Wagoner announced plans to roll out more fuel - efficient vehicles , including approval to start the production process on a vehicle that can run gas - free for trips up to 40 miles .
But the plant - closing plans are a stunning admission from the nation 's largest automaker that its long dependence on large SUVs and pickups is no longer a viable strategy for a company struggling to end losses from its North American operations .
The plants to be closed include two U.S. facilities :
The Moraine , Ohio plant that builds midsize SUVs , such as the Chevrolet Trailblazer and GMC Envoy ; and the Janesville , Wisc. , assembly line that builds large SUVs such as the Chevy Tahoe and Suburban and GMC Yukon .
In addition , it plans to close a pickup plant in Oshawa , Canada , and a truck plant in Toluca , Mexico .
The Mexican plant that builds medium - duty trucks sold to businesses rather than consumers will close later this year .
The other plants will close in 2009 and 2010 , with sooner closings possible if sales do not improve .
Each U.S. plant has about 2,500 employees .
The company said it believes that high oil and gasoline prices will be the norm , and that prices are likely to go higher due to strong global demand for oil .
" These higher gasoline prices are changing consumer behavior and rapidly , " said Wagoner .
" We do n't think this is a temporary spike or shift .
We think it is permanent . "
Goodbye Hummer Wagoner also said GM is looking at possibly selling its Hummer unit as part of a strategic review of the SUV brand based on military vehicles .
The Hummer H3 mid-size SUV gets about 13 to 14 miles per gallon in city driving in the most recent EPA ratings .
The H1 and H2 are larger vehicles on which EPA does not give mileage estimates .
The brand has become the symbol to many members of the public of a gas - guzzling large U.S. vehicle .
Hello Volt
He also announced that GM has approved production of the Chevrolet Volt , a so - called plug - in hybrid vehicle that can run about 40 miles without any use of gasoline .
The Volt will be built in GM's Hamtramck , Mich. , plant and is due in showrooms by the end of 2010 .
" We believe it 's the biggest step yet in our industry 's move away from its historic , nearly complete reliance upon petroleum to power vehicles , " he said .
" We believe the Volt is an important investment for the future of our company and our shareholders . "
Ahead of the rollout of that new model , GM plans to increase production of some more fuel - efficient car models .
It 's adding a third shift at its Orion , Mich. , plant to build more of the Chevy Malibu and Pontiac G6 models , as well as a third shift at a Lordstown , Ohio , plant that builds the compact Chevrolet Cobalt and Pontiac G5 models .
It also plans a more fuel - efficient gasoline engine for its small car models that will get about 9 miles per gallon more than current GM engines in the segment .
The plans were announced ahead of GM's ( GM , Fortune 500 ) annual meeting Tuesday in Wilmington .
They followed similar plans unveiled last month by rival Ford Motor ( F , Fortune 500 ) , although Ford did not give details of plant closing plans .
About 19,000 U.S. hourly employees had already agreed to take buyout and retirement bonuses to leave the company in recent months , but it had originally planned to replace most of those workers with lower - wage new hires who were not due the same expensive benefit package .
At DEFCON , Tony Kapela and Alex Pilosov demonstrated a drastic weakness in the Internet 's infrastructure that had long been rumored , but was n't believed practical .

Quoting : Here 's the PDF of Kapela and Pilosov 's presentation
Having reviewed the format and time shifting provisions , I now turn to the music shifting provisions ( Section 29.22 ) .
Industry Minister Jim Prentice has heavily promoted these provisions as he assures Canadians that they can now shift music from CDs to their iPods .
The provision has faced significant criticism from all sides , however .
The Canadian Private Copying Collective is livid at the change , arguing that it will " rob creators of their rights , denying them compensation for this use of their work . "
In what sounds a lot like consumer group complaints , the CPCC adds that they were not consulted on the issue and that an open consultation is needed .
From the consumer perspective , the provision does not go far enough .
I think it is fair to say that most consumers believe that if they have paid for a song , they should have the right to listen to it on the device of their choice without further compensation ( CRIA seemingly agrees ) .
Such uses should be considered fair uses and the value of listening to a song on multiple devices can be built into the initial purchase price .
Yet the music shifting provision is subject to some significant limitations that undermine their fairness .
First up – as with the other shifting provisions – is the fact that it is subject to an anti-circumvention limitation .
In other words , the right to shift music to your iPod is not a right that you control .
It is a right that is effectively dictated by the record label who can easily remove the right by including copy - controls on the CD release .
In fact , the anti-circumvention limitation even applies to private copies onto blank CDs .
This means that consumers pay for the CD and pay the levy on a blank CD that nominally gives them the right to make a personal copy , yet violate the law if they circumvent a copy - control in order to do so .
If these provisions are to strike a genuine balance , the law should stop treating paying customers like criminals by giving them the right to legally shift their music to the device of their choice .

We sort ours by attitude , Ying S .
What are the myths and mistaken beliefs that are preventing you from being more productive in both your work life and your personal life ?
How are you actively undermining your efforts to pull it all together ?
Yeah , I mean you .
The sad fact is that the beliefs that we hold about productivity and organization often prevent us from doing and being everything we want to do and be in our lives .
While we cannot control the circumstances around us , the things that we think about work , life , effectiveness , success , and innovation affect the way we respond to those circumstances , and often for the worst .
Here , then , are ten common beliefs about productivity that keep people from enjoying the success they desire .
How many of these are keeping you from being more productive , effective , and balanced as a person ?
Myth 1 : Organized equals clean
Too many people equate “ organization ” with the cold , sterile , un - lived - in spaces they see in glossy magazines .
That ’s not organization – the cleanest - looking space might still take forever to find anything in .
An organized space is simply one in which the things you need the most are close at hand , the things you need often are easily found , and the things you need rarely are out of the way but easily retrieved when needed .
That means that organization has to meet your needs , not some imposed notion of cleanliness .
Advertising
If you never spend more than a minute trying to find anything in that mountain of clutter you call your office ( or room or cubicle or kitchen ) , then leave it alone .
At the same time , be honest with yourself – most people claim they can find anything they need , but when put to the test , they ’re left scratching their heads .
If your clutter is n’t working for you , put some time into figuring out how to make sure it does work for you .
Myth 2 : I do n’t have time for a system
This is a popular complaint about systems like David Allen ’s GTD .
The thinking goes something like this : “ If I spend all my time maintaining my list and doing weekly reviews , I ’ll never get anything done . ”
The reality is that while most systems take some time to get set up , once you start using your system , the time you use in “ maintenance ” is more than made up for by the time you save not having to think about what to do – or making up for the things you did n’t remember to do .
Myth 3 : Systems are rigid and unflexible
This is another common complaint about productivity systems .
The fear seems to be that , unlike everyone else ’s life , my life is so chaotic and unpredictable that no system can possibly accommodate it all .
I ’ve read a lot of productivity literature in my life – it is , after all , part of my job !
– and I ’ve never come across a productivity system that did n’t make room for differences in personality , work requirements , or personal situation .
In the end , the important thing is to have a system so that you can respond effectively to unforeseen events without losing your grip on your whole life !
More to the point , though , if your life is really that chaotic and unpredictable , it ’s likely that its because you ’ve resisted adopting some kind of system rather than because no system is good enough for your life .
Which tells me that you have n’t spent the time you need to figure out what your own life is all about – instead , you ’ve just responded to everything the world has thrown at you as it ’s come .
Adopting a system means spending some time figuring out what ’s important to you , what is n’t important , and how to get rid of the less important stuff so you can start making ground on the important stuff .
Myth 4 : Productivity means more work
Once you start down this rabbit hole , it can be really hard to turn yourself around .
The idea is that if it takes me half as long to do all the things in my life as it takes me now , then getting productive means I ’ll be doing twice as much .
Advertising
If you ’re not smart about things , that can sometimes be true , at work at least .
Supervisors hate to see people lounging around while they ’re still on the clock , so finishing up your day ’s work at 2:00 pm means you ’ll be expected to find more stuff to do to fill in the remaining hours .
So if you ’re that productive , you need to either leverage that extra work into a promotion or raise – or convince your boss to adopt a telecommuting plan so you can work from home .
But productivity is n’t just about work , either .
Being more productive in your life means you should have more time to do things like spend time with your family , take a vacation , read a book , visit a museum , or write your plan for world domination .
Getting your work done in half the time just so you can do twice as much work is n’t productive – it ’s dumb .
Myth 5 : Creativity ca n’t be fit into a system
Maybe you believe that productivity stuff is for business people , not creative people like yourself .
This is wrong for two reasons .
First of all , creative work is still work , and just as susceptible to procrastination , poor planning , and shoddy work practices as bookkeeping , house painting , and world domination .
The second reason is that while you may have a great grasp of the demands of your creative work , unless you ’re comfortable with the whole “ starving artist ” thing , chances are you have a lot more to do than just the creative stuff .
Records need to be kept , clients need to be contacted , taxes need to be filed , projects need to be invoiced , and so on .
And here ’s the rub : creative people generally do n’t much like doing all that routine , everyday stuff .
Having a system to make that stuff as painless and speedy as possible means you can spend more time being creative .
Myth 6 : I work best under pressure
There are people who believe they thrive under the pressure of an impending deadline .
Nine times out of ten , they do n’t .
They just enjoy the excuse because it means they do n’t have to take responsibility for the messes they end up in .
Keeping yourself in a high - stress , always - urgent mode is n’t good for your health , and it ’s not good for your business .
Health - wise , it means you ’re very likely to keel over on day , decades before your time .
Business - wise , it means you are n’t much of a pleasure to work with , which means that even when your work is good you ’ll be turning off employers , colleagues , or clients – and sooner or later you ’ll miss some important detail that you were too frantic to recognize , damaging your job , your reputation , and your career .
If you ’re lucky , you ’ll have your heart attack before that happens , though .

Myth 7 : My lack of a system is my system
This one ’s actually true , though not in the way most people intend when they say it .
The mess of habits , practices , and beliefs you have right now are , in fact , a system – and you ’re working it every day .
Hard .
But what most people mean is that by not having a system , they ’re actually being more productive than if they had a system .
For some , this is just a variation on Myth # 2 , but others really think that the mish - mash of habits they ’ve cobbled together out of life experience is working for them .
They do n’t see any room for improvement .
Which is what I imagine being dead is like .
For living things , there ’s always room for growth .
Myth 8 : I need inspiration to work
No , you do n’t .
Inspiration is wonderful , but rarely compatible with getting stuff done .
What you need is a system to capture those flashes of inspiration so that , when inspiration is on holiday , you ’ve got plenty to work with .
We have a word for people who only work when they ’re inspired .
That word is “ unemployed ” .
( The reverse is n’t true , of course – not all unemployed people only work when they feel like it . )
Myth 9 : Being organized is boring
This is a variation of Myth # 1 , flavored with a dash of Myth # 6 : some people crave the excitement that always being about to screw up brings them .
This may reflect deep psychological trauma , but it may also just reflect a lifetime of bad working experiences – pulling a success out of imminent failure can feel great , and if your “ everyday ” successes are n’t rewarded , it can be tempting to push for the imminent failure so you can pull the success out of the jaws of defeat all heroic - like .
Whatever the root , this myth is misguided because it places attention in the wrong place .
Being organized is n’t boring – being boring is boring .
Make your own excitement and you ’ll stop being boring – and then you can stop using your disorganization as a crutch for a life not fully realized .
Advertising
Myth 10 : There ’s something wrong with me no system can fix
This one ’s probably true .
Systems , no matter how good , ca n’t fix the fundamental problems in your life .
They wo n’t make you smarter or more likable or better looking or more experienced .
What they can do is help you make time to figure out how to solve those problems .
They can help you make a space in your life for real personal growth .
And they can help you highlight the sources of those failures , by eliminating the “ noise ” that normally masks them .
In the end , your growth as a person , your success – however you define it — is up to you .
Straightening out the things in your life that keep you from being effective and productive can be an important step towards that success , but it ’s a means , not an end .
But if you ’re holding tight to any of the myths above , you ’re not giving yourself a fair chance – you ’re standing in the way of your own life .
And that ’s not doing you , or anyone else , any good .
How have you been holding yourself back ?
Have you overcome any of these misconceptions , and what happened when you did ?
Share your stories in the comments – I , for one , would like to hear about it !
