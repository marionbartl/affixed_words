This is the teenage thug who punched a girl off her feet after she soaked him during a fun water fight last week .
Daniel McInerney admitted he was in the wrong but refuses to apologise to his 15 - year - old victim - unless she says sorry first for chucking pink liquid over his T - shirt .
The 16 - year - old said he blew his top after being drenched because he was not even there for the water fight , organised through the Facebook website .
McInerney added : " We 're both in the wrong .
She should n't go around throwing juice in my face .
" I 'd say why did you throw that in my face ?
I would apologise to her at the same time she apologises to me .
" She threw juice in my face and I was angry because I had to go all the way home with a sticky T - shirt and juice in my face .
" So I just reacted bad .
I was just annoyed at the fact she done it .
" Fair enough it was a water fight but I did n't have no watergun , no bottles in my hand .
I did n't have no water .
" I was just going to see what girls were there .
" She just came out of nowhere and threw juice straight in my face .
And the way she was laughing and trying to mock me .
I admit I 'm in the wrong .
I mean fair enough , I hit a girl .
But I had to take off my top and put it in the bin . "
McInerney , of Ealing , West London , floored the girl at the Summer Splash water fight in Hyde Park .
Hundreds of other teenagers were at the event .
The girl splashed him with pink water from a bottle and then ran away as he gave chase - thinking it was all part of the game .
But the youngster was in for a shock when seething McInerney suddenly lashed out and hit her , lifting her off her feet and sending her sprawling to the ground .
Last night , the girl - who wants to remain anonymous - told how the attack ruined what had been an enjoyable day up until then .
She said : " I assumed he was involved so I splashed him with dyed water .
" He took it really badly though and started running at me and the next thing he had hit me on my chin .
" It was quite a shock as it had all been quite fun up until that point .
We then had an argument about it and he left .
But I was OK .
I wo n't be taking any further action . "
After the incident things got more ugly as teens turned on police called to calm the situation .
Another Summer Splash was planned for last Saturday but a heavy police presence and bad weather put paid to it .
Wednesday 's attack came just two weeks after teenager Frederick Moody - Boateng was murdered by a gang in South London following a row during a similar water fight .

Amazon basically guaranteed that I 'll never buy a Kindle last night by bending to the wishes of a publisher and deleting every single legitimately - purchased copy of 1984 and Animal Farm from all Kindles remotely .
Ridiculous .

Apparently , the publisher changed its mind about having electronic versions of Orwell 's books .
So Amazon removed them from the store and in the process remotely deleted the books from the Kindles of anyone who bought them , depositing a refund in their account in the process .
If there 's a better argument for dead - tree books and against the Kindle , I 'd like to know what it is .
If you can't be sure that you own something after you pay for it , what 's the point ?
How many people were halfway through these books that they paid for and now are shit out of luck ?

Amazon says this is a " rarity , " but even once is too many times for bullshit like this to happen .
Once I buy a book from Barnes & Noble , I never have to worry about them breaking into my house and taking it back , leaving me a pile of singles on my nightstand .
And of course the fact that this happened to 1984 , of all books , makes this even more surreal .

Typical Republican .
Rails against taxes , then tries to cheat the District of Columbia on his property taxes .
But , Blunt and his lobbyist wife got busted .
Roll Call ( sub. req. ) broke the story :
The District of Columbia Office of Tax and Revenue will charge Rep. Roy Blunt ( R - Mo. ) and his spouse $ 5,600 in back property taxes for their Georgetown home , following a nearly two - month review of the property ’s tax status .
The Missouri lawmaker and his wife , Abigail Perlman Blunt , own a three - bedroom Georgetown home , valued at $ 1.62 million in tax assessment records .
According to public tax records , the Blunts ’ home had received the homestead tax deduction as recently as April , a benefit intended for full - time city residents that can shave hundreds of dollars off annual tax bills — and significantly more in the long term by limiting assessment increases .
Public records show that the city has recalculated taxes dating to 2005 .
The city does not list interest or penalties on the unpaid taxes .
Blunt is running for the seat vacated by Republican Kit Bond .
So far , he ’s the only declared Republican candidate , although a couple others are making noises about jumping in .
The Democratic nominee will be the current Secretary of State , Robin Carnahan .
Early polls look good for Robin .
But , Missouri is always a tough state .
If you want to help pick up this seat for the Democrats , we ’ve set up an ActBlue page for Robin .
She ’s a good friend and a solid progressive .
And , she ’s also the proud parent of a new foal , which you can help name .
Robin ’s family has a farm in Rolla , Missouri .
Over the years , I ’ve learned way more about farming , particularly about cattle , from Robin than I ever imagined I ’d know .
That ’s why I always loved one of her first t.v. ads :

Last Thursday , the Obama administration finally named its choice to head the Patent and Trademark Office : David J. Kappos , who is currently serving as IBM 's assistant general counsel .
Kappos has a long history in the field of intellectual property law , and has been an advocate of patent reforms , having testified in favor of a reform bill before the Senate Judiciary Committee .
Normally , a public record of that sort provides plenty of opportunities for people to identify problems with a candidate , but , so far at least , response to Kappos ' nomination has been generally positive .
The White House 's announcement of the nomination highlights the fact that Kappos has about as much inside knowledge of the functioning of the US patent system as anyone alive .
With engineering and law degrees , Kappos wound up managing IBM 's intellectual property portfolio — for 16 straight years , the company has been the leading recipient of US patents .
IBM 's strategic decisions , which include a heavy focus on consulting and technology integration and its embrace of open source , have undoubtedly made that position a challenging one in recent years .
That history certainly influenced his testimony before Congress , during which he spoke of the need for patent reform .
In advocating for a bill under consideration by the Senate , Kappos focused on a number of issues , including the fact that patents and intellectual property can sometimes limit the sorts of collaborations and open standards that IBM has embraced .
He also highlighted the need for improving the quality of patents issued , citing a survey of professionals that indicated half of them considered US patents to be low quality .
In his view , the ambiguity in many of the patents that are granted has been a major factor in the skyrocketing rate of patent litigation , which he sees largely as a drain on company resources .
To fix matters , Kappos advocated the adoption of a formal process that would allow the patents to undergo a review one year after granting , a process that would allow others in the field to submit comments about the intellectual content .
He would also like to see different standards of royalty - based damages adopted in cases of patent infringement .
These are two measures that have been near and dear to the high - tech industry for some time , so it's no surprise that the nomination was praised by the Coalition for Patent Fairness , which counts many of the companies in that industry among its membership .
Similarly , Microsoft 's deputy general counsel issued a statement in which he said , " We applaud his selection . "
It 's also not surprising that the Chair of the Senate Judiciary Committee , Patrick Leahy of Vermont , praised the choice of Kappos , given that Leahy is both a Democrat and an advocate of patent reform .
What might be surprising is that Kappos is also receiving support from industries that have n't been thrilled with the idea of significant change to the patent system , such as the biomedical industry .
Bio , a biotech industry organization , issued a statement in which it commended Obama for his choice .
" We believe Mr. Kappos will bring a thoughtful perspective to the Department of Commerce and the USPTO , " the statement said , while urging the Senate to act quickly on his nomination .
Quick action would appear to be needed .
As noted in Microsoft 's blog post on the nomination , the backlog of patent applications has tripled over the last decade , with a corresponding growth in the amount of time necessary for a decision on a patent to be issued .
Adding an extra layer of review , as favored by Kappos , would invariably increase the delays , even if it were aided by innovative systems such as peer - to - patent .
Even if some groups disagree with the specific reforms Kappos has proposed , they 're anxious to see someone with demonstrated competence and experience in charge of the USPTO , someone who at least looks likely to make the whole creaking machinery of the office start chugging a little faster .

ASIA ( AFNS ) -- Special Operations Command Central officials opened a new home with a ribbon - cutting ceremony for their new building July 29 here .
The headquarters will allow SOCCENT members to better accomplish its mission of exercising operational control of more than 7,000 special operations servicemembers in the U.S. Central Command area of responsibility .
" We 're privileged to be at the center of our nation 's efforts , " said Army Maj .
Gen. Charles Cleveland , the SOCCENT commander who officiated at the grand opening .
" With the help of our partners , we look forward to continuing to work toward a future that offers greater peace and stability in this region and throughout the world . "
A part of the Combined Forces Special Operations Component Command , SOCCENT includes and supports members from all services , as well as civilians and coalition partners .
" It 's all four services , plus our support people like those who work on parachute rigging , medical folks , transportation and logistics , " said Army Lt. Col .
Holly Silkman , a SOCCENT public affairs officer deployed from MacDill Air Force Base , Fla .
" We 've got lots of partners in the area helping us out , " said the Albuquerque , N.M. , native , citing Iraqi special forces and Afghan commandos as examples .
From SOCCENT 's rear headquarters located at MacDill AFB , more than 700 members from the United States can deploy here for up to a year , or rotate through the AOR for temporary duties of one to three months .
On any given night , SOCCENT headquarters is monitoring at least a dozen special forces operations in the AOR .
A joint operations center can reach out and communicate with forces where ever they may be .
" It 's safe to say our area of interest is indeed the most vital area of importance , not only for the U.S. but for the world , " General Cleveland said to the gathered troops and distinguished visitors .
" Our operations are increasingly becoming the stuff of history . "
The main headquarters had previously been located in a temporary facility on another base in Southwest Asia .
" All of the U.S. forces wanted to be co-located and for the headquarters to be a world - class facility , " Colonel Silkman said .
That desire led to the creation of this state - of - the - art compound .
" We 've planted the flag right here in the area of operations , which means it 's easier to react , " she said .
" We 're in the same time zone as the people we 're supporting . "
General Cleveland sees no comparison between the old and new headquarters .
" There was a huge need for a new facility , " he said .
" So it 's great to get into a permanent building . "
Four years in the making , the new facility has a number of features that will make it an effective headquarters .
These include an indoor rifle range and SOCCENT 's only parachute - rigging tower in the area .
Yet the new headquarters compound is just a small footprint of a larger modernization project in the works around the base .
" This is just the beginning , " General Cleveland said .
Additions in the future will include hangars currently under construction , bigger maintenance bays and a new training facility .
General Cleveland said he hoped members of SOCCENT would look upon their new facility as a " home away from home . "
" I know it can't replace your family and all that waits for you back home , " he said .
" I understand the hardships of serving the nation overseas in a time of war , and I want to publicly thank you and your families for the sacrifices you 've made in the name of freedom . "

( CNN ) -- A
Nestle plant linked to an outbreak of illness has been shut temporarily , and the company said Monday that it expects to lay off more than 200 workers as a result .
Preliminary results " indicate a strong association with eating raw prepackaged cookie dough , " the CDC says .
" It 's likely that we 're going to have some temporary layoffs at that facility , " Nestle spokeswoman Roz O'Hearn said of the Danville , Virginia , facility that was churning out refrigerated cookie - dough products until Thursday .
About 550 people work at the factory , but only about half of them work on cookie dough , she said .
The rest work on Buitoni pasta and sauce in a separate facility at the plant .
She said there is little chance that the Buitoni products might be tainted , because -- even if the cookie dough is proved to be the source of the outbreak of E. coli 0157:H7 -- it is a kosher product , meaning it is made from a segregated stream of ingredients .
Danville 's Economic Development Office said the city 's unemployment rate is 14.3 percent .
Nestle was first alerted to the problem late Wednesday by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the Food and Drug Administration , O'Hearn said , adding : " Less than a day later , we made the decision to remove the product .
We shut down .
We stopped shipping . "
Included in the recall are 300,000 cases of the product .
Each case contains 12 packages , and each package contains 24 cookies .
That 's a total of 86.4 million cookies ' worth of dough .
The recall does not include Dreyer 's or Edy 's ice cream products with Nestle Toll House " cookie dough " ingredients .
That 's because the " dough " in ice cream is not really dough at all ; it is cooked .
" Ice cream is a different formulation , " O'Hearn said .
" Since it 's not meant to be baked before consumption -- those cookie crumbles that are in the formulation -- they 're all cooked .
For the cookie dough that 's present in the ice cream , Dreyer 's is using heat - treated ingredients . "
According to the CDC , between March 1 and Monday , 70 people in 30 states had been infected with a strain of E. coli .
The ages of the people affected ranged from 2 to 57 years , though more than 70 percent were younger than 19 , and 75 percent were female , the agency said on its Web site .
Twenty - five people had been hospitalized , and seven had developed a kidney failure called hemolytic uremic syndrome .
No fatalities had been reported , it said .
" Preliminary results of this investigation indicate a strong association with eating raw prepackaged cookie dough , " the agency said .
" Most patients reported eating refrigerated prepackaged Nestle Toll House cookie dough products raw . "
Health Library MayoClinic.com : E coli
Though cooking the product would kill the bacteria , the agency did not recommend that people holding on to the company 's cookie - dough products do so , " because consumers might get the bacteria on their hands and on other cooking surfaces . "
The recall does not include Nestle Toll House morsels , which are used as an ingredient in many homemade baked goods , or other baked cookie products .
CNN 's Louise Schiavone contributed to this story .

Alongside the news that The Pirate Bay will sell shares on the Swedish stock market come some other significant changes .
The site itself will decentralize and stop hosting and tracking torrents .
Instead ,
The Pirate Bay will use a third party tracker and torrent hosting service to serve its users .
Earlier today The Pirate Bay announced that it would be acquired by Global Gaming Factory X ( GGF ) who are listed on the Swedish stock market .
So , Pirate Bay users can not only share files but they can buy a share of the site as well .
Perhaps even more significant for the BitTorrent community is the thus far unreported decision to close down the BitTorrent tracker .
Up until today Pirate Bay ’s public tracker connected more than half of all BitTorrent users but this is about to change .
Pirate Bay ’s Peter Sunde has informed TorrentFreak that the site will soon decentralize and stop running a BitTorrent tracker of its own .
Instead they will encourage their users to use a yet to be launched third party tracker for their torrents .
To decentralize even further , the torrents that will be listed on the site wont be hosted on The Pirate Bay ’s servers anymore .
In the near future the site will use a new torrent hosting service that will store the torrents for them .
This new hosting service will be open to other torrent sites as well and can be accessed through an API .
In the end The Pirate Bay is making these changes to ensure that the BitTorrent ecosystem stays intact no matter what happens , Peter Sunde told TorrentFreak .
By decentralizing the different aspects they hope that BitTorrent users will be less reliant on the uptime of The Pirate Bay ’s servers alone .
The burden will now be spread among several independently operated services .
For now it remains a mystery what GGF CEO Hans Pandeya meant with “ We would like to introduce models which entail that content providers and copyright owners get paid for content that is downloaded via the site . ”
That ’s worrying to say the least .
In addition , GGF also acquired Peerialism who apparently have developed a new P2P distribution technology which will be used on The Pirate Bay .
How this related to the new tracker and external torrent hosting remains unknown .
We ’re trying to get confirmation and more details from GGF as soon as possible .
Update : According to Johan Sellström , the CTO of Global Gaming Factory , the plans have changed after Peter Sunde talked to us .
“ We had discussed closing it down initially so I think that ’s why he said so .
The plan is to use technology from Peerialism that makes bandwidth utilization more efficient and then it would not make sense to shut it down , ” he said , adding .
“ Peerialism will modify the tracker but it will be backwards compatible .
But all this is subject to change if for some reason it would not work .
It is our ambition to do so . ”
Why do n’t all men look like this ?
( Image : c. Mattel Inc / Everett / Rex Features )
Skinny men have new reason to celebrate .
Well , kind of .
Beefcakes may be able to attract women by rippling their muscles , but the downside of all that brawn is a poor immune system and an increased appetite , a new study finds .
Such evolutionary costs could explain why males of our species do not all look like He - Man , according to William Lassek , an evolutionary psychologist at the University of Pittsburgh , Pennsylvania , who led the new study .
“ In some respects I was surprised at how big the costs were … something I had n’t anticipated , ” he says .
Sex boost
Many other studies have shown that women tend to prefer more toned men , and muscle - bound men tend to have more sexual partners than slender men , when other factors are controlled for .

Previous research has also suggested that musculature comes with a cost .
Testosterone , a hormone that promotes secondary muscle growth , suppresses the immune system of all animals , including people .
Yet no one had examined both the positives and negatives of big muscles in a single population , says Lassek , who analysed data from more than 5000 men , aged 18 to 49 , who participated in the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey , between 1988 and 1994 .
The beefier the man – measured by total fat - free mass , or arm and leg muscle mass – the more sexual partners he had , Lassek confirmed .
The study also showed that more muscled men tended to lose their virginity at a younger age , compared to skinny men .
Hunger pangs
Yet in the same men , muscles did n’t come free .
Muscle mass did a better job of predicting caloric intake than body mass index ( BMI ) , age , or activity levels .
A larger appetite may not seem like a cost in modern western societies , with a restaurant or grocer on every corner .
But ancient humans struggled to get all the calories their bodies needed at times , Lassek says , which could have meant hunky men going hungry more often .
Compared to skinnies , muscular men also tended to produce fewer infection - fighting white blood cells and less of an important immune molecule called C - reactive protein , which helps destroy pathogens .
Together , the pluses of sexual benefits and minuses of the energetic costs of being beefy may even out in the end , explaining why men of all shapes and sizes thrive , Lassek contends .

What truly defines a failed social media campaign ?
What are the factors and elements that drive a social media campaign to its doom ?
What are the worst social media campaigns online ?
What can be learned from the mistakes they have made ?
In my previous post entitled “ 10 Social Media Campaigns that Rock … “ , I listed and discussed , in details , the 10 best social media campaigns that I was able to find online and that had a great the ability to grab my attention and gain my interest .
Furthermore , and in the same post , I added a list of elements and advices that should be considered to ensure the success if any social media campaign .
For this post , as promised , I will be mentioning 10 social media campaigns that failed with a few following tips of how to avoid falling into the same trap !
10 Social media Campaigns that Failed :
Wal Mart‘s Facebook Campaign – Wal Mart here tried using Facebook pages feature to market itself in a different image , “ practicality ” vs. “ style ” , and failed miserably as opposed to Target , the company !
Skittles Twitter Campaign – Although it should have worked out in their favor , skittles underestimated the power of tweeting when it utilized Twitter , which in turn turned what could have been a great campaign against them through the attacks they received about their product through the Twitter community !
Kiva.org ‘s Twitter Campaign –
By applying a the “ # followfriday ” concept , Kiva.org tried to tremendously increase the number of followers and sadly , they failed ( we think it ’s due to choosing the wrong audience ) .
Starbucks Social Media Campaign –
Though their idea to leverage the customer community to drive co-innovation is a great one in theory , Starbucks less than planned or integrated campaign failed to gain the feedback sought .
Advani‘s Political Social Media Campaign –
Though his people were on the right track utilizing a blog , a Facebook page , a Youtube channel and others , there was too much emphasis on advertising rather than communication which lead to a less than desired outcome .
Molson Canadian Facebook Photo Contest Campaign –
The photo required to enter the draw for a trip to Cancun promoted irresponsible drinking and lead to the plummet of the campaign !
Target Rounder ‘s Facebook Campaign –
One which utilized a lie created just to gain more fans and a larger community !
Brinpopcorn.com ‘s Social Media Spammer –
They tried to bribe top diggers to place them on the first page !
General Motor ‘s SUV “ create your own advert ” Viral Marketing Campaign –
The problem was that the environmentalists created negative ads !
Resident Evil ‘s Viral Marketing Campaign – Sony ’s Resident Evil mobile marketing campaign backfired when people thought they are receiving actual mobile viruses !
Things to do & things to avoid !
Revise your marketing message once , twice , three times and even more to make sure you will get the least amount of attacks or negative feedback from your audience .
once , twice , three times and even more to make sure you will get the least amount of attacks or negative feedback from your audience .
When using Facebook for your social media campaign , try not to restrict comments and feedback to your Facebook page as “ Wall Posts ” instead , create a discussion board for more effective and dynamic two - way communication .
.
Never stray from the core or try to be something that you ’re not .
Being authentic , transparent and sticking to your overall image is very important .

Do not try to sell yourself too bluntly .
If you feel you have a need to do so , do it through communication and involvement with communities and individuals on different suitable social media channels .

; lying or purposely deceiving will not pay off as some might suspect !
Use Facebook techniques that are sure to pay off because not every Facebook feature or tool will fit into your image , vision or goals .
Learn when to stick to the “ old school style ” .
The “ more the merrier ” concept does not always work .
Remember : sometimes less is more !
!
If you mess up by mistake , always have a “ damage control ” plan .
Luck is overrated and you need to be prepared in case anything goes wrong .
If almost 50 % of social media campaign will fail , is it wise to keep spending resources to try to create campaigns that rock ?
I do believe so !
Finally , I ’ll leave you to think about the following questions :
How dangerous do you think social media and viral marketing campaigns can be ?
And do you have any more advice or experiences that you ’d like to share ?
Judge Suppresses Coerced Confessions and Refuses to Delay Hearing in Gitmo Case
Created : July 17 , 2009 11:09 | Last updated : July 31 , 2020 00:00
U.S. District Judge Ellen Huvelle this morning denied the government ’s attempt to further delay the hearing of Guantanamo Bay prisoner Mohammed Jawad and , as expected , ruled that his coerced confessions will not be admitted in his habeas corpus proceeding .
This is the first time that a judge has ordered the suppression of statements in a habeas corpus hearing , according to American Civil Liberties Union lawyer Jonathan Hafetz , who represents Jawad .
It ’s also the first time the government has agreed to have the statements suppressed .
As I noted yesterday , though , it ’s still not clear whether this reflects a change in policy on the part of the Obama administration — and a break from the Bush administration ’s insistence that such statements should be relied upon — or whether it ’s simply a strategic move in this one case , where the government seemed likely to lose any argument that the confessions were admissible .
Rejecting the Justice Department ’s request to postpone Jawad ’s hearing on the merits of his case , Judge Huvelle ruled today :
Petitioner has been imprisoned at Guantanamo for more than seven years .
Permitting the government to take additional time would be contrary to the Supreme Court ’s directive that “ the costs of delay can no longer be borne by those who are held in custody . ”
Boumediene v. Bush , 128 S. Ct. 2229 , 2275 ( 2008 )
( “ The detainees in these cases are entitled to a prompt habeas corpus hearing . ” ) .
The government had asked the court to delay the latest status conference in the case so that it could “ consult internally to determine how Respondents will proceed in connection with this habeas action . ”
It ’s not clear at this point whether the government is considering dropping the case altogether , since its primary evidence appeared to be the coerced confessions it ’s now agreed not to use , or whether it will seek to introduce new evidence to support keeping Jawad in prison .

Home users will be able to purchase picture frames and place any picture off of their HDD or select from a gallery of default pictures .
Of course the pictures will probably be moderated , so do n’t go uploading naked ladies to hang up in your apartment .
This is just the begining of what Sony has planned for user - generated content to come to Home .
We look forward to seeing all of the pictures that everyone puts up .

The sun rises in the east .
The sky is blue .
Bill Kristol advises Republicans to vote against health care reform .
The first time he tried this , in 1994 , he established a reputation for tactical “ brilliance , ” as he managed to intimidate Bob Dole–whose life was saved by government health care –into opposing the Clinton effort .
The Republicans stonewalled and won .
But that was then .
The conservative tide was still flowing strong .
It ’s ebbing now , although many Congressional Democrats have n’t figured that out yet .
And Kristol acknowledges the new landscape : he tries the hilarious dodge of suggesting that Republicans kill this year ’s effort and support reform next year :
So this is not the time to let them off the ropes .
This is the week to highlight every problem , every terrible provision , in the Democratic bills : from taxes and spending to government control and rationing to federal funding for abortion and government - required death - with - dignity counseling sessions for the elderly .
Throw the kitchen sink at the legislation now on the table , drive a stake through its heart ( I apologize for the mixed metaphors ) , and kill it .
Then opponents can say , of course we do want to pass sensible health reform .
But to do so , we need to start over .
Yeah right .
Meanwhile , EJ Dionne has an antidote to Kristol ’s poison pill , with this about the coming Obama health care surge .
There are problems with the Democrats ’ approach to health care .
It places too much of a burden on employers .
The House bill is quite deficient when it comes to changing the incentives for doctors and hospitals ( which is the only real hope for controlling costs ) .
But the Republicans have absolutely no credibility on this issue .
Indeed , they have spent 30 years allowing the current system to deteriorate or actively making it worse ( caving to Pharma on the Medicare drug plan , for example ) .
This is the moment for the Democrats to demonstrate that they can lead and legislate .
If they ca n’t bring this off , they will –rightly –be back in electoral trouble before long .
I ’ve started deleting them as spam .
I ’m not talking about the enlarge - your - penis emails or “ You ’ve Won the Lottery ” notices .
I ’m talking about the increasingly - urgent emails coming for weeks from liberal Netroots groups calling for a “ public option ” for healthcare – a government insurance plan citizens could choose to PAY FOR instead of private insurance .
Never has so much passion been so misdirected .
If what these liberal groups ultimately wanted out of President Obama and corporate - funded Democrats in Congress was a topnotch public plan to compete with the first - rate private plans , the wrong way to get it was to make that THE demand .
Especially of a President whose instinct is toward conciliation and splitting the difference with big business and the rightwing .
Sure , Obama was a community organizer once .
That was decades ago when Russia was still our mortal enemy , Nelson Mandela was still an official State Department terrorist threat and the White House was still funding Islamist fanatics in Afghanistan .
For the last dozen years Obama has been a politician – and a consummate compromiser at that .
Have we failed to notice ?
Activists must recognize the surest way to get a strong public option that could compete with the Cadillac of health plans .
We needed to mobilize millions of Netroots people , almost every union and 150 members of Congress to endorse a maximum demand : National health insurance . . . enhanced Medicare for All .
In other words , a cost - effective single - payer system of publicly - financed , privately - delivered healthcare that ends private health insurance ( and its waste , bureaucracy , ads , sales commissions , lavish executive salaries , profiteering ) .
Had liberal groups sent out millions of emails building a movement that posed an existential threat to the health insurance industry , Sen. Baucus and Blue Dog Democrats and their corporate healthcare patrons might well be on their knees begging for a comprehensive public option – to avert the threat of full - blown Medicare for All .
As things stand now , as writers like Bob Kuttner and Norman Solomon have warned , a weak public option would institutionalize a two - tiered system with healthier , wealthier citizens getting the best ( private ) plans , and sicker , harder - to - treat people getting an inferior ( public ) plan .
Newt Gingrich could n’t dream up a better scenario to discredit an enhanced government role in healthcare .
To win serous reforms , we need activist leaders who are tough - minded progressives making maximum demands for reforms that truly address our nation ’s problems .
Leave the inside - the - Beltway deal - making to the politicians , properly frightened and moved by the roar of mass movements .
We need activist leaders who have a clearer idea of who Obama is .
He ’s not one of us .
He ’s one of them – a politician bent on placating corporate interests .
We knew all we needed to know about his current worldview from all the corporatists he put in top jobs .
And from the fact that he felt the need – six weeks into his administration , after the middle - class bailed out Wall Street – to call up the New York Times and assure the world that his policies were NOT socialist but were “ entirely consistent with free market principles . ”
At a time the corporate greedsters and free - market ideologues had been exposed as having threatened the economic well - being of the world , they were n’t the ones on the defensive .
They were n’t doing the apologizing .
Obama was on the defensive ; he was apologizing to them !
When Democratic leaders start borrowing rightwing rhetoric , we know our activism has not been strong or progressive enough .
At the AARP townhall Tuesday , Obama described a public option as “ controversial , I understand people are worried about that . ”
He went on to assure his audience that “ nobody is talking about . . . government - run healthcare ” or “ a Canadian - style plan . ”
At one point , he further assured seniors that no “ bureaucratic law in Washington ” would interfere in their healthcare decisions – seeming to adopt the faux - populism of anti-government rightists .
Yet he seems incapable of anti-corporate populism , even with despised industries like Wall Street and health insurance .

I have huge respect for the smart young activists who built up the Netroots , unleashing all sorts of progressive possibilities for our country .
But I ’m bothered by their often ineffectual , Beltway - originated , halfway demands .
I became active during the Vietnam War .
We might still have troops in Vietnam if – instead of militantly demanding “ All Troops Home Now ” – we ’d organized behind polite Beltway initiatives like : “ Let ’s begin negotiations ” or “ Let ’s set a timeline for phased withdrawal . ”
I fear that Netroots leaders are doing the same dance with Obama today that they did with Nancy Pelosi and Harry Reid in 2007 - 08 .
Instead of demanding that Democrats in Congress bring our troops home from Iraq by using the power of the purse to defund the war , Netroots leaders rallied behind weak , non-binding timelines and other halfway measures cooked up with Congressional leaders .
Without a loud , clear demand for “ troops home ” from the large online antiwar forces , Democratic leaders started retreating and succumbing to Republican rhetoric .
Reid proclaimed : “ We will never abandon our troops in a time of war . ”
Pelosi declared : “ We will have legislation to fund the troops ! "
And the corpses kept piling up .
Great social reforms have occurred in our country not when social movements took their lead from what the White House deemed possible , but when the White House was pushed by powerful movements demanding reforms bolder than what the president was comfortable with .
Leading abolitionists pushed Lincoln toward ending slavery by demanding immediate abolition .
Socialist and workers movements in the ’30s sufficiently scared elites so that FDR could pass New Deal reforms far short of socialism .
Martin Luther King and civil rights activists continuously pushed and prodded JFK and later LBJ .
And these movements did n’t have the Internet .
In 1993 , a National Health Insurance bill gained 100 co-sponsors in the Democrat - led House , plus endorsements from many unions , even Consumers Union .
There was unfortunately no Internet then when the Clinton White House undermined this growing movement by pushing an incredibly complex plan that left big insurers dominating the system .
Clinton ’s plan inspired few and confused many .
After it went down in flames , talk radio host Jim Hightower asked President Clinton why he did n’t back an easily - explained Medicare for All approach that had so much support in Congress .
Clinton said he ’d thought it was politically too difficult but now wondered about that judgment .
Here we are 16 years later .
Neglected by Netroots groups , John Conyers today has 85 House co-sponsors for HR 676 , the Expanded Medicare for All Act , as well as the endorsement of many unions and Obama ’s longtime personal physician .
If all those emails I ’ve received lately had been about building the HR 676 movement and a public system instead of a “ public option , ” the bill would have many more co-sponsors and could be pressuring Democrats to stand tough today .
For Obama to feel secure about reform and standing up to the right , he needs to feel that he ’s in the center pushed by noisy forces to his left .
He ’s admitted as much .
The way to help him succeed is to mobilize seriously to his left .
The way to help Obama fail is for Netroots and liberal groups to collapse toward him from the get - go .
And if Obama does fail , we can quit laughing at a Republican Party in disarray due to Bush , religious extremism , hypocrisy and anti-intellectualism .
Because in this period of crisis and fear , unless a progressively - prodded White House delivers reforms that actually improve lives soon , rightwing reaction could rebound more dangerous than ever in 2010 and / or 2012 .
Panelists on CNN ’s Reliable Sources agreed that Bill O’Reilly does n’t share the blame in the murder of Dr. George Tiller .
“ I think it ’s unfair to demonize O’Reilly in this matter , but at the same time , I wish he had denounced the murder of Tiller more forcefully , ” said host Howard Kurtz .
O’Reilly brought up Tiller in at least 28 episodes of his show on the Fox News Channel .
O’Reilly repeatedly referred to the doctor as “ Tiller the Baby Killer . ”

The Stolen Child .
Where dips the rocky highland
Of Sleuth Wood in the lake ,
There lies a leafy island
Where flapping herons wake
The drowsy water - rats ;
There we 've hid our faery vats ,
Full of berries
And of reddest stolen cherries .
Come away , O human child !
To the waters and the wild
With a faery , hand in hand ,
For the world 's more full of weeping than you
can understand .
Where the wave of moonlight glosses
The dim grey sands with light ,
Far off by furthest Rosses
We foot it all the night ,
Weaving olden dances ,
Mingling hands and mingling glances
Till the moon has taken flight ;
To and fro we leap
And chase the frothy bubbles ,
While the world is full of troubles
And is anxious in its sleep .
Come away , O human child !
To the waters and the wild
With a faery , hand in hand ,
For the world 's more full of weeping than you
can understand .
Where the wandering water gushes
From the hills above Glen - Car , .
In pools among the rushes
That scarce could bathe a star ,
We seek for slumbering trout
And whispering in their ears
Give them unquiet dreams ;
Leaning softly out
From ferns that drop their tears
Over the young streams .
Come away , O human child !
To the waters and the wild
With a faery , hand in hand ,
For the world 's more full of weeping than you
can understand .
Away with us he 's going ,
The solemn - eyed :
He 'll hear no more the lowing
Of the calves on the warm hillside
Or the kettle on the hob
Sing peace into his breast ,
Or see the brown mice bob
Round and round the oatmeal - chest .
For he comes , the human child ,
To the waters and the wild
With a faery , hand in hand ,
From a world more full of weeping than he
can understand .
More than 150 firefighters are battling a brush fire that broke out around 1 p.m. in the Sepulveda Pass near Getty Center , which has been evacuated .
Mount St. Mary 's College in Brentwood was also evacuated .
Los Angeles Fire Department spokesman Erik Scott said the fire has burned more than 10 acres and is moving north .
The fire was jamming traffic on the nearby 405 Freeway .
Scott said no structures are immediately threatened at this time .
Four water - dropping helicopters are fighting the fire , which was reported at 1200 Getty Center Drive .
This is the same general area where a large brush fire burned through last year , forcing the closure of the 405 Freeway .
That fire brought a huge fire department response , and no structures were damaged .
[ Updated at 2 p.m. : Ron Hartwig , vice president of communications , says they are evacuating employees and visitors from the Getty Center .
Visitors are taking the tram to get their cars , then they are driving up the hill to the South Gate , to keep the main entrance clear .
It ’s just a precaution , he says .
The fire is on the hillside west of the entrance .
At Mount St. Mary's , no classes were in session , but 200 people renting out facilities there are being removed .
About 100 staffers were also taken out . ]
[ Updated at 3 p.m. : The Getty Center is closed for the day .
Officials said it could reopen Thursday if the fire is extinguished . ]

Ask them at the right time of day and most ravers will tell you they 'd rather not be criminals .
Some of them might feel compelled to take ecstasy , which remains a Class A drug in Britain , by the illegality that accompanies it .
But most – and this is especially true of regular and recreational users – think it absurd that their pursuit of pleasure be deemed illegal .
In their view , the harm associated with it mostly affects those who " drop " the pills themselves , and is therefore not the business of Government .
In this regard , most users of ecstasy inhabit a tradition whose pioneers include Keith Richards .
" I 've never had a problem with drugs , " the Rolling Stone said .
" I 've had problems with the police . "
And it 's precisely the ubiquity of this view that has caused a relatively new pharmaceutical industry to blossom .
You do n't have to be a member of the flower power generation to see that " legal highs " might carry the whiff of oxymoron .
The term refers to a commonly available breed of drug that replicates the effects of ecstasy but carries none of its criminality .

At least not for now .
Before leaving the post of Home Secretary , Jacqui Smith said last month that she was considering taking the prefix out of " legal highs " , and just sticking with the " high " bit .
" It 's absolutely right that we continue to adapt our drug policy to the changing environment of substance misuse , " Smith said , following the death of a Sussex University medical student named Hester Stewart .
The 21 - year - old 's body was found near a container of GBL , a " legal high " also known as paint stripper .
Smith did n't have time to implement the plans , but they sit close to the top of her successor Alan Johnson 's in - tray .
These " legal highs " are distinguished from ecstasy by their content rather than their effects .
Ecstasy , which generally comes in the form of pills – also known as " disco biscuits " , " beans " , or " party poppers " – is essentially made of methylenedioxymethamphetamine , or MDMA for short ( hence the nickname " Mandy " , sister of cocaine " Charlie " ) .
Users of ecstasy generally prefer to swallow MDMA in its purer form , as a crushed - up pink or brown crystal , rather than in pills bought from dealers , where other alien powders such as bicarbonate of soda ( which helps cakes to get high , but not humans ) might be added .
In this sense , the commonly consumed form of ecstasy can be thought of as MDMA plus any junk the dealer wants to throw in .
The more junk there is , the better his margins and the worse the pill .
The drug causes the release of serotonin , a neurotransmitter , and stimulates feelings of intimacy and ecstasy , while reducing inhibitions .
It also stimulates the release of dopamine and noradrenaline , also neurotransmitters , and oxytocin , the so - called love hormone associated with orgasm and childbirth .
By making the heart beat faster , ecstasy pills cause users to experience a period when they are " coming up " , feeling a surge .
Once the effects have fully kicked in , they attain a sensation described in common parlance as " rushing " or " buzzing " .
" Legal highs " do much the same thing .
There are two common forms , both of which Jacqui Smith had within her sights .
The first is GBL ( gamma - butyrolactone ) , an industrial solvent also used as a paint stripper ( seriously ) and sometimes confusingly referred to as liquid ecstasy – which is misleading , because there are types of liquid ecstasy that are in fact illegal .
It is a fast - acting drug with vaguely hypnotic and euphoric effects that are accentuated when mixed with alcohol .
The second major type of legal high is BZP ( benzylpiperazine , sometimes called " Benny " ) , whose effects on the brain are very similar to MDMA .
BZP began life as a worming treatment for cattle , but the likeness between it and ecstasy has led to a surge in popularity .
A recent report for the European monitoring centre for drugs and drug addiction highlighted several side effects – stomach pains lasting 24 hours , headaches , nausea , vomiting – but received very limited media coverage in Britain .
A few years ago a craze began for another type of legal high , piperazines , which are from the same class as Viagra but have similar effects to ecstasy .
But those drugs , marketed as PEP pills , have faded in popularity .
Purely in order to serve the interests of these pages , your correspondent was convinced to purchase and consume two " legal highs " .
This he did on the River Cam in Cambridge two weekends ago , a ripe location if ever there was one for such indulgence .
The pills can be procured from , among others , shivaheadshop.co.uk .
The website advertises bongs , vaporizers , pipes , chillums – and legal highs and incense .
Within the final category there is a huge range , including herbal blends , incense sticks , Koru energy strips , natural herbal remedies , snow blow , party pills , Jungle High energy pills , and Happy Caps .
This newspaper obtained some Blessed party pills ( four of them at £ 12.99 ) and a box of Happy Caps ( five at £ 5.99 ) .
Together with shipping costs of £ 2.45 , the pills arrive in three days at a total cost of £ 21.43 .
You can pay by card , which is not a method of reimbursement your average dealer is familiar with .
Most dealers will charge between £ 3 and £ 4 for a pill , so though the Happy Caps represent very good value , the Blessed party pills are about an average price .
The Blessed pills do n't achieve the aim promised on their package – " seeing the light " – because within 20 minutes of consuming one on a full stomach your vision begins to blur .
At first , this happens slowly and gradually , and then much faster .
It 's not a case of losing your sight altogether – people are still distinguishable – but there is certainly a generalised haziness .
With it comes an overwhelming sense of happiness , together with a strong affection for those in your company .
This mellow buzz lasts , on one pill , for around three and a half hours , peaking during the second hour .
Even after the buzz has gone , it takes a few hours of sleep before you return to a proper sense of sobriety .
The effect of the Happy Cap pills is milder ( as the price would make you expect ) and there seemed a stronger short - term memory loss .
The buzz lasts for an hour or so less than with the Blessed , but there is basically the same all - pervading sense of excitement and jollity .
It would be remiss not to mention a slight come - down the following morning , when the serotonin levels in the brain are grasping their way back to normal .
Regular users become accustomed to this , knowing it will go away , but to new users they can be a nasty shock .
Why this is experience is legal , while consumption of MDMA is not , cannot be comprehended without abandoning rationality .
The former Home Secretary might have a point about consistency .
No figures exist for how many " legal highs " are taken each weekend , but police now consider them a growing concern .
The true extent of ecstasy consumption is only now becoming clear .
It was helped 18 months ago by the curious tale of Mr A , a patient formerly under the care of the addiction centre at St George 's medical school in Tooting , south London .
Between the ages of 21 and 30 , this chap consumed 40,000 ecstasy pills .
He started with five over a weekend , migrated to 100 each month , and finished with 25 a day , a habit he sustained over four years .
Doctors were not surprised to discover a causal link between this behaviour and the hallucinations , paranoia , muscle rigidity and short - term memory loss that this man endured .
But when Richard Brunstrom , the Chief Constable of North Wales Police , had the audacity to claim that ecstasy was a " remarkably safe drug " ( try taking 25 ibuprofen a day for that long – actually , do n't ) , he was lambasted as a dangerous naïf .
Similarly , a distinguished government drugs adviser , Professor David Nutt , whipped up a media storm when he said in a journal article that taking ecstasy was safer than riding a horse .
Why would these public figures say such things ?
Figures from 2003 ( among the latest available ) estimated there are 730,000 users of ecstasy in the UK , taking between 500,000 and two million pills each weekend .
Since 1994 there have been approximately 400 deaths involving ecstasy – including , of course , that of Leah Betts in 1995 .
But around a hundred people die each year from adverse reactions to , or overdoses of , aspirin and paracetamol .
It has long been a staple of the case made by those in favour of legalising ecstasy that its use is so widespread as to make the law an ass .
The advent of " legal highs " , and their booming availability , now proves that point indubitably .
Party drugs :
What 's allowed
* Although GBL , an industrial solvent , can be bought legally , the body converts it into GHB , a common " date rape " drug , which is banned in the UK as a Class C substance .
* BZP or " Benny " originated as a worming treatment for cattle .
Its effects are similar to those of ecstasy , a Class A drug .
* Other legal highs include Blessed party pills and Happy Caps , containing ingredients such as caffeine , kola nut , clary sage and geranium .
* Magic mushrooms , which have hallucinogenic qualities , were legal until 2005 , when they were reclassified as Class A ( except in their fresh form ) .
* Class A drugs include ecstasy , heroin , LSD , crack , magic mushrooms , cocaine and amphetamines .
* Possession of a Class A drug currently carries a sentence of up to seven years in prison or an unlimited fine .

Should drug laws be tightened to include legal highs ?
Or should rules on all drugs be relaxed ?

The initiative and referendum system is part of the American legal landscape in 24 states .
In these states , citizens may write initiatives to amend the state Constitution or propose new statutes , and in some cases repeal laws with referendums .
In the case of either an initiative or a referendum , the voting public decides on the outcome of the proposal during an election .
In each state which allows citizens to put initiatives on the ballot , the process is slightly different , but the basics remain the same .
Alaska is one state that allows residents to get an initiative on the ballot .
Currently , Nevada , California , Illinois , Oregon , Washington , Arizona , Idaho , Colorado , Montana , Maine , Massachusetts , Alaska , Florida , Nebraska , Oklahoma , North Dakota , South Dakota , Utah , Wyoming , Missouri , Mississippi , Arkansas , Michigan , and Ohio allow voters to submit initiatives to the state ballot .
Florida and Mississippi only allow amendments to the state constitution .
Three more states , New Mexico , Kentucky , and Maryland , permit popular referendums , but not initiatives .
Florida allows voters to submit initiatives to the state ballot .
The first step in getting an initiative on the ballot is writing the text of the proposed initiative .
Typically , a lawyer or team or lawyers performs this part of the task , to ensure that the text will be legal , clear , and enforceable .
After the text of the initiative is written , it is submitted to a state official for review .
This is usually the State Attorney General or the Secretary of State , and he or she writes an official title and summary for the initiative after reviewing it .
Voters can submit initiatives to the state ballot in Utah .
Once the initiative has been reviewed by the state , the group organizing it can start to gather signatures .
The number of signature needed depends on voter turnout in the last major election .
In most states , amendments to the state constitution require petition signatures by eight percent of the voters registered in the state , and new laws require between five and six percent .
The signatures must be valid , as many states check the signatures against a list of voters registered in the state .
Voters in Missouri can submit state ballot initiatives .
The state gives the group organizing the petition a deadline for filing .
If the group collects enough signatures in time , the initiative or referendum will be placed on the ballot , and voters can decide on it .
In the both cases , the paperwork must be completed and filed well before the election , to ensure that it will be included on the ballot .
An initiative can be suggested at any time , because it is a modification of the laws of the state .
Paperwork on a referendum , on the other hand , must be filed within 90 days of the passage of the law in question .
Voters cannot retroactively decide that they disapprove of the laws of their state , but they can act to strike down laws which they think are unconstitutional or unreasonable .

The Story Thing : BioWare 's David Gaider Speaks
By Chris Remo
Being the lead writer on a BioWare game seems to be one of the most intensive writing jobs in the industry -- the company 's mission , after all , is " to deliver the best story - driven games in the world . "
Funny , then , that BioWare 's David Gaider would go home from work on Dragon Age : Origins and gleefully write its prequel novel , Dragon Age : The Stolen Throne , which was just released this past March , ahead of the game 's debut .
Here , Gaider talks about the evolution of BioWare 's game making process since he joined the company in 1999 for 2000's Baldur 's Gate II through to today , as he moves into that same high fantasy territory with Dragon Age : Origins , which is due on Windows PC , PlayStation 3 , and Xbox 360 this October .
You worked on Baldur 's Gate II , so you 've been at BioWare for the better part of a decade .
David Gaider : Yeah , 10 years .
' Ninety - nine , I started .
How much has your role of game writer changed in that time ?
DG : I did n't start as a senior writer per se , although back when I started there were only 60 or 70 people working at BioWare in total .
We 've specialized a lot more since then .
Back then , I did a lot more scripting of my own dialogue , and I was involved a lot more in the design side .
I still do have a lot of input on those things , because design at BioWare [ is comprised of ] technical designers and cinematic designers and level designers -- everybody is grouped into specialties , so it gives us more time to work on our own specialty .
The role has changed a little bit .
What was your background before BioWare ?
Did you have a writing background ?
Obviously now you 've written this whole Dragon Age novel .
DG : [ laughs ]
I have a weird " getting into the industry " story , because it was accidental .
Prior to that , I was in the service industry .
I managed a hotel .
I was an enthusiast .
BioWare at the time had just finished Baldur 's Gate 1 , and [ longtime BioWare designer ]
James Ohlen was going around to other people at BioWare and saying , " If you know anyone who has some interest in writing and design and who has written something game - related to completion , please let us know . "
I had a friend who worked at BioWare , and I had n't even heard of BioWare .
I had n't played Baldur 's Gate at that time .
But I had this play - by - mail RPG running on the side , just a little thing I was doing for some friends .
I had written a rule book for it to completion -- a printed book .
My friend Calvin gave it to James Ohlen -- and I did n't even know he 'd done it .
So I got this phone call in my office at the hotel , saying , " We 'd like to interview you . "
I 'm like , " Who are you ?
And why are you interviewing me ?
For what ? "
So I went in , and it was interesting , but it was an entry - level position for half the money I was making at the hotel , and I thought the whole BioWare thing seemed a little fly - by - night .
I was like , " I 'm not sure I want to leave my hotel job for some game developer ...
I 'm just going to be out of a job in six months or something , right ? "
So I said , " Thanks , but no thanks . "
I went back to my hotel on Monday , and my boss from Mississauga was there in my office , surprisingly .
He was there to inform me that the management company that ran several hotels had been taken over , and the new company had their own managers .
When a hotel is bought out , normally the general manager is let go .
And because I could potentially ransack my client list or whatever , they walk you off the property .
I was shocked , but as I 'm walking out of the door with my little box of stuff from my desk , I 'm thinking , " You know , maybe that BioWare thing is n't so bad after all . "
So , you called them back .
[ laughs ]
DG : I called them back , and they said , " Yeah , let 's do it . "
I think at that point , James wanted to try me out and see how it'd work .
When it comes to writing , you never know what kind of background will actually work .
We 've hired writers who wrote prose books and were completely unable to sort of wrap their head around some elements .
The interactive aspect of game writing ?
DG : The interactive nature .
If you had picked one particular path of the dialogue -- the one that they had in mind -- it sounded great .
As soon as you went off that path , it would fall apart .
And then you 'd have people with degrees who had no experience whatsoever .
It 's weird -- one of the best recommendations for writing seems to be people who as a hobby do a lot of game mastering of tabletop games .
They naturally wrap their brain around the interactivity part of that .
Who knew ?
Even just beyond just having interactivity , there 's also of course a very strong tabletop RPG influence in BioWare 's games , down to specific rulesets and so on .
Dragon
Age is still in that vein .
DG : Every BioWare game gets compared to the last one that comes out .
And there 's potential that when Dragon Age comes out , it will get compared a little bit to Mass Effect .
But I hope that the people who do that keep in mind that we 're going for something that 's a little different here .
Mass Effect is great -- it 's more cinematic -- whereas with Dragon
Age , we 're definitely going to something that 's a little more traditional .
There 's nothing wrong with traditional .
We 're looking at our Baldur 's Gate roots .
I know they whip that out in the marketing a lot , but Baldur 's Gate II was my first game .
I think nothing compares to your first .
For me , it was this wonderful experience where we were working with a tried and true engine , which is a great place to be because you can start creating content and test it right from the beginning .
We have n't really been in that situation since .
Mass Effect 2 is there now , which is good for the team .
Hopefully , for Dragon
Age , we 'll get there , too .
But [ with Baldur 's Gate II ] we were in this great place where we could just generate content and be a little bit experimental in terms of what we tried .
We tried romances -- we just said , " Can we do that ? "
Or , " I like working on this Drow setting .
I 'd like to try this . "
It was very permissive , allowing the writers and designers to have ownership over what they were working on .
The idea was that a lot of the story was told through your followers , the ones you had in your party .
BioWare 's Baldur 's Gate II : Shadows of Amn
That party - based dynamic is something for which I think Baldur 's Gate II still serves as a benchmark in a lot of ways .
DG : Yeah .
Well , to this day , there are people who still talk about the followers .
And we have n't really done a proper party since .
When you only have two followers , there 's a limited possibility of banter .
Here , we have three , which allows a bit of exchange .
For me , writing that banter is some of my favorite parts -- back in Baldur 's Gate II , they 'd talk to each other and tease each other and develop their own relationships .
I think for a player , that 's great .
From a writing perspective , when you have these followers , and you get a different range of their own morality and their own agendas , you get to use them almost as a cipher through which the story is told , because we 've taken away the morality bar .
KOTOR had of course the Light Side and Dark Side meter .
D&D games , of course , have alignments .
And as soon as you attach a gameplay element to that , you need to put it into the gameplay and the writing .
You need quests that have a very sharply delineated good option and evil option .
Taking that away allowed us to have different options for the quests and the dialogue , but we do n't need to always have " evil " and " good . "
We are allowed to put in options that are just logical .
They can be very different .
You can think there 's a good reason to do all of them .
They can be a little in the gray area .
It 's an interesting choice , because there 's still a morality reflected in your choices to an extent , it 's just a spectrum of different moral outlooks , because your party members have their own individual judgments of your actions , and reactions to them , rather than there being one objective " good versus evil " meter .
It seems like it will be harder to try and toe the morality line , so to speak .
DG : It 's about forcing the player to that point where they 're no longer gaming the dialogue and the quests in terms of trying to get their meter to one side or the other .
They start thinking instead , " What are the consequences for my choice ?
What are my followers going to think ?
How is that going to affect my reputation in the world ? "
Sometimes , it 's just a matter of the player .
They wo n't know how much of an effect there is , always .
Or there 's a follower who says , " I do n't like this " -- obviously , if you do that thing , they 're not going to appreciate it very much .
But sometimes , that 's something that nobody else will even know about .
The player will have to decide based on the emotional reaction .
We 're maybe not always going to get to that point , but sometimes that 's all [ a choice is ] there for .
And if you get the player away from a mindset that they need to game it , and instead get them to go for emotional moments , taking a look at how this affects the people that they care about in the game , I think that allows us mature storytelling .
I think that 's what we 're talking about .
Battlestar Galactica is a very different genre , but I think what really impressed upon me as a writer was that this was a character drama that just happened to be science fiction .
Obviously Dragon
Age is epic fantasy , and there is a horde of evil that is affecting the world , but if the entire story was just you needing to fight that evil , that would not be mature storytelling .
What we have is a tale that is being told in the context of this event occurring , but there 's more to it .
There 's a political drama that is going on .
There is a human element -- you have these followers that have these big stories of their own .
I think that is more what players care about .
They want to actually come for the story .
It 's very legitimate that some people will come just for the combat , the visuals , or what have you , but for our core fan base the story is what they 're going to come for .
BioWare 's Dragon Age : Origins
So was the novel part of your job ?
Did you do it during work hours ?
David Gaider : No .
We were talking about the possibility of doing the novel early on , and it was n't like they decided , " We 're doing a prequel for Mass Effect .
We 're doing a prequel for Dragon Age . "
The fact that both of them have [ book - based ] prequels was completely incidental .
I actually did n't know what Mass Effect was doing .
Drew [ Karpyshyn ] was just very interested in going into the more David Anderson character [ protagonist of Mass Effect : Revelation ] because he 's mentioned during the game .
It sort of ended up the same thing .
We were identifying what we could do with the Dragon Age story .
We decided to put it in the Blight tale , because when I made the setting , I seeded various possible stories in parts of the world -- we did n't know at first where we wanted to put this first story [ of Dragon Age : Origins ] .
Eventually we decided , " Okay , it 's in Ferelden . "
There 's this event in history that got mentioned a lot [ in the game ] , the rebellion of Ferelden against their allegiance with this empire .
When we were talking about what we were doing , we thought , " Would n't it be cool if we could tell this story ? "
For a while , we actually tried to put it into the game itself .
As someone who has had to recently switch back and forth between writing prose for a novel , and writing interactive fiction for a game , what are some of the biggest differences from your perspective ?
DG : Well , when you write the book , you have access to certain things that you do n't read in the game .
You peek inside the protagonist 's head .
It 's also a set protagonist .
I know exactly what his motivations are .
You can switch characters .
You can set up scenes .
It 's a unique experience .
Having worked mainly in the interactive part for ten years , it was a bit novel to be able to do that .
It actually was n't as hard as I thought it was going to be .
I did n't work on the book at BioWare .
I had my BioWare job , and then the publisher asked BioWare , " Do you have anybody in mind who might be able to write it ? " because Drew had written the Mass Effect novels .
BioWare came to me and said , " Maybe you 'd like to do it . "
The benefit of having someone like me write the book was that there 's no need to catch me up on the world .
I know exactly what a Dragon Age story is supposed to sound like .
So what writer in existence does n't think , " Maybe I can write a book sometime , " or at least plunk away at something once in a while ?
I had n't for the longest time because so much of my creative energy was taken up by work .
But this was an opportunity .
They hooked me up with Tor [ Books ] , and we had ideas go back and forth .
So then I would come to work .
For a while , when we were in crunch , I 'd work until nine or so at night , rush home , and then by 9:15 I 'd be on my computer writing .
For someone who reads it , they 'll get some additional context to what some of the characters do without having anything spoiled , so I thought the prequel setting was a good period to do .
I certainly did n't want to take the game story and retell it in book form .
What 's the point ?
It was interesting .
With a book , and I imagine with a film as well , the writer is the creator .
BioWare is good because they value the writing process , and not all of the companies do , but I 'm never going to be the sole creator of a game .
There are different mistresses that need to be served .
There 's gameplay , there 's art , there are technological limitations .
But the refreshing part of writing a book was that as the writer , I was the sole creator .
I molded everything .
It was different enough that I did n't feel like I was just working all day , and then going home and doing the same thing .
It did n't feel that way at all .
They were very different endeavors .
This seems like the first thing BioWare has made in several years that has that really traditional BioWare feeling in terms of its setting and subject matter .
With those intervening years , how does it feel to be getting back to that ?
And are there new things that you have to keep in mind when making that game in 2009 ?
DG : There 's the obvious 2D to 3D difference .
The 2D levels we were able to make back in the 2D days were like paintings .
Part of me wishes we could go back to that .
I do n't know how much of a market there would be , but I would think there would be something .
I always found that very beautiful and evocative .
However , we 're quickly reaching that place with the 3D games as well .
We have access to facial animations , expressions , body animations .
We no longer have to tell a story through words only .
That can be done well -- [ Black Isle's ]
Planescape : Torment is an example of a game that was told primarily through words , but maybe it was n't entirely accessible to everyone because not everybody can deal with this wall of text , which is very sad .
I wish there were more willingness to do that .
But now we no longer need to do that .
There was a transition period where we had 3D art , but not the ability to be emotionally evocative with it .
With Mass Effect , we were feeling our way out a little bit with the ability to use facial expressions .
I 'm trying to deal with this as a writer .
I worked on Baldur 's Gate II as my first game , becoming used to telling stories through words primarily .
Normally , you 'd have to write something like , " I am very angry . "
Now , you can have him look mad .
I may not need him to speak at all .
We 've started to get to this point where when it comes to storytelling , it 's not a solo endeavor for a writer anymore .
We 're starting to do this thing where we sit down with , say , a tech designer and an animator .
There are people in each of these fields who are story - oriented .
There are always going to be some who just want to be told what to do , and that 's fine , but there are some who are very creative .
Andrew Farrell is one of the artists we have at BioWare ; he 's very creative and very story - oriented .
I love that we 're at a place where I can sit down with a guy like Andrew and bounce ideas off him .
He looks at it from a slightly different perspective .
He says , " How can I help you tell this story through art ? "
Then I 'll have a cinematic designer .
He 'll say , " These are the libraries of animations and facial expressions I have .
How can I help tell this part of the tale through gestures and interaction ? "
It 's neat when we bounce up against each other , and I 'm thinking , " Really , can we do that ?
Is that possible ? " and they say , " That 's totally possible . "
That 's a neat place to be .
It 's like I was saying earlier about Baldur 's Gate II , where our 2D engine had reached its epitome , and we knew what we could do with it , so we had room to be creatively experimental .
I think we 're reaching that point with 3D games as well .
There are a number of RPG hardcore enthusiasts who I think have been a little embittered from the step away from the traditional style of games .
We 're still trying to remain accessible to a larger audience , but some of them will just never appreciate it .
You can't help that .
But I think they can be pleased to see that we 're getting to a point now once again where we have the ability to focus more on storytelling and experimentation .
I think we 'll see more and more of that as time goes on , and I think it has some really excellent potential .
But not every company is going to do it .
Fortunately , like I said , BioWare values the writing process a little more .
So , if we continue to do that , I think we can see better and better things .
At least for a while , I guess -- until the next piece of big technology comes along .

THE virtuous are often said to be as “ pure as the driven snow ” while villains are frequently described as having hearts of coal or blackened souls .
And the metaphor is made flesh ( or , at least cloth ) in many plays and films where the baddy wears black and the goody white .
But how deep does the metaphor actually run , psychologically speaking ?
That is the question which was asked by Gary Sherman and Gerald Clore of the University of Virginia .
They were pondering a well - known tendency , called the “ Macbeth effect ” , for people to want to clean themselves physically if they have acted unethically or even had thoughts of corrupt behaviour .
( The name comes from the scene in Shakespeare 's play in which Lady Macbeth desperately tries to wash phantom bloodstains from her hands after encouraging her husband to murder the king . )
This association of cleanliness with moral probity is further bound up with the now well - established link between moral disgust ( eg , at unusual sexual practices ) and physical disgust ( eg , at handling dirty objects or eating polluted food ) .
The researchers ' ponderings led them to wonder if the moral roles of black , which is roughly the colour of dirt , and white , which shows up the dirt so well , were connected with the Macbeth effect .
To explore this , they devised an experiment involving 27 Caucasian , six Asian , three African - American and two Hispanic students at the university .
The students were all asked to state the colour of words that they were presented with as quickly as they could .
Such a technique is not new .
Psychologists have long known that if people are presented with , say , the word “ blue ” printed in a blue font , they will be able to state the colour of the font much faster than if the word “ red ” is printed in the same blue font .
The study conducted by Mr Sherman and Dr Clore presented words of moral goodness , like “ virtuous ” and “ honesty ” , and of badness , like “ cheat ” and “ sin ” , in either black or white fonts on a computer screen .
As they report in Psychological Science , the two researchers found that when “ good ” words were presented in black it took the participants about 510 milliseconds to state the colour of the word .
When these same words were presented in white it took roughly 480 milliseconds — a significant difference .
A similar effect was seen with “ bad ” words .
Responding to white ones took around 525 milliseconds , whereas black ones needed only about 500 .
These results are remarkably similar to those found when words are printed in colours that clash with their meaning .
Besides illuminating an interesting corner of the Macbeth effect , Mr Sherman and Dr Clore suggest that their findings may have implications for understanding racial prejudice .
Given that their work hints that blackness and immorality are psychologically connected , and that the labels “ black ” and “ white ” are often applied to race , dark skin might thus easily be associated with immorality and impurity .
Because most of the study group were white , and only three black , there is no way of detecting from the original data whether black people react in the same way as others , and thus whether the link between colour and disgust is independent of race .
As a result , the two researchers are now conducting a follow - up study to look for racial differences .
That study is not yet complete but , according to Mr Sherman , “ initial results are suggesting that this effect is not confined to Caucasians ” .
Perhaps , then , one reason that so many black Americans get a bad rap is not just that their skin colour differs from that of the majority , but that their psychology , being the same as everybody else 's , does not .

Thousands of demonstrators shouting " Free Iran " thronged San Francisco 's Civic Center Plaza Saturday to show solidarity with Iranian protesters who have taken to the streets of Tehran for weeks to dispute the June 12 presidential election there .
" A turning point has been made , " city Supervisor Ross Mirkarimi , the first Iranian American elected to office in San Francisco , told the crowd .
" This day is historic . "
Mirkarimi , a main rally organizer , said the gathering and dozens like it around the globe Saturday marked the rise of a citizen diplomacy movement he compared to those that helped end the Cold War .
The rally is part of a global effort sparked by Firuzeh Mahmoudi , an Iranian American mother in Berkeley whose organizing through traditional channels and social networking sites fueled demonstrations in more than 105 cities from Amsterdam to Tokyo .
Mahmoudi , an environmental consultant on leave from United Nations work , said she was moved to act after watching online videos of Iranian supreme leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei 's violent crackdown on supporters of opposition candidate Mir Hossein Mousavi .
One showed an unknown woman reciting a poem from a rooftop , calling to God for help .
" I just want that woman to know she 's not alone , " Mahmoudi said .
" Seeing people , innocent people , being killed and beaten in broad daylight , one can only imagine what goes on behind prison walls . "
Mirkarimi had already been organizing a San Francisco rally in support of democracy in Iran , and then melded it with the global day of action Mahmoudi sparked .
The crowd , with a cross section of ethnicities , ranged from infants in strollers to grandmothers waving pre-Islamic Revolution Iranian flags .
The gathering filled the center promenade of the plaza between two rows of trees a block long and spilled out onto the grass on either side , where children frolicked .
It was studded with people in green shirts and armbands - the color of the Iranian opposition .
One sign depicted President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad , the disputed winner of the election , as Adolf Hitler .
Organizers estimated the crowd at 10,000 , which could not be confirmed .
State Attorney General Jerry Brown and a host of city leaders spoke .
Turaj Zaim , a 32 - year - old San Francisco poet and musician , fled Iran with his mother when he was 6 years old .
His father , Kourosh Zaim , an Iranian democracy advocate , was jailed after the recent election .
" International awareness , " Zaim said , " seems to be the only pressure that is working on this regime . "
Your laptop goes dead and you do n't understand why because it 's plugged in .
The very first thing you should look for is status LEDs .
The transformer brick or power adapter usually has a status led on it to show that it 's plugged into a good outlet and is functioning .
If the laptop power adapter LED is not lit and the cord is firmly seated in both the transformer and the wall outlet , then the AC adapter is probably bad .
But troubleshooting most power problems takes a little more effort .
Fortunately , it 's also common for the failure to be the power cord itself , as I 've noted with some Toshiba models .
Many HP and Compaq models use " L " connectors which are less prone to failure , and Sony and Dell cords seem more robust as well , but it 's always a possibility .
It seems to me I 've seen " L " connectors on IBM Thinkpads as well .
If the status LEDs on the laptop blink when you wiggle the power cord or if they can be kept on if you position the cord just right , the failure is either the power cord or the power connector inside the laptop .
Of the two , you want the problem to be the power cord because it 's much easier to fix .
A power cord can look perfectly good ( see above ) but be broken inside , normally as result of letting it dangle off the back of the laptop when you work on your lap .
The length of cable running from the power adapter to the laptop is shielded coaxial cable , with the inner conductor attached to the inner part of the barrel connector and the outer part serving as ground .
The actual AC power cord is often detachable from the power adapter and is unlikely to fail as long as it's seated .
Many power cords also include a large choke , probably a ferrite , which I assume is to prevent RF interference generated by the laptop from leaking back onto the cord and turning the length between the laptop and the power adapter into an antenna .
Frankly , I just cut them off on a repair if they are close too the barrel connector .
It 's nice to have a reasonable wire stripper so you can strip the coax in one shot rather than worrying away the sheathing with a cheap tool .
You want to take about an inch of the outer sheath off and then twist the braid shield together .
Some techs like to preload the braid with solder before tacking it to the power connector , but if there 's a tab you can wrap it around first it 's not really necessary .
I prefer to buy new connectors than to try to reuse the original for several reasons .
First , the original laptop power adapter will have a molded casing on the connector , and the only way to get it off is to hack away a little at a time with a razor .
I 've done it and effected a repair when I was traveling and had no other choice , but the braided conductor on my Toshiba notebook was soldered directly to the outside of the barrel rather than having its own solder point , like a replacement connector .
It 's also very difficult to solder factory connectors without melting the insulator unless you have a hot , fine tip iron .
I get my replacement connectors at Radio Shack for a buck or so , bring the original for sizing .
The inside and outside diameter have to be an exact match , so you might even want to bring your notebook to the store with you .
If you are working with the cord length still attached to the power adapter ( transformer ) , make sure you slide the shell for the new connector onto the cord and faced the right way before you solder on the connector .
Otherwise , you 'll be faced with doing it all over or just taping the heck out of the connector .
The length of the barrel connector that fits into the laptop body is somewhat flexible , too long can work , to short and you may be able to back - off a little on the connector shell .
To the left , you can see the inner ( yellow ) of the laptop power cord soldered to the center tab of the barrel conector , and the braid soldered to the outer tab .
If you have a heatshrink gun and tubing you can make a much neater job of it than I 'm doing here : -)
Obviously , you do n't want the two tabs to touch or it just shorts out , so you can work a little tape around one of the tabs if you are paranoid , but leave room to get the shell on .
The shell is actually threaded , as is the connector , so they usually hold together pretty good .
Since this particular failure gave me so much grief the first time it happened , I always travel with a spare replacement end for my laptop power cord .
While my first replacement is still holding up , should it fail , I can just undo the splice and tape the replacement end on in a matter of minutes .
It 's unfortunate that so many people buy a new laptop power adapter or even crack their laptop open and start fooling with the inside receptacle when the problem is just the connector on the power cord .
The economy has gone to pot .
With the nation ’s fiscal health in the tank , homegrown marijuana operations have soared by 60 percent .
Since Oct. 1 , the Drug Enforcement Administration has broken up eight hydroponic pot -growing set -ups around the state — with five in the Big Apple .
That compares with five for all of the previous fiscal year .
Growing marijuana hydroponically — in water — is a lucrative business , said John Gilbride , head of the DEA ’s New York office .
It is far more potent than the regular stuff — with a pound going for about $ 5,000 on the street .
A pound of grass smuggled in from Mexico goes for $ 400 to $ 1,500 .
Of the five “ grow ops ” smashed in the Apple , four were taken down in The Bronx last week .
There were no immediate arrests .
The fifth , in the basement of a house on 237th Street in Queens Village , Queens , was raided on Feb. 24 , and firefighter Patrick Murray , 34 , was charged with growing 100 plants .
A month later , firefighter Matthew Cody , 27 — who worked with Murray at Engine Co. 292 in Woodside — and Cody ’s brother , Michael , 25 , were busted .
A mother and her two sons , 14 and 2 , who lived in Murray ’s house were forced to move when the toddler developed a severe case of hives from the fertilizer used in the growing process .
“ He really got sick , ” said his teen brother .
“ It was really upsetting . ”
The five raids netted 830 pounds of pot worth $ 4.15 million on the street .

After years of starring in rap-music lyrics and videos , " bling " is losing its ring .
The recession is cramping the style of hip - hop artists and wannabes -- many of whom are finding it difficult to afford the diamond - encrusted pendants and heavy gold chains they have long used to project an aura of outsized wealth .
In an attempt to keep up appearances , celebrity jewelers say rappers are asking them to make medallions with less - precious stones and metals .
Some even whisper that the artists have begun requesting cubic zirconia , the synthetic diamond stand - in and QVC staple .
Hip - hop luminaries with the cash to keep it real are appalled .
Bling aficionados fret that the art of " ice " is being watered down .
New Orleans rapper Lil Wayne is often credited with coining the term ' bling ' to refer to outrageous jewelry .

Rapper 50 Cent has relished the chance to accuse his musical adversaries of not glittering like gold .
During a radio interview , the artist , whose real name is Curtis James Jackson III , taunted rapper Rick Ross for wearing faux and rented jewelry .
" Everything that you see has to absolutely be fake , " said Mr. Jackson .
Rick Ross , whose real name is William Leonard Roberts II , has denied the claims .
Mr. Jackson did n't return requests for comment .
" A lot of these rappers simply do n't have the money for real stuff anymore , " says Jason Arasheben , who crafts custom jewelry for wealthy clientele , including Saudi royals and Hollywood movie stars , at his California boutique called Jason of Beverly Hills .
" It 's to the point where they are wearing imitation jewelry , and that 's ridiculous . "
Mr. Arasheben designed the colossus of hip - hop jewels three years ago for rapper Lil Jon : an enormous gold necklace that spells out " CRUNK AIN'T DEAD " with 3,756 round - cut white diamonds ( Crunk is a southern rap subgenre that Lil Jon -- real name , Jonathan Mortimer Smith -- has struggled to keep alive ) .
The neck - straining piece , which weighs more than five pounds , was recognized in 2007 by Guinness World Records as the largest diamond pendant on Earth .
' Big , Chintzy Junk '
He also fashioned a pendant in the image of headphones bedecked in black and white diamonds a few years ago for rapper Biz Markie , whose whimsical jewelry hailed from a less self - conscious era in rap .
The rapper -- whose real name is Marcel Theo Hall -- says he is saddened to see newer rappers favor big , chintzy junk over smaller jewels that illuminate personality .
" When I was wearing a big rope , it was a symbol that I was one of the elite , " says Mr. Hall , whose 1990 hit " Just a Friend " is enjoying a renaissance on iTunes after being featured in a Heineken beer television ad .
" These kids think size matters , but they be lyin ' .
It just makes them look silly . "
Both Mr. Smith and Mr. Hall had planned to sell their pieces for charity last fall in an auction titled " Hip Hop 's Crown Jewels . "
But in a sign of bling 's fading shine , Phillips de Pury & Co. postponed the auction to March and then canceled it altogether due partly to insufficient interest from buyers .
From the dawn of rap music three decades ago , hip - hop artists have festooned themselves with gaudy ornaments to signify that they have risen above humble origins to become ghetto royalty .
English - American trailblazer Slick Rick sported a diamond - studded eye patch , portraying himself as the " Black Liberace , " while the three members of Queens , N.Y. - based Run-D.M.C. rocked gold rope chains that seemed thick enough to hold a real anchor .
To be sure , phony or inferior ice has been around as long as rappers ' traditional standard gear of two - turntables - and - a- microphone .
But with Internet piracy cutting into musicians ' record sales and the recession shrinking attendance for live shows , jewelers say the ersatz stuff has never been more widespread .
Rapper Lil Jon with his record pendant Getty Images
" Times are hard , ai n't nobody rocking it like that anymore , " says rapper and record executive Bryan " Birdman " Williams , who co-founded Cash Money Records in New Orleans in the early 1990s with his brother , Ronald " Slim " Williams .
The independent label has sold more than 45 million albums .
The founders of the record label claim that its most famous artist , Lil Wayne , coined the term " bling " during a recording session to give a sound to blinding opulence .
The word entered popular usage after the hit " Bling Bling " by then Cash Money artist B.G. and was added to the Oxford English Dictionary in 2003 .
' D - Quality Diamonds '
" People think these big pieces are blindin ' but they be like D - quality diamonds , and when you try and sell them you learn they ain't worth a thing , " says Slim Williams .
" You can't be doing it like we did it no more . "
In humid Houston , a Southern rap capital renowned as a mecca of ice , jeweler Johnny Dang says he is adapting to the changing climate by giving customers the less - expensive jewelry they want .
" The look is still big , it is still bling , but people are going with smaller diamonds and lower - karat gold , " trading down from 18 - and 14 - karat alloys to 12 k , which is only 50 % gold , or less , says Mr. Dang .
A Vietnamese immigrant , he started out at flea markets and now has a shop in the tony Galleria mall next to Neiman Marcus .
To survive , Mr. Dang is relying more often on machine - made versions of his jewelry that can cut the cost of a $ 10,000 handcrafted pendant in half .
Mr. Dang's " grillz " sales also have fallen off 60 % in the recession .
He and his business partner , the rapper Paul Wall , helped popularize the bejeweled dental retainers earlier this decade , when diamond - laced varieties molded with platinum were selling for tens of thousands of dollars .
Melting Down Grillz
Now the recession has so damped the extravagance that a Web site called sellyourgoldteeth.com is doing brisk business buying grillz for meltdown value .
" It 's a sign of the times , " says Mark Porcello of Porcello Estate Buyers , which runs the site .
Hip - hop artists are n't eager to admit to thrift , and numerous rappers rumored to be trading down declined to talk about the trend .
" You gotta understand , it is every rapper 's fear to be exposed as a fraud , " said Gregory Lewis of Brooklyn , who posts conversations with artists on the Internet under the alias " Doggie Diamonds , the interview king . "
" If you admit you wear fake jewelry , it is over for you .
It 's like bragging you drive a Lamborghini when you really drive a Toyota . "

While right - wingers are still using red-baiting to try to scare people by calling Obama a socialist , etc. , it appears that this tactic is not working .
A new survey from Rasmussen shows that just 53 % of American adults believe that capitalism is better than socialism .
What is even scarier is that for adults under the age of 30 , only 37 % prefer capitalism , while 33 % prefer socialism , with 30 % undecided .
But what makes this very interesting is that if asked if they prefer a “ free - market economy ” then 70 % say yes .
They deduce that many people are concerned whether capitalism — as it is practiced in the US — actually relies on free markets .
Indeed , 67 % believe that big government and big business often work together in ways that hurt consumers and investors .
So people are still concerned about freedom , they are n’t sure our current economic system is really free .
This has been something I ’ve been curious about since I visited places like China and VietNam .
Both China and VietNam supposedly have communist governments , but in many ways their economies are more free - market than ours ( in fact , most of the ways in which they are not based on free markets is due to corruption , not on how the government manages the economy ) .
UPDATE : FiveThirtyEight.com has a good analysis of this survey .
Madoff is the biggest self - confessed fraudster in US history Bernard Madoff has been given the maximum prison sentence of 150 years for masterminding a massive fraud that robbed investors of $ 65 bn ( £ 40 bn ) .
The sentence , which means Madoff will spend the rest of his life in jail , was greeted with cheers and applause in the packed courtroom .
US District Judge Denny Chin said he wanted to send a message that Madoff 's crimes were " extraordinarily evil " .
Madoff 's lawyer had sought a more lenient sentence of 12 years .
Judge Chin gave Madoff the maximum sentence on all 11 charges , which included securities fraud and money laundering .
FROM THE COURT Laura Trevelyan , BBC correspondent , New York
Victims cheered from the court as the judge sentenced Bernie Madoff to 150 years in jail .
Wearing a black tie and a dark suit , Madoff stood impassively as he heard his fate .
Earlier he had listened to his victims tell the court he was " a monster who should be caged " .
Investor Miriam Siegman 's voice wavered as she admitted that she scavenged in rubbish trucks now her money is gone .
Madoff said he could n't offer an excuse .
Turning to his victims he said " I 'm sorry I know that does n't help " .
In quotes : Madoff sentenced Suicide prompted by Madoff scandal Madoff victims lose life savings " Here the message must be sent that Mr Madoff 's crimes were extraordinarily evil and that this kind of manipulation of the system is not just a bloodless crime that takes place on paper , but one instead that takes a staggering toll , " Judge Chin said .
He said " the breach of trust was massive " and pointed out that no friends , family or other supporters had submitted any letters on Mr Madoff 's behalf .
Madoff has 10 days to decide whether to appeal .
His wife Ruth said in a statement released after the hearing that she felt " betrayed and confused " .
" The man who committed this horrible fraud is not the man whom I have known for all these years , " she said .
' Legacy of shame '
Before the sentencing , Madoff apologised for the " legacy of shame " he had brought on his family and the industry .
" I 'm responsible for a great deal of suffering and pain , I understand that , " said Madoff , who will spend the rest of his life in prison .

A number of them had earlier given emotional statements .
One had broken down in tears during their testimony .
" Life has been a living hell .
It feels like the nightmare we can't wake from , " said Carla Hirshhorn .
" May your jail cell be your coffin , " Michael Schwartz told Madoff .
The BBC's North America Business Reporter Michelle Fleury said the length of the sentence was unexpected .
Victims would be pleased , she said , but this was n't the end for them as they are still trying to recover some of their money .
" I think it was certainly a justified sentence , " said Judith Welling , who , along with her husband lost $ 2.5 m .
" He 's trying to send a message to the world that this sort of behaviour will not be tolerated , " she added .
Madoff 's sentence dwarfed those handed down to other corporate criminals .
Jeffrey Skilling , 55 , Enron 's former chief executive , is serving a 24 - year sentence while former WorldCom boss Bernard Ebbers , 67 , was sentenced to 25 years in prison in 2006 .
Thousands defrauded Bernard Madoff admitted defrauding thousands of investors in a Ponzi scheme which he said had been running since the early 1990s .
Madoff started his financial career aged 22 with $ 5,000 from money made from summer holiday jobs such as working as a garden sprinkler installer in New York .
He then set up Bernard L Madoff Investment Securities in 1960 .
His firm became one of the largest market - makers - matching buyers and sellers of stocks - and Madoff served as chairman of the Nasdaq stock exchange .
Madoff 's firm was investigated eight times by the US Securities and Exchange Commission over the past 16 years , because it made exceptional returns .
WHAT IS A PONZI SCHEME ?
A fraudulent investment scheme paying investors from money paid in by other investors rather than real profits Named after Charles Ponzi who notoriously used the technique in the United States in the 1920s Differs from pyramid selling in that individuals all tend to invest with the same person
But it was the global recession which effectively prompted Madoff 's demise as investors , hit by the downturn , tried to withdraw about $ 7bn from his funds and he could not find the money to cover it .
The list of Madoff 's victims includes film director Steven Spielberg 's charitable foundation , Wunderkinder .
UK banks were also among the victims with HSBC Holdings saying it had exposure of around $ 1bn .
Other corporate victims were Royal Bank of Scotland and Man Group and Japan 's Nomura Holdings .
But it is not just the elite and large firms who were victims of the fraud .
School teachers , farmers , mechanics and many others have also lost money .

With the housing downturn in full swing , it ’s interesting how many housing developments have slowed to a near stop or stalled completely .
I ’ve begun mapping out some of these fallow construction sites in the areas that I frequent ( north King / south Snohomish ) , and I thought it would be interesting to open the process up and make it a group project .
Below you will find the map that I have started .
If you ’d like to contribute some stalled residential construction sites ( SFH or condo ) in your area , just sign into your Google account then head to this link , click “ Edit ” on the left side of the page , and begin adding your markers .
At present , the map is open for anyone with a Google account to edit freely .
I only ask that you not modify existing points added by others and that you follow roughly the same format that I have used on the starting points , which includes location , size ( # of units ) , builder , status , and if possible , a picture .
If we all work together , I think we can create something that will be pretty interesting .
Smell the threat ( Image : SNAP / Rex Features )
The smell of the sweat you produce when terrified is not only registered by the brains of others , but changes their behaviour too , according to new research .
It adds to a growing body of evidence that humans may communicate using scent in a similar way to how other animals use pheromones .
Lilianne Mujica - Parodi , a cognitive neuroscientist at Stony Brook University in New York and colleagues collected sweat from the armpits of first - time tandem skydivers as they hurtled towards the earth .
The smell of their sweat was wafted under the noses of volunteers as they lay in an fMRI scanner .
Even though they had no idea what they were inhaling , two separate sets of volunteers showed activation of the amygdala – the area of the brain responsible for emotion - processing , plus areas involved in vision , motor control and goal - directed behaviour .
Sweat produced under non-stressed conditions did n’t produce this reaction .

What ’s more , in behavioural tests , the “ stress sweat ” seemed to heighten people ’s awareness of threat , making them 43 per cent more accurate in judging whether a face was neutral or threatening .
Ethical issues
Because the study used sweat rather than its components , this is not definitive evidence that human pheromones exist , says Johan Lundstrom , a pheromone researcher at Monell Chemical Senses Center in Philadelphia , who was not involved in the research .
The researchers do , however , have suspicions about what the active chemical might be .
The steroid androstadienone is the primary suspect , and Mujica - Parodi ’s team say it plans to synthesise it .
“ I ’m not naïve about the fact that some people will look at this study and say it was irresponsible , ” says Mujica - Parodi .
There are obvious ethical issues about synthesising a chemical that could induce fear in other people , and the group ’s early research was funded by the US military ( pdf ) .
But Mujica - Parodi insists that the chemical , if shown to have the same effects as full sweat , could be put to all manner of non-sinister uses , such as understanding the dynamics of fear in situations where people are thrown together in confined spaces , like aeroplanes , jails , or submarines .
Stress tool
It could also make training for stressful jobs – such as soldiers , pilots and surgeons – more realistic .
And since it seems to heighten awareness and vigilance , it could be used as a stimulant : to maintain alertness on long car journeys , for example .
Simon Wessely , a psychiatrist at the King ’s Centre for Military Health Research at King ’s College London , says that even if the chemical was to be unleashed in a crowd , it would be highly unlikely to cause mass panic .
“ Fear is biological , of course , but the important thing is the psychology and how you cognitively appraise the situation , ” he says .
“ I do n’t think you ’d get terrified for no obvious reason . ”

The latest from www.freegaza.org reports that the humanitarian vessel Spirit of Humanity has been attacked and boarded by the Israelis 23 miles off the coast of Gaza .
Former US Congresswoman and Presidential candidate Cynthia McKinney is among the 21 human rights workers taken prisoner off the ship .
[ 23 miles off the coast of Gaza , 15:30 pm ] – Today Israeli Occupation Forces attacked and boarded the Free Gaza Movement boat , the SPIRIT OF HUMANITY , abducting 21 human rights workers from 11 countries , including Noble laureate Mairead Maguire and former U.S. Congresswoman Cynthia McKinney ( see below for a complete list of passengers ) .
The passengers and crew are being forcibly dragged toward Israel .
“ This is an outrageous violation of international law against us .
Our boat was not in Israeli waters , and we were on a human rights mission to the Gaza Strip , ” said Cynthia McKinney , a former U.S. Congresswoman and presidential candidate .
“ President Obama just told Israel to let in humanitarian and reconstruction supplies , and that ’s exactly what we tried to do .
We ’re asking the international community to demand our release so we can resume our journey . ”
According to an International Committee of the Red Cross report released yesterday , the Palestinians living in Gaza are “ trapped in despair . ”
Thousands of Gazans whose homes were destroyed earlier during Israel ’s December / January massacre are still without shelter despite pledges of almost $ 4.5 billion in aid , because Israel refuses to allow cement and other building material into the Gaza Strip .
The report also notes that hospitals are struggling to meet the needs of their patients due to Israel ’s disruption of medical supplies .
“ The aid we were carrying is a symbol of hope for the people of Gaza , hope that the sea route would open for them , and they would be able to transport their own materials to begin to reconstruct the schools , hospitals and thousands of homes destroyed during the onslaught of “ Cast Lead ” .
Our mission is a gesture to the people of Gaza that we stand by them and that they are not alone ” said fellow passenger Mairead Maguire , winner of a Noble Peace Prize for her work in Northern Ireland .
Just before being kidnapped by Israel , Huwaida Arraf , Free Gaza Movement chairperson and delegation co-coordinator on this voyage , stated that : “ No one could possibly believe that our small boat constitutes any sort of threat to Israel .
We carry medical and reconstruction supplies , and children ’s toys .
Our passengers include a Nobel peace prize laureate and a former U.S. congressperson .
Our boat was searched and received a security clearance by Cypriot Port Authorities before we departed , and at no time did we ever approach Israeli waters . ”
Arraf continued , “ Israel ’s deliberate and premeditated attack on our unarmed boat is a clear violation of international law and we demand our immediate and unconditional release . ”

Advertisement India 's new government , with Manmohan Singh as prime minister , has taken the oath of office in the capital , Delhi .
Mr Singh is taking charge for a second time , only the second PM after Jawaharlal Nehru to be returned to power following a full five - year term .
The Congress party won a decisive mandate in the recent polls and Mr Singh has emerged politically stronger .
Congress has made tackling the effects of the global economic crisis and ensuring growth its key priorities .
When votes were counted last weekend after India 's marathon five - phase general election , Congress and its allies had 262 seats in parliament , compared to the BJP - led alliance 's 158 .
Pakistan 's message Mr Singh and a 19 - member cabinet took the oath of office from Indian President Pratibha Patil at a ceremony at Rashtrapati Bhavan , the presidential palace , in Delhi .
Mr Singh has displayed an ability to stand firm and outlast his most trenchant critics
The BBC's Sanjoy Majumder
Analysis : PM 's tough agenda India 's key new ministers
What business wants Congress veterans Pranab Mukherjee , AK Antony and P Chidambaram were among those taking the oath .
Sharad Pawar and Mamata Banerjee , who are among the key alliance partners , are also in the cabinet .
The swearing - in will be followed over the next few days by announcements of other ministers .
" This expansion will give due representation to allied parties , " the prime minister 's office said .
On Friday , Pakistan 's President Asif Ali Zardari sent a message congratulating Congress .
" May I also take this opportunity to assure you that Pakistan remains committed to peace and prosperity in South Asia and will continue to work with India to resolve all outstanding issues between the two countries peacefully and in a just manner . "
Bargaining hard Indian economic analyst Paranjoy Guha Thakurta says the challenge for Mr Singh 's government will be to meet the aspirations of India 's youthful and upwardly mobile middle classes while widening social safety nets for the poor , especially those living in rural areas .
But he says the Congress mandate is strong , with the weakening of parties on the left and right .
In recent days , Mr Singh and the leader of his Congress party , Sonia Gandhi , have been bargaining hard with their electoral allies over the distribution of cabinet positions .
On Thursday , the DMK left the alliance after talks failed .
Reports said DMK leader M Karunanidhi was unhappy at the number of cabinet posts offered .
The Tamil Nadu - based party said it would still support the coalition from the outside .
The Congress - led coalition said it had the support of 274 lawmakers prior to the DMK 's announcement , two more than needed for a parliamentary majority .
With outside support , the coalition said it had 322 members of the lower house of parliament backing it .
The BBC's Sanjoy Majumder in Delhi says many thought that during his first term Mr Singh would find it difficult to withstand the pressure of demanding political allies .
But throughout his career , our correspondent says , Mr Singh has displayed an ability to stand firm and outlast his most trenchant critics .

By now , it is a familiar litany .
Study after study suggests that alcohol in moderation may promote heart health and even ward off diabetes and dementia .
The evidence is so plentiful that some experts consider moderate drinking  about one drink a day for women , about two for men  a central component of a healthy lifestyle .
But what if it ’s all a big mistake ?
For some scientists , the question will not go away .
No study , these critics say , has ever proved a causal relationship between moderate drinking and lower risk of death  only that the two often go together .
It may be that moderate drinking is just something healthy people tend to do , not something that makes people healthy .
“ The moderate drinkers tend to do everything right  they exercise , they do n’t smoke , they eat right and they drink moderately , ” said Kaye Middleton Fillmore , a retired sociologist from the University of California , San Francisco , who has criticized the research .
“ It ’s very hard to disentangle all of that , and that ’s a real problem . ”
Some researchers say they are haunted by the mistakes made in studies about hormone replacement therapy , which was widely prescribed for years on the basis of observational studies similar to the kind done on alcohol .
Questions have also been raised about the financial relationships that have sprung up between the alcoholic beverage industry and many academic centers , which have accepted industry money to pay for research , train students and promote their findings .
July 17 , 2009
The Nation - Last month I led a group of twenty - one human rights workers on a boat from Cyprus to challenge Israel 's naval blockade of the Gaza Strip .
We carried toys , medicine , olive tree saplings , toolkits , a fifty - kilo bag of cement and school supplies on our small converted ferry boat .
At 2 AM on June 30 , almost eighteen hours into the 230 - mile journey , a colleague awakened me .
The Israeli Navy was calling our boat on the VHF radio .
" You are navigating towards a blockaded area .
You are hereby ordered to change your course .
If you do not , we will be forced to use all necessary force to stop you . "
Nervous after a previous boat of ours was dangerously rammed at sea in December by the Israeli military , I replied , " Israeli Navy , this is Arion ( the registered name of our ship ) .
We are twenty - one unarmed civilians carrying aid for the Palestinian people of Gaza .
Any blockade on Gaza is unlawful as you are the occupying force in the territory and are therefore responsible for the well - being of the civilian population there .
As our boat , its cargo , and the twenty - one civilians on board do not constitute any kind of threat to Israel or its armed forces , you are obliged to allow us entry .
We are proceeding to Gaza .
Do not use force against us . "
Shortly thereafter our navigational systems were disabled for nearly four hours as the warnings continued .
In their " final " warning to us , the Israeli Navy threatened to open fire .
" Israeli Navy , we are unarmed civilians ; do not use force against us .
Do not shoot . "
We did not stop .
We were boarded by force .
Before we were separated , I saw Navy forces grabbing my husband , Adam , a filmmaker who has made documentaries from Palestine to Darfur , about the neck .
Later , I learned that outside of my view , these government - sanctioned pirates pummeled Adam in order to wrest his videocamera from his grasp .
Though I know it could not have been easy for him , Adam did not fight back .
He was a multi-sport athlete in high school , threw out Manny Ramirez stealing second and is one of those rare individuals who bring a football player 's intensity to peace work .
But like the rest of us , Adam insists on using nonviolent means to resist Israel 's military occupation .
And though in his widely hailed Cairo speech President Obama made an implicit call for nonviolence as the means to challenge the Israeli occupation , the Obama administration made no public statement on our behalf -- nor did it do so three months ago , when my dear friend Bassem Abu Rahme was killed while nonviolently protesting Israeli expansionism in the West Bank that threatens to destroy his village of Bil'in .
Perhaps we were politically inept .
Had we sailed toward Iran to offer assistance to civilian protesters there , we would have been a cause celebre if the Iranian government had arrested us .
Iran , however , for all its troubles , is not now under foreign occupation as Palestine is .
Yet as I watched the demonstrations in Iran , I could not miss the similarities to Palestine 's nonviolent resistance to Israeli occupation .
I cannot count the times I have marched peacefully , waving a flag and demanding freedom for my people -- with only my voice and my presence as my weapons .
And sadly , the number of friends I have lost -- killed by Israeli forces as , like Neda Agha - Soltan in Iran , they nonviolently demonstrated for freedom -- is becoming too great a pain in my heart .
My colleagues and I invested time and energy in this difficult journey and put our lives at risk because for too long the international community has been complicit in Israel 's crimes against the Palestinian people .
For too long , diplomats and world leaders have paid lip service to Palestinian human rights .
For too long , the Palestinian people have been told to wait -- wait in the checkpoint line , wait on the peace process , wait to have your rights recognized , wait for freedom .
Students I met on a recent successful voyage to Gaza certainly did not want to wait to be slowly suffocated and drained of their dreams .
So desperate were they to escape their confinement in Gaza to obtain higher education abroad that they asked us to drop them in international waters and they would swim the rest of the way to Cyprus .
This was youthful madness , but indicative of how trapped people in Gaza are today .
I was born in the blanket of freedom of the United States .
My parents immigrated here , knowing that I could not be free in my homeland .
But today I use my freedom to struggle as a Palestinian for my friends and relatives who endure the yokes of occupation , oppression , discrimination , exile , internment and apartheid .
Most Palestinians in the occupied territories have not lived a day free of Israel 's occupation , and Palestinian citizens of Israel continue to live as a discriminated - against minority .
Just the other day , Israel 's housing minister , Ariel Atias , declared , " We can all be bleeding hearts , but I think it is unsuitable [ for Jews and Palestinians ] to live together [ in Israel ] .
This is the Israel the United States funds with billions each year .
Under the leadership of President Obama -- or any American president , for that matter -- support for this sort of raw bigotry makes no sense and is antithetical to our most cherished principles .
Yet when Israeli leaders utter such contemptible language it is ignored .
When Israeli soldiers fire lethal weapons at unarmed , peaceful protesters it is too often ignored .
When Israeli naval boats become pirate ships -- boarding a vessel that poses them no threat , arresting and beating American citizens -- it is ignored .
It is ignored and Israel continues to enjoy the patronage of the United States and to present itself as a moral beacon for the world .
But my generation finds racist language like that of Atias '-- and the actions that result from such outdated thinking -- abhorrent .
We find it unacceptable that Palestinians continue to be asked to wait , to improve our self - government and to be patient as we build ourselves toward the same rights that people elsewhere take for granted .
With the fourth Palestinian generation born into refugee camps , with a new generation in Gaza being raised poorer and more desperate than the last , with my land being carved and sliced and walled for the exclusive benefit of one ethno - religious group , I say we cannot wait .
The question facing the world now must no longer be about where to squeeze a Palestinian state .
The only relevant question is how to advance the immediate freedom of ten million Palestinians .
There can be no more waiting , no more prevaricating , no more negotiations on that simple , beautiful human concept -- freedom .
We will be free .
President Obama can expedite the process by putting pressure on Israel , or he can sideline himself and the process for the next eight years .
Sooner or later , however , Israel 's subjugation of us will be overturned .
The current situation is untenable .
Whether we live in two states or one state with equal rights for all -- as in South Africa and , indeed , the United States -- we will achieve our freedom .
What South Africa was to students in the 1980s , Palestine is fast becoming to younger generations increasingly repulsed by the entrenchment of Israel 's dual system of law , domination of another people and ongoing confinement of 1.5 million Palestinians to a tiny parcel of land in Gaza .
So , yes , this was only one tiny humanitarian boat to Gaza .
But Israel 's heavy - handed action shows how much is at stake and how shaky Israel 's grip over another people becomes when the world 's citizens speak out and take action -- even as governments fall short .

Police have raided dozens of homes across the country as they questioned climate change protesters planning action this summer against coal - fired power stations and airports .
More than 200 officers carried out a pre-emptive raid early on Monday , arresting 114 people thought to be preparing a protest at the Ratcliffe - on - Soar power station in Nottinghamshire .
Yesterday it emerged that as the campaigners were in custody , officers raided homes around the UK , seizing computer equipment and mobile phone records .
All of those arrested but not charged for conspiracy to commit criminal damage and aggravated trespass were released yesterday on police bail – many with onerous conditions , including bans on approaching any UK power station or attempting to disrupt their operations .
Campaigners said this was an attempt to reduce numbers at major climate camps and demonstrations planned over the summer and to limit protests if the government decides to go ahead with a major new coal - fired power station at Kingsnorth in Kent .
A spokesman for Nottinghamshire police said specialist equipment , including bolt cutters and chains , that was seized during the raid suggesting that the protesters posed a " serious threat to the safe running of the site " .
However the mass raids and the lack of charges prompted renewed concern about the tactics of officers policing environmental protests .
Shona Jainjuah , from the Camp for Climate Action , which yesterday denied planning the action , said : " First the police violently attack the climate camp during the G20 , and now 114 people are arrested before they have actually done anything .
People should be very concerned about how the police are stepping over the line in the way they are targeting activists . "
An activist who did not want to be named added : " This is an attempt to silence a peaceful movement of young people trying to make people aware of the greatest threat to the world .
This is madness . "
Senior figures in the environment movement said surveillance of activists now regularly went beyond demonstrations to include open public meetings , campaigners ' offices and individual activists .
John Sauven , executive director of Greenpeace UK , which also denied any involvement in the action , said police were filming people arriving at and leaving the group 's London headquarters , and had stopped and questioned members leaving public meetings about opposition to the expansion of Stansted airport .
" These are all quite legitimate activities so we can see from what 's happening that the level of police surveillance is increasing dramatically , coupled with which is the big increase in technology at their disposal to monitor people , " said Sauven , citing the example of CCTV cameras that can be used to track vehicles and equipment to pinpoint mobile phone users .
It emerged yesterday that police almost certainly used a mole in the fast - growing climate movement to warn them of the impending action and to locate the activists .
According to E.On , the owners of the Ratcliffe power station , energy companies across the region had been warned days in advance of a possible major action , and had been advised to increase their security over the weekend .
" We got the heads up a few days before that there was the potential for there to be a greater risk of protest , not just for Ratcliffe but for other stations in the north and Midlands " , said a spokeswomen for E.On .
" Police who arrested us told us that they had known about the action at least a week before , " said one protester who was arrested yesterday morning .
" They were waiting for us .
It 's difficult not to conclude that there was a mole . "
Police have infiltrated Greenpeace and other activist groups for some time , and the rapid growth of the climate change movement , with people new people joining every week , has made it easier .
Only a small handful of people are likely to have known where or what the Nottinghamshire action was to be , with everyone else being told by word of mouth to meet at a prearranged time and place .
Activists are asked to leave their mobile phones at home and to make no calls in advance , but police have the technology to track people to within a few metres .
" The size of the police operation and the early warnings both suggest the police had inside information , " said one woman arrested .
“ I think animals do experience regret , as defined as the recognition of a missed opportunity , ” Dr. Brosnan said .
“ In the wild , these abilities may help them to recognize when they should forage in different areas or find a different cooperative partner who will share the spoils more equitably . ”

No one knows , of course , exactly how this sense of regret affects an animal emotionally .
When we see a dog slouching and bowing , we like to assume he ’s suffering the way we do after a faux pas , but maybe he ’s just sending a useful signal : I messed up .
“ It ’s possible that this kind of social signal in animals could have evolved without the conscious experience of regret , ” said Sam Gosling , a psychologist at the University of Texas , Austin .
“ But it seems more plausible that there is some kind of conscious experience even if it ’s not the same kind of thing that you or I feel . ”
Marc Bekoff , a behavioral ecologist at the University of Colorado , says he ’s convinced that animals feel emotional pain for their mistakes and missed opportunities .
In “ Wild Justice , ” a new book he wrote with the philosopher Jessica Pierce , Dr. Bekoff reports on thousands of hours of observation of coyotes in the wild as well as free - running domesticated dogs .
When a coyote recoiled after being bitten too hard while playing , the offending coyote would promptly bow to acknowledge the mistake , Dr. Bekoff said .
If a coyote was shunned for playing unfairly , he would slouch around with his ears slightly back , head cocked and tail down , tentatively approaching and then withdrawing from the other animals .
Dr. Bekoff said the apologetic coyotes reminded him of the unpopular animals skulking at the perimeter of a dog park .
“ These animals are not as emotionally sophisticated as humans , but they have to know what ’s right and wrong because it ’s the only way their social groups can work , ” he said .
“ Regret is essential , especially in the wild .
Humans are very forgiving to their pets , but if a coyote in the wild gets a reputation as a cheater , he ’s ignored or ostracized , and he ends up leaving the group . ”
Once the coyote is on his own , Dr. Bekoff discovered , the coyote ’s risk of dying young rises fourfold .
If our pets realize what soft touches we are , perhaps their regret is mostly just performance art to sucker us .
But I like to think that some of the ruefulness is real , and that researchers will one day compile a list of the Top 10 Pet Regrets .
( You can make nominations at TierneyLab , at nytimes.com/tierneylab . )
At the very least , I ’d like to see researchers tackle a few of the great unanswered questions :
When you ’re playing fetch with a dog , how much regret does he suffer when he gives you back the ball ?
As much as when he ends the game by hanging on to the ball ?
CIA and Assassinations : The Guatemala 1954 Documents Edited by Kate Doyle and Peter Kornbluh National Security Archive Electronic Briefing Book No. 4

Washington , D.C. –
These documents , including an instructional guide on assassination found among the training files of the CIA 's covert " Operation PBSUCCESS , " were among several hundred records released by the Agency on May 23 , 1997 on its involvement in the infamous 1954 coup in Guatemala .
After years of answering Freedom of Information
Act requests with its standard " we can neither confirm nor deny that such records exist , " the CIA has finally declassified some 1400 pages of over 100,000 estimated to be in its secret archives on the Guatemalan destabilization program .
( The Agency 's press release stated that more records would be released before the end of the year . )
An excerpt from the assassination manual appears on the Op - Ed page of The New York Times on Saturday , May 31 , 1997 .
The small , albeit dramatic , release comes more than five years after then CIA director Robert Gates declared that the CIA would " open " its shadowy past to post - cold war public scrutiny , and only days after a member of the CIA 's own historical review panel was quoted in the New York Times as calling the CIA 's commitment to openness " a brilliant public relations snow job . "
( See Tim Weiner , " C.I.A. 's Openness Derided as a ' Snow Job ' , " The New York Times , May 20 , 1997 , p. A16 ) Arbenz was elected President of Guatemala in 1950 to continue a process of socio- economic reforms that the CIA disdainfully refers to in its memoranda as " an intensely nationalistic program of progress colored by the touchy , anti-foreign inferiority complex of the ' Banana Republic . ' "
The first CIA effort to overthrow the Guatemalan president --a CIA collaboration with Nicaraguan dictator Anastacio Somoza to support a disgruntled general named Carlos Castillo Armas and codenamed Operation PBFORTUNE -- was authorized by President Truman in 1952 .
As early as February of that year , CIA Headquarters began generating memos with subject titles such as " Guatemalan Communist Personel to be disposed of during Military Operations , " outlining categories of persons to be neutralized " through Executive Action " -- murder -- or through imprisonment and exile .
The " A " list of those to be assassinated contained 58 names -- all of which the CIA has excised from the declassified documents .
PBSUCCESS , authorized by President Eisenhower in August 1953 , carried a $ 2.7 million budget for " pychological warfare and political action " and " subversion , " among the other components of a small paramilitary war .
But , according to the CIA 's own internal study of the agency 's so - called " K program , " up until the day Arbenz resigned on June 27 , 1954 , " the option of assassination was still being considered . "
While the power of the CIA 's psychological - war , codenamed " Operation Sherwood , " against Arbenz rendered that option unnecessary , the last stage of PBSUCCESS called for " roll - up of Communists and collaborators . "
Although Arbenz and his top aides were able to flee the country , after the CIA installed Castillo Armas in power , hundreds of Guatemalans were rounded up and killed .
Between 1954 and 1990 , human rights groups estimate , the repressive operatives of sucessive military regimes murdered more than 100,000 civilians .
DOCUMENTS Document 1 : " CIA and Guatemala Assassination Proposals , 1952 - 1954 " , CIA History Staff Analysis by Gerald K. Haines , June 1995 .
CIA records on assassination planning in Guatemala were first gathered pursuant to a Freedom of Information Act lawsuit filed in 1979 .
All of them were withheld on national security grounds at that time .
In 1995 , the CIA 's historical staff " rediscovered " these records during a search of Guatemala materials to be declassified as part of the agency 's " Openness " program .
A staff historian , Gerald Haines , was assigned to write this brief history of these operations .
He concluded that as early as January 1952 , CIA headquarters began compiling lists of individuals in Arbenz 's government " to eliminate immediately in event of [ a ] successful anti-Communist coup . "
Planning for assassination included budgeting , training programs , creation of hit teams , drafting of target lists of persons , and transfer of armaments .
Haines writes that " until the day that Arbenz resigned in June 1954 the option of assassination was still being considered . "
The CIA , according to this history , did not implement its assassination strategy .
But the declassifiers of this study , and other related documents , have deleted the names of the targeted individuals , making it impossible to verify that none of them were killed during or in the aftermath of the coup .
Document 2 : " A Study of Assassination " , Unsigned , Undated .
Transcription
Among the documents found in the training files of Operation PBSUCCESS and declassified by the Agency is a " Study of Assassination . "
A how - to guide book in the art of political killing , the 19 - page manual offers detailed descriptions of the procedures , instruments , and implementation of assassination .
" The simplest local tools are often much the most efficient means of assassination , " counsels the study .
" A hammer , axe , wrench , screw driver , fire poker , kitchen knife , lamp stand , or anything hard , heavy and handy will suffice . "
For an assassin using " edge weapons , " the manual notes in cold clinical terms , " puncture wounds of the body cavity may not be reliable unless the heart is reached .... Absolute reliability is obtained by severing the spinal cord in the cervical region . "
T he manual also notes that to provide plausible denial , " no assassination instructions should ever be written or recorded . "
Murder , the drafters state , " is not morally justifiable , " and " persons who are morally squeamish should not attempt it . "
Document 3 : " Selection of individuals for disposal by Junta Group " , March 31 , 1954 .
One of the many assassination lists compiled by the CIA during planning for Operation Success .
As the memorandum indicates , the chief of one of the CIA 's divisions involved in the coup ( the division title has been deleted ) requested a list of names of Arbenz government leaders , members of the Communist Party , and individuals " of tactical importance whose removal for psychological , organizational or others reasons is mandatory for the success of military action . "
The memo asks that CIA personnel read through the list and initial the names of those who should be included on a " final list of disposees . "
The list ( and the initials or names of all CIA officers appearing in the document ) has been withheld .
A handwritten note attached on the bottom of the memo reads : Elimination List
April [ illeg . ] - [ Illeg . ] is taking a copy of list of
names for checking with the [ illeg . ]
April 7 - Original Memo
with attached Biographic data
has been passed to [ deleted ]
Returned by [ deleted ] on 1 June 1954
Document 4 : " Guatemalan Communist Personnel to be disposed of during Military Operations of Calligeris " , Origin deleted , Undated .
Another version of the assassination lists compiled by the CIA and Carlos Castillo Armas ( code - named " Calligeris " ) in the course of preparing for the 1954 coup .
The names of the agency 's intended victims were divided into two categories : persons to be disposed of through " Executive action " ( i.e. , killed ) and those to be imprisoned or exiled during the operation .
Before releasing this document to the public , the CIA deleted every name , leaving only the rows of numbers to indicate how many people were targeted .
Document 5 : " Operation PBSUCCESS : The United States and Guatemala , 1952 - 1954 " , CIA History Staff document by Nicholas Cullather , 1994 .
Excerpt .
A narrative history of the CIA 's role in planning , organizing and executing the coup that toppled Jacobo Arbenz Guzmán on June 27 , 1954 .
Cullather , now a diplomatic historian at the University of Indiana , worked on contract for one year with the CIA , where he was given access to thousands of agency records and secret operational files in order to produce this overview .
The result is a surprisingly critical study of the agency 's first covert operation in Latin America .
Beginning with a review of the political , economic and social forces that led to Arbenz 's presidency in 1951 , the document is an intimate account of how cold war concerns convinced President Eisenhower to order the removal of the democratically - elected leader by force .
It also provides countless new details of a covert mission plagued by disastrous military planning and failed security measures : according to Cullather , " Operation Success " barely succeeded .
The CIA scrambled to convince the White House that it was an unqualified and all but bloodless victory , however .
After Arbenz resigned , Eisenhower called the Director of Central Intelligence , Allan W. Dulles , and his senior covert planners into a formal briefing of the operation .
Cullather 's account now reveals that the agency lied to the president , telling him that only one of the rebels it had backed was killed .
" Incredible , " said the president .
And it was .
At least four dozen were dead , according to the CIA 's own records .
Thus did the Guatemala coup enter agency lore as an " unblemished triumph , " Cullather explains , and become the model for future CIA activities in Latin America .
In Guatemala , of course , " Operation Success " had a deadly aftermath .
After a small insurgency developed in the wake of the coup , Guatemala 's military leaders developed and refined , with U.S. assistance , a massive counterinsurgency campaign that left tens of thousands massacred , maimed or missing .
“ I consider the approach is remarkable and more than intriguing , ” said Dr. Friend , who is now at Sage Bionetworks in Seattle .
But he warned that cancer cells are very versatile and can “ evolve around any pressure you put on them , ” so that no single approach is likely to afford a cure .
The EnGeneIC method uses minicells to deliver a variety of agents to tumor cells , including both anticancer toxins and mechanisms for suppressing the genes that make tumors resistant to toxins .
The minicells are generated from mutant bacteria which , each time they divide , pinch off small bubbles of cell membrane .
The minicells can be loaded with chemicals and coated with antibodies that direct them toward tumor cells .
No tumor cell , so far as is known , produces a specific surface molecule for toxins to act on .
But 80 percent of solid tumors have their cell surfaces studded with extra-large amounts of the receptor for a particular hormone , known as epidermal growth factor .
The minicells can be coated with an antibody that recognizes this receptor , so they are more likely to attach themselves to tumors than to the normal cells of the body .
The tumor cells engulf and destroy the minicells , a standard defense against bacteria , and in doing so are exposed to whatever cargo the minicells carry .
What also helps direct the minicells toward tumors , the EnGeneIC researchers say , is that the blood vessels around tumors tend to be leaky , and the minicells are small enough to leave the circulation at the leak sites .
The minicells do not seem to be highly provocative to the immune system , even though they are made of bacterial cell membrane .
The reason may be that the provocative parts of the membrane are masked by antibodies with which the minicells are coated , Dr. Brahmbhatt said .

TURNBERRY , Scotland -- Tom Watson had another magical day at the British Open .
The 59 - year - old Watson bounced back from a dismal start , rolling in two impossibly long putts to share the midway lead with little - known American Steve Marino .
Watson played the final 10 holes at 4 under for an even - par 70 that might have been even more impressive in the windy conditions than his opening 65 .
Marino shot 68 at treacherous Turnberry , and the two will start Saturday in the final group at 5 - under 135 .
Another old - timer , 49 - year - old Mark Calcavecchia , will be right with them , one stroke back .
" It 's as if the spirits are on my side , " said Watson , who rolled in a 75 - foot birdie at the 16th and a 45 - footer at the final hole to pull even with Marino .
" I would n't be here if I did n't think I could win .
" I hope the spirits stay on my side . "
Tiger Woods was not nearly as unfortunate .
The world 's top - ranked player limped off with a 4 - over 74 and missed the cut ( by one stroke ) in a major for only the second time in his professional career .
Watson also had his troubles -- at the beginning .
He followed a bogey - free Thursday with bogeys on five of the first seven holes -- including four in a row .
Just when it seemed he was fading away , the five - time Open champion bounced back with two birdies around the turn .
Chromium , the open source development version of Google 's Chrome Web browser , recently gained support for native theming on the Linux platform .
This reflects the growing maturity of the Linux port and demonstrates the extent to which Google is committed to making Chrome a first - class browser on the Linux platform .
When Chrome was launched last year , it was only available on Windows .
Following the initial release , the developers began a porting effort to bring the browser to Linux and Mac OS X .
We have closely followed Chromium prereleases on those platforms to keep up with the latest developments .
In May , we did a hands - on review of Chromium on Linux using an alpha version .
Google has made considerable progress since then and released the first Chrome - branded Linux and Mac versions last month .
As we noted in our review of the Chromium alpha for Linux , one of the major challenges faced by the developers was the lack of a single universal toolkit or set of user interface guidelines for the Linux platform .
The inherent diversity of the Linux desktop ecosystem , which has multiple competing toolkits and desktop environments , raises some difficult questions for third - party software vendors .
Google eventually decided to commit to using the GTK + toolkit and has been working to make the browser visually conform to a standard GNOME environment .
In previous builds of Chromium that we have tested on Linux , the browser used GTK + to render the menus , but the rest of it looked nearly identical to the Windows version .
In the latest builds , the browser has a native theming option in the preferences dialog which causes it to adopt the colors and icons of the user 's GNOME theme while still retaining the signature skyline tab style .
It also has an option on the tab bar right - click context menu that allows users to toggle whether Chromium browser windows will be displayed with the standard GNOME window decorator or the custom Chrome window decorator .
We have tested this with several popular themes to see how well it works .
At the current stage , it handles light themes very well but falls down a little bit with dark themes .
It adopts standard GNOME icons for the back , forward , and refresh buttons but still uses its own icons for the two menus on the right - hand side of the URL bar .
It 's important to note that the screenshots below , which demonstrate theming support with a number of popular themes , are taken with an unofficial Chromium nightly build and not an officially released version .
The theming feature is still under heavy active development and could change considerably before it is included in an official Chrome release .
Clearlooks
Crux
Darkroom
Dust
Human
Default theme
I was a little skeptical at first , but after testing several of the themes , I 'm convinced that the developers are on the right track .
It 's definitely a good start and it works reasonably well already , despite being new .
Dark themes have traditionally been a trouble area even for conventional GNOME applications , so it 's unsurprising that Chromium has some related issues .
The only other oddity that really stands out to me is the way that the color only extends halfway down the window frame when the native decorator is disabled .
This is probably a minor issue that will be fixed in future builds .
Chrome 's excellent performance is attracting the attention of a growing number of Linux users .
The browser has the potential to gain a considerable following on the Linux platform if it can continue to deliver this level of performance while additional features are added .
The latest theming improvements show that Google 's developers clearly care about visual integration , which is a promising sign that we can expect to see good Linux support as the browser evolves .
But as US intelligence efforts were trained on Iraq , there was no comparable attempt to map out the different groups facing off against American and allied forces in Afghanistan and Pakistan , according to multiple US government officials and analysts .
A recent Obama administration review of US policy found American understanding of the nature of those adversaries to be seriously lacking .
" Over time in Iraq we developed a very nuanced understanding of the enemy , " Petraeus , the top commander in the Middle East , told the Globe in response to e-mailed questions .
" That proved invaluable as we worked with our Iraqi partners to determine which sub - groups , tribes , and other social elements might be reconcilable and which were truly irreconcilable . "
Part spycraft , part history research , the project is an attempt to re-create the successes in Iraq in 2007 and 2008 , when the United States and its allies were able to co-opt some elements of the Sunni-led insurgency and Shia militias and bring them into the fold of the Iraqi government .
Enlisting the former enemies is credited with helping to dramatically reduce the number of attacks on US and Iraqi security forces .
" This is the key to moving forward , " said Peter Bergen , a specialist on radical Islamic terrorism at the New America Foundation in Washington , D.C. " The easiest way to end an insurgency is to get people to stop being insurgents . "
The initiative , which involves hundreds of intelligence operatives and analysts in the United States and overseas , is expected to culminate later this year in a detailed , highly classified analysis of the different factions of the Taliban and other groups .
The overall effort is considered crucial to the long - term success of President Obama 's goal of crushing the remnants of the Al Qaeda terrorist network and bringing stability to large swaths of the two countries that have become incubators for anti-US violence .
" You have a whole spectrum of bad guys that sort of get lumped into this catch - all term of Taliban . . . because they 're launching bullets at us , " said a senior defense official involved in the effort who like others was not authorized to speak publicly about intelligence matters .
" There are many of the groups that can probably be peeled off . "
Top military and intelligence officials say they know far too little about the disparate groups they are fighting in Afghanistan and Pakistan and believe many fighters have been incorrectly labeled as the Taliban , lumping those who pose the greatest threat with others who may be willing to share power with the Afghan and Pakistani governments .
WASHINGTON - US intelligence agencies have launched an intensive effort to examine the various tribes linked to the Taliban to determine whether some can be broken off through diplomatic and economic initiatives , mirroring the successful strategy employed by General David H. Petraeus in Iraq , according to Defense Department officials .
In response , one senior military official involved in the effort said intelligence analysts have been instructed by top officials in the Pentagon , the State Department , and the National Security Council to return to the basics , including dissecting " Who is the Taliban and who are the real bad guys ? "
" We have insufficient [ intelligence ] capacity and capability when it comes to Afghanistan and Pakistan , " said the official , adding that the intent of the intelligence work is to establish " a more granular understanding of tribes , social structures , and the enemy as the effort in Afghanistan moves forward . "
The first step , officials said , will be identifying the remnants of the Afghan Taliban who ruled Afghanistan until it was overthrown by US - led forces in late 2001 for harboring the planners of the 9/11 attacks .
They include leaders possibly open to dialogue , such as Mawlawi Jalaluddin Haqqani and Gulbuddin Hekmatyar , Afghans who are believed to be potential rivals for power with the more radical Taliban leader Mullah Muhammed Omar , who escaped the US onslaught in 2001 .
Some Taliban leaders are reportedly talking through intermediaries about a potential peace deal with the Afghan government .
Then there are Al Qaeda 's leaders and other foreign Arabs aligned with them who used Afghanistan as a haven to plan attacks on the United States and are now believed to be relying on neighboring Pakistan as a base of operations .
They are considered by most specialists to be irreconcilable to American overtures .
But there are other foreign elements , including Uzbeks , Chechens , and Uighurs , whose ultimate intentions are less understood , officials said .
" Many of those foreign elements have been there for 20 years , " said the senior defense official .
" They are the refuge of the first Afghan jihad " against the Soviet Union in the 1980s .
" Some of those have actually intermarried within the tribes . "
Meanwhile , there is the so - called Pakistani Taliban , perhaps symbolized by Baitullah Mehsud , one of the militants most wanted by American and Pakistani military forces for his role in orchestrating attacks on both sides of the porous border .
And there are also criminal elements such as the drug smugglers and what one official called angry local Pashtun tribes " who do n't like anybody setting up shop in their area . "
Specialists said untangling these different groups could be the key to achieving American aims .
" Some of them . . . may not be susceptible to dialogue or moderating influences , " Hilary Synnott , a senior fellow at the International Institute for Strategic Studies in London , said recently in an online forum hosted by the Council on Foreign Relations .
" But others , such as . . . those who are being coerced by extremists of whom they disapprove , or those who are frustrated by the lack of alternative opportunities , may be persuaded or induced to lay down their arms and work for peace . "
But Bergen , who has spent considerable time in the region , warned that reaching durable agreements with more moderate elements will prove more difficult than it was in Iraq - especially when they see the 21,000 additional American military forces that Obama is sending this year to Afghanistan .
" It 's going to be more complex to do deals with the Taliban than people think , " Bergen said .
In their view , " more brigades are not coming to make peace deals .
They are going to kill a lot of people . "

I took a polygraph recently for a Fall unpaid internship with the FBI .
I had to venture about 300 miles and 4 hours to get to it .
I had all of the things I 've read on here happen .
I was accused of trying to use counter measures ; criticized for my breathing ; asked if I was under the influence of alcohol during the test .
I was all over the place apparently .
I got my name wrong , the day of the week , everything .
I must have done the same 7 questions , about 4 times , so basically , I had answer them 28 times , over and over .
He took off the metal finger sensors twice and had me wipe my hand on my pants twice , finally , he put some rubbery green sticker sensors .
I had to alter my breathing during the exam , causing distress in my body .
During the exam , he raised the pressure of the BP cuff from his chair .
I could feel it get tighter .
Then the last round of questions , the cuff was real tight , not tight as in to hurt me but you could really feel the squeeze .
Then I was accused of having felonies , I answered that i did not and whatever I had told him and the other interviewing agent was all that I had done .
I did not even get to the part about espionage .
When I did not have any information to give I was told that it was over and that they would n't waste anymore resources on me .
No background check or anything .
The next day I receive a call from an investigator who is going to conduct my BI .
An acquaintance of mine said that even though you flunk , pass , or whatever , they conduct the BI .
He told me he had not heard anything to cancel the BI so he'd just go through it .
I gave him references and talked to him .
He seemed ok .
Last I heard of him was for a question he had about someone I was living with .
Recently , I received a call to reschudle my poly , but nearer to my location .
I had a prior engagement so I was unable to schedule for that time .
I was told then it would probably be next month then and about 4 hours away again , I told her to let me know .
Apparently , it is to be with the same polygrapher or his superior .
During my exam , he would frequently pace around the room and would leave to the next office to seek counsel from his superior as to whether to fail me or give me a inconclusive , but the man was not there
The thing is , I may be moving in another direction and I may get a paying job .
I do n't really feel like going through the poly experience again .
The consensus here is to not take the poly .
I am thinking I should bow out of the process altogether .
Are my instincts correct ?
TOYOTA RETURNS TO ITS COMPACT TRUCK ROOTS WITH THE A - BAT CONCEPT VEHICLE
The concept 's unique look is a combination of the large body surfaces , intersecting tight surface planes , crisp lines and the trapezoidal profile .
The A - BAT 's 19 - inch wheels sit at the vehicle 's corners creating a tough and ready
stance .
Vital Stats
' The image of a NATO all - terrain military truck inspired us to keep the occupants as far forward as possible to maximize rear bed capacity in this compact package , ' stated Sperling .
Both the driver and front passenger have a large multi-information display screens on the IP to view the status of their high tech gadgets and HVAC and audio settings .
Toyota Motor Sales ( TMS ) , Ú.S.A. , Inc. , returns to its compact pickup truck roots with its latest concept vehicle A - BAT .
The environmentally advanced A - BAT provides modern versatility , roominess and style in a compact pickup architecture .
The A - BAT made its debut in Detroit at the 2008 North American International Auto Show today .
' Driving from beyond the suburbs to the city is a way of life for many people , ' said Kevin Hunter , president , Calty Design Research , Inc .
' We 've taken Toyota 's truck heritage to a different level by envisioning a vehicle capable of maneuvering the suburbs as well as dirt roads .
This compact truck is as comfortable for long commutes as it is for road trips .
It can accommodate outdoor toys and home improvement supplies .
Plus , customers benefit from the hybrid powertrain 's low emissions and fuel economy .
' The A - BAT concept was developed by the TMS Advanced Product Strategy group and Calty , Toyota 's North American - based , research and design center located in Newport Beach , Calif .
Together , they identified a buyer group whose unique combination of lifestyle activities and vehicle needs required a vehicle that as of now is not available in the market place .
The team created a new genre of compact vehicle with good fuel economy , advanced functionality , maneuverability , unique styling within its segment , and a durable package suitable for an active lifestyle .
Advanced styling was also key in making the A - BAT appropriate for today 's market .
The A - BAT concept rides on a unibody platform for car - like handling when navigating city streets and crowded parking lots , and smooth ride quality for highway trips and the everyday commute .
In addition , its lightweight package coupled with Toyota 's Hybrid Synergy Drive¨ technology is designed to deliver excellent fuel economy .
Translucent solar panels in the top surface of the instrument panel capture sunlight and convert it into energy , showcasing the vehicle 's ' green ' character .
Positioned below the Toyota Tacoma , A - BAT integrates truck features with carfundamentals for an efficient and modern package .
The A - BAT 's unique aerodynamic exterior was crafted by Calty Project Chief Designer Ian Cartabiano and Creative Designer Matt Sperling .
They integrated Toyota 's design philosophy , ' Vibrant Clarity ' into the exterior by keeping the design forward - looking , crisp and functional .
' We studied the ' trapezoid ' silhouette from the side profile of the Toyota Prius and applied it to create an entirely new truck image , ' said Sperling .
He further enhanced the trapezoidal profile by placing the cab forward , and using fast angle A - and C - pillars , shortened overhangs , and a sleek front window .
' The bold grille showcases Toyota 's reverse trapezoid and T - face theme in a new way , ' explained Cartabiano .
' The bed is defined by the C - pillar and is clearly separated from the cab to allow it to stand out from the rest of the profile .
'
The A - BAT features a four - foot bed , but has more flexibility than the standard pickup truck .
A translucent roof panel slides open to allow for tall cargo in the cab .
When the pass - through midgate is folded down into the cab the bed lengthens an additional two feet .
An open tailgate provides an additional two - foot of bed length .
The A - BAT offers customers the versatility of hauling a standard 4x8 sheet of plywood one day , then taking a family on a camping trip to the lake the next .
The bed has features perfect for work and play .
These include tailgate lighting for illuminating the load in the bed , a first aid kit and flashlight integrated into the tailgate , sliding tie downs , and an AC power outlet .
Items such as sports and leisure equipment can be stored in the lockable drawers in the bed walls .
The concept also has additional storage that is accessible through sliding doors conveniently placed in and outside of the truck bed .
For even more storage capacity the A - BAT comes with a large sliding drawer beneath the bed , accessible without opening the tailgate .
Although the A - BAT is rugged and has a spirited exterior , the interior team worked to create a modern look for the interior .
'We balanced colors and fabrics that were both bright and vibrant , but also captured an urban - rugged feel with their energetic and geometric qualities , ' said Alan Schneider , Project Chief Designer .
'
The inspiration behind the exposed structure on the interior was drawn from high - end mountain bike frames , ' added Daryl Harris , Senior Creative Designer .
' We applied lightweight construction materials , such as carbon fiber and aluminum , to the instrument panel , console and seats for increased structural rigidity while reducing mass .
'
The rigid , yet sculptured alloy center console runs between the two front seats and houses a portable power pack .
The battery pack offers both AC and DC for a wide variety of applications including powering tools , electrical gear while camping , a laptop computer , small appliances or assisting a vehicle jump start .
The door trim , shoulder , armrest and instrument panel pads and seat cushions are made of a tough , lightweight and comfortable material that can be selected for personalization .
In addition the colors are coordinated to enhance the sleek interior environment .
The center console and door pockets feature carbon fiber components to complete the durable and modern look .
The four - passenger A - BAT offers numerous seating and storage configurations .
In addition to the rear seats folding down with the midgate to extend the cargo bed length , the rear seat cushions can retract beneath the cargo bed to increase rear cab cargo flexibility .
A removable storage tray beneath the rear seat offers tie downs and organizing compartments to secure loose cargo .
Inside the A - BAT has a retractable portable navigation unit with a seven - inch diagonal screen and Wi-Fi internet .
Other advanced features include a port for portable device assistant synchronization and a hard drive for digital music .
The solar panels on the dash recapture energy from the sun to assist in the charging of the navigation unit , portable power pack and backlit information displays .
' This concept is the next evolution of the compact truck , ' said Hunter .
' We were able to create a compact truck that 's utilitarian , has an original profile compared to other pickup trucks , has a ' small , but tough ' character and is economical to operate .
The A - BAT is a fun - to - drive , practical package that reflects Toyota 's environmental sustainability message . '
-- from the Center for Inquiry 's report on its
" Credibility Project " ( see below )
Perhaps the senator 's most famous quote in the field of environmental " science " is :
" With all of the hysteria , all of the fear , all of the phony science , could it be that man-made global warming is the greatest hoax ever perpetrated on the American people ?
It sure sounds like it . "
For some time now , at taxpayer expense , the senator has had a pet project , which our environmental go - to guy A Siegel described in a recent Get Energy Smart Now post ( " the various incarnations of a “ report ” cobbling together statements from scientists that supposedly dissent from the scientific consensus on humanity ’s role in driving accelerating global warming .
This is a quite favorite ‘ denier ’ citation , the supposed 400 or 600 or 700 ( depending on which version ) number of scientists who have , supposedly , gone on record against the Theory of Global Warming .
And , they like to cite this as from the “ Senate Environment and Public Works Committee ” , without mentioning that this is a Minority Report from global - warming denier , fossil fool James Inhofe ’s staff .
Once upon a time , a senator named Joe McCarthy became famous for brandishing lists , usually lists of Communists in High Places , which unfortunately were n't subject to verification because he only brandished them -- for all anybody knew , they could have been his grocery list , or a quick - noted account of What the Voices Tell Me .
Well , somebody has finally taken a look at Senator Inhofe 's little list .
On Friday , the Center for Inquiry
In its press release , the CFI reports :
In this Senate Minority Report , almost 700 individuals with implied scientific credentials are offered as evidence that measures to address climate change are premature , and that further research is needed .
Sen .
Inhofe has used this report to support the claim that there is an ever - increasing international groundswell of scientific opposition to the position of approximately 2,000 scientists whose work is the basis of the United Nations Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change Science Report ( IPCC ) released in 2007 .
The Center for Inquiry maintains that the Senate Minority report fails to make a credible case that a large number of actual climate scientists take exception to the near - universal consensus of the research community .
“ It is beyond question that the work of the U.N. scientists has survived the scrutiny of their colleagues , and that they constitute a significant majority of active researches addressing this problem today .
This led us to take a careful look at the broad conclusions of the Senate Minority Report , ” said Dr. Stuart Jordan , science policy advisor to the CFI Office of Public Policy and retired emeritus senior staff scientist at the NASA Goddard Space Flight Center .
“ As a result of our assessment , Inhofe and other lawmakers using this report to block proposed legislation to address the harmful effects of climate change must face an inconvenient truth : while there are indeed some well respected scientists on the list , the vast majority are neither climate scientists , nor have they published in fields that bear directly on climate science . ”
However , After assessing 687 individuals named as “ dissenting scientists ” in the January 2009 version of the United States Senate Minority Report , the Center for Inquiry ’s Credibility Project found that :
• Slightly fewer than 10 percent could be identified as climate scientists .
• Approximately 15 percent published in the recognizable refereed literature on subjects related to climate science .
• Approximately 80 percent clearly had no refereed publication record on climate science at all .
• Approximately 4 percent appeared to favor the current IPCC - 2007 consensus and should not have been on the list .
Further examination of the backgrounds of these individuals revealed that a significant number were identified as meteorologists , and some of these people were employed to report the weather .
The CFI has published a brochure , Perhaps the senator 's most famous quote in the field of environmental " science " is :
For some time now , at taxpayer expense , the senator has had a pet project , which our environmental go - to guy A Siegel described in a recent Get Energy Smart Now post ( " Scientific inquiry concludes : Inhofe list " not credible . . . " ) as -- Once upon a time , a senator named Joe McCarthy became famous for brandishing lists , usually lists of Communists in High Places , which unfortunately were n't subject to verification because he only brandished them -- for all anybody knew , they could have been his grocery list , or a quick - noted account of What the Voices Tell Me .
Well , somebody has finally taken a look at Senator Inhofe 's little list .
On Friday , the Center for Inquiry issued a report based on what it calls " The Credibility Project , " which declared the latest version of Senator Inhofe 's list , in the form of a " Minority Report " from the EPW Committee , " not credible .
"
In its press release , the CFI reports : However , The CFI has published a brochure , downloadable as a PDF , summarizing the work and findings of " The Credibility Project . "
In his post , which provides a splendid summary of the report , A Siegel writes , " I have now read this multiple times and am more impressed , with each read , with how well done it is , powerful in how it is thoughtfully understated . "
He thinks that " every educated American should read and absorb " the brochure .
" It is that thoughtful and that important . "
The report concludes with a statement from the authors that they have " double - checked our results and are prepared to offer the following three conclusions " :
1 ) We think it is highly unlikely that a growing fraction of top climate scientists are becoming increasingly skeptical of human causation of global warming .
2 ) We think that the title “ Senate Minority Report ” is technically appropriate , but grossly understated .
That report ’s list does contain the names of some outstanding scientists , including at least one distinguished meteorologist .
However , when weighted against the much larger number of equally outstanding climate scientists , there is no doubt where the great majority of experts in this field stand .
3 ) Absent hard evidence that another likely candidate drives global warming , it is highly unlikely that man-made greenhouse gases do not play a significant and probably a major role in causing global warming .
The authors of this Credibility Project assessment are not qualified to assess the engineering and economic questions associated with proposed legislation addressing climate change .
However , we are disturbed by any document that may misrepresent the state of the global scientific effort to address this problem .
The report concludes with a statement from the authors that they have " double - checked our results and are prepared to offer the following three conclusions " :
#
If you were to draw up a list of Things We Survived While the Country Was Under Total Republcan Control During the Bush Regime , somewhere on that list -- I do n't say necessarily in the Top 10 , but somewhere on the list -- has to be :
Because Inhofe is not only a crusading global - warming denier but a rampaging fundy loon who believes the earth is man 's playpen to befoul and exhaust while awaiting the Rapture .
( It 's actually an insult to God to try to extend the life of the planet longer than He means us to be here . )
He has devoted his life to the promotion of ignorance and the forcible destruction of knowledge and honest inquiry in all known forms .
He is a savage and a bully .
And while he has championed pretty much the full range of dangerous and psychotic Far Right causes , he is known above all for his unwavering devotion to the pillaging and plundering of the environment .
And for four years he was chairman of the Senate EPW Committee .
He remains ranking minority member .
This God of his has one kinky sense of humor .

Last September , a service called My Name is E launched , promising to solve the ' social network portability ' problem – taking the hassle out of adding friends on social networks by aggregating your friend lists on to one site .
You could add a friend on My Name is E , which would then update your contacts across the other sites .
Nifty , eh ?
People were quick to sign up , eagerly handing over multiple usernames and passwords so My Name is E could do its stuff .
Judging by the number of recommendations it was receiving on Twitter , it was clearly an outstanding service .
But there was something odd about these messages .
Every recommendation was phrased the same : " I 'm now using My Name is E to add friends to my Twitter account ! More info on http://hellomynameise.com " .
It soon became apparent that My Name is E was logging in to Twitter as each of its users and sending these recommendations as them , but without their permission or knowledge .
" The autotweet was a kind of viral marketing , implemented by one of our developers for teasing our followers on Twitter , " says Andreas Creten , My Name is E 's lead developer .
" Unfortunately , we forgot to disable the feature before we launched . "
Angry backlash
The backlash was immediate , with angry complaints on Twitter and customer support forums .
" We disabled it as soon as users started complaining , " says Creten .
" We were surprised at the response – it was a good lesson .
Since we had people 's passwords we could take full control of their accounts , but people do n't like it when someone else uses their account to do something . "
Many of them not only felt angry at My Name is E , but also embarrassed that they were so publicly outed as being careless with their passwords .
A typical message on Get Satisfaction came from Paul Downey , chief web services architect at BT : " Thanks for making me look and feel stupid – it's me that gets to Twitter , not your password phishing bots ! "
Says Twitter 's API lead , Alex Payne : " We 've always advised users to only give their passwords to websites they feel they can trust .
Any website runs the risk of compromise , so giving out your credentials is always a gamble .
There 's little risk in using a desktop Twitter client , but we 've cautioned users against handing out their passwords to web - based services that are higher - value targets to attackers . "
No big deal ?
You may be thinking that this is no big deal .
After all , it 's only a Twitter password , not your bank details .
But this thinking is flawed .
" [ Hypothetically ] we could easily have logged into people 's mail accounts , intranets ... " says Creten , referring to the fact that many people use the same login details across multiple different sites .
Of course , in many cases if a hacker has access to your email account then they have access to all your accounts , because this is where your registration details for different services will have been sent .
Yet the " give us your email username / password to add your existing friends on this site " routine is becoming more and more common .
Twitter does it .
So does Get Satisfaction , Linked In , Yelp , Plaxo , Ning , FriendFeed , Orkut , iLike .
Hell , giants like MySpace and Facebook do it .
They can't all be wrong , surely ?
Jeremy Keith , technical director of user experience consultancy Clearleft , is unequivocal : " The message is being sent out that it 's okay to hand out passwords from one site on a completely different site .
If – or should I say when – this practice becomes commonplace then phishing and identity theft become so much easier : it teaches people how to be phished . "
" That should be rephrased ' has taught users how to be phished ' , " argues Simon Willison , technical architect at Guardian News and Media .
" The Facebook thing is n't a smart way of connecting members , it 's a horrible precedent . "

Rebooting Resembles February Event PASADENA , Calif . -- NASA 's Mars Reconnaissance
Orbiter is in safe mode and in communications with Earth after an unexpected rebooting of its computer Wednesday evening , June 3 .
The spontaneous reboot resembles a Feb. 23 event on the spacecraft .
Engineers concluded the most likely cause for that event was a cosmic ray or solar particle hitting electronics and causing an erroneous voltage reading .
Jim Erickson , Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter project manager at NASA 's Jet Propulsion Laboratory , Pasadena , Calif. , said , " The spacecraft is sending down high - rate engineering data , power positive , batteries fully charged , sun pointed and thermally safe .
The flight team is cautiously bringing the orbiter back to normal operations .
We should be resuming our exploration of Mars by next week . "
The reboot occurred at approximately 6:10 p.m. PDT ( 9:10 p.m. EDT ) on June 3 .
This is the sixth time since the spacecraft began its primary science phase in November 2006 that it has entered safe mode , which is its programmed precaution when it senses a condition for which it does not know a more specific response .

On this day in 1933 visual futurist Syd Mead was born in Saint Paul , Minnesota .
He started his career in 1959 working for Ford Motor Company , but for us fanboys our love affair with his work really starts 70s when he started to make the jump from slick looking industrial design to science fiction .
His early film work in Hollywood includes credits on the film Star Trek : The Motion Picture , 2010 , Tron , Aliens and even the comedy Short Circuit ( yes that was his robot design ! ) .
However his triumph for me was his preproduction work on Blade Runner :
Over the years Mead ’s work has n’t been limited to Hollywood , he ’s done for concept work on the anime series Mobile Suit Gundam and Space Cruiser Yamato — and even worked on a videogame or two .
On the surface it would be easy to say that Syd Mead has a knack for industrial design , but that would overlook his other devastating skills like dramatic layout , delicious draftsmanship and his powerful use of color on the page :
Het Magrittemuseum in Brussel opende zijn deuren in 2009
Wie kent Magritte niet ?
Het ontstaan van een museum
Het universum van een genie
De mysteries van een schilder
De persoon Magritte
Achter het afstandelijke
Praktisch
Lees verder
Iedereen kan voor de vuist wel enkele werken van de Belgische schilder opnoemen of zich minstens enkele doeken voor ogen halen : bijvoorbeeld ofof .
De amateur kunstliefhebber zal er wellicht nog een schepje bovenop kunnen doen met De Geheimzinnige Speler misschien of Het Geheugen en een pak meer in het hoofd .
Een groot deel ervan is nu permanent in hette Brussel te bezichtigen .
Niet het hele oeuvre jammer genoeg , maar dat is ook niet verwonderlijk gezien de internationale erkenning van de schilder van wie sommige topwerken in de grootste musea ter wereld hun plaats hebben gevonden .
Maar toch valt er veel moois te bewonderen in het voormalige Hotel Altenloh .
Door een samenwerking tussen de overheid en een privésponsor werd het gebouw , een van de vleugels van de , helemaal gerenoveerd .
De energiegroep GDF - Suez kwam over de brug met 6,5 miljoen euro voor renovatie , verbouwing en inrichting van het gebouw terwijl de Belgische staat met 1,2 miljoen euro de renovatie van de buitengevels bekostigde en voor de installatie van een lift zorgde .
Hieraan werd acht maanden gewerkt .
Het gebouw werd voorzien van 16m2 zonnepanelen en 300 m2 thermische schermen .
Er werden 600 spots geInstalleerd op laagspanning en er werd een besparing van 30 % op het elektriciteitsverbruik gerealiseerd .
De wereld vanis een magische , verwarring zaaiende wereld .
Op zich schildert hij doodgewone voorwerpen als daar zijn : een pijp , een appel , een paraplu , een bolhoed of vogels zoals de duif of de arend , of landschappen ( de zee , een berg ) of ( delen van ) huizen of mensen ( ( zaken ) mannen , een ( zijn ) vrouw ) .
De combinatie van deze elementen , zelfs het in elkaar verweven ervan schept verwarring , slaat ons met verbijstering .
Magritte stelt dingen in vraag , kaart het probleem van de conceptie der dingen aan en trekt dit door tot in het absurde door bijvoorbeeld woorden te schilderen in plaats van de voorwerpen die ze benoemen .
Het daagt de toeschouwer uit om na te denken over de wereld om ons heen .
Wat is waar en wat is niet waar ?
Hoe objectief is het beeld dat wij van de realiteit hebben ?
Tegelijkertijd snijdt hij het universele thema van de relatie tussen de schilderkunst en de werkelijkheid aan .
Het aangezicht van menig personage op Magrittes schilderijen is niet te zien omdat een voorwerp het bedekt ( een appel , een pijp ) of omdat het gesluierd is of gewoon omdat de persoon met de rug naar de toeschouwer afgebeeld staat .
De sluier in zijn werk gaat terug op de dood van zijn moeder die zelfmoord pleegde door verdrinking en werd opgevist met een door haar nachtkleed versluierd gelaat .
Het is een techniek die doorheen zijn hele werk loopt : een voorwerp verbergt een ander of vervangt het , achter wat je ziet zit iets anders verscholen , met andere woorden : alles wat je ziet en ervaart is relatief en kan ook op een andere manier worden geïnterpreteerd .
Magritte visualiseert de kern van alle ( goede ) kunst : je ziet niet wat je ziet , alles is gelaagd , ceci nest pas une pipe .
Als je dan ook nog weet dat Magritte gefascineerd werd door detectiveverhalen en politieseries , baart het geen verwondering dat er een zeker mysterie rond zijn personages waart .
Zo mysterieus en verwarrend zijn schilderijen zijn , zo saai en alledaags was zijn leven : een burgermannetje dat hoofdzakelijk in Brussel woonde en werkte en trouwde met zijn grote jeugdliefde .
Oorspronkelijk was hij ontwerper van reclameaffiches en werkte hij ook nog als tekenaar van patronen voor behangpapier .
Vandaar zijn rechtlijnige , precies afgeboorde doeken .
Geen grootse , overweldigende schilderkunst alsofmaar eenvoudige , realistische afbeeldingen , weliswaar met een uit het evenwicht brengende , onconventionele inslag .
Magrittes schilderijen lijken koud , afstandelijk en zonder gevoel , maar toch bezitten ze een soort van aparte poëzie die je zoetjes doen wegdromen ( Grote Familie , Zwarte Magie ) .
Ook een bepaalde vorm van humor is hem niet vreemd ( Het Onmogelijke Proberen , De Filosofische Lamp ) .
De geïnteresseerde bezoeker zal nog zovele andere aspecten in zijn schilderijen ontdekken .
Het is eigen aan een groot schilder dat hij zijn publiek aanzet om zijn werk te doorgronden en te duiden .
In het nieuwe Magrittemuseum aan het , dat een oppervlakte van 2000 m2 beslaat , kan men sinds 2 juni 2009 meer dan 270 kunstwerken en archiefstukken gaan bekijken .
Naast zijn bekende werk ( 200 schilderijen , olie op doek , gouaches , tekeningen , beeldhouwwerken en beschilderde voorwerpen ) zijn er ook 10 reclameaffiches , 10 muziekpartituren , brieven ( en een prachtig geschreven liefdesgedicht ) en 40 fotos tentoongesteld en kun je er films bekijken die door Magritte zelf werden geregisseerd .
Het bezoek aan de tentoonstelling , die chronologisch werd opgebouwd , start op de derde verdieping .
The biggest opportunity to improve the nation ’s energy situation is a major investment program to make homes and businesses more efficient , according to a study released Wednesday by the consulting firm McKinsey .
An investment of $ 520 billion in improvements like sealing ducts and replacing inefficient appliances could produce $ 1.2 trillion in savings on energy bills through 2020 , the study found .
The report said such a program , if carried out over the next decade , could cut the country ’s projected energy use in 2020 by about 23 percent , a savings that would be “ greater than the total energy consumption of Canada excluding transportation , ” Ken Ostrowski , a senior partner in McKinsey ’s Atlanta office , said at a forum in Washington on Wednesday .
It would also more than offset the growth in energy use that would be expected otherwise .
“ The scale is vast if we can put together the means to pursue it , ” Mr. Ostrowski said .
Homes account for about 35 percent of the potential efficiency gains , according to McKinsey , while the industrial sector accounts for 40 percent and the commercial sector 25 percent .
The report included only efficiency improvements whose long - term savings would outweigh the initial costs .
It did not consider the potential environmental benefits of cutting energy use .
The report acknowledged substantial barriers to achieving the savings , foremost among them the initial costs .
The $ 52 billion annual investment envisioned by McKinsey is four or five times more than the nation currently spends on energy efficiency , and would have to be maintained over a decade .
The economic stimulus package passed in February barely makes a dent ; by McKinsey ’s estimate , it contains $ 10 billion to $ 15 billion in spending on energy efficiency .

Shutterstock NRC 's methodology release has campuses nationwide eagerly awaiting the research council 's rankings .
Text Size A A
After repeated delays , the National Research Council on July 9 released the methodology behind its rankings of doctoral programs , including those in chemistry and chemical engineering .
The methods represent a departure from previous assessments , abandoning reliance on reputation surveys in favor of a more data - intensive approach .
A release date for the rankings themselves has not been scheduled .
The assessments by the research council , which functions under the National Academy of Sciences , are a valued resource for students , educators , and administrators , but they were last updated in 1995 .
The release of the new rankings , to be based largely on data from the 2005 – 06 academic year , have been postponed on multiple occasions .
" It 's frustrating for everybody — the longer it takes to get the rankings out , the more dated the information becomes , " says Charles A. Wight , a physical chemist and dean of the graduate school at the University of Utah .
" But there 's also a sense that people would rather have things done right " than done hastily , he says .
That 's also the council 's view , says Jeremiah P. Ostriker , chair of the committee overseeing the project .
Each program will have a range of rankings , in order to stress inherent uncertainties in the analysis , he says .
Rankings are based on 20 criteria in three areas : scholarly activity , student support , and diversity .
In addition to an overall ranking range , programs will be ranked in those three areas .
Data for several criteria , such as degree completion rates , have never before been collected or disseminated on a nationwide scale , Wight notes .
Furthermore , weights given to criteria are driven by faculty input , says Ostriker , an astrophysicist and former provost at Princeton University .
What 's deemed an important measure of program quality " turns out to be quite different in different fields , " he says .
Where possible , measures will be reported per capita of full - time faculty , in efforts to avoid giving artificial advantages to larger programs .
Rankings may be released by the end of 2009 , Ostriker speculates .
" Now that the methodology is in place , we hope to update rankings more quickly in the future , " he says .

The 16 men who died in the North Sea helicopter crash disaster were called " heroes " at a memorial service .
Prince Charles and Prime Minister Gordon Brown joined hundreds of relatives of the victims at the Kirk of St Nicholas in Aberdeen .
A candle was lit in memory of each of the men who died as their names were read aloud .
The men died when their Super Puma crashed off the Aberdeenshire coast two weeks ago .
Camilla , Duchess of Rothesay , and Scottish First Minister Alex Salmond were also in attendance at the memorial , as were about 100 workers from the Miller platform , from which the helicopter had been returning .
Candles were lit for each of the men who died A screen was erected on Union Street to relay the service outside , and was watched by hundreds more people .
The service was conducted by the Reverend Andrew Jolly , chaplain to the North Sea oil and gas industry .
He said : " This occasion must be for us all today a time of great sadness and sorrow .
" Those of us here and those who join us outside and offshore and around the world cannot begin to imagine the pain and sorrow the relatives of those who perished on 1 April , 2009 must be feeling at this time . "
He said those affected would never forget what had happened .
He added of the book of condolence : " It 's important I believe at this time that such a book is created , for it serves to remind us of those who are the heroes of this industry .
Safety is the ultimate priority for those who work in the North Sea .
Let that stand as a memorial we can give to the lives of those who died so tragically in this accident
Alex Salmond
First Minister
" They have paid the ultimate price for the richness harvested below the seabed . "
Mr Jolly said he would fly out to the Miller platform on Thursday to conduct a further memorial for those who could not attend .
Wednesday 's service also honoured a 17th man who died in an unrelated offshore accident on the same day as the Bond Super Puma accident .
David Stephenson , 44 , of Willow Bridge , Northumberland , was a crewman on the Well Servicer , operated by Technip .
Speaking after the service , Mr Salmond said : " Today 's service was an important opportunity for the families , friends and colleagues of those lost in this tragic accident to come together and remember them .
" The service was simple , dignified and enormously moving .
It will mean a great deal to the families , as will the turnout from thousands of people to make their own tribute .
" Our thoughts are with the loved ones of the victims , and also with those in the emergency and voluntary services whose heroic efforts on the day of the accident sadly proved to be in vain . "
He added : " Safety is the ultimate priority for those who work in the North Sea .
Let that stand as a memorial we can give to the lives of those who died so tragically in this accident . "
Aberdeen businessman Sir Ian Wood , chairman of the multi-million pound energy services firm John Wood Group , said : " The first emotion from the oil and gas industry is deep sorrow and sympathy for the families . "
Permanent memorial
He said a safe environment was needed in the industry .
The memorial , which started at 1400 BST , was broadcast live on BBC Two Scotland , BBC Radio Scotland Medium Wave and on the BBC news website .
The Super Puma helicopter had been returning from BP's Miller oil platform when it crashed about 11 miles north east of Peterhead on 1 April .
All 14 passengers and two crew members on board were killed .
Those who died in North Sea crash
Eight of the victims came from the north east of Scotland , seven from the rest of the UK , and one from Latvia .
Early discussions have taken place on a possible permanent memorial for the victims of the Super Puma crash .
The matter will be discussed by the newly - formed Helicopter Accident Issues Task Group .
On Tuesday , Grampian Police said the bodies of 13 of the victims were being returned to their families .
They said the other three would be released as soon as possible .
The wreckage was recovered from the seabed .
It included the black box flight recorder , the fuselage with the engines and rotor gearbox attached , the separated rotor head with the main rotor blades still attached , and the separated tail .
An initial report by the Air Accidents Investigation Branch found the helicopter had suffered a " catastrophic " failure in its main rotor gearbox .

Dude I had a fucking crazy night last night
< Thomas > yeah ?
< Narcissus >
So you know how Jason is basically a crazy redneck ?

< Narcissus > we 're just kind of stumbling around laughing , but Jason takes a fence post , UPROOTS the motherfucker , and just Braveheart charges this field of geese
< Narcissus > the geese start going apeshit as he 's swinging like mad , just honking like crazy tearing up the river
< Narcissus > the three of us do n't know what to do , but three generations of inbreeding sure as hell did .
The fucker cracks one of the geese over the head , and it 's just frozen , sort of stunned
< Narcissus > without a second of hesitation , Jason grabs his dull ass pocket knife and just pounces on the goose , stabbing wildly , and let me tell you .. there 's a fuckton of blood in a goose
< Narcissus > this thing is hemorrhaging blood , completely covering him , but he keeps stabbing it
< Thomas > wtf dude ?
that 's fucking nuts
< Narcissus > just listen , it gets worse
< Narcissus >
We are completely dumbfounded , we do n't know what the fuck just happened , but we 're pretty sure it 's extremely illegal
< Narcissus > we decide to wrap up the goose in Aaron 's jacket and take it back to the apartments
< Narcissus > so we walk like 3 miles back , and take it to the field by the power station
< Narcissus > Jason 's not done though , he takes his dull blade and SKINS THE MOTHERFUCKING GOOSE
< Narcissus > takes out the entrails , the whole nine yards , takes for fucking ever

Now that 's a fucking adventure
< Narcissus > yeah , I know , but just imagine this episode of cops :
< Narcissus > four college age guys , drunk , walk out of a darkened field in the middle of a city at 3 A.M. after spending several hours working on something , and one of them is COVERED in blood , holding a dull , bloody knife , claiming to have just hunted , skinned , and then completely thrown away an entire goose
< Narcissus > you can't right better shit than that

A record low 43 per cent of 375 million eligible voters cast ballots in European elections , a dismal result that could dent the credibility of the European Parliament , according to estimates early today .
Pollster TNS - Opinion 's estimate said just over 161 million people participated .
Margot Wallstrom , the EU commissioner in charge of raising public awareness of the EU , called the low turnout " a bad result " , adding it showed the need to work to change the perception that the European Union is detached from its citizens .

She said governments must make Europe a bigger factor in domestic politics to combat voter apathy and ignorance at a time when the 736 - member EU legislature is exerting more influence and power over how the 27 - nation bloc is run .
The legislature has powers to vote on or amend two - thirds of all EU laws .
" It does n't help to run European election campaigns on national agendas , " Wallstrom said .
" We have a number of lessons to learn , for the ( EU ) institutions and for the member states ... to connect better to the citizens . "
The EU is hobbled by an enduring phenomenon : While European governments and mainstream politicians tend to take a European perspective , voters think and choose nationally .
The low voter turnout , and victories for fringe parties wanting to reduce the powers and size of the EU , underscored how unsuccessful the EU has been in making itself relevant in the eyes of the European electorate .
The first signs that the general public views the EU as an aloof project became evident in 2005 when French and Dutch voters rejected a European constitution .
That charter has since been watered - down to a reform treaty which was rejected in a 2008 referendum in Ireland .
The Irish will stage a second referendum in the fall .
Early results and predictions :
About 200 people have clashed in the northern city of Manchester as the leader of the whites - only British National Party tried to enter the city 's town hall .
British politicians fear an electoral breakthrough for the BNP in the European parliamentary elections .
Anti-racism campaigners say a win for the BNP would be the first time Britons have sent an extreme - right politician to Brussels .
Police said one man was arrested in the clashes between anti-fascist protesters and BNP supporters of party leader Nick Griffin .
Meanwhile , an exit poll in Sweden indicates the new populist Pirate Party will be a major surprise in European Parliament elections .
The public broadcaster SVT survey says the Pirate Party , which advocates shortening the duration of copyright protection and allowing non-commercial file - sharing , has won 7.4 per cent of the Swedish vote .
The survey shows the main opposition Social Democrats getting 25 per cent , up slightly from the previous European Parliament elections in 2004 .
In second place was the conservative Moderate Party , Sweden 's leading party in the centre - right coalition government , also up slightly with 18.5 per cent support .
One of the biggest losers in the Swedish vote was the Left Party , which the exit poll gave 5.7 per cent - down from 12.8 per cent in 2004 .
Sweden has 18 seats in the European assembly .
In Madrid , Spain 's Conservative Popular Party has won two more seats in the European Parliament than the ruling Socialists with over 88 percent of the vote counted .
The Popular Party won 23 seats , earning 42 percent of Spain 's vote compared to the Socialists , who captured 21 seats with 38.6 percent of the vote .
Minor parties claimed five seats Sunday -- United Left and the Coalition for Europe won two seats each and Union for Progress and Democracy elected one candidate .
Spain , with 43.8 million people , has 50 seats in the 736 - seat EU parliament .
Both main parties focused on the world economic downturn but voters appeared more interested in domestic issues .
A total of 35.5 million people were eligible to vote and turnout was just over 45 percent .

PORT OF SPAIN ( Reuters ) - The United States is ready to talk to Cuba , Secretary of State Hillary Clinton said on Thursday as Caribbean leaders piled pressure on Washington to end its sanctions against the island .
Secretary of State Hillary Clinton ( C ) waits inside the national palace during a meeting with Haiti's President Rene Preval in Port - au - Prince April 16 , 2009 .

A day before the start of a 34 - nation Summit of the Americas that excludes Cuba , the issue of the hemisphere ’s only one - party communist state and U.S. hostility toward it was dominating diplomatic activity in the region .
President Barack Obama , who hopes to open up a new era of improved cooperation with Latin America and the Caribbean at the three - day meeting in Trinidad and Tobago , earlier this week relaxed parts of the 47 - year - old U.S. trade embargo on Cuba .
But he says he expects Havana to reciprocate by giving more human rights and democracy to its citizens , and that the embargo will remain in place until this is forthcoming .
After talks with Clinton in Haiti on Thursday , Haitian President Rene Preval said he hoped that Cuba could take part in the next summit meeting of leaders of the hemisphere .
“ My wish , and it is a wish already expressed several times by the United Nations General Assembly , is that the embargo be lifted , ” Preval said in the Haitian capital , Port - au - Prince .
Clinton said she agreed with the emphasis on moving toward dialogue throughout the hemisphere .
“ We stand ready to discuss with Cuba additional steps that could be taken , ” she said .
But she made clear Washington was also waiting for Havana to make a contribution to an improvement of relations .
“ We would like to see Cuba open up its society , release political prisoners , open up to outside opinion and media and have the kind of society that we all know would improve the opportunities for the Cuban people , ” Clinton said .
In the buildup to the summit , Obama has faced a growing chorus of calls from Latin American governments -- including regional heavyweight Brazil and oil producer Venezuela -- to end the U.S. policy of trying to isolate Cuba .
Critics say the policy has failed to foster change in Cuba and , on the contrary , has isolated Washington in the region .
CHAVEZ AND LEFT -WING ALLIES
Washington wants the Trinidad and Tobago summit to focus its attention on tackling the global economic crisis that threatens to reverse recent growth in Latin America and the Caribbean and to send millions back into poverty .
While U.S. officials say they do n’t want leaders to be “ distracted ” by the sensitive Cuba issue , Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez had pledged to demand at the summit Cuba ’s return to regional groups , like the summit meetings .
The voluble Venezuelan leader , a fierce critic of Obama ’s conservative predecessor George W. Bush , said on Thursday he would not sign the summit draft declaration , which speaks of cooperation to fight poverty and inequality but does not mention the issue of Cuba .
“ I ask the question :
Where is there more democracy , in the United States or Cuba ?
Who has the democracy meter to measure that ? ”
Chavez asked during a meeting in eastern Venezuela with left - wing allies , including Cuban President Raul Castro .
“ I have no doubt in saying : there ’s more democracy in Cuba than in the United States , ” he added .
Like Castro , he wore military uniform .
The Summit of the Americas falls on the anniversary of one of the worst U.S. foreign policy fiascos in recent history , the Bay of Pigs invasion of Cuba on April 17 - 19 , 1961 .
CIA - supported Cuban exiles were routed in a battle that consolidated communist rule 90 miles from U.S. soil .
In an op - ed article on Thursday , Obama urged the region ’s leaders not to get bogged down in old debates .
“ We must choose the future over the past , because we know that the future holds enormous opportunities if we work together , ” he wrote , calling for a partnership “ on fundamental issues like economic recovery , energy and security ” .
But other leaders seem set on raising the Cuba issue .
“ We feel very strongly that Cuba can be seen as one of the important members of the Caribbean community and that the time for the continued isolation of Cuba is really at an end , ” St. Kitts and Nevis Prime Minister Denzil Douglas said .
Cuba was suspended from the 35 - member Organization of American States ( OAS ) in 1962 because the communist system created by Fidel Castro after he took power in a 1959 revolution was judged incompatible with OAS principles .

So what ’s the terrible secret of Esther , the titular European orphan adopted by Vera Farmiga and Peter Sarsgaard who ’s very clearly responsible for all the terrible things that happen in the trailer ?
According to someone who ’s seen it , this :
Esther is really a 33 - year - old woman who was born with proportional dwarfism which causes her to have the appearance of a child .
She also happens to be a former prostitute , who had wealthy pedophiles for clients .
[ Update : She is apparently not a former prostitute . ]
The reason why she has her neck covered is because she was once in asylum and she struggled so much in her straitjacket that it left with her deep scars on her neck .

One of the most powerful figures at Wikipedia has resigned after it was discovered he'd been editing entries under bogus names .
David Boothroyd , who is also a British politician , had even used the fake account to edit the pages of political opponents .
As well as being a registered volunteer editor , Boothroyd had been elected to the powerful Wikipedia Arbitration Committee : a group of around 15 editors which make final and binding decisions for any disputes on the site that cannot be resolved informally .
In some cases , the committee could even overrule Wikipedia founder Jimmy Wales .
Scientology Ban
The committee most recently made headlines when it voted to ban any edits made from the IP address of the Church of Scientology .
The committee ruled that users with such addresses had made too many biased edits .
It also decided that any user who appeared to be using the site solely to make changes to Scientology articles , whether in favor or against , would be banned for a year .
Boothroyd , who had been a member of the committee since 2007 , quit after it was discovered he had edited pages under accounts other than his main user name ( ' Sam Blacketer ' ) .
These included changes to pages for British Conservative party leader David Cameron -- it 's reported Boothroyd changed this page more than any other .
( Source : theregister.co.uk )
Procedure , Not Politics
In the British tabloids the issue has been a political one , since Boothroyd is an elected member of the Labour party .
However , the issue at Wikipedia is a procedural one .
Using multiple accounts ( also known as ' sock puppetry ' ) , is highly frowned upon as it can be used to artificially boost the support for a particular position or belief .

VANCOUVER --
Off in the distance , a unicycle rolls around the ellipse that circles downtown 's Esther Short Park .
Nothing unusual there , though you might think of Vancouver as more of a meat , potatoes and bicycles - only kind of town .
But there 's something different about this unicycle .
There 's a blocky - looking thing under the saddle .
And the rider is n't pedaling , yet the contraption is moving .
And the rider is playing a guitar .
By the time the rider rolls into closer view , it 's clear that the unicycle is battery - powered .
And it 's clear that the rider is doing his best to promote the wizardry of inventor Daniel Wood .
Wood , a high school dropout and self - taught engineer , invented the electric , gyroscope - packed , one - wheeled cycle to help launch a new company in downtown Vancouver .
The invention is known as the SBU -- for Self - Balancing Unicycle -- and offers the promise of taking some of the circus - stunt nature of the unicycle to the masses .
The SBU delivers on one - half of the equation -- front to back balancing -- but the rider still must figure out the essential left and right balancing that 's essential to turning and staying upright .
Nevertheless ,
Wood , a 30 - year - old refugee from a Vancouver high - tech firm where he was laid off last year , has created a product that appears to have few parallels in the market .
The SBU
Inventor : Daniel Wood
Owner : Focus Designs , co-founders Daniel Wood and Bobby Wood
Base product : Conventional unicycle from Seattle Bike Supply , retrofitted with SBU equipment
Construction site : Basement , 110 W. 13th St. , Vancouver
Web : focusdesigns.com
He 's spent more than two years developing and perfecting the design with this in mind : " I wanted to make something I would want to ride . "
There are other electric unicycles , and the two - wheeled Segway has shown the importance of gyroscopes in keeping a wheeled vehicle from tipping .
But the SBU appears to be one of a handful to have combined the two features .
Now Wood and his partners need people to pay $ 1,599 apiece for an SBU in the midst of a recession .
Four units are on order , all from people who have said they 're interested in being distributors .
Wood has gotten two technological gadgetry celebrities on the SBU -- Adam Savage , host of the Discovery Channel 's " MythBusters , " and Dean Kamen , inventor of the Segway .
Savage contacted
Wood just moments after he saw a story about the SBU on the Web site , gizmodo.com .
" I gotta have one , " Savage recalled telling Wood in an e-mail .
Savage , whose program regularly features construction of contraptions , is a longtime unicyclist .
He commuted on them when he lived in New York City and , to amaze his friends , he 'd bounce down stairs on a unicycle or juggle while riding one .
So he was eager to try out the SBU when Wood and his friends arrived on the " MythBusters " set in January .
He quickly was hooked .
" I love it ! "
Savage said in the phone interview .
He keeps the SBU on the set .
A regular unicycle and the SBU are different enough that it's an apples to oranges comparison , Savage said .
The biggest difference would be starting and stopping .
The SBU 's internal gyroscope senses , through the rider 's movement , whether he wants
to go forward , slow down or stop .
Lean forward enough , and it can go faster -- up to 10 mph .
A skilled rider can ride uphill and downhill as easily as on flat ground .
But it takes a skilled rider to make the SBU perform at all .
First - time riders will spend much of their introductory moments sitting on the saddle , walking the SBU with one foot and making tentative attempts to roll with both feet on pedal - size platforms .
Most people can be up and going in 45 minutes , Wood said .
The Segway 's Kamen was n't one of them .
While Wood was able to get the famous inventor on an SBU during a visit to Kamen 's house in New Hampshire during a robotics conference last year , the Segway inventor needed help to stay aboard .
Even Savage says the SBU 's commercial prospects are challenging .
" It seems to me a fairly niche market , " he said .
" But someone had to do this .
It just had to get done . "

Before the 18th century , scientists and non-scientists alike assumed that the material substance of living organisms was fundamentally different from that of non-living things -- organisms and their products were considered organic by definition , while non-living things were mineral or inorganic .
With the invention of chemistry in the late 18th century , scientists uncovered the incoherence of the traditional distinction : all material substances are constructed from the same set of chemical elements .
Today we understand that the special properties of living organic matter emerge from the interactions of a large variety of large molecules built mostly with atoms of carbon , oxygen , and hydrogen .
Chemists now use the word organic to describe all complex , carbon - based molecules — whether or not they are actually products of an organism or products of laboratory synthesis .
But many educated people in Western countries think that only some crops and cows are organic , while all others are not .
How can one simple word -- organic -- have such different meanings ?
Through the 19th and 20th centuries , increased scientific understanding , technological innovations , and social mobility changed the face of American agriculture .
Large - scale farming became more industrialized and more efficient .
In 1800 , farmers made up 90 % of the American labor force ; by 1900 , their proportion had decreased to 38 % , and in 1990 , it was only 2.6 % .
However , not everyone was happy with these societal changes , and there were calls in the United States and Europe for a return to the preindustrial farming methods of earlier times .
This movement first acquired the moniker organic in 1942 , when J. I. Rodale began publication in America of Organic Farming & Gardening , a magazine still in circulation today .
According to Rodale and his acolytes , products created by — and processes carried out by — living things are fundamentally different from lab - based processes and lab - created products .
The resurrection of this prescientific , vitalistic notion of organic essentialism did not make sense to scientists who understood that every biological process is fundamentally a chemical process .
In fact , all food , by definition , is composed of organic chemicals .
As a result , the U.S. Department of Agriculture ( USDA ) refused to recognize organic food as distinguishable in any way from nonorganic food .
The “ organic food ” movement was not taken seriously by U.S. government agencies until 1990 , when lobbyists convinced Congress to mandate the establishment of a certification process for organic foods .
Twelve years later , organic farmers finally obtained rules they wanted to prevent impostors from siphoning off market share .
But as the USDA emphasizes , the " basis of these standards is on process , not product . "
In other words , organic food is defined not by any material substance in the food itself , but instead by the " holistic " methods used on organic farms .
Furthermore , the physical attributes of the product and any effects it might have on environment or health are explicitly excluded from U.S. , European , and international definitions .
The implicit , unproven assumption is that organic agriculture is -- by its very nature -- better for the environment than so - called conventional farming .
The European Commission states as a matter of fact that " organic farmers use a range of techniques that help sustain ecosystems and reduce pollution . "
Yet , according to self - imposed organic rules , genetic modification in the laboratory is strictly forbidden , even if its purpose is to reduce an animal 's negative impact on the environment .
( Canadian scientists have already engineered pigs to secrete an enzyme in their saliva that reduces the polluting phosphorous content of their manure by up to 75 % . )
On the other hand , spontaneous mutations caused by deep - space cosmic rays are always deemed acceptable -- without any testing -- since they occur " naturally . "
In reality , laboratory scientists can make subtle and precise changes to an organism 's DNA sequence , while high - energy cosmic rays can break chromosomes into pieces that reattach randomly and sometimes create genes that did n't previously exist .
Even more than a concern for the environment , organic producers and consumers are driven by faith in the presumed health benefits of their holistically produced food .
In The Future of Food , Canadian farmer Marc Loiselle explains , “ the underpinning of my conversion to organic food is not so much the economic point , it ’s the health point , to protect my health , to protect my family ’s health and my neighbors ’ . ”
Irrespective of whether they buy into the health rhetoric or not , western consumers have been led to believe that organic farmers are never allowed to use toxic chemical pesticides .
In fact , this carefully cultivated beliefs is simply false .
Pyrethrin ( with the formula C21H28O3 ) is one of several common toxic chemicals sprayed onto fruit trees by organic farmers ( even on the day of harvesting ) ; another allowed chemical is rotenone ( C23H22O6 ) , a potent neurotoxin , long used to kill fish , and recently linked to Parkinson 's disease { Betarbet , 2000 # 1258} .
How can organic farmers justify the use of these chemical pesticides ?
The answer comes from the delusion that substances produced by living organisms are not really chemicals .
Since pyrethrin is extracted from chrysanthemums and rotenone comes from a native Indian vine , they are deemed organic instead .
However , the most potent toxins known to humankind , including ricin and strychnine , are all natural and organic .
In fact , all currently used pesticides -- both natural and synthetic -- dissipate quickly and pose a miniscule risk to consumers .
As the National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences explains ,
while pesticides may be found in many products , the levels at which they are present fall far below the levels known to not cause any health effects .
The fact that they are found at all is only due to the significant advances in analytical chemistry .
The tests are now so sensitive that the detection level that can be easily reached is equivalent to detecting one teaspoon of salt in one million gallons of water .
Levels even lower than that can sometimes be detected .
Nevertheless , faith in nature ’s beneficence can still be fatal to some children .
About 5 % express severe allergic reactions to certain types of natural food , and every year , unintentional ingestion causes hundreds of thousands of cases of anaphylactic shock with hundreds of deaths .
The triggering agents are actually a tiny number of well - defined proteins in certain foods — including peanuts , soybeans , tree nuts , eggs , milk , and shellfish — that are resistant to digestive fluids .
These specific proteins linger in the intestines long enough to provoke an allergic immune response in susceptible people .
No society has been willing to ban the use of any allergenic ingredients in processed foods , even though this approach could save lives and reduce much human suffering .
GM technology could offer a more palatable alternative : the use of targeted RNA silencing technologies to turn off plant allergen genes .
With this approach , scientists have already created low allergenicity soy , and promising results have been reported for both peanuts and shrimp .
Some day perhaps , conventional soy and peanut farmers will all switch production to low - allergenicity GM crop varieties .
If that day arrives , organic food produced with GM - free organic soy or peanuts will be certifiably more dangerous to human health than comparable non-organic products .
Unfortunately , conventional farmers have no incentive to plant reduced - allergy seeds when sales of their current crops are unrestricted , especially when the public has been led to believe that all genetic modifications create health risks .
In the current social and economic climate , much of the critical research required to turn promising results into viable products is simply not pursued .
As a result , anti-GM , organic food advocates may be indirectly responsible for avoidable deaths of future children .

The Adventures of a Pythonista in Schemeland /28
by Michele Simionato
June 20 , 2009
Summary
If there is a topic which is likely to engender a flame war between Schemers and Lispers , that topic is hygienic macros .
It is the time to face it , and to explain what people mean when they allude to the " hygiene problem " .
Advertisement
Hygienic macros
In episode 9 I noted that Scheme provides three major macro systems ( syntax - rules , syntax - case and define - macro ) , yet I went on to discuss my own personal macro system , sweet - macros .
The decision was motivated by various reasons .
First of all , I did not want to confuse my readers by describing too many macro systems at the same time .
Secondly , I wanted to make macros easier and more debuggable .
Finally , sweet - macros are slightly more powerful than the other macro systems , with a better support for guarded patterns and with a few extensibility features which I have not shown yet ( but I like to keep some trick under my sleeve ; ) .
After 19 episodes about macros , I can safely assume that my readers are not beginners anymore .
It is time to have a look at the larger Scheme world and to compare / contrast sweet - macros with the other macro systems .
I do not want to discuss all the macro systems in existence here , therefore I will skip a few interesting systems such as syntactic closures and explicit renaming macros .
However , readers interested in alternative macro systems for Scheme should have a look at this excellent post by Alex Shinn which summarizes the current situation better than I could do .
Notice that Alex is strongly biased against syntax - case and very much in favor of explicit renaming macros .
The two systems are not incompatible though , and actually Larceny provides a syntax - case implementation built on top of explicit renaming macros ( see also SRFI - 72 ) .
syntax - match vs syntax - rules syntax - rules can be quite trivially defined in terms of syntax - match : ( def-syntax ( syntax - rules ( literal ... ) ( patt templ ) ... ) #'( syntax - match ( literal ... ) ( sub patt #' templ ) ... ) )
As you see , the main difference between syntax - rules ( apart for a missing sub ) is that syntax - rules automatically adds the syntax - quote #' operator to you templates .
That means that you cannot use quasisyntax tricks and that syntax - rules is strictly less powerful than syntax - match .
The other difference is that syntax - rules macros do not have guarded patterns ; the most direct consequence is that providing good error messages for incorrect syntax is more difficult .
You may learn everything you ever wanted to know about syntax - rules in the Syntax - Rules Primer for the Mildly Insane by Al Petrofsky .
syntax - match vs syntax - case
In principle , syntax - case could be defined in terms of syntax - match as follows : ( def - syntax syntax - case ( syntax - match ( ) ( sub ( syntax - case x ( literal ... ) ( patt guard skel ) ... ) #'( syntax - match x ( literal ... ) ( sub patt skel guard ) ... ) ) ( sub ( syntax - case x ( literal ... ) ( patt skel ) ... ) #'( syntax - match x ( literal ... ) ( sub patt skel ) ... ) ) ))
In reality , syntax - case is a Scheme primitive and syntax - match is defined on top of it .
So , syntax - case has theoretically the same power as syntax - match , but in practice syntax - match is more convenient to use .
The major syntactic difference is the position of the guard , which in syntax - case is positioned before the skeleton , whereas in syntax - match is positioned after the skeleton I did spent a lot of time thinking about the right position for the guard : I hate gratuitous breaking , but I convinced myself that the position of the guard in syntax - case is really broken , so I had to fix the issue .
The problem with syntax - case is that while the pattern is always in the first position , you never know what is in the second position : it could be the guard or the template ; in order to distinguish the possibilities you have to check if there is a third expression in the clause and that is annoying , In syntax - match the template is always in the second position ; if there is something in the third position , it is always a guard ; moreover , there could be another expression in the clause ( in the fourth position ) which is used as alternative template if the guard is not satisfied .
The advantage of having fixed positions is that it is easier to write higher order macros expanding to syntax - match transformers ( syntax - match itself is implemented in terms of syntax - case where the template are not in fixed position and I had to make the implementation more complex just to cope with that ) .
You may learn ( nearly ) everything there is to know about syntax - case in the the book The Scheme Programming Language by Kent Dybvig .
syntax - match versus define - macro Nowadays macros based on define - macro are much less used than in past because macro systems based on pattern matching are much more powerful , easier and safer to use .
The R6RS specification made syntax - case enter in the standard and it is the preferred macro system for most implementation .
Nowadays , there is a good chance that your Scheme implementation does not provide define - macro out of the box , therefore you need to implement it in term of syntax - case ( or syntax - match ) .
Here is an example of such an implementation : ( def - syntax define - macro ( syntax - match ( ) ( sub ( define - macro ( name . params ) body1 body 2 ... )
#'( define - macro name ( lambda params body1 body 2 ... ) ) ) ( sub ( define - macro name expander ) #'( def - syntax ( name . args ) ( datum - > syntax #'name ( apply expander ( syntax -> datum #'args ) ) ) ) ) ) )
The code should be clear : the arguments of the macro are converted into a regular list which is then transformed with the expander , and converted back into a syntax object in the context of the macro .
define - macro macros are based on simple list manipulations and are very easy to explain and to understand : unfortunately , they are affected by the hygiene problem .
You can find examples of use of define - macro in many references ; I learned it from Teach Yourself Scheme in Fixnum Days by Dorai Sitaram .
The hygiene problem
If you have experience in Common Lisp or other Lisp dialects , you will have heard about the problem of hygiene in macros , a.k.a. the problem of variable capture .
As Paul Graham puts it , errors caused by variable capture are rare , but what they lack in frequency they make up in viciousness .
The hygiene problem is the main reason why define - macro is becoming less and less used in the Scheme world .
PLT
Scheme has being deprecating it for years and nowadays even Chicken Scheme , which traditionally used define - macro , has removed it from the core , by using hygienic macros instead : this is the reason why the current Chicken ( Chicken 4 ) is called " hygienic Chicken " .
You can find good discussions of the hygiene problem in Common Lisp in many places ; I am familiar with Paul Graham 's book On Lisp which I definitively recommend : chapter 9 on variable capture has influenced this section .
Another good reference is the chapter about syntax - case - by Kent Dybvig - in the book Beautiful Code .
Here I will give just a short example exhibiting the problem , for the sake of the readers unfamiliar with it .
Consider this " dirty " definition of the for loop : ( define - macro ( dirty - for i i1 i2 . body ) `( let ( ( start , i1 ) ( stop , i2 ) ) ( let loop ( ( , i start ) ) ( unless ( >= , i stop ) , @body ( loop (+ 1 , i ) ) ) ) ) )
Superficially define - macro looks quite similar to def-syntax , except that in the macro body you need to a add a comma in front of each macro argument argument .
Internally , however , macros based on define - macro are completely different .
In particular , they are not safe under variable capture and that may cause surprises .
For instance , code such as > ( let ( ( start 42 ) ) ( dirty - for i 1 3 ( display start ) ( newline ) ) ) 1 1 prints the number 1 ( twice ) and not the number 42 !
The reason is clear if you expand the macro ( notice the if you implement define - macro in terms of syntax - match then syntax - expand still works ) : > ( syntax - expand ( dirty - for i 1 3 ( display start ) ( newline ) ) ) ( let ( ( start 1 ) ( stop 3 ) ) ( let loop ( ( i start ) ) ( unless ( >= i stop ) ( display start ) ( newline ) ( loop (+ 1 i ) ) ) ) )
Since the inner variable start is shadowing the outer variable start , the number 1 is printed instead of the number 42 .
The problem can be solved by introducing unique identifiers in the macro by means of gensym ( gensym is not in the R6RS standard , but in practice every Scheme implementation has it ; for convenience I have included it in my ( aps compat ) compatibility library ) .
The dirty - for macro can be improved to use gensym for every variable which is internally defined ( and it is not a macro argument ) : ( define - macro ( less - dirty - for i i1 i2 . body ) ( let ( ( start ( gensym ) ) ( stop ( gensym ) ) ( loop ( gensym ) ) ) `( let ( ( , start , i1 ) ( , stop , i2 ) ) ( let , loop ( ( , i , start ) ) ( unless ( >= , i , stop ) , @body ( , loop (+ 1 , i ) ) ) ) ) ) ) > ( let ( ( start 42 ) ) ( less - dirty - for i 1 3 ( display start ) ( newline ) ) ) 42 42 less - dirty - for works because all internal variables have now unique names that cannot collide with existing identifiers by construction .
You can see the names used internally by invoking syntax - expand ( notice that by construction such names change every time you expand the macro ) : > ( syntax - expand ( less - dirty - for i 1 3 ( display i ) ) ) ; in Ikarus ( let (( #{g0 |K!ZoUGmIIl%SrMfI|} 1 ) ( #{g1 |qecoGeEAOv0R8$ %0|} 3 ) ) ( let #{g2 |kD?xfov61j0 $ G1 =M|} ( ( i #{g0 |K!ZoUGmIIl%SrMfI|} ) ) ( unless ( >= i #{g1 |qecoGeEAOv0R8 $ %0|} ) ( display i ) ( #{g2 |kD?xfov61j0 $ G1=M|} (+ 1 i ) ) ) ) )
Unfortunately less - dirty - for is not really clean .
gensym cannot do anything to solve the free - symbol capture problem ( I am using Paul Graham 's terminology here ) .
The problem is that identifiers used ( but not defined ) in the macro have the scope of expanded code , not the scope of the original macro : in particular , if the outer scope in expanded code redefines the meaning of an identifier used internally , the macro will not work as you would expect .
Consider for instance the following expression : > ( let ( ( unless ' unless ) ) ( less - dirty - for i 1 3 ( display i ) ) )
If you try to run this , your system will go into an infinite loop !
The problem here is that shadowing unless in the outer scope affects the inner working of the macro ( I leave as an exercise to understand what exactly is going on ) .
As you can easily see , this kind of problem is pretty tricky to debug : in practice , it means that the macro user is forced to know all the identifiers that are used internally by the macro .
On the other hand , if you use hygienic macros , all the subtle problems I described before simply disappear and you can write a clean for loop just as it should be written : ( def - syntax ( clean - for i i1 i2 body1 body 2 ... ) #'( let ( ( start i1 ) ( stop i2 ) ) ( let loop ( ( i start ) ) ( unless ( >= i stop ) body1 body 2 ... ( loop (+ 1 i ) ) ) ) ) )
Everything works fine with this definition , and the macro looks even better , with less commas and splices ;-)
That 's all for today .
The next episode will discuss how to break hygiene on purpose , do n't miss it !

WASHINGTON ( Reuters ) -
The CIA withheld information about a secret counter - terrorism program from Congress for eight years on orders from former U.S. Vice President Dick Cheney , the New York Times said on Saturday .

Citing two unidentified sources , the newspaper said Central Intelligence Agency Director Leon Panetta disclosed Cheney ’s involvement in closed briefings to congressional intelligence committees late last month .
Panetta , who was named to head the agency earlier this year by President Barack Obama , ended the program , which remains secret , when he first learned of its existence from subordinates on June 23 , the Times said .
Intelligence and congressional officials told the newspaper the agency began the program after the September 11 attacks and said it never became operational and did not involve CIA interrogation programs or domestic intelligence activities .
The newspaper said its efforts to reach Cheney through relatives and associates were unsuccessful .
Asked about the Times report , CIA spokesman Paul Gimigliano said it was not the agency ’s practice to discuss classified briefings .
“ When a CIA unit brought this matter to Director Panetta ’s attention , it was with the recommendation that it be shared appropriately with Congress .
That was also his view , and he took swift , decisive action to put it into effect , ” Gimigliano said , declining to comment further .
Cheney was a key advocate in the Bush administration of using controversial interrogation methods such as waterboarding on terrorism suspects and has emerged as a leading Republican critic of Obama ’s national security policies .
Panetta has vowed not to allow coercive interrogation practices , secret prisons or the transfer of terrorist suspects to countries that may use torture , a pledge seen as a break with the agency ’s policies under President George W. Bush .
Critics of the agency , however , want it to be more forthcoming about its secret programs .
Fears the CIA withheld key information from Congress were rekindled in May when House of Representatives Speaker Nancy Pelosi , a Democrat , accused the agency of failing to reveal in 2002 that it was waterboarding a terrorism suspect .
Panetta has rejected the Democratic speaker ’s accusation .
U.S. law requires the president to make sure intelligence committees are kept fully informed of intelligence activities , including any significant anticipated intelligence activity .
But the government has some leeway in disclosing such information .

Soldier Challenges President Obama's Citizenship
By Prescott Carlson in News on Jul 15 , 2009 4:40 PM
An Army reservist has found a unique way to get out of going into battle .
U.S. Army Major Stefan Frederick
Cook is balking at being deployed to Afghanistan , saying that the Commander - in - Chief has no right sending him there because Barack Obama can't legally be the President .
Cook is a " birther " ( wow , something actually stupider sounding than " truther " ) , part of a group still clinging to the notion that Obama was born in Kenya instead of Hawaii , as claimed .
And because his father was not a U.S. citizen this would mean Obama is not a " natural - born " citizen and ineligible for the Presidency .
You might remember a previous court case on this caused quite a stir around these parts .
Taking the case for Cook is lawyer Orly Taitz , who has represented other suits challenging Obama 's citizenship status including one suit filed by loon and former Illinois Republican Party embarrassment Alan Keyes .
Cook had received his active duty orders on June 9 , ordering him to report for duty today , July 15 .
Taitz applied for a temporary restraining order on July 8 .
Here 's the real kicker -- the ploy , for now at least , seems to have worked .
Army officials today are saying that Cook 's deployment orders have been revoked , and he is no longer expected to report to MacDill Air Force Base in Florida .
Lt. Col. Maria Quon refused to give a reason for the revocation saying , " Because of the Privacy Act I could n't go into it . "
Given this outcome , Ms. Taitz might soon find herself with other clients trying to pull the same stunt .

Using Iframes Sparingly
This post is based on a chapter from Even Faster Web Sites , the follow - up to High Performance Web Sites .
Posts in this series include : chapters and contributing authors , Splitting the Initial Payload , Loading Scripts Without Blocking , Coupling Asynchronous Scripts , Positioning Inline Scripts , Sharding Dominant Domains , Flushing the Document Early , Using Iframes Sparingly , and Simplifying CSS Selectors .
Time to create 100 elements
Iframes provide an easy way to embed content from one web site into another .
But they should be used cautiously .
They are 1 - 2 orders of magnitude more expensive to create than any other type of DOM element , including scripts and styles .
The time to create 100 elements of various types shows how expensive iframes are .
Pages that use iframes typically do n’t have that many of them , so the DOM creation time is n’t a big concern .
The bigger issues involve the onload event and the connection pool .
Iframes Block Onload
It ’s important that the window ’s onload event fire as soon as possible .
This causes the browser ’s busy indicators to stop , letting the user know that the page is done loading .
When the onload event is delayed , it gives the user the perception that the page is slower .
The window ’s onload event does n’t fire until all its iframes , and all the resources in these iframes , have fully loaded .
In Safari and Chrome , setting the iframe ’s SRC dynamically via JavaScript avoids this blocking behavior .
One Connection Pool
Browsers open a small number of connections to any given web server .
Older browsers , including Internet Explorer 6 & 7 and Firefox 2 , only open two connections per hostname .
This number has increased in newer browsers .
Safari 3 + and Opera 9 + open four connections per hostname , while Chrome 1+ , IE 8 , and Firefox 3 open six connections per hostname .
You can see the complete table in my Roundup on Parallel Connections .
One might hope that an iframe would have its own connection pool , but that ’s not the case .
In all major browsers , the connections are shared between the main page and its iframes .
This means it ’s possible for the resources in an iframe to use up the available connections and block resources in the main page from loading .
If the contents of the iframe are as important , or more important , than the main page , this is fine .
However , if the iframe ’s contents are less critical to the page , as is often the case , it ’s undesirable for the iframe to commandeer the open connections .
One workaround is to set the iframe ’s SRC dynamically after the higher priority resources are done downloading .
5 of the 10 top U.S. web sites use iframes .
In most cases , they ’re used for ads .
This is unfortunate , but understandable given the simplicity of using iframes for inserting content from an ad service .
In many situations , iframes are the logical solution .
But keep in mind the performance impact they can have on your page .
When possible , avoid iframes .
When necessary , use them sparingly .

By relaying this signal back to researchers when a flood - causing storm is likely , they can attempt to predict the magnitude of the event pinned to specific geographic areas .
It has also allowed scientists to gain weather data on remote areas they had never been able to track before .

Since 2007 , the city of New York has bought one way tickets for nearly 600 homeless families to the city of their choice .
Destinations have included Florida , California , and even Johannesburg , South Africa , via trains , planes and automobiles .
Mayor Michael Bloomberg embraced this program as a realistic and relatively inexpensive solution to New York ’s overcrowded homeless shelters .
Sending the families to a new city , as long as they have a friend or relative to live with there , is much less expensive than the average $ 36,000 a year spent on a family in shelters .
Once the families arrive at their new homes , New York social workers check in on their progress periodically and the city has on rare occasions fronted funds for rent and a security deposit .
In 2006 , Malcolm Gladwell wrote in the New Yorker about a similarly creative program in Denver that could have saved the city a fortune while making strides towards solving its homeless problem .
The experimental program gave free housing to chronically homeless people who had accumulated massive hospital bills , which were paid for by taxpayers .
The study found that subsidizing housing for homeless people cost an average of $ 10,000 a year per person , about a third of what the city would spend on social services if the people remained on the street .
The idea , writes Gladwell , “ is that once the people in the program get stabilized they will find jobs , and start to pick up more and more of their own rent , which would bring someone ’s annual cost to the program closer to six thousand dollars . ”
By 2016 , Denver hopes to create an additional 800 housing units for the chronically homeless to compound the success of this experimental program .
San Francisco Mayor ( and now CA gubernatorial candidate ) Gavin Newsom announced in 2005 that his Care Not Cash program , which took homeless people off welfare in favor of social services , had decreased the number of homeless people on welfare by 84 percent , disproving critics who said it could never work .
This voter - approved initiative decreased monthly welfare checks to homeless people from $ 410 to $ 59 and used the money saved to pay for homeless services , including food and shelter .
On the surface , these experiements in New York , Denver and San Francisco sound like a homerun .
They appease progressives because they offer social services to a disadvantaged population .
And who does n’t love a goverment program that saves money ?
But they are far from perfect , and raise questions about where to draw the line and how to guarantee that once the cash runs out , the homeless wo n’t end up back on the streets .
Of the New York plan , Arnold Cohen , a New York homeless advocate told the New York Times , “ What we ’re doing is passing the problem of homelessness to another city .
We ’re taking people from a shelter bed here to the living room couch of another family .
Essentially , this family is still homeless . ”
And the Denver program certainly has its problems .
Years living on the street takes its toll , and some are simply too mentally or emotionally unstable to remain in a program .
It is difficult for taxpayers , and especially fiscal conservatives , to support a program that gives government support to individuals who ca n’t seem to help themselves .
But with budgets tight and few signs of the economy bouncing back soon , it ’ll be tough for cities to resist programs that reduce homelessness rates at a low cost , even if the long - term outlook is unclear .

OTTAWA — A spokesperson for Prime Minister Stephen Harper is denying reports he received a sacramental communion wafer recently at Roméo LeBlanc 's Roman Catholic funeral mass and pocketed it instead of consuming it .
The religious faux pas was caught on video during the former governor general 's funeral in New Brunswick , where Harper received the wafer representing the body of Christ but instead of eating it appears to put in his program or pocket .
Dimitri Soudas , a spokesman for the prime minister , said that Harper " was offered communion , and accepted . "
Soudas said he consumed the consecrated host immediately afterwards , within seconds of taking it from the priest , contrary to suggestions a video shows he did not .
" Unfortunately CBC cameras do n't stay on the prime minister long enough sometimes , " Soudas told reporters in L'Aquila , Italy , where Harper is attending a G8 summit .
" The priest offered communion to the prime minister .
He accepted it , and he consumed it . "
Soudas explained that while Harper is a Protestant , " who is the prime minister to question a priest offering him communion . "
Meanwhile , a senior New Brunswick Roman Catholic priest has called on the Prime Minister 's Office to explain what happened to the sacramental communion wafer .
" If I were the prime minister , I would at least offer an explanation to say no offence was meant and then ( clarifying ) what happened to the consecrated host , " Monsignor Brian Henneberry , vicar general and chancellor of the Diocese of Saint John , told the Saint John Telegraph Journal .
The incident was ratcheted up when the video clip made it to YouTube .
It shows Harper accepting the wafer from a priest but not consuming it while clearly showing New Brunswick Lieutenant - Governor Herménégilde Chiasson , the next person to receive the host , raise it to his mouth .
Neil MacCarthy , a spokesperson for the Archdiocese of Toronto , explained that Harper should not have accepted the communion given that he is n't Roman Catholic .
" In the Roman Catholic faith we say that Roman Catholics are the only ones who should present themselves for communion because we believe that are actually consuming the body and blood of Jesus Christ , " he told the Toronto Star .
MacCarthy said he is sure Harper meant no disrespect but should have politely declined by crossing his arms over his chest .
" We encourage those who are non-Catholic ... to present themselves for a blessing ( instead ) , " he said .

Following the brutal slaying of Dr. George Tiller , Operation Rescue released this statement :
“ We are shocked at this morning ’s disturbing news that Mr. Tiller was gunned down .
Operation Rescue has worked for years through peaceful , legal means , and through the proper channels to see him brought to justice .
We denounce vigilantism and the cowardly act that took place this morning .
We pray for Mr. Tiller ’s family that they will find comfort and healing that can only be found in Jesus Christ . ”
And now the group 's leader , Randall Terry has released this Rally the troops video to all anti-choice advocates .
In the above video he calls President Obama and pro-choice politicians child killers , and proclaims Dr. Tiller to be a mass murderer , who " reaped what he sowed , " but voices regrets that the slain doctor was n't able to " get things right with his maker " and that it was unfortunate that he did n't get a " trial of a jury of his peers and to have a proper execution . "
This is one sick , twisted individual .
To deny that hateful propaganda like this could incite someone to violence , is just plain dilusional .

More details are emerging about Global Gaming Factory X's plans for the Pirate Bay following yesterday 's announcement of their $ 7.9 million purchase of the torrent site .
Already , GGX said they would find a way to compensate copyright holders whose works are traded on the site .
Now BusinessWeek reveals that the Pirate Bay plans to raise money by turning the spare bandwidth of their users into a commodity that they will sell to ISPs like Comcast and AT&T .
Business
Week reports :
GGX CEO Hans Pandeya , " has hatched a groundbreaking scheme to bundle together the collective Internet bandwidth of Pirate Bay 's users into a giant new peer - to - peer network .
Then , he 'll resell that broadband capacity on an ad hoc basis to Internet service providers — companies like Comcast ( CMCSA ) or AT&T ( T ) — that are in need of a quick injection of cheap bandwidth . "
Pandeya says that the scheme will cut bandwidth costs by ISPs by , " more than a half . "
When a user joins into the plan , they will also earn money for sharing their spare bandwidth with the Pirate Bay Network .
They can then cash out or use the money to pay to download copyrighted works , which is Pandeya 's other major money - making plan for the previously free but illegal website .
We give the idea an A for creativity -- we 'd swap bandwidth for free movies -- but BusinessWeek 's Mark Scott sees some flaws in the plan :
Pandeya will have to build a network of users big enough to make his bandwidth resellable -- no given if the Pirate Bay goes legit .
Users may violate their own ISP contracts by reselling their bandwidth to another network provider .
Third , in some cases , The Pirate Bay will likely be selling bandwidth back to its original owners -- a Comcast user 's cable modem connection back to Comcast , for instance -- and it 's unclear if ISPs will really be willing to pay for the privilige .
Lastly , if Pandeya can navigate all of these issues and turn The Pirate Bay legit , it 's worth nothing he 'll be the first to succeed where Napster and Kazaa , two other big file trading networks that tried to make the leap , failed .

For The First Time Since ’ 95 , A Man Dies And The Bull Wins In Spain
Total Pro Sports –
It may seem like quite the deadly adventure to think you can out run a pack of bulls charging at hundreds of running men , but that has n’t been the case over the past decade or so .
That was until yesterday ’s sad news that one man had died in Pamplona during the popular Running Of The Bulls , the first death since 1995 experienced at the event .
The fatality occurred when Jimeno Romero , a 27 - year - old man from Alcala de Henares on vacation with his parents and girlfriend , was gored in the neck and lung by a rogue bull named Capuchino , who was separated from the pack .
Isolated bulls are the most dangerous ones as they often become disoriented when separated from the pack and are more likely to attack the surrounding people .
And like we have seen before , when a bull attacks , it is not a pretty sight .
The incident was described as follows :
Photographs showed Jimeno Romero lying on a stretcher moments after the goring , his face and neck stained with blood and his eyes only half - open .
An emergency medical worker was leaning over him , applying what appeared to be gauze to his neck wound .
Amateur video broadcast by Spanish TV station Cuatro showed Jimeno Romero trotting backwards , facing the oncoming bull , when he trips over other runners and goes down .
The Spaniard then tries to squeeze feet - first under a wooden fence serving as a protective barrier , when the bull comes up and gores him in the neck with its right horn .
Jimeno Romero instantly bled profusely , lying face up as medics tried to save him .

Nine others were injured , including one 61 - year - old American , who was suffering from internal bleeding after being struck in the chest .
Doctors said he was in intensive care , but his condition was not life - threatening .
Deaths are not a common occurrence at the Spanish tradition , and yesterday ’s was only the fifteenth since 1924 , when they first began keeping records .
Here is a video of the fatal running explained by an eyewitness .

To speak out for human rights in an occupied land -- to investigate and publicize the systematic tortures and atrocities practiced by the client regime of the occupying power -- is a dangerous , often deadly business .
Harith al - Obaidi found that out in Iraq this week , when he was gunned down in a Baghdad mosque a day after he condemned the American - installed government for its flagrant abuses .
The New York Times reports :
The Sunni leader , Harith al - Obaidi , was leading Friday prayers at al - Shawaf mosque in the upscale neighborhood of Yarmouk , and also gave a sermon complaining about the abuses , when a gunman entered the mosque and fired at him ... Mr. Obaidi , who was deputy chairman of the human rights committee in Parliament , actively campaigned against what he saw as abuse in Iraqi prisons .
“ He was probably the No. 1 person in defending human rights , ” said Alaa Maki , a senior member of Tawafiq , the Sunni bloc that Mr. Obaidi headed .
“ And he was the No. 1 person visiting and touring the Iraqi jails . ”
... In his work , Mr. Obaidi was fighting against such practices as torture and delayed releases for prisoners , as well as to improve their sleeping quarters .
The prisons of the American - installed , American - trained , American - maintained government led by the longtime violent religious extremist Nouri al - Maliki are notorious hellholes of torture , deprivation , murder and injustice -- just as they were under Saddam ( whose party was installed in power in the 1960s with CIA assistance ) , and just as they have been under the American occupation .
The Americans still hold more than 10,000 captives in their own facilities ; at one time , the International Red Cross estimated that between 70 - 90 percent of America 's captives had committed no crime whatsoever , much less any violent action against the occupation forces .
And of course , the progressive champion of open government , Barack Obama , has just won another court battle to bury evidence of American atrocities written on the bodies of Iraqi captives .
This week I had the good fortune to be in San Francisco for a meeting of the Bay Area Clojure Meetup .
This meeting was a special event since Clojure 's creator , Rich Hickey , was in town for the big JavaOne conference .
We ended up packing out the room with sixty people , which made it probably the largest gathering of Clojure programmers ever .
The meeting began with a handful of so - called " lightning talks " ( of various lengths ) on all sorts of topics .
A few highlights were Amit Rathore 's Swarmiji clustering library and George Jahad 's talk on decompiling Clojure with jdb , which showed tools to get a new perspective on how your code gets compiled .
After these Rich gave a talk on the recent work he 's been doing on chunked sequences .
Basically when a seq wraps a vector or vector - like collection , rather than every first / rest invocation breaking the vector down piece by piece , the seq can break a chunk of the vector off to work on all at once and keep its own internal counter that points to the current position in the chunk .
The motivation here was that while you generally can rely on the seq abstraction to map over each element in a vector in a functional manner , sometimes performance concerns force you to use a more imperative - style loop instead .
With the chunking in place , the map approach is even faster than the less - idiomatic loop , so there 's one fewer reason to stray from the functional approach .
It 's really encouraging to see that Rich is making this a priority — he wants to make sure that you never get penalized for doing things the elegant way .
After this Rich hosted a Q&A session , from which two main points stuck in my mind .
He mentioned that before the 1.0 release , he asked what people thought would be a good set of short - term goals for the project , to which the response was overwhelmingly " move off SVN to git " .
Since the project was still fresh of a jump from SourceForge to Google Code , he was reluctant at first , but he seems to have been convinced that the distributed approach is what 's best for the community .
He promised us that the move will happen .
He 's currently experimenting with GitHub and making sure for himself that tool support is good enough .
The other question of particular interest was that of tests .
Rich does n't write tests for Clojure .
The community has contributed a test suite , but it 's kept in a separate repository and does n't offer full coverage .
Rich 's opinion is that tests are for finding bugs , and that he is able to avoid bugs by reasoning out the problem up front , so it 's not a wise use of his time for him to write his own tests , though he does appreciate and run the community - provided suite .
This made me very nervous at first , but the next day I read Out of the Tarpit [ PDF ] , a paper he recommended at the meeting .
The paper makes a strong case for informal reasoning being a suitable substitute for test cases in codebases that exhibit referential transparency .
While I still prefer TDD for its help in the design phase of coding , I 'm much more ready to accept the notion that thinking through the problem up front and verifying it with manual tests is actually a feasible approach to getting working code in functional languages , though of course in situations where mutability is the norm it leads to disastrous results .

The rules of grammar you follow while speaking may not reflect what you 're thinking .
In a study published today in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences , researchers found that speakers of subject - verb - object languages – " Bill eats cake " – reverted to a subject - object - verb form when asked to communicate with their hands .
" Bill cake eats " may sound counterintuitive to an ear weaned on English or any of the one - half of human languages that modify subjects with verbs , but it appears to follow the natural order of our cognition .
" This may reflect the real thought that comes before language , " said study co-author Susan Goldin - Meadow , a University of Chicago psychologist .
" It seems pretty natural . "
Goldin - Meadow 's team asked forty people – ten speakers apiece of
English , Mandarin Chinese and Spanish , each of which follows the SVO
order , and ten speakers of Turkish , which follows an SOV order – to describe a series of simple actions , such as a girl turning a knob , with gestures .
Regardless of their native language , the subjects almost universally preceded object with verb : girl knob turns .
" We expected that the language they spoke would influence the language of their gestures , but it didn't , " said Goldin - Meadow .
To test whether the subjects used subject - object - verb as a communicative strategy , they were given a series of illustrated transparencies , each depicting one element of a scene , and told that order was irrelevant : the final layered montage would look the same regardless of its assembly .
The subjects still put object before verb .
" It almost speaks to the independence of language from thought , " said Goldin - Meadow .
The implications of these unexpected results are n't yet clear .
Speakers of subject - verb - object languages may actually experience a constant low - level cognitive stress from translating their thoughts into less - intuitive speech patterns , though Goldin - Meadow said it would likely be so tiny as to be undetectable .
However , such a cognitive load could become more apparent in neurologically damaged children , or in children who have trouble learning a subject - verb - object language .
" There 's no evidence for this , " she cautioned , " but maybe looking at kids with problems is the first step .
Maybe we could understand that the child is thinking in a different way , and teach them a translation strategy . "

Nun haben wir es also geschafft !
3DCenter ist würdig genug , in der Zensurliste von JusProg Aufnahme zu finden – neben solchen bekannten Webseiten wie den schon voraufgezählten .
Wobei sich diese Liste natürlich beliebig erweitern läßt – bis hin zu solchen Internet - Abgründen wie dem Kinder - Programm des MDR , der Kochrezepte - Webseite DasKochrezept.de und dem Bundesministerium für Bildung und Forschung .
Ausdrücklich noch einmal betont sei dabei , daß 3DCenter .de gleich die höchstmögliche Auszeichnung zuteil wurde : Der ( selbsternannte ) Jugendschutzfilter JusProg sperrt diese URL für alle Webnutzer – ganz unabhängig ihres Alters .
Wie wir dies verdient haben , ist uns selber noch nicht ganz klar – als ziemlich schlimm textbasierte Webseite ist es nicht ganz so einfach , wegen dem heutzutage beliebtesten Vorwurf von Gewaltdarstellungen an den Pranger gestellt zu werden .
Wahrscheinlich ist es die Kombination aus Links auf Gulli & Co. , die Berichterstattung über ( prinzipiell verabscheuungswürdige )
Gewaltspiele und die hier und da eingestreuten Politiknews , welche nicht unbedingt auf eine " normale " , stur obrigkeitstreue Gesinnung schließen lassen .
Aber im eigentlichen reicht sicherlich auch schon der allgemeine Gedanke der Webseite , über Hardware für Computerspieler ( und damit potentielle Amokläufer ) zu berichten .
Wir sehen diesen Fall jedenfalls gelassen und eher denn belustigend .
Natürlich werden wir prüfen , ob denn die totale Sperrung von 3DCenter wirklich notwendig ist – schließlich bedeutet das , daß hier der " Jugendschutz " klar über das Ziel hinausschießt , wenn denn auch erwachsenen Internetnutzern der Zugriff vollständig verwehrt wird .
Prinzipiell läßt sich allerdings gegen einen Jugendschutz mittels Filtersoftware ( wie bei JusProg ) nicht viel sagen – schließlich wird dieser von den Erziehungsberechtigen manuell aktiviert , womit es also zu keinem von oben verordneten Zwangsfilter kommt , sondern dies alles die freie Entscheidung der Erziehungsberechtigen bleibt .
Daß derzeit keine Filtersoftware auch nur annähernd perfekt ist ( womit der Effekt eher gering bleibt ) und daß die Schutzbefohlenen solche Maßnahmen meist nur dazu anspornen , diese zu umgehen , steht auf einem anderen Blatt .
Sehr riskant sind allerdings die Nebenwirkungen solcher Filterprogramme : Denn mit diesen wird auch Erwachsenenschutz möglich , wie im konkreten Beispiel deutlich zu sehen .
Dies steht JusProg allerdings nicht zu und erfüllt unserer Meinung nach den Punkt der Zensur – welche in der Bundesrepublik Deutschland grundgesetzrechtlich untersagt ist .
Sicherlich kann man Ausnahmen bei klar gesetzeswidrigen Webseiten machen – wenn allerdings solche Webseiten wie 3DCenter davon betroffen sind , ist eindeutig jegliches Maß verlorengegangen und es handelt sich eben um Zensur .
Hinzu kommt der Punkt , daß solcher Filterprogramme dann oftmals auch von Firmen gekauft werden , um ihre internen Netzwerke vor all zu heftigen privaten Surfen zu schützen .
Dies Firmen kaufen dann in gutem Glauben eine Software , um möglichst viele XXX - Seiten zu bannen – und bekommen gleichzeitig noch einen politischen Filter hinzu , was sicherlich in den wenigsten Fällen so beabsichtigt ist .
In einem solchen Fall würde im übrigen zwischen dem Anbieter einer Filtersoftware und von 3DCenter ein klar geschäftsschädigendes Verhalten seitens des Anbieters der Filtersoftware vorliegen – wo wir uns dann auch alle rechtlichen Schritte vorbehalten , gleich aber mal klar machen , daß dies für den Anbieter der Filtersoftware teuer werden kann .
Denn selbst wenn man über 3DCenter aus jugendschutzrechtlicher Sicht eventuell diskutieren kann , die hier abgehandelten Themen sind trotz daß sie teilweise außerhalb des Mainstreams liegen , niemals einen Erwachsenenschutz wert .
Wir entschuldigen uns abschließend noch für das obige Stopp - Schild – den Gag konnten wir uns einfach nicht verkneifen – und verweisen auf die Diskussion zum Thema im Forum .

Unsere Partnerwebseiten HT4U , PC Games Hardware ( " Standard gesperrt " – Willkommen im Club ! ) , WinHelpline und deferred Power sollten sich eventuell auch mal selber bei JusProg checken .

A refreshing side - effect of the Octomom phenomenon has been how little abuse Nadya Suleman has taken for her obviously Muslim given name .
Her father is apparently from Iraq :
In January , he told CBS News that he ’s a veteran of its military and — in a sign of just how feeble the American economy is — that he planned on returning to Iraq to find work .
Googling “ Octomom ” with “ Muslim ” or “ Islam ” reveals precious little enmity directed at her .
Perhaps facetiously , the question has been raised , though she ’s Christian , of whether she ’s on a mission from Allah to wage demographic jihad against the West .
About the worst I could find was a commenter on Free Republic ( where else ? ) , who asked why the state is “ subsidizing this Allah worshiper . ”
Perhaps the reason Nadya is n’t subjected to more grief is that those inclined to blame her for siphoning off more than her fair share of government aid are part of the same crowd that smiles approvingly at her for acting like a good Christian who goes forth and multiplies .
Hey , it ’s not her fault that the Bible says “ multiply ” when what it really means is “ add . ”
At least it does n’t advise believers to go increase exponentially .
Taking “ go forth and multiply ” even more literally than Octomom is the Discovery Channel ’s Duggar Family , currently weighing in with 18 children .
You know them : Michelle Duggar is the mother to whom the phrase - gone - viral “ Your vagina is not a clown car ” was applied before Nadya .
( Technically speaking , it would be the uterus that one should refrain from using as a clown car . )
As for Nadya ’s moniker , it ’s neither been tracked back to a source nor has anyone stepped forth to claim credit for inventing it .
That ’s surprising because , with its allusion to an octopus ’ tentacles capturing Nadya ’s apparent need to grab all the babies , attention , and presumably love that she can for herself , it ’s sheer genius .
The name ’s potential is n’t lost on Nadya , though .
Smoking Gun reports that her lawyers filed an application with the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office to trademark the word , which she hopes to use as a brand name for disposable diapers and clothes .
First , though , her lawyers need to overcome the obstacle presented by a video - game company that beat them to the punch by trademarking the name for an iPhone game .
While awaiting the name change , the game is called Fertile Myrtle , after the central character .
When players depress her belly , she ejects babies .
Octomom is also discussing a reality show with TV networks for the not - too - distant future .
At which point , the kids will be old enough to create the requisite pandemonium while she plots her return to the dating scene .
Another public name mentioned in connection with a prospective reality show is Michael Vick ( Ookie , as court papers reveal , to his Bad Newz kennel friends ) .
Though his agent claims they seek no such show , his lawyers did mention to a bankruptcy judge that their client hopes to earn $ 600,000 in a post - prison release documentary .
Perhaps
Vick ’s camp is concerned that a reality show might subvert his plans to be reinstated to the NFL .
But a show that portrays
Vick performing public service might actually help restore him to the good graces of NFL commissioner Roger Godell .
How about if Ookie moved in with Octomom to help her out and spare the state some public assistance ?
His duties would include feeding , bathing , and diapering the the octuplets .
( While Nadya , presumably , would plot their marketing . )
Ookie would also function as Nadya ’s BFF , propping up her self - esteem and , when she prepares for a date , applying body make - up to her stretch marks .
But that ’s not all .
To atone for the abuse and murder of dogs , Ookie will raise eight puppies — toy dogs , the better to facilitate his humiliation — one for each baby : an Australian silky terrier for Jonah , a Bichon Frise for Jeremiah , a Chihuahua for Josiah , a Japanese Terrier for Makai , a Maltese for Nariah , a Pekingese for Isaiah , a Pomeranian for Maliah , and a pug for Noah .
He could call it the Good Newz kennel .
And he thought prison was hard .
Shares in GGF rose dramatically yesterday on the news that the company is set to acquire The Pirate Bay .
However , about a week ago equity marketplace Aktietorget shut down trading of GGF 's stock after unusually large trading volumes led to a rapidly increasing stock price , prompting suspicions of illegal trading .
Confidence and trust in the BitTorrent community reached a possible all - time low yesterday as news broke that the world ’s largest tracker , The Pirate Bay , would be sold to the corporate Global Gaming Factory X ( GGF ) .
The acquisition for $ 7.8 m ( SEK 60 million ) came as a huge shock to most people familiar with The Pirate Bay , as GGF promised that when it takes over the site it will eliminate illicit file - sharing – the base upon which The Pirate Bay achieved its worldwide fame and enabled it to gather millions of loyal users .
Indeed , most indications point to GGF being only interested in three things – the Pirate Bay ’s domain name , the users and the revenue they can generate from them .
However , according to a report , the news of the acquisition did n’t come as a shock to everyone .
Indeed , accusations are being made that some individuals knew what was about to happen and took the opportunity to try and cash in .
Around a week ago , equity marketplace Aktietorget shut down the trading of GGF stock after it spotted unusually large trading volumes leading to a rapidly increasing stock price , notably in the absence of any new information to explain the sudden interest in the company .
Indicating they suspect insider dealing and announcing an investigation , Peter Gönczi , executive vice president of Aktietorget told Dagens Industri : “ There are reasons to suspect that information was leaked . ”
After the price of GGF shares rocketed by more than 150 % yesterday , at one point today they had lost 29 % of their value , up to date details here .
In my last post about the most powerful developer tool ever made I had a person leave a comment that said this :
I could not agree with you more .
Google is your friend !
I actually landed my current job because of Google .
In my interview I was asked the question , " How would you rate your skills in C# , 1 - 5 ? "
I replied " 4 " , even though I had never seen a line of C# code .
He asked me why I rated myself a 4 and I told him , " Programming is a skill , once you know how , everything else is just syntax and I can just Google the rest . "
This comment had me thinking for a few minutes .
Sure , knowledge of your programming language and environment are very important , but overall , is programming a generic skill that easily translates between platforms , languages , and toolsets ?
My first response was “ kinda ” , object oriented programming is a generic skill .
If you know how to write good object oriented software , then you are likely to be able to easily translate that skill into another , demonstrably similar , language .
A Rose By Any Other Name
For example , if I were to be an awesome Java developer ( which I am not ) who can write great OO code , then I would very likely be able to turn around and write great C# code .
I ’d have to do quite a bit of searching , and trial and error to find out the particular way to connect to a database , search a string , write to a file , etc … but over the course of a few weeks I could become extremely productive in the alternative platform .
As Thoreau said :
Every artizan learns positively something by his trade .
Each craft is familiar with a few simple well - known well established facts - not requiring any genius to discover but mere use and familiarity .
You may go by the man at his work in the street every day of your life . -
And though he is there before you carrying into practice certain essential information - you shall never be the wiser .
There are simple well - known facts at play here , but these are both incredibly similar platforms .
They practically share the same syntax , both are object oriented , they are both garbage collected , etc …
The similarities go on and on .
But if you came from a language which was n’t so similar , then would we be in the same situation ?
Is it just syntax at that point ?
Absolutely not .
There are really two different ways that languages differ .
First is in syntax , second is in paradigm .
In terms of syntax and paradigm C# and Java are basically the same .
Even C# and C++ would be considered very similar in terms of syntax and paradigm , but if a C++ programmer came into C# they could probably get around but would likely perform tasks in sub-optimal ways until they learned the ropes .
Obviously the reverse is also true , but to a more extreme degree .
If you were to drop a C# developer into the world of Scala they would feel comfortable with the syntax but the shift to a more functionally oriented language would probably give them trouble for quite a while until they learned the ropes .
Going further and putting the developer into a functional language like F# would push them even further , and without proper training and exploration they would probably be solving problems in entirely backwards ways because they are still thinking in their old paradigm .
In F# though we still have the object oriented tools available to us , and therefore the C# developer would likely be able to at least fumble their way through a problem .
However , if you took a C# developer and dropped them into the world of Haskell they would be a fish out of water .
The software would be as foreign to them as a brain would be to a cardiac surgeon .
Making The Switch
Does this mean that the comment on my previous blog post was n’t true ?
Absolutely not .
In fact , he is almost certainly correct in the vast majority of cases .
Object oriented programming dominates the development industry right now and moving between C++ , C# , Java , PHP , Delphi , VB. NET , etc … are all extremely similar .
Once you ’ve learned how to develop in one , you can be fairly comfortable in the others in a matter of days or weeks .
It is n’t even that far of a jump to go into object oriented dynamic languages like Ruby , Python , or Grooby .
You just have to forget everything you were taught about the importance of type safety !
If you are looking for a tutorial , look no further !
The bigger jump is when you look at the next generation of languages coming down the pipe and you start to think about the paradigm shift that would accompany languages like F# , Scala , Erlang , Clojure , etc …
These languages , should any of them become mainstream will represent a shift in the fundamental way in which many programmers develop .
In fact , many of us are already starting to make this shift if you are working in a OO language such as C# that is slowly starting to push more and more functional concepts into it .
Do n’t Forget About the Libraries
Libraries can’t be discounted completely though .
I wrote it off as earlier in this post as simply googling for a snippet of code to write to a file or parse a string , but the reality is that libraries that come with languages drarwf the languages themselves by many times .
Over time a developer becomes familiar with his / her platform of choice and their productivity can rise substantially .
The real question is how long does it take to get to this point ?
I for one subscribe to the idea that libraries are like spoken languages .
The English language may have tens of thousands of words , but any individual usually only uses a few hundred in every day conversation .
Those few hundred can take a different amount of time to learn , depending upon the person and the environment .
One thing is for sure though is that a developer writing C# in one shop and a developer writing C# in another shop can be exposed to two entirely different parts of the framework .
A good example of this is that I went in for an interview once where the interviewer asked me to tell him how to connect to a database , fire off a query , and then read the results out .
Well , I had just come off a two year project where we used a heavy abstraction on top of the data layer that mapped all of it into classes for us .
I honestly could n’t remember what the classes were called , and so I told him that .
I explained that I had n’t needed to use those classes in quite a while , and I made a few guesses about their names .
Right now I am using them on a daily basis , and I wish I was n’t , but I could name all of them off to you and probably even enumerate all of their methods !
The point is that library experience is important , and learning tools is important , but they will only take you so far .
The rest is up to you and your search engine .
Summary
So does out programming experience translate across languages and platforms ?
We better hope so , at least to some degree .
Otherwise all of those pointy haired guys out there who are looking for the 20 year old guy with a year of experience in the tool du jour would be right !
Ugh , that would be the most depressing thing ever .
But I do n’t think that is the case , I think that good developers span languages and platforms and they are the ones that are always searching for a better way to do something .
They are always trying to be more efficient , more productive , and do more with less .
They are always looking for a sharper tool .
Are your tools getting dull ?

As I 've Matured
So where was I ?
Oh.
Right .
I had this little scary robot show and for whatever reason could n't convince enough people that it was a ) scary enough b ) robot enough or c ) in English .
Add that dim sum combo of factors to a red bean paste of non-monetizable early adopters dvring the show like motherfuckers and now I 'm unemployed .
Everyone says having your show cancelled is like a death but I 've been dead before and at least when you 're dead you do n't get thrown off the Warner Bros .
lot for haunting your old parking space .
They probably mean it's like the death of a friend or a family member but that shit only hurts when it 's YOUR friend or family member and even then it 's mitigated by age , lifestyle and whether that person was a Hollywood friend or a real one and whether that family member left you money .
Losing your show is more like a surprise divorce where you get served papers in the morning and your ( ex ) wife is fucking Human Target by three in the afternoon using the same time slot your child was conceived in and also where she did that one thing that one time on your birthday .
People say the bright side to losing your show is gaining time to spend with your family but I 'm pretty sure that waking up next to your ex-showrunner spouse whom you have n't seen for two and a half years is pretty close to waking up next to that special someone you met the night before at Carlos n' Charlie 's in Cancun on Spring Break .
WIFE : Oh ... It 's you .
EX-SHOWRUNNER : Hey baby .
WIFE : You look ... different than I remember .
EX - SHOWRUNNER : I 've gone a little grey .
WIFE : Or a little fat .
EX - SHOWRUNNER : Pretty sure it 's grey .
WIFE : Pretty sure ... fat .
Was I ... drunk ?EX-SHOWRUNNER : Drunk ?
When ?
WIFE : I do n't know .
The whole time ?
You should own your self - inflicted wounds if for no other reason than a ) they are yours and b ) you inflicted them , you dumb motherfucker , but I do want to say in my own defense that it takes a special kind of someone to work seventy hours a week where it is HALLOWEEN 24FUCKING7 and not pack on a few -- WIFE : Dozen .
A dozen--WIFE : A few dozen . a few dozen pounds fine I get it .
A few dozen pounds consisting mainly of but not limited to : Chocolate Pop Tarts , Twinkies , Ding Dongs , double - decker PB&Js , pink and white animal cookies , duck sandwiches , maricopa almonds , stinky cheese , french bread , deer in a thai curry peppercorn sauce , trail mix with the peanuts picked out , breakfast sausage , pistachios , Diet Coke , large Jamba Juices , those little Butterfingers , lox when we had Zvi the Israeli P.A. , and sushi .
And I 'm willing to own that .
Especially the sushi part .
One of the hardest parts of having your show cancelled is the part BEFORE it 's cancelled , when it 's " on the bubble " .
The absolute hardest part of that , besides the phrase " on the bubble , " is everyone gets it in their head that you actually know what 's happening with your show and you 're just not telling them .
No one believes the show 's fate is in the air , they believe the fate 's been decided , you know the fate , but you 're just not sharing it with anybody .
Now understand this : at any one time on a show there are over TWO HUNDRED people working on a show .
OVER TWO HUNDRED FAMILIES DERIVING THEIR INCOME FROM YOUR LITTLE CREATIVE ENDEAVOR .
What kind of fucking asshole would I be if I knew they were all going to be out of work in a month but just did n't feel it was politically expedient to tell them ?
CONSCIENCE : Hey .
Buddy .
That grip 's wife is having a baby in two months .
He 's thinking of leaving to work on a feature .
ASSHOLE ME :
We 're cancelled in two weeks .
CONSCIENCE : We gotta tell him .
ASSHOLE ME : Nah .
People leaving .
Bad for morale .
Not politically expedient .
Who but a heartless cocksucker would stop someone from getting other work knowing they had no future at their current job ?
( Other than William Morris and Endeavor , that is . )
But I progress .
I guess there were signs that the show was in trouble ( other than the 1.3 rating and the four share ) .
First there was the day I was in my office and looked up to see Chuck Lorre and a Warner Bros .
facilities manager standing in my doorway pointing to various features and using their hands to take " air measurements . "
( Chuck tried to play it off like waving to me God Bless him , but I know an air measurement when I see it . ) I know what you 're all thinking : Chuck Lorre needs office space ?
What the fuck for ?
Does n't he already have office space spread out all over half the fucking studio ?
Is n't it enough that Charlie Sheen 's trailer is the size of Waylon Jennings ' tour bus and it blocks the best way to ride a golf cart from a certain scary robot writer 's office to a particular scary robot sound stage ?
There 's only 2 and half men for fuck 's sake , and one of them 's like , six years old or something .
You think MR.
CHUCK FUCKING LORRE that just because you 've pimped my show on Big Bang that you can stand out in my hallway with a basket waiting for the guillotine to fall and my head to roll right to you ?
Do you think you can do that ?
Air measurer ?
Damn right you can .
You 're Chuck fucking Lorre and you own my ass .
But Chuck did n't take my office -- I believe he said something about my private bathroom having a non-platinum sink -- and what I thought was good news soon became anything but .
Because while you may be a bubble show to your family and your fans , as far as the studio goes the minute your show wraps you are a deadbeat renter who 's already forfeited his cleaning deposit .
It was Open Season on the Sarah Connor Suite as My Room of Ones Own soon became the Potential Room of Any Jackass Pilot Producer who Thought His Show was getting Picked Up .
And believe me , there 's a lot of those assholes .
Poking their heads in , hopped up on good test scores in the key demos , power - drunk and showing off their spanking new laminated Warner Bros .
ID card hanging off a lanyard like a slutty USC freshman and her Spring Weekend mug .
And yet .
No one took it .
I was starting to feel like Grandma 's hand - knit afghan at the garage sale that starts out a keepsake you could n't part with but ends up as the substitute for styrofoam peanuts when you need to wrap up the six matching sunflower pattern kitchen glasses your mother gave you when you left for college .
Eventually I cracked and started taking the whole thing personally .
I 'd hear them coming and start screaming " Vultures !
Vultures !
Come in vultures ! "
It was that John Irving novel with the orphans and the older ones just know they 're fucked and they start rejecting the parents before they can be rejected - -( It 's here that I just want to note that I have n't read " that John Irving novel " but I 'm pretty sure I saw a movie based on " a John Irving novel " and I feel like that scene was in the movie and should 've been if it was n't . ) -- I really did this .
Forget the John Irving thing .
I really did yell this at people .
No one thought it was funny .
Well .
I did .
I also considered renting the office back from Warner Bros. , myself .
It was a romantic gesture , or a lazy one , as I had a huge stuffed cow and a Lego Tower of Babel that I could n't fit into the back of my Chrysler .
As it turns out , the studio will rent you back their offices , but at THE SAME RATE THE PRODUCTION PAYS , which , while I can't remember the exact amount , worked out to something around $ 450,000 a month .
But that did include the private bathroom with the non-platinum sink .
Eventually the day came when I was evicted from the room I 'd written thirty episodes of my very first television show .
I packed a very large SUV with a very large amount of computer equipment , scripts , DVDs , Sarah Connor memorabilia , something that may or may not have been many half - empty tequila bottles , some office supplies I do n't want to talk about , and possibly some gum and trail mix .
Despite the show NOT yet being cancelled , I was the last person to leave the empty building and would 've turned the lights out if I was paying for the electricity .
I drove up to the security gate and prepared to be waved through , knowing there was a good chance this was the last time I 'd be on this lot in my capacity as Executive Producer of Terminator : The Sarah Connor Chronicles .
It was after 8:00 and that meant I was guaranteed a " trunk check , " a phenomenal Hellerian ritual by which the guards checked your trunk and NO MATTER WHAT WAS IN THERE let you leave the lot .
I had never known ANYONE to EVER explain themselves regarding the contents of their trunk during the trunk check ritual .
I think this has even happened : GUARD : Trunk please .
ANONYMOUS TV PRODUCER : Sure , Frank .
How 's the kids ?
GUARD / FRANK : Good .
Good .
( Checks trunk )
Is that Bugs Bunny in there ?
ANONYMOUS TV PRODUCER : Yeah .
I roofied him .
GUARD / FRANK : Sure .
Yeah .
Looks that way .
ANONYMOUS TV PRODUCER : I 'll probably bring him back tomorrow .
GUARD / FRANK : All righty .
Make sure to call him a drive on , though .
Otherwise we can't let him on .
ANONYMOUS TV PRODUCER : Of course .
I 'm no rookie , Frank .
So on my final official day on the lot I pull to the guard shack with my SUV full of EVERYTHING .
GUARD : Hey .
How 're you tonight ?
ME : Last night , Frank .
Last night on the lot .
GUARD : Looks that way .
That your whole office in there ?
ME : Pretty much .
As I start to pull away -- GUARD : You got your property sheet ?
ME : Excuse me ?
GUARD : Your property sheet .
Like an inventory sheet .
With all of this inventoried and signed off on by the production .
ME : What ?
GUARD : I 'm gonna have to ask you to turn around and return to the lot , go to your production offices , and get an executive to inventory all of this , certify it as yours , and then sign the sheet .
Then you can leave .
ME : Frank .
Let me explain something .
There is nobody else .
I 'm it .
GUARD : Well someone is going to have to list , certify , and sign .
ME : Someone ?
Like who someone ?
GUARD : Someone .
A producer .
Someone .
And then it hit me .
ME : Frank !
I 'm that someone !
It 's my show !
I am the someone that I 'm looking for !
GUARD : Wait .
Who are you ?
ME : I 'm Josh Friedman , Frank !
And until I drive past this guard shack I am the Executive Producer of this tv show !
I am the someone !
Ca n't I give myself permission to leave ?
At which point Frank went to the guard shack .
A line of cars had formed behind me , wondering what kind of fuck up was holding up the line at nine o' clock at night .
Frank returned with a form , in triplicate .
GUARD : List the items .
Certify they 're yours .
Sign off .
ME : I am , in essence , authorizing myself to leave and thus no longer be the Executive Producer .
GUARD : As far as we 're concerned , yes .
ME : Works for me .
And so I did .
And so I had .
And so I was n't .
As I drove off I rummaged through the questionable office supplies for a piece of gum .
Stuck it in my mouth , accelerating onto Barham Blvd. into the night .
I blew a bubble .
It would be another month before it popped .
AskMen recently wrote an article discussing the top 10 supercars that should be more afforbable .
We have our take on this discussion and this is the second installment .
Even though the cars they identified should be cheaper , they are n’t .
And so , we have added our two - cents and sought to find suitable alternatives that will save you a little money and still have you riding in style .
The other day we counted down from number 10 to number 6 and today we wind it down to number 1 .
As promised , the sports cars get more expensive and the recommendations a little more far out .
It ’s always cool to review exotic cars , and as stated before , even though we are making recommendations on more affordable options , any one of these vehicles would provide the ride of a lifetime .
So , check out the list below with some of the most expensive supercars on the market today and some advice that just might save you enough money on the side to buy an extra car or four if you ’ve got big bank .
No.5 – Aston Martin One -77
Price : Approximately $ 1.75 million
Why try to be like Bond with an Aston Martin DBS when you can better him in a One - 77 ?
It could add even more 007 - like charm , sophistication and excessive carnal activity to your life — areas you want to improve anyhow .
One - upmanship comes at a stiff cost , though , and the One - 77 drops in among supercars that should be affordable .
All the exclusivity and bespoke fiddling by Aston can’t fill the $ 1.5 million or so gap between the One - 77 and the $ 266,350 DBS .
Maybe being just like Bond is n’t so bad after all .
What the price should be :
We understand the exclusivity of the One - 77 , but is n’t owning one good enough ?
Why do you have to pay millions ?
Put the price just above a DBS and make a limited number of them and you ’ll still be the coolest kid on the block for buying one , without having to sell your house , car , kidney , and first - born child to afford it .
SUB5ZERO ’S TAKE
There is no doubt that the Aston Martin One - 77 is one bad mofo .
The car sports a 7.3 - liter naturally aspirated V12 engine producing 700 + bhp making it capable of 3.5 second sprints from 0 to 60 mph .
It has all the fit and finish you would expect from Aston Martin plus some additional niceties .
And there ’s always the rarity factory because they are only producing 77 units .
But that said , if you are looking to save a few bucks and get an outstanding automobile that will turn heads and slow traffic to a crawl , we recommend the Spyker C12 Zagato .
For $ 644,000 you get a car good for 3.8 second 0 - 60 times in a package that is as far out and high - design as you will ever see on the road today .
This is a showroom quality car that begs to be driven and screams for attention .
Total savings = $ 1,106,000

No.4 – SSC Ultimate Aero
Price : Approximately $ 600,000
So you long for a supercar , yet your patriotism demands your dollars stay here in the U.S. of A ?
We ’ll bet you wish you could try a Shelby , as in Shelby Super Cars .
Their SSC Ultimate Aero snagged the Guinness World Record for top production car speed ( 255.83 mph ) , which appeals to both the patriot and velocity junkie in us all .
Fit , finish and interior appointments are not yet record - setting , but we have high hopes , especially with an electric version of the Aero said to be on the way .
What the price should be : $ 260,000 .
Just a little bit more expensive than the recently reduced SLR as it is the “ fastest ” production car on the road it deserves a little recognition , no ?
SUB5ZERO ’S TAKE
We ’re all for patriotism , but when it comes to cars we sometimes can’t help but stray from our home soil .
That ’s why we would have to opt for the Gumpert Apollo if we wanted to stay below the $ 500 k mark and still get a track master .
This is a 2,600 pound street legal race car with engine options that include the base twin - turbo V8 with 650 bhp , the sport version with 690 bhp and the race version with 790 bhp .
In any case , this is a car that can run from 0 - 62 mph in 2.7 seconds and reach 120 mph in 2.9 seconds .
It ’s also quite rare with only 25 built in 2009 .
Total savings = $ 173,000
— — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — —————-
No.3 – Ferrari 612 Scaglietti
Price : $ 315,000
To answer your first question :
Why not the Enzo ?
Simple : Eddie Griffin has inadvertently adjusted supply and demand , further skewing prices .
The 612 Scaglietti is our Ferrari supercar that should be affordable .
Every halfway decent guy deserves to experience a V12 Ferrari sometime , and the 612 means he can bring his wife and two kids along .
But look at the thing : not a stunner , to say it diplomatically .
Based on looks alone , this Ferrari should have its price adjusted accordingly .
What the price should be : $ 130,000 .
The 911 Turbo is so much prettier than this Ferrari , but we ’ll give the Scaglietti the benefit of the doubt with its V12 and keep the prices even .
SUB5ZERO ’S TAKE
The 911 Turbo is a great car but it ’s not a Ferrari .
The Scaglietti is a Ferrari but it ’s the ugly duckling and dark horse of the family .
So what ’s one to do ?
Let ’s explore …
The Scaglietti does feature a V - 12 engine good for 533 hp and a 0 - 60 mph time of 4.2 seconds .
But this is 5/10ths of a seconds slower than the Porsche .
The Scaglietti features Ferrari ’s F1 SuperFast automated manual paddle - shift transmission along with carbon ceramic brakes standard .
However , the Porsche can be outfitted with the same type of brakes and has a Tiptronic S transmission that is absolutely phenomenal .
So , we agree with AskMen ’s assessment but would like to pose an alternative — why not just go with a Lotus Exige S260 ?
For $ 75,000 you get a 4 second car with amazing handling that certainly has that “ wow ” factor .
It ’s definitely not as luxurious as the Ferrari but after 10 minutes of driving it you wo n’t care .
Total savings = $ 240,000 .
— — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — —————-
No.2 – Bentley Continental Supersports
Price : $ 250,000 ( est. )
We ’ve always liked green cars in theory , less so with their packaging and the trade - offs .
Suddenly , there ’s one that makes us want to hug trees until we ’re riddled with splinters : the Bentley Continental Supersports .
So like the aforementioned Koenigsegg CCXR , the green aspect here is limited to the ability to burn E85 ethanol .
Still , it ’s a start .
It ’s also another of the supercars that should be affordable .
While the enhancements are commendable , the price of going environmentally friendly in your Bentley is expected to be about $ 70,000 over a standard Continental GT .
What the price should be : $ 150,000 .
It ’s saving the planet , come on !
Why should you have to plod along in a smart or Prius when you can rocket by in one of these ?
Would n’t we save the planet a bit more quickly behind the wheel of a Bentley ?
We ’d like to think so .
SUB5ZERO ’S TAKE
Biodiesel is very popular right now and rightfully so .
Not only can you squeeze out more horsepower from flex - fuel engines when using ethanol , but arguably you are helping Mother Earth as well .
We ’d like to recommend the Trident Iceni instead of the Bentley .
You get a car that can reach 200 mph , hit 0 - 60 in under 4 seconds and drive 100 miles per gallon all for about $ 85,000 .
Total savings = $ 165,000 .

No.1 – Bugatti Veyron 16.4 Fbg par Hermés
Price : $ 2,465,430
If the volume of air travel is any indication , people want and need to travel at speeds above 250 mph .
While the SSC Ultimate Aero does this , it ca n’t match the luxury of the world ’s most expensive Volkswagen : the Bugatti Veyron 16.4 .
At around $ 1.6 million , it only seems reasonably priced against the Fbg par Hermés edition , where special paint and Hermés touches are supposedly worth the nearly $ 1 million upgrade .
At these prices , it seems blasphemous , but this overblown Veyron is king of the supercars that should be affordable .
What the price should be : $ 1,601,965 .
Essentially this special edition Bugatti is nothing more than a Veyron wrapped in a Hermés scarf , and with the average price per pound of a Hermés scarf being $ 1,965 USD that ’s the only extra the base price should see as we ’re quite sure there ’s not more than a pound ’s worth of Hermés scarf in this car .
SUB5ZERO ’S TAKE
The Bugatti Veyron is one of the most impressive cars to come along in quite some time .
After all , this Bugatti workhorse features a quad - supercharged 8.0 - liter W16 engine putting out 1001 horsepower that allows it to reach 253 + mph and sprint from 0 - 62 mph in 2.5 seconds .
In fact the 922 lb- ft of torque provided by the twin V8 powerplants allows the car to generate over 1g during fast acceleration .
Indeed the Veyron is so powerful that it uses an airbrake to help with stopping and over 10 radiators for cooling .
The base price tag of $ 1.6 million for the Bugatti Veyron 16.4 seems steep but well worth it if money is no object or if your name starts with King or Shiek .
The $ 1 million bump in price of the Hermes edition is just plain outrageous .
When spending this kind of money , we recommend a different approach .
The Bugatti is amazing but not nearly as rare as its price tag reflects .
We believe that when dropping this kind of coin you should not only get an amazing driving experience , but handcrafted brilliance and ultimate exclusivity .
Enter the Pagani Zonda Cinque , a super limited - edition vehicle ( only 5 will be built ) that will rocket from 0 to 62 mph in 3.4 seconds .
This is basically a street legal race car with a 678 hp AMG engine capable of 217 mph .
The cost you ask ?
A cool $ 1,550,000 .
Total savings = $ 915,430 .
— — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — —————-
Conclusion :
So , we ’ve seen some pretty amazing cars along this journey as we explored the top 10 supercars that should be more affordable .
While reviewing some of the most expensive exotic cars in the world , we also proposed some cheaper alternatives that are just as much fun to drive , have tremendous character , outstanding class and provide a nitrous boost to the male ego .
So what ’s the overall price delta for our recommendations ?
A whopping $ 4,899,430 !

First came the stomachaches and low fevers .
Then Lance Cpl. Cory Belken broke out in a rash .
His temperature shot up to 104.6 degrees .
The young man became delirious , telling his mother , Barbara Skaggs , that he wanted to go to the smoking section even though he had never smoked .
His blood pressure dropped .
Belken , a 20 - year - old Marine , had been dealing with two potentially life - threatening conditions at once -- a recent onset of acute leukemia and a blooming infection from a smallpox vaccination .
He was that unlucky one - in - a - million case , his doctors said , but one they hoped would end well .
Unfortunately , his immune system was n’t regenerating very well after two rounds of chemotherapy .
Advertisement
Belken was crashing .
In doctors ’ and family members ’ account of that harrowing night of March 7 , hospital staff at Naval Medical Center San Diego scrambled to get Belken to the intensive care unit about 11 p.m. and worked on him for about 12 hours .
Doctors pumped five medications called vasopressors into Belken ’s body at the highest dose , constricting peripheral blood vessels to keep blood pumping to his heart and brain .
Other organs started to fail .
His hands and feet turned dusky .
On the afternoon of March 8 , Lt. William Danchenko , an oncology nurse practitioner , approached family members in the waiting room .
He thought this was it .
Advertisement
“ We need you now , ” Danchenko told them .
Skaggs , 39 , rushed to the bedside of her only child .
“ Come back , ” she begged .
Bad timing
Belken was the victim of bad timing , said Lt. Cmdr. Edith Lederman , an infectious diseases specialist at the naval hospital .
Advertisement
When a corpsman at the Marine Corps Air Ground Combat Center in Twentynine Palms , Calif. , jabbed Belken ’s arm 15 times to deliver the smallpox vaccine Jan. 13 , the young man felt fine .
He was running regularly and lifting weights every day .
His family , which hails from the St. Louis area , had no history of leukemia , a cancer of the bone marrow that cripples the immune system .
His answers to a standard set of health questions did not rule him out from getting the standard regimen of vaccines for deploying to Iraq .
So Belken got the smallpox shot , which delivers a live form of the virus vaccinia , a milder cousin of the smallpox virus variola .
Had the cancerous cells built up faster , officials would have seen the symptoms of leukemia and exempted him from getting the vaccine , Lederman said .
Or , if he had gotten the vaccine several months earlier , she said , his immune system probably could have cleared the vaccinia without much trouble .
Advertisement
“ It ’s a fluke , really , ” Lederman said .
More than 1.7 million service members have been vaccinated against smallpox since 2002 because of fears of a bioterrorism attack .
Most simply develop a tiny blister that scabs over after 14 days .
The scab typically falls off by the 21st day , leaving a barely visible circle of new skin on the arm .
But the military knows it is risking potentially fatal side effects to protect service members , who are exposed to diseases most Americans never encounter .
About 200 service members have developed complications associated with the smallpox vaccination that were serious enough to require hospitalization or absence from work , according to Lt. Col.
Patrick Garman of the Military Vaccine Agency .
Problems included inflammations of the brain and parts of the heart .
Advertisement
Most of these people recovered , but in one case in 2003 , two expert panels concluded that a group of standard deployment vaccines , including the one for smallpox , probably contributed to the death of Army Spc. Rachel Lacy .
In 2007 , a vaccinia infection also nearly killed a 2 - year - old Indiana boy who contracted the virus from his father , a recently vaccinated serviceman .
The boy , who was vulnerable because he had the skin condition eczema , developed vaccinia lesions over 50 % of his body .
He recovered after he received an experimental drug .
This low rate of serious problems is still high enough to keep public health officials from mandating smallpox jabs for the general population , experts said .
After all , the disease has been eradicated as a natural infection since 1980 .
But because the military still thinks there is a credible threat of bioterrorism with smallpox , one of the deadliest diseases known to man , officials remain committed to inoculating service members , said Dr. Michael Kilpatrick , who directs strategic communications for the Military Health System .
Advertisement
Military officials said that they were doing their best to reduce complications by asking about preexisting conditions , but that they could n’t catch everything .
“ The reality is , we ’re never going to have zero risk on a vaccine , ” Kilpatrick said .
“ There ’s always going to be that individual that has some untoward event that would occur . ”
Belken was one of the estimated 12,800 Americans a year who develop acute myelogenous leukemia .
He just did n’t know it when he was vaccinated .
Things started to go awry about a week later .
Advertisement
He had a headache that did n’t go away , and he slept straight through a day and a half .
A friend took him to an on - base Navy emergency room .
“ They drew blood , and they told me that I had half the blood that I should ’ve had , ” Belken recalled .
On Jan. 28 , he was admitted to Naval Medical Center San Diego .
Cmdr .
Amy Reese , a staff oncologist , thought it best to start chemotherapy immediately , despite the blistering and slightly enlarged size of his vaccination site .
“ We know untreated leukemia is 100 % fatal , ” she said .
Advertisement
Doctors were n’t sure what the treatments , which wipe out both good and bad cells , would do to the vaccination site .
“ It ’s a strange situation to come across , ” she said .
Doctors said they do n’t believe his vaccination triggered the leukemia .
But his depleted immune system , crippled by the leukemia and chemotherapy , did appear to leave enough of an opening for the vaccinia to take hold .
A colleague asked Lederman to take a look at Belken ’s lesion because he knew she worked on pox viruses during a fellowship at the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention .
When she lifted up the gauze March 2 , seven weeks after the shot , she was shocked to see the lesion had grown to nearly 2 inches in diameter .
Advertisement
A rim of blistering tissue surrounded a tan - colored crust .
Vaccinia appeared to be actively eating up tissue .
Lederman told Belken and family members who had flown in from Missouri that she was very concerned .
She suspected a spreading infection known as progressive vaccinia .
She was sending samples to the CDC .
Lederman told the family that it was a rare condition and potentially fatal .
In the past , when Americans routinely received smallpox jabs , 15 % of patients who developed progressive vaccinia died , despite massive amounts of vaccinia immune globulin , the standard treatment .
In his laid - back , Southern - inflected drawl , Belken asked evenly , “ Can it be cured ? ”
Advertisement
Yes , Lederman told him , but it would probably require some experimental treatments in addition to the standard ones .
Because she had worked on the case of the child from Indiana , she knew about a drug called ST - 246 .
The toddler was the first vaccinia patient who had received the drug , and it had worked .
Belken felt encouraged .
“ All right then , ” he said .
Lederman secured special approval from the Food and Drug Administration .
Belken got very protective of his arm and did n’t want family members to hug too tightly .
Advertisement
“ Stay away , ” he told them .
“ That stuff ’s no joke . ”
Minutes to live
With so many things haywire in Belken ’s system , doctors hustled to figure out what was causing his crash .
The main problem turned out to be a multiple - drug - resistant bacterium called Pseudomonas aeruginosa .
It had invaded Belken ’s bloodstream while his immune system was low .
Tests for vaccinia did not show any in the blood or bone marrow , but Lederman acknowledged that the infection may have had some effect .
Advertisement
“ Any time you have an infection or multiple infections going on at the same time , you distract the immune system somewhat , ” she said .
Doctors gave him minutes to live , his mother recalled .
“ And then after those minutes went by , it was hours , ” she said .
“ It turned to days , and then it was all right . ”
One doctor called Belken “ Lazarus . ” Danchenko has never seen such a turnaround .
Advertisement
“ He had one foot in the grave and one on a banana peel , ” he said .
“ If you have anybody who ’s an atheist , they should go meet Cory . ”
The near - death experience left its mark , shriveling some of Belken ’s toes .
Surgeons had to amputate both legs below the knees .
The vaccinia also spawned satellite lesions .
Lederman had to add another experimental drug known as CMX - 001 , which had never been tested on vaccinia patients .
About a month later , she had to kill another drug - resistant bacterium that started to grow on Belken ’s lesion .
The young man required so many doses of vaccinia immune globulin that the CDC has suggested re-evaluating how much we keep in the Strategic National Stockpile .
Belken ’s infection required an amount originally estimated to be enough for 30 people .
Advertisement
In his fifth - floor hospital room one recent morning , Belken patiently crossed his arms and waited for Lederman to apply medicine to his lesion .
His face was gaunt and serious , a contrast with the rosy - cheeked former self smiling back in pictures tacked to the wall .
Lederman was pleased with the scabbing and new purplish - pink skin .
“ We have n’t got any live virus in over a week , ” she said with a smile .
Advertisement
Belken still can’t believe all of these problems attacked him at once .
“ It sucks , ” he said .
“ I mean , I did all the training with all my friends and , I mean , we were moments away from going . ”
Belken and his family wished he did n’t have to deal with the vaccinia in addition to the leukemia .
They did n’t think a smallpox attack was very likely .
“ I think it ’s a big chance they ’re taking , giving them the shots , ” Skaggs said .
Advertisement
She was just glad he ended up at a hospital that had enough experience to handle her son ’s case .
“ If we would n’t have tried these experimental drugs , he could ’ve died from it , you know , ” she said .
Belken has a long road to recovery , but he is making progress .
After a four - month stay at the San Diego hospital , he was transferred to a rehabilitation facility about a week and a half ago .
With the help of a front - wheel walker , Belken can now go about 50 feet on his new prosthetic legs without taking a break .
He is taking such long , fast strides now that sometimes his physical therapists ask him to pull back because they are worried he might reopen some sores on his amputations .
He was also promoted to corporal last week .
Advertisement
Bone marrow tests lately have shown no evidence of leukemia , and Belken is eagerly preparing for a transplant .
Doctors think they have found a pretty close donor match .
Belken ’s grandmother Judy Weekley said she has heard there is a 20 % chance her grandson wo n’t make it through the surgery .
But she said the family is holding on to the guarded optimism that has sustained them through this ordeal .
“ God ’s kept him alive through this ; he ’s not going to let him down now , ” Weekley said .
“ Cory ’s a fighter .
He wants to live .
Real bad . ”

Advertisement Conservative MPs are to pay back another £ 125,000 in expenses as a result of the party 's scrutiny review of claims , David Cameron has said .
Among newly disclosed repayments are £ 25,000 by Eleanor Laing and £ 10,000 by Sir Peter Viggers , who was criticised for trying to claim for a duck house .
It doubles to about £ 250,000 the amount being paid back by Tory MPs in total .
By repaying the money , Mr Cameron said MPs would go some way to " atone for the mistakes of the past " .
Mr Cameron , who addressed all Tory MPs in a private meeting in the Commons before publishing the new figures , admitted the process had not been " utterly consistent in every way " .
However , he said it was a " good step forward " and more action than any other party had taken .
' Damaging issue '
Mr Cameron set up the scrutiny panel after the Daily Telegraph highlighted a number of claims which led to Tory MPs saying they would pay back about £ 125,000 .
The further repayments showed a " collective " understanding of the scale of problem , Mr Cameron added , and demonstrated the party 's " real desire to take a lead over what is a very damaging issue " .
We need to recognise , and in some way try and atone for , the mistakes of the past
David Cameron
" It is about understanding the level of public anger about a system which was broken and the part we played in it .
" It is not good enough just to sort out the rules for the future .
" We need to recognise , and in some way try and atone for , the mistakes of the past .
And these payments are , I believe , an important part of that . "
The latest figures reveal 41 MPs have made extra repayments on top of what was already announced .
Of these , the single highest was £ 25,000 by shadow justice minister Eleanor Laing who was accused of not paying capital gains tax on the sale of a property .
Gardening Mr Cameron said that although Ms Laing had not broken any rules , she had decided it was " morally right " to repay the money .
Bill Cash has agreed to repay £ 15,000 in rent and mortgage costs after it emerged he claimed for rent he paid to his daughter to live in her London flat .
Other senior Tories making payments include John Gummer , who is returning £ 11,500 for gardening and household maintenance , and Sir John Butterfill , who is paying back £ 14,000 for mortgage interest and tax claimed on a staff annexe .
In addition , nine MPs have agreed not to claim for a second homes allowance in future .
NOTABLE TORY REPAYMENTS Eleanor Laing : £ 25,000 Bill Cash : £ 15,000 John Butterfill : £ 14,478 James Arbuthnot : £ 9,338 Stephen Crabb : £ 9,300 Michael Spicer : £ 4,700 James Clappison : £ 3,100 Anthony Steen : £ 1,537 Julie Kirkbride : £ 701
In full : Conservative repayments
The cases of two MPs , Anne Main and Brian Binley , are being considered by the Parliamentary Standards Commissioner after complaints were received about them by members of the public .
The Telegraph reported that Mr Binley claimed rent for living in a property owned by his company , not against the rules at the time although later outlawed .
He has publicly said he will not repay any money as he believes he has not done anything wrong .
According to the Telegraph , Ms Main 's daughter was living rent free in her publicly funded second home but the MP has also insisted she did nothing wrong .
The BBC News Channnel 's chief political correspondent James Landale said not all MPs had yet been scrutinised , with the report featuring 186 of the 192 Tory MPs .
Fair system
While the Tories were stressing the process had been voluntary , he said it was clear that many MPs had faced tough meetings with Mr Cameron over the issue .
Last week the parliamentary authorities said MPs from all parties had paid back £ 500,000 of money , with Labour MPs repaying a total of £ 366,000 .
A separate body has been set up by Parliament to go through all MPs ' claims since 2004 but Mr Cameron , who has himself agreed to pay back nearly £ 1,000 , said he wanted the Conservatives to react more quickly to public anger over expenses .
SCRUTINY PANEL MEMBERS
Tory chief whip : Patrick McLoughlin Deputy chief whip : John Randall National convention chairman : Jeremy Middleton Lawyer : David Gold Leader 's chief of staff : Ed Llewellyn Party finance director : Ian McIsaac
He set up the scrutiny panel , whose members include his chief whip and chief of staff , and all Tory MPs have had to submit their expenses since 2004 for inspection by the six - man panel .
Anyone found to have made unjustified requests has been under pressure to repay money or face suspension .
Frontbenchers who had already agreed to repay money include George Osborne , Michael Gove and Alan Duncan .
A number of Tory MPs have said they will stand down from Parliament since the expenses crisis began , several in direct consequence of public outcry over their behaviour .
These include Sir Peter Viggers and Andrew MacKay who stood down after it emerged he had named the main home in which he and his wife , fellow Tory MP Julie Kirkbride , lived as his second home and claimed expenses on it .
Mr MacKay , whose case has been referred to the House of Commons authorities , has yet to repay any money .
Ms Kirkbride later said she would quit Parliament after facing criticism over claims she re-mortgaged her second home in her constituency , in which her brother lived rent free , to build an extra bedroom .

WASHINGTON 
As he often does , President Obama took the opportunity in a bill - signing ceremony last month to remind Congress “ to do what we were actually sent here to do  and that is to stand up to the special interests , and stand up for the American people . ”
But Mr. Obama did not mention that the measure he was signing , the Helping Families Save Their Homes Act , was missing its centerpiece : a change in bankruptcy law he once championed that would have given judges the power to lower the amount owed on a home loan .
It had been stripped out three weeks earlier in a showdown between Senate Democrats and the nation ’s banks , including many that are getting big government bailouts .
As Congressional Democrats and the White House crow about multiple victories over the financial industry , including new rules for credit card issuers , banks are quietly savoring an even bigger victory of their own .
Yep , you guessed it .

Sewage created by residents across Manchester is to be recycled to power about 500 homes in the city .
The £ 4.3 m scheme , thought to be the first of its kind in the UK , is being tried out at waste water treatment plants at Davyhulme in Manchester .
Human waste is converted to biomethane which is pumped into people 's homes .
Developed by National Grid and United Utilities , the method has been hailed as the " fuel for the future " because of its low carbon emissions .
Caroline Ashton , United Utilities biofuels manager , said : " Sewage treatment is a 24 - hour process so there is an endless supply of biogas .
" It is a very valuable resource and it 's completely renewable .
" By harnessing this free energy we can reduce our fuel bills and reduce our carbon footprint . "
' Commercial scale '
Biomethane will also be used to power the utilities firm 's sludge tankers .
The project has received funding from the government department Defra , through the Waste and Resources Action Programme ( Wrap ) .
Janine Freeman , head of National Grid's Sustainable Gas Group , said the pilot scheme would power about 500 homes .
She added that a plant the size of Davyhulme would be able to provide energy for more than 5,000 properties in the future .
Several plants in Europe are already using the method to power homes and businesses .
Dr Richard Swannell , director of retail and organics at Wrap , said : " The project aims to be the first in the UK to process and inject biomethane into the gas grid on a commercial scale .
" By using biomethane as a fuel for sludge tankers , it could also help our country make more widespread use of renewable energy . "
It is hoped the project will be up and running by 2011 .
A new Chinese government edict requiring that economic stimulus money be spent only on Chinese goods takes the world a step further toward a dangerous international trade war , foreign businessmen and some economic analysts here warn .
" It is a new sign of global protectionism , " worries Xu Xiaonian , who teaches at Shanghai 's China - Europe International Business School .
" This will definitely hurt the global economic recovery . "
The new regulations , dated May 26 and reported in the China Daily this week , say that " government - funded projects should purchase domestic products unless they cannot be obtained under reasonable business conditions . "
Imports paid for from the government 's $ 586 billion stimulus plan must be approved in advance , it stipulated .
The measure drew strong criticism from the European Union Chamber of Commerce here , which warned in a statement that giving local firms preferential treatment " sends the wrong signal to the domestic and international business community at a time when international cooperation is key to sustaining economic recovery . "
Nations creep toward protectionism
Most economists agree that protectionist trade policies turned the 1929 United States stockmarket crash into the Great Depression , and since the current economic crisis began world leaders have repeatedly pledged to avoid repeating that mistake .
Nevertheless , the World Bank has accused members of the Group of 20 key world economies of imposing more than 50 trade restricting measures in the past seven months .
The US Congress attached a " Buy American " rider to President Barack Obama 's stimulus package in February , ultimately requiring , after intense debate , that the money be spent on US - made goods and services as long as that is " consistent with the United States ' obligations under international agreements . "
At the time , Chinese officials complained bitterly about US protectionism and the danger it posed to the world economy .
Other signs of rising protectionism have emerged in the past few days .
On Tuesday , the government of the state of New South Wales in Australia offered local companies preferential treatment over foreign ones in bidding for government contracts .
Earlier this month , the Federation of Canadian Municipalities approved a reciprocal boycott of American products in municipal procurement decisions .
The Chinese notice announcing the new rules , issued by the State Council ( China 's cabinet ) , the powerful National Development and Reform Commission , and seven other ministries , said they were necessary to correct a bias toward foreign suppliers .
For China , aim is n't to protect jobs
Although Chinese manufacturers often offer lower prices , explains Xiang Songzuo , an independent economist , " state - owned enterprises have a tendency to buy foreign goods because that offers executives an opportunity to travel abroad and to get commissions .
" The main purpose of this document is anticorruption , " he argues .
Pressure for protectionist measures is building in China , says Mr. Xiang , but it is not coming from workers fearing for their jobs , as is generally the case in Western countries .
Instead , he says , " many companies , mainly private exporters , are complaining to the government because they are losing their foreign markets ... and they need more domestic demand .
They see other countries ' stimulus packages encouraging firms to buy local and hire local workers , and they ask why the Chinese government does not have a similar policy . "
STS - 117 was a Space Shuttle mission flown by Space Shuttle Atlantis , launched from pad 39A of the Kennedy Space Center on June 8 , 2007 .
Damage from a hail storm on February 26 , 2007 had previously caused the launch to be postponed from an originally - planned launch date of March 15 , 2007 .
The mission , also referred to as ISS - 13A by the ISS program , delivered to the International Space Station ( ISS ) the second starboard truss segment ( the S3 / S4 Truss ) and its associated energy systems , including a set of solar arrays .
During the course of the mission the crew installed the new truss segment , retracted one set of solar arrays , and unfolded the new set on the starboard side of the station .
STS - 117 also brought Expedition 15 crewmember Clayton Anderson to the station , and returned with ISS crewmember Sunita Williams .
This mission was the 118th Space Shuttle flight , the 28th flight for Atlantis and the 21st U.S. flight to the ISS .
The launch of STS - 117 marks the 250th orbital human spaceflight .
The completion of the mission leaves thirteen flights remaining in the Space Shuttle program until its end in 2010 , excluding two as - yet - unconfirmed Contingency Logistic Flights .
On June 11 , NASA mission managers announced a two - day extension of the mission , adding a fourth extra-vehicular activity ( EVA ) .
These two days were inserted into the mission timeline after flight day 8 .
This possibility had been discussed prior to launch .
Because of launch day and thus rendezvous day uncertainty the decision to extend was deferred until after launch .
The repair of the gap in the Orbital Maneuvering System ( OMS ) thermal blanket ( heat shielding ) was conducted during EVA 3 .
Because of the cancellation of landing opportunities on June 21st because of weather , STS - 117 is the longest mission for Atlantis , landing at Edwards Air Force Base on June 22nd .
FULDA , Germany —
The rusty and paint - chipped guard post might seem out of place among the rolling green hills and tidy villages of Germany ’s Rhine region .
But the backdrop of concrete barracks and barbed wire hints at what this place , called Point Alpha , really was :
Just a few decades ago , this was a crucial border checkpoint between East and West Germany , where American soldiers waited for an imminent Soviet attack that never came .
“ This was n’t a border between two countries , ” said Rudolf Kling , a volunteer tour guide at the Point Alpha Memorial .
“ It was a border between two different worlds : communism and freedom . ”
The post at Point Alpha looks out over a broad stretch of lowlands .
This strategic corridor , called the Fulda Gap , was a central chess piece in a global battle of American and Soviet wills that ended almost 20 years ago , with the fall of the Berlin Wall in November 1989 .
If Soviet troops launched an invasion , American military experts believed it would happen here , 450 kilometers from Berlin .
“ The Fulda Gap was an easy path to Fulda , so the troops could march right into it , ” said Gunther Teubner , another volunteer tour guide at the Point Alpha Memorial .
He pointed to a map and drew a direct line from Fulda through the former West Germany , all the way to the French border .
“ They would have cut the Federal Republic of Germany in half , and they would n’t have stopped there . ”
The Fulda Gap ’s navigable terrain made it a logical attack point because large masses of men and weapons could move west at a rapid pace .
But the land held as much symbolic as strategic significance .
A successful Soviet march through the Fulda Gap would have paved an open path to nearby Frankfurt , the financial heart of West Germany and home to the U.S. Army ’s V Corps headquarters .
Wolfgang Hamberger , Mayor of Fulda from 1970 to 1998 , was in regular contact with Point Alpha regiment commanders and headquarters in Frankfurt , learning of information he could n’t always relay to his constituents .
“ Nobody wanted to spread panic , ” Hamberger said of his job .
“ But the people knew that if push came to shove , Fulda was a risky place to live . ”
It is n’t clear how close Soviet leadership came to breaching the Warsaw Pact by striking through the Fulda Gap .
But the strip of land remained a tinderbox for decades as American and Soviet forces stood eye - to - eye across mesh - iron fences .
If an attack had occurred , the world would likely have witnessed a full - scale war pitting two nuclear powers against one another .
“ If they marched in — if there was a siege — we knew we ’d be gone , ” said Winfried Jaeger , who was born and raised in Fulda .
Yet the looming attack never moved past a battle of intimidation and tension because the Soviet forces were never given the order to strike .
“ There is believed to be one main reason for that , ” explained Gerhardt Wittig , a historian with the Joint Commission of German and Russian Historians .
“ It was the American presence .
If you attacked the Federal Republic of Germany , that meant full - out war with the U.S. , and you had to be able to survive that . ”
The 14th Armored Cavalry Regiment was the first battalion of Americans to patrol the post at Point Alpha starting in 1951 , and the soldiers remained at the site until 1991 .
Michael Brand , who represents Fulda in the German Parliament , was just 16 years old when the Berlin Wall , and the border between East and West Germany , fell .
He still keeps a piece of Point Alpha ’s mesh - iron fence in his Berlin office .
“ We were grateful that the American troops were stationed [ at Point Alpha ] at that time , and we still are , ” said Brand .
“ Looking at it now , Point Alpha was a beacon of freedom , and it will be seen that way in the future as well . ”
Fulda ’s former mayor , Hamberger , said people in his town went about their daily lives .
And he pointed to the American presence as a deciding factor .
“ Our anxiety was tempered by the awareness that the superior American military technique and strategy was protecting our peace and freedom , ” he said .
These days , Point Alpha attracts about 100,000 visitors annually who tour the museum and walk through the former American barracks where soldiers once slept , ate and watched .
The spot is preserved as a stark reminder of what the East - West divide wrought for all those along its winding path .
“ There ’s no other place in the country where the role of Americans in defending the country is explained and celebrated like at Point Alpha , ” said Michael Brand .
“ It ’s a reminder that peace and freedom need to be protected . ”

GERMAN 76.2-MM SELF -PROPELLED GUN
Further information has been reported from official sources about this weapon , previously referred to in Tactical and Technical Trends , No. 21 , p. 6 .
It appears that to date the only 76.2 - mm piece reported mounted on the 38 light ( t ) * tank chassis is a long - chambered version of the Russian field piece 76.2 - mm FK ( Feldkanone , field piece 36 ( r ) . *
The long - chambered piece and the Russian light field piece are identical except for the following differences :
76.2 - mm as mounted
on 38 ( t ) tank 76.2-mm FK 36 ( r ) Muzzle brake Yes No Length of chamber ( approx ) 28 in 15 in Chamber volume ( approx ) 3,600 cc 1,780 cc Maximum range ( estimated ) 15,000 yds 8,000 yds
Both pieces have Russian markings ; however , the only known long cartridge case ammunition is of German manufacture .
It is also of interest to note that the same cartridge case is used in the 75 - mm Pak 40 ( antitank ) as is used in the long - chambered 76.2 mm .
A Fresno homeless advocate has been sent a letter from Homeland Security , informing him that his attempts to help the homeless have been " brought to the attention of the Police Department 's Terrorism Liaison Officers . "
The unwanted attention of the Homeland Security anti-terrorism group followed a City of Fresno " clean up " of a homeless encampment on the Mariposa Mall in downtown Fresno .
Several homeless advocates monitored the " clean up " and removal of homeless people 's property on the morning of April 22 , 2009 by City Sanitation Workers .
" Clean ups " at the Mariposa Mall site , just west of Fresno City Hall , are conducted about once a month .
City Sanitation puts up signs announcing the date of the clean up , most of the homeless people move out shortly before they arrive , and move back later in the day .
Phil Connelly , one of the homeless advocates , left the Mariposa Mall “ clean up ” and went to the City of Fresno Corporate Yard ( 2101 G street ) in an attempt to see where the confiscated property was taken .
It has been city policy to store property at that location for 90 days , or until it is reclaimed .
A few days after his visit to the City of Fresno Corporate Yard , Connelly was contacted by Sgt. Ronald Grimm , Homeland Security Coordinator for the Fresno Police Department .
Seed beetles are polyandrous
Seed beetles are polyandrous – females mate with multiple males , and choose which sperm will fertilize their eggs afterward .
Scientists long believed they did this to get the best sperm .
But a new study shows the fittest males always lose .
A study published today in Science details a series of careful experiments Swedish researchers conducted on mating seed beetles ( pictured ) .
They want to find out what the benefits were to females who mated with multiple males , given that multiple matings could be dangerous to their health for a variety of reasons .
The accepted wisdom is that females mate with many men because they can choose which sperm fertilize their eggs after mating .
Basically , more men equals a bigger and better smorgasbord to choose from in the genetics department .

The San Francisco Municipal Transportation Agency board unanimously approved the city 's long - stalled bike plan Friday , giving the go - ahead to 45 of the 46 individual projects under consideration .
" Today is an historic day for the future of bicycling in San Francisco , " Mayor Gavin Newsom said .
" These bike lanes will improve our environment , enhance bike safety and help people lead healthier lives . "
Leah Shahum , executive director of the San Francisco Bicycle Coalition , also applauded the decision .
" It really is a historic decision by the city to invest in sustainable transportation , " she said after the plan was approved at a packed meeting at City Hall .
The plan calls for 34 miles of new bike lanes on city streets , among them Fifth Street , Alemany Boulevard , Ocean Avenue , Clipper Street and Portola Drive .
It also includes proposals for new bike racks , special traffic signals for bikers and other initiatives intended to make cycling safer and more convenient .
The only proposed project to be held up was the planned bike lane on Second Street in the South of Market , which ran into opposition from neighbors upset over the prospect of losing traffic lanes and the ability to make left - hand turns at several intersections .
The transportation board asked for more study of the proposed Second Street bike lanes .
The bike plan had been held up for three years by court order .
Two groups and blogger Rob Anderson sued to block implementation , successfully arguing that a thorough environmental analysis was needed before the plan could be implemented .
The city conducted the study , and the Planning Commission certified the document Thursday night .
Anderson said he intends to appeal that decision to the Board of Supervisors .
Once that process is exhausted , the city attorney will petition the Superior Court to have the injunction lifted .
If and when that is done , the transportation agency can move forward with the bike - improvement projects .
In all , about 60 projects are planned to be completed in the next few years at a cost of about $ 14 million .
Officials hope to get started by late summer or fall .
LONDON ( Reuters ) - Oil Major Royal Dutch Shell
Plc does n’t plan to make any more large investments in wind and solar energy in the future and does not expect hydrogen to play an important role in energy supply for some time .
“ We do not expect material amounts of investment in those areas going forward , ” Linda Cook , head of Shell ’s gas and power unit told reporters at a press conference on Tuesday .
“ They continue to struggle to compete with the other investment opportunities we have in our portfolio , ” Cook said of solar and wind .
Shell ’s future involvement in renewables will be principally limited to biofuels , which the world ’s second - largest non- government - controlled oil company by market value believes is a better fit with its core oil and gas operations .
In the past year , the company said it was refocusing its wind business on the U.S. as it pulled out of European projects .
Shell has around 550 megawatts of wind power capacity but does not break out figures for investment in each renewable energy source .
From 1999 - 2006
Shell invested around $ 1.25 billion in green energy , according to Reuters analysis of Shell ’s statements .
Wind played a large part of that .
One renewables analyst said the decision could reflect the $ 100 / bbl drop in oil prices since July which has eased concerns about energy supply and the economic crisis which has pushed environmental concerns down the agenda .
“ There may not be any political pressure on them to invest in renewables at this particular stage , ” the analyst , who asked not to be named , said .
The decision may anger environmental groups who , in recent years , have put pressure on Shell over its major investments in Canada ’s oil sands , an energy and water intensive business which involves squeezing crude from bitumen - soaked soil .
While Shell ’s advertising focuses on its involvement in renewable energy , only around 1 percent of its investments go to these energy sources .
The son of Iran 's supreme leader , Ayatollah Ali Khamenei , has taken control of the militia being used to crush the protest movement , according to a senior Iranian source .
The source , a politician with strong connections to the security apparatus , said that the leading role being played by Mojtaba Khamenei had dismayed many of the country 's senior clerics , conservative politicians and Revolutionary Guard generals .
But these conservatives are reluctant to challenge the Khameneis openly out of fear that any conflict would destabilise the Islamic Republic and weaken Iran in the region .
Instead they will use their positions in the organs of state to make it hard for the supreme leader and President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad to govern .
" This game has not finished .
The game has only just started , " the source said , on condition of anonymity because of the sensitivity of his own position in Iran .
He said Mojtaba had played a leading role in orchestrating Ahmadinejad 's disputed election victory on 12 June and had led the backlash against protests through direct control of street militias , known as basiji .
The official death toll from that backlash is less than 20 but , according to a Tehran doctor who has given his account to the Guardian , the actual number is much higher – 38 in the first week at his hospital alone .
He said the basiji covered up the deaths and pressured doctors not to talk .
" Mojtaba is the commander of this coup d'etat .
The basiji are operating on Mojtaba 's orders , but his name is always hidden in all of this .
The government never mentions him , " the Iranian politician said .
" Everyone is angry about this .
The maraji [ Iran 's most senior ayatollahs ] and the clerics are angry , the conservatives are very angry and strongly critical of Mojtaba .
This situation cannot continue with so many people on the top against it . "
Very little is known about Mojtaba Khamenei .
He is the supreme leader 's second son , reportedly being groomed to succeed his father .
Such a dynastic succession would be very hard under present circumstances as the leader is supposed to be chosen by a clerical assembly of experts on the basis of the candidate 's religious standing .
Mojtaba wears clerical robes but by no means has the theological status to rise to the top job .
A major upheaval in the clerical establishment would be required to arrange it .
Within Iran , Mojtaba is widely believed to control huge financial assets .
There are claims on Iranian dissident websites that the current anti-British campaign in Tehran is motivated in part by Britain 's announcement on 18 June that it had frozen nearly £ 1bn in Iranian assets , in accordance with UN and EU sanctions .
The frozen funds included a lot of Mojtaba 's money , it is claimed .
Mojtaba 's name does not appear on the Treasury 's list of targets of those sanctions , but one British official said the supreme leader 's son may operate through state - run enterprises that are listed .
" I 'd be amazed if some of the money was n't his , " the official said .
The Iranian politician who spoke to the Guardian said the supreme leader had long been leaking support among the religious hierarchy on which his powerbase was once built and had now virtually lost it altogether .
Among the roughly 20 maraji ( " sources of emulation " , from whose ranks the supreme leader is supposed to be chosen ) , he said Khamenei could only rely on the support of a handful .
He said that an axis of lay conservatives in important positions would also try to hinder Ahmadinejad 's efforts to wield power .
That axis includes Ali Larijani , the parliamentary speaker , Mohammad Baqer Qalibaf , the Tehran mayor , and Mohsen Rezai , one of the defeated presidential candidates and the secretary of the expediency council , which mediates disputes between the clerical and lay state institutions .
They would be supported by the opposition 's most powerful backer behind the scenes , former president Hashemi Rafsanjani , head of the expediency council and the assembly of experts .
The Iranian source also claimed there were splits in another pillar of the Islamic Republic , the Revolutionary Guard .
The overall commander , General Ali Jafari , and the Tehran province commander , General Ali Fazli , were opposed to Mojtaba 's power grab .
He said the hardline statements issued in the Revolutionary Guard 's name , threatening a " decisive confrontation " with protesters , were the work of the political and public relations departments , which are under the direct control of Ahmadinejad , and did not represent a united position .
That is a controversial claim .
Most analyses have presented the Revolutionary Guard as monolithic and entirely behind the regime .
For revolutionary stalwarts uneasy over the direction of the regime , open rebellion was unthinkable , the politician said .
" For them , the red line is the stability of the country , " he said .
" They will continue softly . "
He said this hidden internecine struggle would last a considerable period and the outcome was far from clear .
The only certainty was that the Khameneis and Ahmadinejad had not yet won .
" They control things on the surface , " he said .
" But Iranians are not sheep . "
Everyone is gaga over the idea of fast solid - state drives , but until we move to some new memory technology other than flash , SSDs are a dead end .
I say this only because during a recent trip to Europe I took about six photos on a 16GB Compact Flash card and boom !it was dead .
This makes the third CompactFlash drive that blew up on me over the past few years .
I 've had two early 1GB drives go out , and now this 16 GB card .
One is simply too many .
Then there is the technology I 've harped on over the past five or six years : .
When the idea for the HHD was hatched , it was intended to solve all sorts of problems .
Half spinning platter and half flash memory , an HHD would increase throughput and make the hard disk more powerful than ever somehow .
I actually sat through a day of presentations outlining how this device would revolutionize the mass - storage industry .
It was all ready to go and , as one guy put it , make Vista so hot that people would flock to it .
You see , .
How soon they forget .
So Vista comes out , but the drives do not .
Then I wait .
And wait .
I start asking around .
All of a sudden these things are delayed .
Nobody actually says why .
Samsung may have announced one .
The CEO of Seagate tells me that they will probably end up only in high - end servers .
He can't say why .
Over time they simply fail to hit the market except as oddities here and there .
This was complicated by some scheme of Intel 's to use memory on the motherboard to accomplish the same speed boost .
That plan seemed to crap out too .
Then a couple of years ago , we begin to see the solid - state drive .
Various drives hit the market ; some show up in netbooks and some in laptops .
Their prices are about ten times the price of a mechanical hard drive , in terms of cost per gigabyte .
But then rumors of a 30 percent failure rate begin to surface .
These rumors are denied by the industry , but people maintain a persistent belief that SSDs fail at least twice as often as conventional hard disks .
This seems to be the case .
Needless to say , there 's some issue with the technology .
And I 'm certain that this failure rate has something to do with the non-start of the HHD .
Flash memory appears to be a stopgap technology hanging around until a better nonvolatile memory technology appears .
There are plenty of suitors , sure , but nothing commercial .
Flash memory suffers from all sorts of problems , the least of which is a finite read / write cycle that requires a special allocation architecture to keep the data bits moving from one part of the memory chip to another so that one area does n't get " worn out . "
And often when you buy a Compact Flash or SD card , you might find you get a data - recovery disk with your memory module .
When one of these things blows up , it wo n't work ever again , but the data is still there on the drive , and you can coax it off with the right software .
I never lost the photos I had stored on that toasted CompactFlash card , I just could n't use it in the camera anymore ( or anywhere else for that matter ) .
It was fried .
There are a number of hot memory technologies lurking in labs around the world , and unless flash can prove itself more reliable , storage technology will turn toward something entirely different if something new actually makes it out of research and into development .
Until then , people , always take an extra memory card with you when you travel !
You wo n't regret it .
This happens to every shutterbug every so often .
And as for the solid - state - drive revolution , well , good luck with that one .
To true believers , the iPhone is not just another phone .
“ It ’s a device that does everything in my life , ” said Vartan Nadjaryan , who already has an iPhone but still showed up at an AT&T ; store in Glendale at 3:30 a.m.
Friday to be among the first to get his hands on the latest incarnation of Apple Inc. 's popular touch - screen device , the iPhone 3G S .
Nadjaryan , 20 , was among thousands of people who queued up to buy the device , which costs $ 199 to $ 299 for new AT&T ; subscribers and current subscribers who are eligible for an upgraded phone .
Since introducing the original iPhone in 2007 , Apple has snagged a significant chunk of the market for smartphones , a category of high - end cellphones that also lets users take pictures , play videos , access the Internet or play games .
Last year , the Cupertino , Calif. , company sold 13.7 million iPhones worldwide , capturing 8.4 % of the smartphone market , said Tina Teng , an analyst with research firm iSuppli Corp. in El Segundo .

But while throngs of people lined up for hours for the first - and second - generation iPhones , Friday ’s launch of the iPhone 3G S was relatively subdued .
At the AT&T ; store where Nadjaryan went , about 15 customers were waiting when the store opened at 7 a.m .
But a mile away at the Apple store in the Glendale Galleria , about 200 had shown up by the same time .
This roll - out day was quieter in part , perhaps , because for the first time , buyers could pre-order the phone online the day before its store release , Teng said .
Another factor may be the cost of the service , she said .
The least expensive AT&T ; plan that includes text messaging and data service would run in excess of $ 100 , including tax .
“ That can put a cap on their growth , ” said Teng , who estimates that Apple will sell 18.7 million iPhones this year for a 10 % share of the market .

For some , the problem was n’t in getting the phone ; it was getting it to work .
Thanks to the crush of new phones coming on line within a short period of time , some customers waited hours for their phones to be activated .
Customers who called Apple ’s customer service line were informed of a possible two - to three - hour delay in getting phone service for their new devices .
Nadjaryan said he had to reboot his iPhone 3G S three times before it connected .
But , he said , “ it ’s well worth it . ”

Times staff writer David Sarno contributed to this report .
Mexican soldiers battled for two hours with armed men believed to be holding police hostage in a house in Acapulco , leaving 16 gunmen and two soldiers dead , the military says .
At least three soldiers and Mexican bystanders were injured in the shootout .
Some small hotels were evacuated in the Acapulco neighborhood , which used to be popular with classic Hollywood stars such as John Wayne , but has since fallen out of favour and become rundown .
The battle broke out Saturday night after the military received a tip about a gated home filled with armed men , said the army colonel who led the mission and spoke on the condition of anonymity for security reasons .
Gunmen opened fire at the soldiers when they arrived at the house and hurled about 50 grenades at them .
Several gunmen tried to flee in a car but ran into a Humvee that was blocking the exit .
An additional group of gunmen arrived by car to reinforce those in the house , but were killed by the military , the colonel said as he wore a ski mask while leading reporters through the battle scene .
Inside the home , soldiers found four Guerrero state police officers who were handcuffed in the garage .
The police officers , who were still bound and sitting on the floor , told reporters that they were being held captive by the gunmen .
The military did not have any intelligence reports about the police officers capture and said their identities had not been confirmed .
" We found them like this , handcuffed , and they say they were kidnapped .
So , if they were kidnapped , as they say , then we rescued them , " the colonel said near the bound men .
The military said it was unclear whether the gunmen belonged to one of the drug cartel battling for turf in Guerrero state .
One drug cartel , the Beltran Leyva cartel , has a heavy presence in Acapulco .
One of its top lieutenants was arrested last month .
The military said they confiscated 47 guns , grenades and various ammunition from the home , and seized several cars , including a Mercedes Benz .
Mexico has deployed 45,000 soldiers in the war on the drug cartels .
More than 18,000 people have died since December 2006 in drug - related violence .
The Mexican offensive has had far - reaching implications , as the shortage of Mexican drug exports , has driven up illegal drug prices around the world .
Police in Vancouver have said the spike in gang violence there is related to the shortage of Mexicans drugs , causing gangs to fight over a shrinking supply .

Advertisement " Can you think of a more complicated question to ask ? " says Deb Roy , as he explains the genesis of his work .
In 2005 , the artificial intelligence researcher at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology ( MIT ) Media Lab set out to understand how children learn to talk .
" We wanted to understand how minds work and how they develop and how the interplay of innate and environmental influence makes us who we are and how we learn to communicate . "
It was a big task and after years of research , scientists around the world had only begun to scratch the surface of it .
But now , Professor Roy is beginning to get some answers , thanks to an unconventional approach , an accommodating family and a house wired with technology .
And the research may even have kick - backs for everything from robotics to video analysis .
Snap shots
The question of how infants learn to speak is hotly debated .
At its simplest level the argument comes down to " nature versus nurture " .
On one side , scientists argue that children have an innate hard - wired ability to learn language , while on the other side , researchers argue that language is learned through interactions with the people and environment around them .
The first task we set for ourselves was to transcribe everything my son heard or said from nine to 24 months
Deb Roy Between the two extremes is a spectrum of opinion .
Professor Roy wandered into this debate as someone originally more interested in robots than children .
" I was initially inspired by how children learn language as a new way of building machines , " he says .
But looking through the raft of prior research on the effect of environment on language , he noticed a common problem ; previous studies only offered snapshots of a child 's development .
" Every parent knows that a child can change a lot in a week or a month , " he told BBC News .
" If you 're interested in the process of development then it is important to have a continuous view . "
It is a problem recognised by other linguists as well .
" Current samples that the field works with - typically an hour of recorded speech a week - are one to two orders of magnitude too small for our scientific purposes , " Professor Steven Pinker of Harvard University told BBC News .

So , Professor Roy , who by then had a child on the way , set about solving the conundrum .
His solution : wire up his house with 11 cameras , 14 microphones and terabytes of storage and record every waking moment of his soon - to - arrive son .
It was christened the Human Speechome project and immediately drew comparisons with its genetic counterpart .
" Just as the Human Genome Project illuminates the innate genetic code that shapes us , the Speechome Project is an important first step toward creating a map of how the environment shapes human development and learning , " said Frank Moss , the director of MIT 's Media Lab at the time .
Professor Pinker , who is also an adviser to the project , said : " In developmental psychology there has long been a trade - off between gathering lots of data from a small number of children , or a small amount of data from a much larger number of children .
" Roy is simply pushing this trade - off to an extreme - a truly massive amount of data from a single child . "
Now , a quarter of million hours of recordings later , Professor Roy is beginning to tease apart the masses of data and look for answers .
Deep dive
To extract meaningful patterns from the 200GB ( gigabytes ) of data that flowed daily onto the racks of hard drives in the basement , the team created a series of software tools .
The first , ominously called Total Recall , allows a researcher to quickly scan through any part of the data .
All 25 recordings from the microphones and cameras are shown as separate channels .
HUMAN SPEECHOME PROJECT 11x 1 megapixel fisheye lens cameras .
Swithced on by motion sensors .
14 x omnidirectional microphones recording CD quality sound 1000 m ( 3000 ft ) wires connect recorders to servers in basement Record from 8 am - 10 pm every day for 3 years PDAs in each room can be used to control recording ' Oops ' button wipes last few minutes of recording Sound is represented as a spectrograph , while the video is processed to show only movement , creating a ribbon of colour , which looks like the flow of traffic at night and represents the accumulated motions of life in the Roy household .
While useful for getting a sense of when and where action may have taken place , the team needed another set of tools to delve deeper into the data .
" The first task we set for ourselves was to transcribe everything my son heard or said from nine to 24 months , " he says .
He estimates that there is somewhere between 10 to 12 million words of speech to transcribe .
" For anyone that has transcribed speech , they will know that is a laborious and slow process , " he says , with a degree of understatement .
Initially his team tried to use off - the - shelf speech recognition software , but soon realised that they were not up to the job of extracting words from often - noisy environments .
" We realised that the state of the art is not even close to good enough , " he told the BBC .
Automatic systems could have error rates of up to 90 % , he said .
At the other extreme , Professor Roy also experimented with human transcribers , but that also came with its own problems .
" It would take an average of 10 hours to find and transcribe one hour of speech , " he told the BBC .
HUMAN SPEECHOME IN NUMBERS 90,000 hours of video recorded 140,000 hours of audio recordings Approx 200GB of data collected every day 150 TB of raw data collected over course of project 70 % of infants waking hours captured 10 to 12 m words spoken 4 m words so far transcribed
Speechome project launched
When you are trying to analyse 16 months of video from 14 microphones , those kinds of ratios do n't seem attractive .
Instead , the researchers created a piece of software called Blitzscribe , which finds speech in the recordings and breaks it down into easily transcribed sound bites .
" We have automated components assisting human annotators , " he said .
The net result is that we have reduced 10 hours down to two hours . "
The analysis also takes into account how a word was said - called prosody - and who said it .
To date , the team have already transcribed more than four million words .
" It 's already the most complete transcript of everyday life at home than any recording ever made . "
A similar human - computer system , called TrackMarks , has also been developed to analyse the video and gives information such as where people are in relation to one another and the orientation of their heads .

Advertisement Although the data sets are still incomplete , Professor Roy says they are already beginning to see interesting results .
For example , his team has been able to begin to tease apart a process he calls " word births " , the time when a baby first begins to use a word .
By analysing the length , and hence complexity , of sentences spoken by caregivers to his son , he believes that he has shown that adults subconsciously simplify sentences until the child understands the word .
Once it has been understood , the adults then build up the complexity of the sentences containing the word .
" We essentially meet him at this point of the birth of the word and gently pull him into language , " he says .
The Speechome Recorder can be fitted in any home Professor Roy stresses it is an initial result and has not been validated by the scientific community .
However , he says , it shows the kind of questions that can be answered with the data and tools he now has .
But winning over the rest of the scientific community might be his most difficult job .
It remains to be seen whether other scientists will accept his conclusions as they are based on the analysis of just one child and , as Professor Roy admits , are unlikely to be reproduced because of time and cost .
In part to address this criticism , he has developed a stand - alone device - called the Speechome recorder - that can be easily put into homes with out 1000 m ( 3000 ft ) of wiring in the walls and converting the basement into a data centre .
The devices look like floor lamps and contain an overhead microphone and camera , with another lens at eye level for children .
The base of the device holds a touch - screen display and enough storage to hold several months of recordings .
Their first deployment will be in six pilot studies of children with autism where they will be used to monitor and quantify the children 's response to treatment .
" I 'm really excited - this is the future of the project , " says Professor Roy .
Robot reflex
But he also has his eye on other possible spin - offs .
For example the video - analysis algorithms designed for the project could be used in automated systems to monitor CCTV cameras and extract information about particular events .
He is also working with architects to visualise how people move around an environment and how changes to building design affect that .
The results are being fed into creating a semi-automated architectural design system .
" This could be really interesting if you 're designing a retail space or if you are an architect and have a design and want to know whether it will work or how to change it . "
However , Professor Roy has never forgotten his roots in robotics and still hopes to bring the project full - circle .
" What if we can build a machine that can step into the shoes of a child and learn in human - like ways , " he asks .
" Imagine transferring that into a video game character or into a domestic robot that can now learn to communicate and interact in social ways .
" I see a lot of pathways back . "

I heard a lot of news about ‘ tea parties ’ going on yesterday .
If you do n’t know , tea parties are supposed to mimic the Boston Tea Party , where New Englanders complained that they were paying tax , but had no say in government , i.e. taxation without representation .
That got me wondering why people would be participating in tea parties today .
Nearly everyone in the U.S. has representation , so that ca n’t be it .
From the Financial Times
The protests are focused on Mr Obama ’s economic recovery efforts and $ 3,600bn ( £ 2,400bn ,  2,700 bn ) federal budget , which critics portray as “ big government ” measures that will pile debt on future generations .
Nothing about taxation directly there , but these tea parties are scheduled for April 15th ( the deadline to file your US individual tax return ) .
So does it have something to do with taxes or not ?
If you want to protest government spending as opposed to taxation , do n’t have a tea party and do n’t do it on April 15th .
If you want to protest taxation , well , that got me curious .
I assumed that the US has the lowest taxes in its modern history .
I knew that the first tax rates in our history would be really small , so my definition of modern history is , say , after the depression .
The Tax Foundation has the historical numbers and even an Excel download .
Unfortunately the data is n’t normalized , so I had to do some manipulating .
The moral is , do n’t protest taxes when taxes are low ( unless you think they should be higher ) .
I really have to thank Jon Peltier for his timely post about Callout Label Error Bars .
I changed all of the years ( four digit integers ) into dates using = DATE ( YEAR ( A2 ) , 1,1 ) .
I wanted the x-axis to be a date , so I made every year January 1st .
Next , I found the maximum marginal tax rate for that year for the married - filing - jointly filing status .
I guessed that MFJ is the most typical filing status .
Then I created an X - Y scatter chart with a big purple line .
For the error bar callouts , I used this range .
I started with .2 error bars for everything , then manually adjusted them to make them look nice .
The formula in F2 is =VLOOKUP ( E2 , $ A$ 2 : $ B$ 98,2 ) - G2 .
It finds the rate for the date in question and subtracts the error bar value .
I had to round all the historical dates to the nearest January 1st so that the error bars were n’t out in space .
The workbook is n’t pretty , but you ’re welcome to download taxgraph.xls.zip .
BOSTON – An experimental drug that starves the bacteria responsible for tuberculosis makes conventional therapy five times more effective against drug - resistant TB , doctors reported today .
The company - run study found that the Johnson & Johnson drug TMC207 , if added to a standard cocktail of five other TB medicines , cleared traces of the tuberculosis bacteria in the sputum of 48 percent of the volunteers after eight weeks .
Only 9 percent of patients given the five older drugs alone showed that type of improvement .
TMC207 is being billed as the first new tuberculosis drug in 40 years .
It works by interfering with the enzyme ATP synthase , which the bacteria need to store energy .
" It starves them .
It 's like cutting off your food supply , " Dr. David McNeeley of Tibotec Inc. , the subsidiary of Johnson & Johnson that developed the drug , said in a telephone interview .
Other drugs attack TB in different ways .
The only notable side effect was nausea , experienced by 26 percent of volunteers in the TMC207 group , versus 4 percent among those getting the conventional cocktail plus a placebo , they reported in the New England Journal of Medicine .
The test involved 47 people in South Africa with newly diagnosed lung TB that was resistant to two standard drugs , isoniazid and rifampin .
About 1.8 million people die worldwide each year from tuberculosis and a third of the world 's population – 2 billion people – are infected , according to the World Health Organization .
The WHO says that of 9 million new TB cases annually , about 490,000 are multiple - drug resistant TB or MDR - TB and about 40,000 are extensively drug resistant or XDR - TB .
Fewer than 3 percent of MDR - TB cases worldwide are being treated according to WHO recommendations .
The bacteria is extremely difficult to treat because it can remain dormant in the body , unresponsive to drugs .
That means patients have to take medicine for a long time , and people often stop their therapy , allowing resistance to develop .
" It 's like the bacteria are hibernating .
They can go for 20 years and then there 's a relapse , " McNeeley said .
But even hibernating cells need to use some energy , he said .
The new drug cuts off this lifeline .
" So whether you 're actively replicating or sleeping slowly , you strangle to death , " he said .
The development of TMC207 represents an important advance in the chemotherapy of tuberculosis , " Clifton Barry of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases in Bethesda , Maryland , said in a commentary .
It represents " a new class of drugs that increase the therapeutic options for patients who have multidrug - resistant or extensively drug - resistant tuberculosis , for whom treatment options are often sparse , largely ineffective , and often highly toxic , " Barry wrote .

McNeeley said another characteristic of the drug is that its effects show up later than conventional TB medicines , whose effectiveness may wane just as TMC207 is starting to have a real impact .
Asked if the drug , if approved , would be cheap enough for widespread use in the sometimes - poor countries where TB is the biggest problem , McNeeley said , " Johnson & Johnson is committed to bringing this out to the people who need it . "
I do n't think this is the wordiest strip I 've ever done , but it probably comes damn close .
It 's pretty hard to talk about the whole nature - versus - free - will thing concisely , though .
I think what it boils down to is that people basically want to bang because millions of years of evolution have made bangin ' pretty much the most fun thing people can do with their time !
See you tomorrow , hopefully with slightly fewer words .
How Much Longer Can This Go On? Posted June 2009 .
How can we systematically find the longest increasing subsequence ?

Mail to a friend Print this article Introduction Suppose given a sequence of distinct numbers , and we ask , what is the length of the longest increasing subsequence ?
For example , I give you 2 , 5 , 1 , 4 , 7 , 6 , 3 .
Trial and error give you almost immediately several subsequences of length 3 , such as 2 , 5 , 7 .
In fact , it 's easy to write down all those of length 3 : 2 , 5 , 7
2 , 5 , 6
2 , 4 , 7
2 , 4 , 6
1 , 4 , 7
1 , 4 , 6 So the question quickly becomes , are there any of length 4 ?
Well , any subsequence of length 4 would have to extend one of length 3 , so you can just look at all of length 3 and see if any can be extended .
The answer is , no .
So if you think only of short sequences , this will seem easy to answer .
I 'll demonstrate a graphical method that will help you do the necessary mental calculation quickly .
But suppose I give you a sequence of 100 numbers 41 , 93 , 31 , 73 , 98 , 29 , 12 , 54 , 24 , 0 , 52 , 78 , 87 , 55 , 25 , 81 , 76 , 91 , 51 , 7 , 39 , 92 , 65 , 40 , 45 , 5 , 1 , 20 , 84 , 99 , 27 , 32 , 13 , 8 , 2 , 61 , 19 , 9 , 74 , 60 , 66 , 79 , 47 , 86 , 30 , 3 , 85 , 42 , 89 , 43 , 70 , 17 , 6 , 63 , 28 , 11 , 34 , 75 , 22 , 64 , 59 , 16 , 48 , 15 , 90 , 80 , 69 , 67 , 35 , 72 , 50 , 14 , 33 , 53 , 10 , 38 , 94 , 18 , 58 , 46 , 49 , 88 , 68 , 21 , 62 , 44 , 97 , 82 , 37 , 83 , 95 , 4 , 56 , 57 , 77 , 23 , 96 , 26 , 36 , 71 ?
Answering this question will involve a few digressions , and will have connections to many parts of mathematics .
In the first part of this column , I 'll explain how to solve the problem posed here , very little more and no less .
In the second , I 'll say something about extensions into other matters .
Note :
The original posted column was mathematically incorrect ( near the end of the Heights section ) .
I wish to thank Luigi Rivara for pointing this out .
What follows is now correct .
Part I . Increasing subsequences Reformulation
So , suppose we are given a sequence of n distinct integers .
It will make things slightly , but not drastically , simpler if we look only at sequences of n integers in the range 0 ... ( n - 1 ) .
In effect we are given a rearrangement or permutation of this range .
How can we systematically find the longest increasing subsequence ?
Let 's look at something easier than one of length 100 , say this one 5 , 2 , 0 , 6 , 1 , 4 , 7 , 3 It will make the discussion easier , if we add to this list the indices of the numbers in the sequence , starting with 0 , so it becomes a sequence of pairs of numbers , which can be written 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 5 2 0 6 1 4 7 3 The original problem can now be formulated slightly differently .
We are going to put an order on pairs of numbers .
Define ( a , b ) ≤ ( c , d ) to mean that a ≤ c and b ≤ d .
( This is what is called a partial order , because it can happen that of two given pairs , neither is less than or greater than the other .
For example , [ 2,5 ] and [ 4,1 ] are not comparable . )
We are given a set of such pairs [ 0,5 ] [ 1,2 ] [ 2,0 ] [ 3,6 ] [ 4,1 ] [ 5,4 ] [ 6,7 ] [ 7,3 ] and we want to find in it a constantly increasing chain of greatest length .
We can picture the problem .
In the following figure the pairs are marked in red , and one pair is `smaller ' than another when there is a chain of arrows from the first to the second .
It is easy to read off from the diagram that the length of a maximal chain is 4 , and that there is exactly one of that length , starting at [ 2,0 ] and ending at [ 6,7 ] .
Heights
The diagram also suggests a way to solve the problem systematically .
( 1 ) Certain pairs are minimal in the set - there are no smaller pairs .
In the diagram , these are the ones that are in some sense ' at lower left ' .
Here there are three of them : [ 0,5 ] , [ 1,2 ] , and [ 2,0 ] , all marked in red in this diagram :
To be precise , recall that the order on our set of pairs is given by arrows , and one pair is less than another if there is a chain of arrows from the first to the second .
A pair is minimal if there are no arrows with it as target .
So we can find the minimal pairs by running through all the arrows , and eliminating their targets .
More generally , suppose we call the height of a pair one more than the length of the longest increasing chain ending at it .
The minimal pairs are those of height 0 .
And we have now found a new way to formulate the original problem - we want to find a pair with the largest possible height .
Here are the height assignments , which we find by inspection :
The colored pairs are a bit more interesting than the others .
You may at first be tempted to say , if we want to assign a height to some pair [ x , y ] and we have an arrow from a pair [ a , b ] of height 0 to it , then we assign it height 1 .
But this would be wrong , say , for the pair [ 5,4 ] .
The longest path to it comes from [ 4,1 ] , which has height 1 , so we assign it height 2 .
The basic principle for any set of pairs is that a pair ( x , y ) has height h if ( a ) there is a pair of height h- 1 which is less than ( x , y ) and ( b ) there are no smaller pairs of height ≥ h .
Why is this ?
Well , a pair of height h- 1 has to it a chain of length h , so ( a ) guarantees that there is a chain to ( x , y ) of length h+1 , and its height is at least h .
As for condition ( b ) , if [ x , y ] were assigned height ≥ h+1 there would be a chain to it of length ≥ h+2 , and in that chain just before it a pair of height ≥ h .
So there would have to be some pair of height h that is smaller than [ x , y ] .
These criteria are practical .
It might seem with condition ( b ) that we are just going around in circles , but in fact there is a fairly simple way to assign heights as we read from left to right .
( 1 ) The very first pair in the list has to have height 0 , it is guaranteed to be minimal .
( 2 ) Suppose we want to assign height to a pair [ i ,n ] and we have already assigned heights to all previous pairs .
Any pair smaller than the current pair [ i ,n ] has to be one of the previous pairs .
So we scan them to check conditions ( a ) and ( b ) .
For example , let 's look at our example again .
Suppose we have assigned heights for the first five pairs , and want to find the height of the sixth pair [ 5,4 ] ..
Index 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 Number 5 2 0 6 1 4 7 3 Height 0 0 0 1 1 2 In order to check whether a previous pair is smaller , it is enough to check that the second coordinate is smaller , since the first one is necessarily so .
The previous pairs smaller than [ 5,4 ] can be read easily as [ 1,2 ] , [ 2,0 ] , [ 4,1 ] .
The first two are of height 0 , but the second is of height 1 .
So the height of [ 5,4 ] is 2 .
Here are the final height assignments : Index 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 Number 5 2 0 6 1 4 7 3 Height 0 0 0 1 1 2 3 2 I summarize how the process goes :
We scan through the sequence from left to right , finding for each i in succession the height h i of n i .
In finding h i , we scan through all the prior items n j < n i , finding the maximum height h j among them .
Then we set h i = h j +
1 . This calculation even tells us , recursively , how to assemble for each i a chain of maximal length ending at n i , since it gives us for each n i an n j just prior to it in a maximal increasing chain .
The obvious drawback of this process is that it is horribly inefficient , since in assigning h i we have to search through all i-1 predecessors .
The amount of work involved is thus proportional to 1 + 2 + 3 + ... ( n - 1 ) = n( n - 1 ) / 2 for a sequence of length n .
For n large , this is roughly n2/2 ; for n=100 about 5,000 , not feasible to do by hand .
Organization
Is it really necessary to scan through all n j with j < i when assigning h i ?
If you think carefully about what 's going on , you see that there are two criteria to be satisfied when assigning height h to n i : ( 1 ) n i < all predecessors n j with h j ≥ h ; ( 2 ) n i > at least one predecessor n j with h j = h - 1 ; But these suggest that as we go along we keep track of some extra data - for each height h we keep track of the minimum value of n j among those j with h j = h .
With these data at hand , we no longer have to scan the entire list of predecessors , but need just to scan down the list of such minimum values to find the smallest one that is still greater than n i .
We can understand this better if we maintain a record of all the items with a given height , which I 'll do in a kind of bar graph .
If the original sequence we are considering is the one above - i.e. 5 , 2 , 0 , 6 , 1 , 4 , 7 , 3 then the graphs go like this :
Let me explain a few of these .
( a ) When we are placing the 2 , we have no predecessors of size < 2 , so it gets height 0 . ( b ) When we are placing the 6 , there are several of size < 6 , all of height 0 , so it gets height 1 . ( c ) When we are placing the 3 , it is < 7 so it can't have height 4 ; and it is < 4 , so it can't have height 3 ; but it is > 1 , which has height 1 , so it gets height 2 .
This procedure is much , much better than the original one .
It costs a little extra effort to keep the height records , but the amount of time it takes to assign all heights is very roughly proportional to the length of the input sequence .
The sequence of 100 integers written down at the beginning is entirely feasible .
We get the length of a longest subsequence to be 15 , and a subsequence of that length to be 9 26 34 45 52 55 71 72 75 79 80 92 93 94 95 0 1 2 3 6 11 14 33 38 46 49 56 57 77 96
Furthermore , we can streamline things even a bit more .
We do n't have to keep records of all the items of given height , because as these records grow , the items on top of the record decrease .
( I leave it as an exercise to figure out why . )
This means that the top item of each record is the always the minimum of that height , and after all that 's all we need .
So we only have to keep a list of the last item assigned a given height .
This leads to the bumping algorithm .
Bumping
The way this computation is usually explained is in terms of the bumping algorithm .
We are given a sequence of N distinct numbers n i and want to find the longest increasing subsequence .
We start with an empty array h indexed by - 1 ... N. We initialize it by setting h - 1 = -∞ and h i = ∞ for all i ≥ 0 .
We then progress through the sequence n 0 , n 1 , ... modifying the array h as we go along .
In terms of the process we described before , at any given moment the j - th item in h will be the previous item we saw of height j .
In order to assign a height to [ i , n i ] , we find j with the property h j < n i < h j+1 , and replace h j+1 by n i ( i.e. we bump h j+1 ) , to which we assign height j+1 .
Initializing with -∞ and ∞ saves us some trouble dealing with special cases .
Here 's how the array changes with time in the example above .
h 0 h 1 h 2 h 3 ∞ 5,2,0,6,1,4,7,3 5 2,0,6,1,4,7,3 2 0,6,1,4,7,3 0 6,1,4,7,3 0 6 1,4,7,3 0 1 4,7,3 0 1 4 7,3 0 1 4 7 3 0 1 3 7 Following this as described does n't tell us as much as does the earlier process of assigning heights in place to the numbers in the sequence , but it does tell us that the maximum height is 3 .
At each stage , we have to search the array H to find where to insert something .
This can be done ( by binary search ) in a number of steps proportional to the logarithm of the length of the array .
The amount of time it takes to finish the process is therefore proportional to at most n log n if the length of the original sequence is n - much faster than one might expect from a first look at the problem .
In doing this by hand , the part that takes the longest is just writing stuff down .
Part II .
Going further Recycling
The bumping process is rather wasteful .
When one inserts an item into the array to replace an item that is already there - when we bump it - we have not paid any attention at all to the item we replace .
Is it really necessary just to throw away all those bumped items ?
Not at all !
They can be reused !
We build up a new sequence of pairs from the bumped items .
If h j < n i < h j+1 , we bump h j+1 and replace it by n i .
But now instead of just forgetting h j+1 , we add the pair [ i , h j+1 ] to a new sequence of pairs to be dealt with in the next stage .
In the example above , [ 1,2 ] bumps 5 ; [ 2,0 ] bumps 2 ; [ 4,1 ] bumps 6 ; and [ 7,3 ] bumps 4 .
So the new sequence of pairs we get is [ 1,5 ] , [ 2,2 ] , [ 4,6 ] , [ 7,4 ] .
We insert this into a new blank row .
The row becomes 2,4 , giving in turn a bumped sequence [ 2,5 ] , [ 7,6 ] .
Repeat .
If we write the succesive rows underneath each other , we get finally the pattern 0 1 3 7 2 4 5 6 This pattern is called a tableau .
It has this characteristic feature : the numbers in rows increase from left to right , and those in columns increase from top to bottom .
So far , we have n't done anything with the first coordinates we carry along .
Now what we do is maintain at each stage two rows simultaneously , getting eventually two tableaux of the same shape .
Whenever a number is added to the first row instead of replacing a number already there , we place the index of the number inserted to the second row .
What we get in this example is a similar tableau : 0 3 5 6 1 4 2 7 Going backwards
The process of going from the initial sequence through a sequence of pairs to a pair of tableaux can be reversed .
For example , suppose we are given the tableaux 0 2 3 1 4 0 1 3 2 4 We can read off from this what has happened .
The last entry added to the tableaux had to be the 4 in the second one .
So the last entry made in the first was in the same location .
So the 4 in the second row was bumped from the first row , and in fact it had to be bumped by the 3 .
So the last operation done was to insert 3 into the first row of the following pair of tableaux .
0 2 4 1 0 1 3 2 Continuing , we see that the previous operation was to insert a 4 .
In the end , we can see that the initial sequence of numbers was 1 , 2 , 0 , 4 , 3 .
The Robinson - Schensted correspondence Since we can go both ways - sequence to pair of tableaux and back again - we get in the end a matching of permutations of 0 ... ( n - 1 ) with pairs of tableaux of n elements each .
This turns out be a remarkable way to understand permutations .

Getting laser eye surgery can be a life changing decision which may seem like a risky procedure but in reality , has proven to be very safe and effective .
Ask around , you 'll be surprised how many people have had the procedure or know someone who has , with very positive results .
I should know , I 'm one of them - and I 've had a different experience than most people that I 'd like share .
Hopefully you 'll be able to relate to my story and then decide if it is right for you .
After all , how many people can say they had both procedures done at the same time ?
First off , let me say that I 've never been one to shy away from taking risks ; many a friend can tell you some crazy stories .
But risks and stories aside , laser eye surgery does affect the eyes after all , and I made absolutely certain to take every precaution and research everything before going through with the procedure .
The investigation began ...
Lasik vs. PRK
My Procedure
The Day of the surgery
Recovery
Today
First , let me start by telling you why I decided to have the vision correction procedure .
I had worn glasses since the age of 10 , replacing them as my prescription changed , changing styles as designs changed , enduring them breaking or the lens popping out when playing soccer or basketball ( insert your childhood experience here ) .
I eventually switched to contact lenses , and although aesthetically I felt they were better , contacts came with their own set of problems .
For one , they were never completely comfortable , especially after wearing them for long periods of the day - my eyes would dry out , become watery and there would be a general redness of the eyes .
Not only that , after some time they began to really irritate my right eye , and after seeing an ophthalmologist ( eye doctor ) , it turned out they had actually scarred my cornea due to them not being cleaned properly ( I knew I should n't have switched solutions ! ) .
Much to my chagrin , I was forced to switch back to glasses until my cornea fully healed ( which would be at least 3 months ) .
This was ok until one fine day when I went skiing on Cypress Mountain .
The overcast day started off well until it started to sleet ( snow / rain ) on the mountain .
I had been skiing fine with my glasses on , but as the downpour increased , I tried putting my ski goggles on over my glasses .
It worked in preventing the snow from building up and obscuring my vision but now they were getting fogged up underneath my goggles .
Let 's just say that as vision decreases , fear and frustration increases when trying to ski down a mountain .
After suffering / surviving the next couple of runs and feeling dejected over a wasted day of skiing , I decided that there must be a better way .
I even thought about all the times I went to the beach with my glasses , only wishing to wear sunglasses .
Then wearing contacts so I could wear sunglasses but then losing the contacts in the water .
And then finally getting prescription sunglasses but not being able to go into the water for fear of losing them .
God help us poor , partially blind souls .
I 'd seen some ads in the paper and saw prices as low as $ 490 an eye to as high as $ 1200 for vision correction surgery .
I always thought this was considered cosmetic or elective surgery but learned that many health insurance plans started covering a portion of laser eye surgery similar to glasses and contacts .
This was encouraging and I suggest checking out your plan and you 'll probably discover the same thing if you have a decent health insurance plan .
I then asked around to find out if anyone had actually had the procedure done and found some - my wife 's cousin , and a colleague from work - both had had their procedure done at different places and were very pleased .
Each told me that the initial consultations were free and that 's the best place to start .
You can schedule a no obligation appointment and they 'll measure your eyes and tell you what type of procedure you 're eligible for .
They 'll then recommend a procedure ( as everyone 's eye shape and prescription is different ) .
I had astigmatism as well but this is not an issue for them to treat .
They will finally quote you a price and leave you to decide when , or even if you 'd like to go through with it .
No pressure .
So I first tried the place my wife 's cousin recommended - Vision Med .
The friendly staff at their office did the consultation in about 1.5 hours - recommending that I get PRK done on both eyes - a more expensive procedure but with better long term success .
My colleague had gone to London Eye Center which was located a little too far for me to see however he highly recommended it and said either way , do the most expensive and safest procedure as this affects your eyes after all .
- Good advice .
The next place I decided to consult was the one with all the ads around - Lasik MD .
I found out that this chain had done more than 300,000 procedures including the Canadian Armed forces .
First impression was that it was a really nice , welcoming office a few blocks away from Vision Med .
I must admit , I 'm a fish guy and the large aquarium they had warmed me up to them too .
Their consultation took about 3 hours and I felt was much more thorough .
They immediately noticed the scratching on my cornea and said that although I qualify for Lasik ( the $ 490 per eye deal ) that PRK may be a better choice .
What 's more is that in a strange twist of fate , I learned that the same ophthalmologist I had seen regarding my eye , was also one of the doctors at Lasik MD .
There are 2 procedures that can be done with laser eye surgery - Lasik and PRK .
Without getting into too much detail or history I 'll break down the main differences .
If you qualify for both , its really just a matter of recovery time , money , and comfort level .
What you 'll first need to understand is that your eye , and specifically your cornea , is layered like an onion ( I think of Shrek every time I explain this ) .
Interestingly enough , the outer 2 of the 5 layers of your eye will grow back or ' regenerate ' themselves - the lower 3 do not .
This is the basis for laser eye surgery - they use a high precision laser to cut away at the layers of the eye to reshape it and correct the way light enters it ; correcting the image our brains interpret .
The difference between Lasik and PRK is with Lasik ; they first cut away the 2 layers of the eye , make the laser incision , fold the 2 layers back and allow the eye to heal .
Since just the incision has to heal , the recovery time is drastically reduced ( as well as healing discomfort ) .
The downside , is that the Dr has to make the incision .
PRK on the other hand is considered ' No touch ' meaning no doctor / human touch needed - just straight lasering of the eye and the 2 layers need time to grow back on their own .
Apparently , long term this is said to have a higher success rate since there is no room for human error .
Recovery time is much longer and can be very uncomfortable but is apparently safer as they place a contact lens and bandage on your eye , ensuring nothing enters it ( dust ) which healing .
The laser technology has also advanced over the years , although they are both affective , the newer model lasers have more precision .
This in turn makes using the new laser more expensive .
The original laser is a cheaper procedure and the one generally offered with the $ 490 per eye promotion if you qualify .
Well , all that more thorough testing at Lasik MD paid off since I did in fact qualify for the lasik procedure .
I had limited vacation left at work and liked the fact that I had the option to choose for myself .
In the end , I decided lasik would be the best procedure for me , however , after speaking to the doctor that would actually be doing the procedure ( yes my now good ophthalmologist friend ) - he actually mentioned that there 's no reason I could n't opt for Lasik on the left eye and PRK on the right .
That way the cornea scarring caused by my contacts would be eliminated as well .
Brilliant !
All the preparation , discussions with family and seemingly endless anticipation passed , and the day of the procedure finally arrived .
Now I 've been skydiving , bungee jumping etc , and I have to admit , the moment before I lay under the laser , I had that sudden rush of adrenaline and thought to myself - " Am I really ready ?
What if something goes wrong ?
Do I really want to go through with this ? " and then I reminded myself of all the extensive research I did beforehand and am now sharing with you .
So in I went under this white behemoth of a machine - honestly just amazing technology even just to look at .
The doctor put some drops in my eyes which numbed the area , they then put something in to keep my eyes open and he steadied my head under the machine .
The Dr then made his incision for the left ( lasik ) eye .
Picture a little robot - like guillotine on its side , on tracks .
It purposefully slid over my eye making the incision .
This was the only time I could n't see , and a little worrisome although I was warned / prepped it would happen .
The laser then goes to work and in about 15 seconds , the eye is done .
The Dr then finished up and bandaged the eye ( My vision was blurry but I could see ) .
It was now time for the right eye which was to use the PRK procedure .
This was much more straightforward as the Dr told me to simply look at the honeycomb - shaped lights of the behemoth , and after 15 seconds of zaps , the procedure was done .
Of course , no one tells you about the burning hair smell which is actually your eye burning , but in the end what else would you expect ?
That it would smell like Cool Water ?
:) Leaving the facility , you can still see although its very blurry - but reassuring none - the - less that you can still see .
Also , you can drop your glasses off in the large bin by the entrance - I hear they donate them to third world countries - enjoy pirates !
Having both eyes done with different procedures , I really got to experience the difference between the two .
For the first couple days , you 're all bandaged up and can only function in really low light .
The pain killers help but early on it was hard for me to know which eye is was more sore .
However , after the first couple days its obvious - the PRK eye hurt like a $ * @!%* compared to the lasik .
But with lots of rest and painkillers it 's definitely tolerable .
Pretty soon , I did n't feel any discomfort in the lasik eye and was even trying to watch tv to cure my boredom .
Here 's the interesting part , my vision was blurry but improved in about 3 - 4 days considerably in my left eye ; the vision was n't perfect but was really good .
My PRK eye on the other hand , well that took a good 10 - 12 days , but my vision was becoming even clearer than the Lasik eye .
After about 2 months , the PRK eye was pretty much perfect , while the lasik eye was still a bit blurry .
4 months later and they were both excellent .
Throughout the recovery , there is constant stream of eye drops to deal with the dryness .
You also have to deal with copious amounts of boredom from not being able to focus on things .
There are a number of post - op checkups where they test your eyes after the first week , month and then 3 months after the procedure .
Their goal is to see how your eyes are healing and to ensure that you would n't need a follow - up correction .
This happens on extremely rare occasions but is covered when you decide to get the procedure done .
I'm happy to say that its been 2 years since the vision correction procedure and I proudly have 20 / 20 vision .
There are very minor halos at night ( no worse than when I wore contacts ) when you look at things like lampposts or headlights .
Of course , I now have complete freedom to go to the beach or ski whenever I want without glasses or contacts .
Overall , one of the best decisions I 've ever made and a safe procedure I highly recommend to all my friends , family and anyone else who took the time to read this novel .
LOS ANGELES / TOKYO ( Reuters ) - A collapse in silicon prices threatens to put the heat on solar panel makers that use little of the material , such as Japan ’s Sharp Corp and even low - cost industry darling First Solar Inc .
Spot prices on the solar industry ’s key raw material , polysilicon , have halved since January , giving a leg up to solar panels that rely heavily on the material .
Thin - film solar panels , made with little or no polysilicon , are starting to lose their competitive edge over China - made silicon - based modules , which are more efficient in transforming the sun ’s rays into electricity .
“ First Solar is still the undisputed leader , but finally , someone ’s competing with them , ” said Macquarie analyst Kelly Dougherty .
Intensifying price competition is making scale all - important , hurting the chances of start - ups , she said .
“ If this trend continues , I would n’t be surprised if just a handful of thin - film companies are left . ”
U.S. - based First Solar , the world ’s top thin - film company , has been snapping up large , utility - scale contracts in Europe and the United States thanks to its cadmium telluride panels that are cheaper to produce than the traditional silicon - based panels that dominate the market .
But the precipitous drop in silicon panel prices is eroding First Solar ’s lead .
Last month , the chief executive of German solar power plant builder and First Solar customer Phoenix Solar AG said the company was ready to shift toward silicon - based panels if prices drop far enough .
Crystalline silicon and thin film solar panels are now competing in the same markets for the same customers , Andreas Haenel said on a conference call , adding that Phoenix had been able to negotiate lower prices with First Solar as a result .
“ Whenever we see that one is getting the advantage over another , we are flexible to shift from left to right and from right to left , ” Haenel said .
CHINESE ADVANTAGE
Polysilicon prices will continue to fall as semiconductor demand stays weak and oversupply plagues the solar sector , industry players say .
That , along with potential demand gains from a new solar subsidy in China , would further lower costs for Chinese manufacturers , who already boast processing costs of 90 cents to $ 1 per watt of generating capacity -- narrowing the gap with ultra-low - cost First Solar and giving Sharp and Taiwanese thin - film makers such as NexPower Technology , an affiliate of United Microelectronics Corp , a run for their money .
Chinese manufacturers including Suntech Power Holdings Co Ltd , Trina Solar and Yingli Green Energy Holding Co Ltd have been able to cut their prices more aggressively than their German and U.S. peers because they procure more polysilicon from the spot market and because of low electricity and labor costs .
Yingli Green Energy Holding Co Ltd , which is undercutting even its Chinese rivals , was tapped by U.S. power company and First Solar customer AES Corp last month to be its exclusive supplier of crystalline silicon solar panels -- a deal Barclays Capital analyst Vishal Shah wrote “ shows further evidence that low poly prices are likely closing the gap between First Solar and Yingli panel prices . ”
Silicon - based panels are thought to be competitive with thin film at about 1.60 euros ( $ 2.26 ) per watt of generating capacity , according to Friedman Billings Ramsey analyst Mehdi Hosseini .
On average , prices are now between 1.70 euros per watt and 1.80 euros per watt , Hosseini said , adding that China ’s Yingli recently beat out First Solar for a contract in Germany by pricing below the market average at 1.60 euros per watt .
First Solar officials did not reply to a request for comment on Hosseini ’s assertion .
“ These price falls are a major problem for thin - film makers , especially for those that use turnkey lines from Applied Materials Inc or Oerlikon and who just deliver standard amorphous tandem thin - film cells , ” said iSuppli analyst Stefan de Haan .
Applied Materials customers include India ’s Moser Baer , U.S. - based private company Signet Solar and China ’s ENN Solar Energy Co. Oerlikon customers include Germany ’s SCHOTT Solar and ErSol Solar Energy AG and Taiwan ’s CMC Magnetics Corp .
DOWN , BUT NOT OUT
Not that anyone expects First Solar to be run out of the market .
Rather , lower prices on silicon - based panels will pressure the company to stay competitive by cutting its own prices , ultimately driving down earnings estimates .
“ First Solar is still one of the best companies , it ’s just that competition is catching up and do you really want to buy it at $ 200 ? ” said Hosseini , who cut his rating on First Solar to “ underperform ” this week .
“ The kind of earnings that I am expecting justifies a $ 100 or $ 110 stock , not $ 200 . ”
First Solar ’s stock was at $ 190.66 in Monday afternoon trade on Nasdaq and has gained about 30 percent so far this year .
The shares trade at about 25 times 2009 earnings estimates , compared with multiples of 22 , 15 and 11 for Yingli , Suntech and Trina .
One First Solar investor said that while competition was heating up , he still expected the company to compete best for contracts with U.S. utilities , who are willing to trade efficiency for the lowest price possible .
“ It does make thin - film marginally less superior , but it definitely has n’t eroded its advantage , ” said Edward Guinness , a fund manager with Guinness Atkinson Funds , which owns more than 11,000 First Solar shares .
“ We ’ve always seen thin - film as having an attractive niche .
I do n’t think it ’s going to take over the whole market , and I ’ve never thought that . ”

Measuring the electric charge on single atoms is not something that has n't been done before , but now researchers from IBM's Zürich research laboratory have improved on their previous work , and shown that atomic force microscopes ( AFM ) can successfully replace scanning tunneling microscopes ( STM ) in doing the job .
Using an STM yields good results as well , and it was an IBM researcher who , back in 2004 , first proved that measuring the electric charge on single atoms with this technology was possible .
But , according to the experts , an AFM is more suited for the job , because it does not require that the analysis sample be set on a conductive layer .
A scanning tunneling microscope has a quite simple construction principle .
It boasts a tip only a few atoms wide ( in some cases just one atom wide ) , which is used to analyze microscopic samples .
It is brought down on the sample , and it then passes an electrical current through it .
The conductive surface underneath helps drive the current through the material that needs studying .
The microscope then analyzes the variations that the electrical current experiences while running through the sample , and determines some of its properties .
With AFM , IBM researchers believe they may have found a more elegant solution .
This type of microscope also has a tip just one atom wide , but it 's kept in place by a cantilever , a beam just a few nanometers across .
This diving board has a small voltage running through it , but the current does not pass through the sample and underneath .
The cantilever vibrates because of this voltage close to its natural frequency .
This ensemble is then brought down very close to the sample , which is usually made up of either a single atom , or just a few .
When brought this close to each other , the atom at the tip of the AFM and the atom in the sample interact on the basis of the “ opposite charges attract ” principle , which means that the interactions between the two atoms will slightly change the way the cantilever resonates and oscillates .
Despite the fact that these variations are less than one atom's size in one direction or the other , researchers are able to analyze them and determine if gold or silver atoms have an extra electron , or if they lack one .
“ That is what makes this technique so important ; it 's not only the charge state of an atom but we want to go further and investigate molecules and measure distribution of charges .
We 're not directly aiming at making a photovoltaic cell or a computer in our system .
We 're trying to understand the basics of the processes in such devices , ” Dr. Leo Gross , from IBM , told the BBC News .
World ’s Best Photographers and their amazing shots
Its always a good feeling to see a nice picture taken from a right angle with the best camera available in market .
But thats not the only prerequisite to capture a good photograph .
Your involvement with the subject and the virtual development of the image in mind much before it is developed chemically or electronically is what makes the best photographers sets apart from others .
For last few days I have been observing the work of some best known name in photography industry which prompted me to write this article .
Starting with the history and meaning of the word “ photography ” which comes from the Greek word ‘ phos ’ means “ light ” and ‘ graphis ’ means “ representation by means of lines ” or “ drawing ” , together which means “ drawing with light . ”
History of Photography goes back to the 1820s with the development of chemical photography .
The first permanent photograph was an image produced in 1825 by the French inventor Nicéphore Niépce
Though there were many world renowned photographers whose work was applauded and published for many decades
on various magazines , newspapers , internet and other platforms , there are certain legends like
David Seymour , Henri Cartier - Bresson , Robert capa , Bruce Davidson , George Rodger , Eve Arnold and Raghu Rai whose names are unforgettable and sculptured in golden words in the world of photography .
They were not only the best photographers but were also the founding members of Magnum Photos , a cooperative organization
founded in 1947 owned and administered entirely by its member with offices in New York , Paris , London and Tokyo for showcasing classic and unique work of world ’s best photographer .
The first name which comes to my mind is Henri Cartier - Bresson who was born in 1908 and was a French photographer considered to be the father of modern photojournalism , an early adopter of 35 mm format , and the master of candid photography .
After trying his hand in music and painting he finally settled with photography as his last and only obsession .
He joined the French Army as a Corporal in the Film and Photo unit when World War II broke out in September 1939 .
In spring 1947 , Cartier - Bresson , with Robert Capa , David Seymour and George Rodger founded Magnum Photos .
He achieved international recognition for his coverage of Gandhi ’s funeral in India in 1948 and the last ( 1949 ) stage of the Chinese Civil War .
He died in Aug 2004 .
David Seymour born to jewish parents in 1911 covered Spanish civil war and other European events .
In 1947 he founded Magnum .
In 1954 after Robert capa ’s death he became president of magnum .
while covering the 1956 Suez war he was killed by egyptain machine gun fire .
George Rodger was a brit journo .
He was the first photographer to enter concentration ( death ) camps at Bergen - Belsen , a Nazi
concentration camp in Germany during second world war in 1945 .
His photographs of the few survivors and piles of dead human body were published in Life and time magazines and were highly influential in showing the reality of the death camps .
After founding magnum he worked as a freelance photographer taking pictures of people , nature and landscape which were later published in national geographic magazine .
Eve Arnold was the first female member of magnum and changed the myth that women ca n’t be good photgraphers and they can only pose for photographs .
she was born in Philadelphia .
She was best known for her intimate image of actress Marilyn monroe on the sets of Monroe ’s last film , The Misfits .
Currently she lives in Britain .
Raghu Rai born in 1942 is an Indian photographer and photojournalist who initially worked with The Statesman .
In 1976 , he left the paper and became a freelance photographer .
From 1982 up until 1992 , Rai was the director of photography for India Today .
He was the only Indian photographer to be a member of Magnum photos and joined it as correspondent in 1977 .
Rai was awarded the Padmashree in 1971 , one of India ’s highest civilian awards ever given to a photographer .
In 1992 , his National Geographic cover story “ Human Management of Wildlife in India ” won him widespread critical acclaim for the piece .
There are so many other photographers ( though all the names can not be mentioned here )
around the world who are working round the clock taking best shots for all our feel - good factor .
Hats off to such photographers for their Out of Box vision .

Even sham elections can sometimes produce real results .
That was the lesson of the Philippines in 1986 and of Ukraine in 2004 .
And though Friday 's election in Iran is unlikely to yield a similar democratic outcome anytime soon , the poll matters for having again revealed the nature of mullah rule -- to the Iranians who cast ballots expecting they'd be counted , and to a world that finds its illusions about Iranian democracy shattered .
The election was a sham thrice over .
Though elected by popular vote , Iran 's president is subservient ...
WASHINGTON -- The White House said Thursday it was seeking ways to include same - sex marriages , unions and partnerships in 2010 Census data , the second time in a week the administration has signaled a policy change of interest to the gay community .
The administration has directed the Census Bureau to determine changes needed in tabulation software to allow for same - sex marriage data to be released early in 2011 with other detailed demographic information from the decennial count .

Alexander Hleb 's Arsenal regret : I should never have left the Gunners - I 'd die for Wenger
Alexander Hleb has confessed that his move from Arsenal to Barcelona last year was a mistake he now regrets .
The 28 - year - old confirmed he is unhappy in Catalonia despite his team 's successes in the Spainish league and Europe last season .
' When you mostly sit on the bench , winning titles brings very little joy , while getting to the last eight of the Champions League with Arsenal was unforgettable , ' said the Belarus winger .
Please take me back : Alexander Hleb regrets leaving north London
High hopes : Hleb after signing on at Barcelona
' I regret my move from London , but unfortunately nothing can be done about it now . '
While Hleb feels he has been poorly treated by Nou Camp boss Pep Guardiola , he showered praise on former manager Arsene Wenger .
' For me , Wenger was like a father .
I consider him one of the best managers in the world .
' For such a boss one wants to die on the pitch .
Arsene managed to create a smashing team with a wonderful atmosphere inside of it .
' I have no doubts that if Arsenal had the same budget as Barcelona , the Gunners would be among the three best clubs on the planet . '
Hleb is prepared to stick it out at Barca until the new year , but he has been offered to Inter Milan as part of the swap deal that should see Sweden striker Zlatan Ibrahimovic go in the opposite direction .
It 's an excuse for these insurance companies to avoid paying out these claims .
It 's why nyceve , one of our best healthcare bloggers , calls them the MURDER - BY - SPREADSHEET industry .
They 've helped kill three Americans every hour by denying them insurance coverage .
That 's 72 Americans a day that they 've helped kill with this policy in America .
And that 's 26 , 280 Americans that have died every year as a result of this intentional neglect .
This is the DEATH CLOCK created by one of our own kossacks , Dburn , showing how many Americans have died TODAY as a result of this " recission " policy by the murder - by - spreadsheet industry .
Here 's more from this LA Times article , which everyone should read :
An investigation by the House Subcommittee on Oversight and Investigations showed that health insurers WellPoint Inc. , UnitedHealth Group and Assurant Inc. canceled the coverage of more than 20,000 people , allowing the companies to avoid paying more than $ 300 million in medical claims over a five - year period .
It also found that policyholders with breast cancer , lymphoma and more than 1,000 other conditions were targeted for rescission and that employees were praised in performance reviews for terminating the policies of customers with expensive illnesses .
This murderous " recission " policy affects EVERYONE , even nurses .
A nurse in the article lost her coverage , all because she failed to disclose a visit to the dermatologist for acne .
She was diagnosed with breast cancer and had her policy cancelled as a result .
That insurance company left her at great risk and financial cost in seeking life - saving medical treatment without insurance coverage .
AND THIS IS PRECISELY WHY WE NEED A PUBLIC OPTION !
That 's what Rep. Dingell said during the hearing , and I agree with him .
And this guy 's right as well :
" This could reshape the debate , " said Jerry Flanagan , a patient advocate with Santa Monica - based Consumer Watchdog .
" When insurance companies go under oath and admit they are canceling innocent patients when they get sick , it makes it very difficult for lawmakers to pass a law that requires every American to buy a policy or face a tax fine .
It opens the way for a public option to hold the companies in check . "
This is what will happen if we do n't get a strong , robust Medicare - like public option in health care reform .
We 'll get a mandated bailout of the murder - by - spreadsheet industry by forcing us to get their junk insurance policies which we NOW HAVE NO GUARANTEE of actually getting covered if we get sick without a public option .
They 'll deny our insurance coverage , dump us onto another higher - cost junk insurance plan , and we 'll die for the price of our lives to these insurance sharks .
And that new poll that just came out showing that 76 % of Americans support a public option ?
These weakling Senators in the Senate are WRONG about there not being support for a strong public option !
Also , President Obama is WRONG when he says the Conrad co-op proposal is an acceptable alternative .
It 's not an acceptable alternative at all .
Please CALL the White House and tell him to keep his promise about the public option and NOT TO SUPPORT the Conrad co-op proposal !
CALL the White House at : 202-456-1111 and E - MAIL them as well !
Tell them to STOP PLAYING POLITICS WITH OUR LIVES and pass an actual strong , robust Medicare - like public option in health care reform !
I 've had enough of these Senate Democrats and Republicans playing politics with a strong , robust Medicare - like public option , which is now supported by 76 % of Americans .
We desperately NEED a strong , robust Medicare - like public option that is AFFORDABLE and OPEN to all Americans , and helps keep the insurance companies honest .
Mcjoan was right in her diary about why we NEED to pressure the HELP Committee members , and to prevent them from being rolled again .
Here are the numbers of the HELP Committee and their members below along with the usual talking points .
First , start off with by telling these Senators you want a strong , robust Medicare - like public option THAT IS OPTION A , not OPTION B OR C [ see below for three options in committee draft ] in the mark - up of the draft legislation , and to include it when releasing the bill for a FULL CBO score , then go into these talking points below .
Tell Senator [ Name ] that you DO NOT want the 7 - year trigger for the public option and take it off the table , and that you want him to support an affordable strong , robust Medicare - like public option .
We NEED a strong , robust Medicare - like public option NOW OPEN TO ALL AMERICANS AND AFFORDABLE , not more of the SAME broken system that 's given us unaffordable premiums , little private insurance coverage , and rising co-pays .
Also , DON'T TAX OUR EMPLOYER HEALTH BENEFITS .
Instead , follow the proposal by President Obama to tax the wealthy above $ 250,000 , eliminate the overpayments in Medicare Advantage , and put tax capital gains to help fund health care reform .
TELL YOUR SENATOR NO ON THE SCHUMER COMPROMISE AND NO ON THE CONRAD CO -OP COMPROMISE .
Tell Senator Dodd to STOP PLAYING POLITICS to appease the Republicans and release the details public option in the HELP committee bill draft !
CALL Senator Dodd at ( 202 ) 224-2823
You can e-mail the HELP committee as well here at help_comments@help.senate.gov .
Also , do n't forget to CALL these Senators on the HELP Committee with the talking points above and why you WANT the HELP committee draft to have a strong , robust Medicare - like public option , that is NOT THE SCHUMER COMPROMISE OR THE CONRAD CO - OP proposal !

Also , tell President Obama at the White House not to pursue bipartisanship for bipartisanship 's sake with the public option as a bargaining chip in health care reform , especially when Rahm Emmanuel was the one behind the " 7 - year trigger " compromise proposal .
Let 's make President Obama know that we do n't want the 15 % that is traded away for " bipartisanship " to be the public option .
This is what President Obama has told visitors in private at the White House :
The president has told visitors that he would rather have 70 votes in the Senate for a bill that gives him 85 percent of what he wants rather than a 100 percent satisfactory bill that passes 52 to 48 .
Tell President Obama not to sacrifice the public option for the sake of bipartisanship .
It wo n't be real health care reform without a strong public option that helps keep insurance companies honest .
CALL the White House at : 202-456-1111 and E - MAIL them as well !
Please especially CALL Jeff Bingaman to support a strong , robust Medicare - like public option , and Kay Hagan to support a strong , robust Medicare - like public option !!!!

Remember again , this is the three options for the public option in the HELP Committee draft :
Option A : A public health insurance plan operated by the Federal government with a payment schedule that is set in statute and is based on Medicare .
Option B : A federal health insurance plan that is operated under contract from HHS but would play by the same rules as commercial health insurance carriers .
The federal government would contract with an entity to administer the plan as well as provide start - up costs ( e.g. , 6 month reserve ) .
The plan would be required : ( 1 ) to be a non-profit or cooperative entity
( 2 ) charge premiums at a level to cover costs of paying claims , making quality improvements , and administering the plan and ( 3 ) re-pay initial start - up costs .
Every state gateway must offer the federal public plan .
In addition , States would be permitted to operate their own public plan if the plan meets requirements established by the Secretary .
Option C : Drop public plan option .
[ That 's it .
That 's the whole thing . ]
I 'm in favor of Option A in the HELP Committee draft , which is basically a strong , robust Medicare - like public option .
If you want a strong , robust Medicare - like public option , then the time to fight is here and NOW !
Let 's not stop on making these calls !
A strong , robust Medicare - like public option is the line in the sand for me .
Is it the line in the sand for you as well ?
Please REC this diary up so others can see the phone numbers and make the calls today !
Also , please ask your friends and family to CALL today !
The more people that call , the better it will be for the public option in health care reform .
I ’ve just read an elegant study on the neuroscience of gambling that wonderfully illustrates why the dopamine equals pleasure myth , so often thrown around by the media , is too tired to be useful .
I have seen countless news reports that claim that some activity or other causes dopamine to be released ; that dopamine is the ‘ pleasure chemical ’ ; and that it ’s also released by ‘ drugs ’ , ‘ sex ’ , ‘ gambling ’ and ‘ chocolate ’ ( a quartet I have named the four dopamen of the neurocalypse ) .
Normally , this breathless attempt to make something sound sexy is followed by a slightly sinister bit where they say that this dopamine activity is also likely to make it ‘ addictive ’ .
Dopamine is involved in drug addiction , but the over - extended clich√© is drivel , not least because the dopamine neurons start firing in the nucleus accumbens when any reward is expected .
Whether it be heroin , a glass of water when you ’re thirsty , or your favourite book on calculus – if that ’s what floats your boat .
And herein lies the subtlety .
Our best evidence tells us that while the dopamine system has many functions , it ’s not really a reward system – it ’s most likely a reward expectancy system of some kind .
Theories of exactly what form this takes differ in the details , but it certainly seems to be active when we ’re expecting a reward , whether it actually turns up or not .
The study on gambling , led by neuroscientist Luke Clark , demonstrates that this is true even when the actual experience is unpleasant .
The research team looked at the activity differences in the dopamine - rich mesolimbic system in a gambling task – comparing wins , misses and near - misses .
Near - misses were where the reels on a slot machine just missed the payout .
It turns out that near - misses activate almost exactly the same dopamine circuits as actual wins – but here ’s the punchline – they were subjectively experienced as the most unpleasant outcome , even worse than total misses .
In other words , the dopamine system was firing like a rocket display but the experience was awful .
Interestingly , although near - misses were experienced as aversive they increased the desire to play the game but only when the person had some perception of control , by choosing what the ‘ lucky ’ picture would be .
Of course , like choosing ‘ heads or tails ’ , it ’s only an illusion of control because the outcome is random anyway .
But because of reward expectancy the dopamine system is most active when we think we can control the outcome and modify our strategy next time , even if that sense of control is completely false .

You ’ve heard it ’s coming in 2012 .
Or maybe 2022 .
It ’s certainly not ready yet , but some parts are already in browsers now so for the standards - savvy developers , the future is worth investigating today .
Ian “ Hixie ” Hickson , editor of the HTML 5 specification , hopes that the spec will go to Last Call Working Draft in October this year .
Accessibility Task Force member , Bruce Lawson , interviews
Hixie on how the specification for the next generation of the Web ’s markup language is shaping up .
Disclosure of affiliations : both work for browser vendors — Bruce for Opera , Hixie for Google ( and previously , Opera and Netscape ) .
Bruce
The spec now known as HTML 5 began with a " guerilla " group called WHATWG .
How and why did the WHATWG begin ?
Hixie
The short answer is the W3C told us to .
The long answer : Back in 2003 , when XForms was going through its final
stages ( the " Proposed Recommendation " vote stage ) , the browser vendors
were concerned that it would n’t take off on the Web without being made a
part of HTML , and out of that big discussion ( which unfortunately is
mostly hidden behind the W3C ‘s confidentiality walls ) came a proof of
concept showing that it was possible to take some of XForms ’ ideas and put
then into HTML 4 .
We originally called it " XForms Basic " , and later renamed
it " WebForms 2.0 " .
This formed the basis of what is now HTML 5 .
In 2004 , the W3C had a workshop , the " The W3C Workshop on Web Applications
and Compound Documents " , where we ( the browser vendors ) argued that it was
imperative that HTML be extended in a backwards - compatible way .
It was a
turning point in the W3C ‘s history — you could tell because at one point
RedHat , Sun , and Microsoft , arch - rivals all , actually agreed on something ,
and that never happens .
The outcome of that workshop was that the W3C concluded that HTML was
still dead , as had been decided in a workshop in 1998 , and that if we
wanted to do something like HTML 5 , we should go elsewhere .
So we announced
a mailing list , and did it there .
At the time I was working for Opera Software , but " we " in this case was
Opera and Mozilla acting together ( with Apple cheering us from the
sidelines ) .
Bruce
How did you become editor ?
Hixie
I was at the right place at the right time and everyone else was too busy .
Bruce
How do you personally go about editing the spec and incorporating
feedback ?
What are your processes ?
Hixie
This has varied over the years , as we ’ve gone from a nascent organisation
with a few dozen people to a well - established project with a mailing list
with 900 + subscribers .
Mostly it ’s all down to managing e-mail .
When
someone writes feedback on the spec , whether by sending an e-mail to one
of the mailing lists I ’m on , or by blogging somewhere , or twittering , I
log their feedback in a folder on my IMAP server .
Feedback gets
categorised into either feedback I can work on right away , or feedback
that I can’t deal with yet for whatever reason .
An example of the latter
would be requests relating to mutation events , because I ’m waiting for
DOM3 Events to update how mutation events work .
Then , I just go through all the feedback I have , e-mail by e-mail , more or
less in the order that I received them , sending replies and fixing the
spec to address the issues that were raised .
This has some disadvantages , for example there ’s a big delay in between
when someone spots an error and when I fix it .
It also has some really
important advantages .
If I respond to feedback on something I wrote
straight after writing it , I sometimes find that I have an attachment to
that section , so if someone suggests a total replacement , I tend to not
like their idea .
But if I have a delay , I find my attachment has gone
away , and I ’m eager to replace my old stupid idea with their better one .
( Assuming it ’s better , anyway ! )
Bruce
What ’s the hardest thing to do ?
Hixie
There are a few things that are hard .
One is saying " no " to people who have
clearly spent the time to come up with a good idea .
The sad truth is that
I reject almost everything that I and anyone else thinks of , because if I
did n’t , the spec would be a thousand times more bloated than it is now .
We
get proposals for all kinds of things , and we have to have a very high bar
for what goes in .
There ’s also the danger that if we add too many things
to the spec too quickly , the browser vendors will each implement their own
bit and it ’ll be a big mess that wo n’t help Web authors .
So I have to make judgements about what is worth adding and what is n’t ,
and that ’s hard .
I ’ve upset a lot of people by rejecting their ideas ,
because they take it personally .
On the other hand , some of the most
productive members of the community now are people who ’ve had many of
their ideas rejected , but they stuck around long enough to see a few of
their ideas make it in .
The best way to get an idea into the spec is to
find something in the spec that ’s just clearly wrong , which is something
that a lot of the most active people do a lot , too !
Something else that ’s hard is making up new features .
The bulk of HTML 5 is
actually just defining how browsers already do things , which , although
complicated and sometimes unbelievably arcane , is , at the end of the day ,
pretty easy to spec : you test the browsers , and you write what they do .
Rinse , repeat , until the spec covers every possible case .
Making up new features , though , means actually thinking about what should
happen , what is the most understandable solution , figuring out how things
should fit together , and so on .
It ’s often tempting to make something that
is theoretically neat , but which does n’t fit in with the rest of the
language , too .
After all , that ’s where all this came from — we do n’t want
to create a new XForms , a really well - designed technology that does n’t fit
into the way people write pages .
What ’s in the spec ?
Bruce
You ’ve said that HTML 5 is in " direct competition with other technologies intended for applications deployed over the Web , in particular Flash and Silverlight " .
Why is it so important to do so , and is n’t it a lost cause given that those techologies are already out there while HTML 5 is not yet complete ?
Hixie
HTML 4 is also in direct competition with proprietary technologies , and
it ’s winning , hands - down .
HTML5 is just continuing the battle , because if
we do n’t keep up , then the proprietary technologies will gain ground .
Bruce
What are the main philosophies of HTML 5 ?
Hixie
Backwards - compatibility , incremental baby steps , defining error handling .
Those are the main philosophies .
Bruce
What else did WHATWG try to achieve with this new iteration of HTML ?
Hixie
We started from trying to put features from XForms into HTML 4 , and we
quickly also took the opportunity to fix some of the things in HTML 4 that
were either too vague or disagreed with reality ( that is , where the
browsers all did one thing but the spec said another ) .
It turns out that HTML 4 is so vague that this is a pretty big task — it even involved
defining the whole HTML parsing model , including error handling , which is
a huge job ( it took me the better part of a month to write the first
draft , and we were tweaking it for about a year before it become more or
less stable ) .
Something else we ’ve tried to do is make things simpler .
We ’ve simplified
the syntax ( e.g. the rules about what can be quoted , what strings are
valid id s , etc , are much simpler now ) .
We ’ve made things which people
used to do in JavaScript have shortcuts , so now you can just say autofocus= " " to focus a form field when the page loads , instead of using control.
focus ( ) , which allows the browser to do clever things like not
actually focus the control if the user is already typing elsewhere .
Bruce
Does HTML 5 legitimise tag soup ?
Does " paving the cowpaths " perpetuate
bad markup ?
Hixie :
No , HTML 5 actually makes the rules for markup even stricter than HTML 4 in
many ways , both for authors ( the rules are simpler , but stricter , than HTML 4′s ) and for implementers ( gone are the days where they can just do
whatever they want when handling parse errors , now every browser has to
act the same ) .
Hopefully , we ’ve managed to make the rules on what is valid syntax more
understandable , which should help with getting more good markup .
We’ve
also made it possible to write clearer validators , so I have high hopes .
Bruce
Does including JavaScript and DOM API s in the HTML 5 spec dilute the
message about separating behaviour and structure ?
Hixie
I did n’t know about a message about separating behaviour and structure , I
must have missed that memo !
HTML 5 takes a pretty hard line on separating
style and presentation from structure and semantics ; there are no more font tags .
Separating the logic and behaviour from the structure and
semantics of an HTML document is n’t as important , generally , as far as I
can tell .
The main advantage of defining the HTML DOM API s and the HTML elements in
the same specification is that we do n’t let stuff fall through the cracks .
In practice , browsers implement the HTML elements as DOM nodes , there ’s no
difference .
When we separate the two in the specs , therefore , we introduce
a conceptual gap where there is n’t one in reality .
The DOM2 HTML spec , for
instance , does n’t say what happens when you change the type attribute of
an input element from text to checkbox on the fly , and the HTML 4
spec does n’t mention that changing attributes on the fly is possible , so
in the HTML 4 / DOM2 HTML era , there ’s a big hole there .
In HTML 5 , this is
all defined together , so we can tighten this up and make sure there are no
gaps .
Bruce
Why no native support for microformats / RDFa in HTML 5 ?
Hixie
Microformats is natively supported in HTML5 , just like it was in HTML 4 ,
because Microformats use the built - in extension mechanisms of HTML .
We considered RDFa long and hard ( in fact this is an issue that ’s a hot
topic right now ) , but at the end of the day , while some people really like
it , I do n’t think it strikes the right balance between power and ease of
authoring .
For example , it uses namespaces and prefixes , which by and
large confuse authors to no end .
Just recently though I proposed something
of a compromise which takes some of RDFa ‘s better ideas and puts them into HTML 5 , so hopefully that will take care of the main needs that caused
people to invent RDFa .
We ’ll see .
About browsers
Bruce
Do the browser makers have too much influence on the spec ?
Hixie
The reality is that the browser vendors have the ultimate veto on
everything in the spec , since if they do n’t implement it , the spec is
nothing but a work of fiction .
So they have a lot of influence — I do n’t
want to be writing fiction , I want to be writing a spec that documents the
actual behaviour of browsers .
Whether that ’s too much , I do n’t know .
Does gravity have too much
influence on objects on earth ?
It ’s just the way it is .
Bruce
One of the chairs of the W3C working group is a Microsoft employee .
Is that giving too much power to one browser vendor , or a good thing ,
given that Microsoft ’s browsers still dominate and their buy - in on any spec is
therefore essential ?
Hixie
Personally I would like Microsoft to get more involved with HTML 5 .
They ’ve
sent very little feedback over the years , far less than the other browser
vendors .
Even when asking them about their opinion on features they are
implementing I rarely get any feedback .
It ’s very sad .
If I e-mail them a
question about how I can best help them , I usually get no reply ; at best
I ’ll get a promise that they ’ll get back to me , but that ’s it .
Accessibility
Bruce
There has been a lot of spirited debate ( ahem ) about accessibility in
the development of HTML 5 .
How does the spec deal with the requirements
of people with disabilities ?
Hixie
Universal access — the requirement that anyone be able to use information
on the Web — is a fundamental cornerstone of HTML ‘s design , just like
security , privacy , and so on .
In general , we try to design features so
that they Just Work for everyone , regardless of how you are accessing the
Web .
For example , in HTML 5 we ’ve added new input controls like calendars .
These will Just Work with screen readers once browsers support them ,
authors do n’t have to do anything special .
Bruce
Does your personal support of humanitarian eugenics affect your opinion of giving
extra " help " for people with disabilities ?
Hixie
You ’ve been reading too much of our pet troll ’s blog ! ;-)
[ Bruce 's note : this refers to Mr Last Week , mysterious author of the blog Last Week in HTML 5 , which lampoons the HTML 5 Working Group in very funny , frequently foul - mouthed manner . ]
People with disabilities are just as important to me in my work on HTML 5 as is anyone else .
Bruce
You wrote to ask screenreader vendors to participate in
the specification process .
Did they ever reply ?
Hixie
A couple did , but only to say they had little time for the standards
process , which was quite disappointing .
Since then , though , Apple has
ramped up their efforts on their built - in Mac OS X screen reader software ,
and we do get a lot of feedback from Apple .
So at least one screen
reader vendor is actively involved .
Bruce
HTML 5 and WAI - ARIA appear to do the same thing in some places .
How should developers handle this ?
Hixie
When there ’s a built - in way to do something , using that is the simplest
and most reliable solution .
So for example , if you want to have a
checkbox , using the input element with its type attribute set to checkbox is the simplest solution — it ’ll work for everyone , with or
without JavaScript , with or without a screen reader , and so on .
ARIA is
useful when HTML does n’t let you do what you want and you find yourself
hacking around with many nested div s , scripting your own controls and so
forth .
Bruce
Can we expect ARIA - specific constructs which have no equivalent in HTML 5 , such as live regions , to be allowed under the rules of HTML 5 so it will all validate ?
Hixie
Yes , the plan is to make sure ARIA and HTML5 work well together .
Right now
I ’m waiting for ARIA to be complete ( there are a number of last call
comments that they have n’t yet replied to ) , and for the ARIA
implementation rules to be clearer ( it ’s not yet obvious as I understand
it what should happen when ARIA says a checkbox is a radio button , for
instance ) .
Once that is cleared up , I expect HTML 5 will give a list of
conformance criteria saying where ARIA attributes can be used and saying
how they should be implemented in browsers .
Why , when , how , who ?
Bruce
Why would we content authors want to move to HTML 5 ?
What ’s in it
for us ?
Hixie
Today is probably too early to start using HTML 5 .
Long term , content authors will find a variety of new features in HTML 5 .
We have a bunch of new structural elements like section , article , footer , and so on .
We have new elements for embedded media , like video and audio .
We have new input controls , like the calendars I mentioned ,
but also fields for URL s , e-mail addresses , telephone numbers , and for
color selection .
We have control over autocomplete values in text fields ,
as well as field validation so that you can say which fields are required .
We have context menus , pushState ( ) so you can update the URL in Ajax
applications , and offline application cache manifests so that your users
can take your applications offline .
The list goes on .
There ’s also the benefits that come from using an HTML 5 validator .
HTML 5
is much more precise about many things than HTML 4 , so the validators will
be more useful in catching real errors .
The embed element is no longer
invalid .
Bruce
Are there advantages for end -users , too ?
Hixie
A more powerful HTML means more powerful Web applications .
Just like XMLHttpRequest resulted in more interactive apps , HTML 5 will result in
a richer and more consistently reliable experience .
I hope !
Bruce
What ’s the the timeline ?
When can we start using HTML 5 ?
Hixie
The plan is to have the spec mostly finished by October 2009 .
A lot
depends on the browser vendors , though .
I do n’t know when things will be
implemented widely enough that authors can use them reliably everywhere .
Some features , like canvas and video , are getting implemented in most
browsers as we speak .
Others will take longer .
Bruce
What can standards - savvy WaSP readers do to get involved with the specification process ?
Hixie
There are a number of ways of taking part .
What we need most of all these
days is technical review of the specification text , calling out places
where I screwed up , where the spec defines something that ’s not easy to
use for Web authors , where the spec contradicts itself , typos , spelling
mistakes , grammar errors , errors in examples , you name it .
I posted a blog entry recently detailing how people can send feedback .
You can join the W3C HTML Working Group or the WHATWG .
There are also lots of other things people can do — write demos , write tutorials , edit other related specs , write articles introducing parts of
the spec on the blog , write test cases …
Anyone who wants to help out but does n’t know where to start should drop
me an e-mail at [ email protected ]
Bruce
Will there ever be an HTML 6 , or is it a convenient fiction to park
out - of - scope discussions ?
Hixie
I ’m sure there will be an HTML 6 , and 7 , and 8 , and probably many more ,
until someone comes up with something so radically better that we stop
evolving the Web as we know it .
I expect work on HTML 6 will start even before HTML 5 is completely done , in
fact .
Putting the finishing touches on HTML 5 will be a long and tedious
job involving writing a massive test suite .
HTML 4 never had a serious test
suite created ( it was too vague as a specification to really be properly
tested ) , so we have to start from scratch with HTML 5 .
The HTML 6 team will
at least be able to build on what we ’ve done with HTML 5 , I ’m jealous !
Actually if it was up to me , after HTML 5 I would probably transition HTML to an incremental model .
Once we have a basic spec that is well - defined
and has been proven , instead of releasing a frozen snapshot every few
years , I ’d prefer a model where we can slowly evolve the language , call it
" HTML Current " or something , without having to worry about versioning it .
To some extent that ’s what we ’re doing with HTML 5 , but I think formalising
it would really help .
Having versions of specs does n’t make sense when you have multiple
implementations that are all evolving as well .
No browser is ever going to
be exactly HTML 5 , they ’ll all be subsets or supersets .
So why bother with
versioning the spec ?
It ’s a very unusual idea in the standards world , so I do n’t expect us to
do this .
But I do think it ’d be the best way forward .
Bruce
Would you like to be the HTML 6 editor ?
Hixie
Too early to tell !
It ’s been a lot of fun working on HTML 5 , it ’s quite
challenging and you have to deal with all kinds of issues from the deeply
technical to the highly political .
I might want a change of pace when
we ’re done with HTML 5 , though .
Bruce
What ’s your fave feature that did n’t get into HTML 5 that you ’d put
into HTML 6 ?
Hixie
In - window modal dialogs or dialog box — the kind of prompt you get when the
computer asks you a question and wo n’t let you do anything else until you
answer the question .
For instance , the window that comes up when you say
" Save As… " is usually a modal dialog .
Right now people fake it with div s and
complicated styles and script .
It would be neat to just be able to say
" make this section a modal dialog " .
Like showModalDialog ( ) , but within
the page instead of opening a new window with a new page .
I ’d add it to HTML 5 , but there are so many new features already that we
need to wait for the browsers to catch up .

A strike now completing its fourth week at Ssangyong Motors in Pyeongtaek , South Korea , remains a standoff as of this writing .
The strike echoes in many ways the dynamic seen in the recent Visteon struggle in the UK and in battles over auto industry restructuring around the world .
Involving , on the other hand , an outright factory seizure and occupation , and preparation for violent defense of the plant if necessary , it is the first struggle of its kind in South Korea for years .
Loren Goldner
( June 19 )
The company was taken over three years ago by China ’s Shanghai Automotive Industry Corporation , which holds 51 % ownership .
At the time , the Pyeongtaek plant had 8700 employees ; it now has 7000 .
In February the company filed for bankruptcy , proposing a restructuring and offering the Pyeongtaek plant as collateral for further loans to re-emerge from bankruptcy .
The court approved the bankruptcy plan , pending adequate layoffs to make the company profitable again .
The management strategy seems to have been a long - term whittling down of personnel combined with acquisition of technology for operations in China .
Since the Shanghai Automotive takeover , there has been no new investment at Ssangyong Motors , and no new car model launched .
( Korean prosecutors have raised questions over the legality of the technology transfer to China , since the technology in question was developed with Korean government subsidies , but to date no legal action has been taken . )
Workers at the plant responded with strikes against pending layoffs in April which accelerated into a full strike and plant takeover and occupation by 1700 workers on May 27 when the list of workers to be laid off was announced .
The strike focused on three main demands : 1 ) no layoffs 2 ) job security for all and 3 ) no outsourcing .
The company wants to force 1700 workers into early retirement and has fired 300 casuals .
The Ssangyong workers are organized in the Korean Metal Workers Union ( KMWU ) and have worked an average of 15 - 20 years in the factory .
A regular worker earns a base pay of approximately 30,000,000 won ( currently ca. $ 25,000 ) per year ; a casual earns about 15,000,000 for the same work .
( In Korea , the base pay is only part of the salary , which includes benefits –for regular workers — as well as significant overtime paid at a higher rate , often 10 hours a week and accepted , or even desired , by most workers as a necessary income supplement . )
As of mid-June , about 1000 workers were continuing the occupation , with wives and families providing food .
About 500 workers not slated for layoff are staying at home , and about 1000 supervisory staff are scabbing , mainly maintaining machines , while no cars have been produced since the occupation began .
There has been to date little mass police presence in Pyeongtaek .
This is due at least in part to to the current political crisis in South Korea following the recent suicide of ex-president No Mu Hyeon and subsequent large - scale demonstrations expressing growing outrage against the current right - wing government of Lee Myong Bak , demonstrations that are expected to gain momentum into July .
The Lee government , elected in December 2007 on a program of high economic growth and now discredited by the world crisis , has been taken aback by the depth of outrage revealed in demonstrations mobilizing up to 1 million people .
After the unleashing of riot police provoked further outrage and brought more people to the streets , the government is unwilling to risk further disenchantment by an assault on the Pyeongtaek factory .
On June 16 , a large anti-strike rally of more than 1500 people was held outside the factory gates .
The rally was attended by the 1000 supervisory scabs , 200 hired thugs and 300 workers not on the layoff list and not supporting the strike .
400 riot police stood by , doing nothing , and finally declared the scab assembly illegal .
During the scab rally , about 700 - 800 workers from nearby factories , such as the Kia Motor company , came to defend the Ssangyang plant , in part in response to a text message tree of the KMWU .
The occupying workers have made plans for armed defense against any police attempt to recapture the plant , stocking iron pipes and Molotov cocktails .
As a further fallback plan , they intend to concentrate in the paint department , where the flammable materials ( in their estimate ) will dissuade the police from firing tear gas cannisters and setting off a conflagration .
According to one activist critical of the role of the union , the KMWU seems to remain in control of the strike .
In contrast to role of the unions in the Visteon struggle in the UK and in the dismantling of the US auto industry , the KMWU has thus far supported the illegal actions of seizing the plant and preparing for its armed defense .
On the other hand , it has been concentrating on the demand for no layoffs and soft - pedaling the demands for job security for all and against out - sourcing .
The core occupation of the plant is powered by 50 or 60 rank - and - file groups of 10 workers each , who in turn elect a delegate ( chojang ) for coordinated action .
According to the same critical activist , these chojang are the most combative and class - conscious workers .
The outcome of this strike remains up in the air .
It benefits from a momentarily favorable political climate , which has put the Korean government on the back foot , but it is up against the deep crisis of the world auto industry and the world economic crisis generally .
The nearby Kia Motor Company plant is itself in the middle of critical negotiations for crisis measures , and GM - Daewoo is being hit with the world reorganization of GM .
The company strategy , as in the case of Visteon , seems to be at best slow attrition ( already underway since 2006 ) or even an outright closing of the plant .
The Ssangyong Motor struggle may light a fire in the Korean auto industry and beyond , or , more likely , be strangled , slowly or not so slowly , in its current isolation .
Last summer I got the opportunity to work briefly with Conal Elliott in Belgium .
The two weeks I spent there are still making an impact on me ; immediately I resonated with his semantic design idea .
But the more important ideas were the ones I picked up subconsciously , and I ’m just now becoming able to put them in words .
(1) If extreme idealism is n’t working out for you , maybe it is because you are not wholeheartedly following your own ideals .
(2) You must be the change you wish to see in the world ( – Mahatma Gandhi ) .
As applied to software : design software as if it were the beautiful paradise you want it to be , then build pieces of the scaffolding back to the status quo .
Both of these were key insights leading me to undertake Dana .
At the time I was desperately trying to create an FRP framework for Haskell , trying in terms of IO and STM and playing messy tricks with the operational semantics of thunks .
It felt like cheating .
I had the desire to throw away IO altogether in my efforts , just to see where that led me ( this forced me to put aside the way I thought an FRP interface should look ) .
This was an instance of ( 1 ) .
But in Haskell , IO would always be beneath it all .
Your functional program always becomes an imperative program at the end of the day .
Maybe this dissonance is what is causing the endless FRP difficulties .
Maybe we can’t really know what pure FRP is until we have pure turtles all the way down — until there is no impedance mismatch between the functional and the imperative .
This set me on researching the idea of a purely functional operating system , which is still the slogan by which I name Dana .
But now Dana is more than that .
Now , it is my ( 2 ) .
In this post , I describe how I see the world of software in 30 years .
This is n’t about what kind of devices computers will be embedded in or how they are connected ; this is about the process of developing software .
Code and program are the same ; any fragment of code may be used interactively .
Complex programs are just compositions of simpler ones , and composition of programs is a fundamental concept to both users and programmers .
Thus power users cannot help but to be programmers .
Computer science has become a strict subfield of applied mathematics .
Creating complex software is primarily modeling : the fundamental task in software development is to create a mathematical model of your problem .
The model is encoded directly , and then software scaffolding is built around it , verified to the model .
Reasonable shops do not dare ship code that has n’t been verified to correspond to their model .
Development tools — programs that talk about programs — are astoundingly rich and expressive .
Simply enter a property about your code .
The tool goes off on a model search to try to refute the property .
Meanwhile , in a way that my mind cannot yet comprehend , the programmer communicates the “ essence ” of why the property should be true , and the tool fills in all the details of the proof .
The property is added to a database of facts , which everyone can immediately see and use .
Provably correct code is what people do , because the tools have made it so easy that it is an obvious engineering choice ( this ease does not come without a resculpting of our brains ) .
Gargantuan test suites are replaced by a few hours of a developer with a proving tool ( an exponential increase in productivity came from the fact that theorems compose , but tests do n’t ) .
User interfaces are mostly an artistic task , quite different from the rigorous visualization that modelers do .
All objects have a few obvious ways to endow them with primitive user interfaces ( see Eros ) .
Then making a nice user interface is a matter of rearranging them , composing inputs and outputs , and drawing / animating things ( under the assumption that computers are still monitor , keyboard , and mouse driven — make the appropriate generalizations ) .
The shops that will be renowned by power users are those who have a great program with a great interface , but they also ship components to the underlying logic .
This is trivial for them , because of the ubiquitous separation between interface and logic .
Some are still irrationally afraid of giving away their trade secrets by exposing this , so there are still lame , interface - only programs .
But these lame programs will not have the chance to participate in the miracles of engineering the decade will bring , a combiatorical build up of the the work of millions of developers , coming together to create the Star Trek computer — or something else , far more advanced .
Computation is an information science , and is subject to the exponential explosion that comes with it .
This Utopian vision hinges on correct composition of everything , from programs to facts .
Right now , software is primarily non-compositional .
We have libraries and languages , which are built up of smaller libraries and languages .
But end products are not designed to be composed ; they are mostly designed for the end user only .
But the end user is where the money is , thus where a great deal of the effort in the industry is going .
Moreover , for advanced programs ( say , Maya ) , the end user is also where a lot of the skill and talent is .
We have to work at this .
There is little small - scale economic incentive to make your program composable ; you just give your competitors the ability to use your software without you being able to use theirs .
And it ’s hard for idealistic young CEOs to try such a thing , since the state of software development means you have to put in a lot of work both to make your program composable and to compose other people ’s programs .
But these things are not fundamentally hard , they are just hard using the languages and methods of today .
Dana is my own first step in this direction .
It aims to be an environment which forces everything to be composable and verifiable .
This comes at the expense of mental laziness : you will have to seriously rewire your brain to work in it .
I do n’t believe that the enlightenment can come without this rewiring .
I ’m desperately trying to rewire my own , to even consider the choices that will be obvious to the generation ahead .
Is your brain going to be ready when the revolution comes ?
San Francisco - The U.S. Patent and Trademark Office has announced that it will revoke an illegitimate patent on Internet subdomains as a result of the Electronic Frontier Foundation 's ( EFF ) Patent Busting Project campaign .
U.S. Patent No. 6,687,746 , now held by Hoshiko , LLC , claimed to cover the method of automatically assigning Internet subdomains , like " action.eff.org " for the parent domain " eff.org . "
Previous patent owner Ideaflood used this bogus patent to demand payment from website hosting companies offering personalized domains , such as LiveJournal , a social networking site where each of its three million users may have their own subdomain .
In the original reexamination request , EFF and Rick Mc Leod of Klarquist Sparkman , LLP , showed that the method Ideaflood claimed to have invented was well known before the patent was issued .
In fact , website developers were having public discussions about how to create these virtual subdomains on an Apache developer mailing list and on Usenet more than a year before Ideaflood filed its patent application .
The open source community 's public record of the technology development provided the linchpin to EFF 's patent challenge .
" In the reexam , the Patent Office systematically rejected each of Hoshiko 's arguments as well as the patent claims .
We were fortunate to have the Internet Archive and Usenet Archive as proof of the prior work by the open source community , " said Rick Mc Leod , who drafted the EFF petition .
" This patent was particularly troubling because the company tried to remove the work of open source developers from the public domain and use it to threaten others , " said EFF Legal Director Cindy Cohn .
" Ironically , the transparent open source development process gave us the tools to bust the patent ! "
The challenge to the Ideaflood patent is part of EFF's Patent Busting Project , which combats the chilling effects that bad patents have on public and consumer interests .
This marks the second patent completely " busted " by the project , which has also resulted in the narrowing of another patent and the ongoing reexaminations of three more .
Hoshiko can appeal the decision .

A man looks at the third - generation " Prius " of Japanese auto giant Toyota Motor at a showroom in Tokyo in May 2009 .
Toyota Motor Corp 's latest edition of the Prius hybrid became Japan 's best selling car in monthly sales in May , pulling ahead of its rival , Honda 's Insight , an industry survey showed Thursday .
Defying the worst recession in decades , green cars in Japan are gaining ground against conventional gas - guzzlers , offering automakers hope of re-energising a flagging domestic market .
Toyota Motor Corp 's latest edition of the Prius hybrid became Japan 's best selling car in monthly sales in May , pulling ahead of its rival , Honda 's Insight , an industry survey showed Thursday .
The re-modeled Prius ranked number one in sales , which climbed to 10,915 last month and above the company 's monthly target , against 8,183 for the Insight , the Japan Automobile Dealers ' Association said .
Both automakers launched hybrids amid a severe economic downturn , but they topped domestic sales for the second straight month , in part due to government subsidies including tax breaks for buyers of fuel - efficient cars .
Honda 's Insight clinched the top spot in April .
Toyota , the world 's leading automaker , which booked its first - ever loss last fiscal year , rolled out the third - generation hybrid in mid-May , competing against the Insight which debuted in February with a lower price tag .
Toyota has sold more than 1.25 million Prius vehicles since its launch in 1997 , making it the world 's most popular hybrid , but faced with growing competition from Honda , slashed the price of its latest model .
The revamped Prius has solar panels in the roof to power the ventilation system , a 1.8 - litre petrol engine and an electric - powered water pump .
Commenting on the May sales figure , Toyota 's chief engineer of the new model , Akihiko Otsuka , said : " Of course the sales figure is supported by incentives ... but I 'm not pessimistic about the future as I see that our customers ' interests in cars in general has come back . "
In a bid to maintain its lead in fuel - sipping cars , Toyota announced Wednesday that it will lease 200 plug - in Prius hybrids to fleet customers in Japan from late 2009 , and another 150 in the US and more than 150 in Europe .
The plug - in hybrids , to be equipped with lithium - ion batteries for the first time , can be recharged at electric outlets in households .
Similar light - weight batteries are used in laptops and other consumer electronics .
Used as an electric vehicle for short distances , a plug - in can switch to operating like a regular hybrid when the battery runs out of power .
Meanwhile , Japan 's fourth - largest automaker Mitsubishi Motors Corp , which aims to be a world leader in zero-emission electric vehicles , plans to sell plug - in vehicles in Japan as early as 2013 , the Asahi Shimbun said .
The plug - in will be equipped with a petrol engine that will generate electricity to power a motor when the batteries die , the newspaper said without citing its sources .
A spokesman was unable to confirm the report .
MMC is expected to roll out the electric i-MiEV vehicles to fleet customers in Japan in July this year and to retail customers next year .

Announced at the Sony E3 2009 press conference , Take - Two ’s Agent is an “ ultimate action title ” developed exclusively for the PlayStation 3 by Rockstar Games .
While exclusive third - party titles are typically seen as a thing of the past , the GTA giant had vivid justification to make the project a PS3 exclusive .
“ At this phase in the cycle , when you ’re trying to launch a new franchise , exclusivity can really help you launch the franchise .
It can give you the kind of platform that you need to start exclusive , start in the right kind of way with the right kind of partner .
Exclusivity does work , ” said president of Take - Two , Ben Feder ”
We certainly cannot argue with this logic .
Sure , being multiplatform gives a game access to a larger install base but there ’s littler guarantee that it ’ll be a success , particularly since it ’s a new IP .
Even now , there ’s still debates over whether franchises like Metal Gear Solid would have done as well as they did if they were n’t PS3 exclusives .
However , there is a positive aspect to only choosing one platform to concentrate on .
The development team can literally double their efforts by focusing strictly on one platform , rather than spreading them over two .
Being exclusive also ensures support from the platform holder , including advertising support .
Ben Feder of Take - Two expressed why he believes Agent will benefit from being a PS3 exclusive :
“ I have a lot of confidence in Sony .
I have a lot of confidence in their ability to lead the market , as they always have .
Their console is a terrific platform to be developing for , and Agent is a great testament as to our belief in what that platform can do , and what they can do with us as part of a partnership . ”
Since Feder believes that this is only the beginning of this generation , it is obvious that Take - Two believes Sony still has time to , and will , end up being the leader of this generation .

A family handout photograph shows abducted Israeli soldier Cpl. Gilad Shalit when he was a senior in high school in 2005 .
Israel accused the Iranian government of paying $ 50 million to block a deal that would have freed the Israeli soldier captured by Hamas - linked militants who crossed from Gaza into Israel on June 25 .
Israel 's U.N. Ambassador Dan Gillerman told the UN Security Council that " we heard news " earlier in the day on Thursday that Tehran bribed Hamas leader Khaled Mashaal " to sabotage the negotiations on the release of Cpl. Gilad Shalit and prevent his release . "
Iranian diplomat Mansour Sadeghi told the council his goverment " catergorically rejected " the allegations against his country made by Israel , dismissing Gillerman 's allegations as " baseless and absurd . "

JERUSALEM , July 15 ( UPI ) -- Israel prevented French diplomats from entering Gaza to celebrate Bastille Day , because of Gilad Shalit 's ongoing captivity , Israeli security officials said .
The diplomats should not be allowed to celebrate a holiday of freedom and human rights while the kidnapped soldier remains in captivity , an official told Haaretz Wednesday .

Israeli officials said the diplomats ' request for 15 entry visas Tuesday morning was too late , as regulations require requests to be submitted 48 hours prior to the intended visit , the paper said .
A Foreign Ministry source quoted in the paper , accused the diplomats of provocation , saying they were well aware they submitted the request late , with the intention of blaming Israel for ruining their holiday .
French Ambassador Jean Michel
Cas called for the immediate release of Shalit at the embassy 's celebration in Jaffa , the paper said .
But as new marketplaces have emerged , PCs have been unable to compete with Wall Street ’s computers .
Powerful algorithms  “ algos , ” in industry parlance  execute millions of orders a second and scan dozens of public and private marketplaces simultaneously .
They can spot trends before other investors can blink , changing orders and strategies within milliseconds .
High - frequency traders often confound other investors by issuing and then canceling orders almost simultaneously .
Loopholes in market rules give high - speed investors an early glance at how others are trading .
And their computers can essentially bully slower investors into giving up profits  and then disappear before anyone even knows they were there .
High - frequency traders also benefit from competition among the various exchanges , which pay small fees that are often collected by the biggest and most active traders  typically a quarter of a cent per share to whoever arrives first .
Those small payments , spread over millions of shares , help high - speed investors profit simply by trading enormous numbers of shares , even if they buy or sell at a modest loss .
“ It ’s become a technological arms race , and what separates winners and losers is how fast they can move , ” said Joseph M. Mecane of NYSE Euronext , which operates the New York Stock Exchange .
“ Markets need liquidity , and high - frequency traders provide opportunities for other investors to buy and sell . ”
The rise of high - frequency trading helps explain why activity on the nation ’s stock exchanges has exploded .
Average daily volume has soared by 164 percent since 2005 , according to data from NYSE .
Although precise figures are elusive , stock exchanges say that a handful of high - frequency traders now account for a more than half of all trades .
To understand this high - speed world , consider what happened when slow - moving traders went up against high - frequency robots earlier this month , and ended up handing spoils to lightning - fast computers .
It was July 15 , and Intel , the computer chip giant , had reporting robust earnings the night before .
Some investors , smelling opportunity , set out to buy shares in the semiconductor company Broadcom .
( Their activities were described by an investor at a major Wall Street firm who spoke on the condition of anonymity to protect his job . )
The slower traders faced a quandary :
If they sought to buy a large number of shares at once , they would tip their hand and risk driving up Broadcom ’s price .
So , as is often the case on Wall Street , they divided their orders into dozens of small batches , hoping to cover their tracks .
One second after the market opened , shares of Broadcom started changing hands at $ 26.20 .
The slower traders began issuing buy orders .
But rather than being shown to all potential sellers at the same time , some of those orders were most likely routed to a collection of high - frequency traders for just 30 milliseconds  0.03 seconds  in what are known as flash orders .
While markets are supposed to ensure transparency by showing orders to everyone simultaneously , a loophole in regulations allows marketplaces like Nasdaq to show traders some orders ahead of everyone else in exchange for a fee .
During an appearance on CNN this Wednesday , the co-chair for Black Voices for Trump was asked by anchor Brianna Keilar why President Trump " did not condemn white supremacists " during his debate with Joe Biden the previous night .
T.W. Shannon responded that during the debate , Trump said he would condemn white supremacy " three times , " to which Keilar fired back , " But then he did n't . "
" How many times does the President have to have this conversation , " Shannon continued , ignoring Keilar .
" At some point , the media has to accept his answer .
He 's condemned it , at least seven times that I can google real quick and find it , and he said it last night -- he called out that group by name . "

In late November , Christopher Shays was still absorbing the shock of having lost his bid for re-election after 22 years in Congress when he made a troubling discovery :
Tens of thousands of dollars had disappeared from his campaign treasury .
The news got worse , according to an adviser to Mr. Shays :
The man Mr. Shays entrusted to run his political operation for nearly a decade had been quietly draining the account and had spent nearly $ 200,000 on Red Sox tickets , limousine travel , mysterious withdrawals at the Foxwoods casino and a donation of more than $ 1,000 to his synagogue .
The campaign manager , Michael Sohn , has not been charged with a crime .
The Federal Election Commission has opened an investigation into the apparent financial irregularities at the request of Mr. Shays , who has also alerted the Justice Department .
Philip Russell , Mr. Sohn ’s lawyer , would not comment beyond saying : “ Mr. Sohn is aware of an investigation and is cooperating with the process .
But we have very little by way of particulars . ”
Beautiful Acrobatic Art Festival
China hosted the annual Acrobatic Art Festival in Wuhan , this year .
The location changes every year but the exhibition is just as breathtaking every time , no matter where it ’s held .
The event took place in a stationary circus in Wuhan and attracted more than 2,000 spectators that were simply mesmerized by the 30 acrobatic numbers performed by artists from all around the world .
The Acrobatic Art Festival included acrobatics , animal tricks and clownery .
Last night , Glenn Beck and Jonah Goldberg tried an exercise similar to Rush Limbaugh 's , in which they tried to construct a plausible argument that James von Brunn , the Holocaust Museum shooter , was actually a " figure of the left . "
They ran through the same list :
He hated Bush , he hated " neocons , " may have targeted the neocon Weekly Standard too , and most of all , he hated Jews .
Somehow omitted :
He also hated black people , and he especially hated Obama because he believed he was controlled by Jews .
( See the note he left behind . )
He also hated the Federal Reserve , taxes , the United Nations , the federal government generically , admired Hitler , urged the reciminalization of miscegenation laws , and promoted The Protocols of the Seven Elders of Zion as fact .
He worked at one time for Willis Carto 's right - wing publishing house , Noontide Press , and used to sell copies of Carto 's house organ The Spotlight .
As Mark Potok put it to Keith Olbermann :
You know , the idea , though , that somehow , you know , this shooting at the Holocaust Museum was in any remote way an artifact of the left or Obama 's fault somehow , you know — I mean , it 's vile beyond words and just has no basis at all in fact of any kind .
Yep .
" Vile beyond words " just about covers it .
Especially when it comes to Jonah Goldberg .
Here 's how he put it at NRO :
Never mind that von Brunn is n’t a member of the far right .
That is , of course , flatly , demonstrably and outrageously false .
Or is Goldberg now trying to cast Willis Carto as a " man of the Left " ?
Is there anyone more congenitally dishonest than Jonah Goldberg working in the right - wing media ?
Deeply , appallingly dishonest ?
I mean , I really think Glenn Beck believes the amazingly dumb stuff that comes pouring out of his mouth .
Bill O'Reilly is no doubt deeply cynical , but I think his ego keeps him from admitting to himself that he is in fact a bullying and manipulative propagandist .
The rest of them -- Rush Limbaugh , Ann Coulter , Michelle Malkin -- at some level actually really believe the garbage they emit .
Goldberg , on the other hand , comes across as someone who at a basic level realizes he 's just playing semantics games as a way to manipulate the debate .
Deeply cynical , in other words .
Because you can't help read his book , Liberal Fascism without recognizing the profound dishonesty of the entire enterprise -- which is , namely , to declare that " fascism is a phenomenon of the Left " .
It 's not as morally appalling as Holocaust denial , but it 's close .
Because anyone with any respect for history , and especially the importance of the its details , and who has studied in any serious sense the historical events surrounding the rise of fascism in the 1918 - 30 period knows just how profoundly wrong , how meaningfully false , Goldberg 's claim is .
Goldberg recently published a length self - defense of his book , upon its paperback publication , in National Review .
I wrote a long exegesis on it for Orcinus .
You can go here to read it .
It 's titled : " Fascism is not liberal : The profound dishonesty of Jonah Goldberg " .
And you can see the same gobsmackingly deep dishonesty on full display in this exchange .

Couple Accused of Spying for Cuba Former State Department analyst and wife allegedly spied for 30 years .
June 5 , 2009  --
A former State Department official and his wife worked as spies for the Cuban government for 30 years , according to a federal indictment announced today .
FBI agents arrested Walter Kendall Myers , 72 , and Gwendolyn Steingraber Myers , 71 , in Washington , D.C. Thursday .
The pair , known as " Agent 202 " and " Agent 123 " or " Agent E - 634 , " respectively , face charges including fraud , conspiracy and acting as agents of a foreign government .
The couple allegedly had a secret meeting with Fidel Castro himself in January 1995 , and traveled to Cuba or met with Cuban agents in other countries .
According to court documents filed in the case , Kendall Myers , who obtained a top secret clearance during his career , reviewed classified documents at the State Department , then copied details in notes or remembered their contents to relay to his handlers during meetings .
The court documents do n't specify which materials Myers allegedly used , but a criminal complaint filed with the case alleges that he admitted to taking sensitive information while employed as a senior analyst by the State Department 's Bureau of Intelligence and Research , or INR .
Court documents say that analysis of " Myers ' classified Department of State work computer hard drives reveals that from Aug. 22 , 2006 , until his retirement on Oct. 31 , 2007 , Kendall Myers , while employed at INR , viewed in excess of 200 sensitive or classified intelligence reports concerning the subject of Cuba .
...
Of these reports concerning Cuba , the majority were classified and marked secret or top secret . "
The Myerses and their attorneys could not be reached for comment .
Secretary of State Hillary Clinton has ordered a " comprehensive review of this case " and asked for " a thorough assessment of past and current Department of State security procedures and practices " and recommendations for future practices , State Department spokesman P.J. Crowley said in a statement .
" In addition , the secretary directed the department to conduct a comprehensive damage assessment in coordination with the intelligence community in accordance with established damages protocols and regulations , " Crowley said .
The FBI and State Department worked together on the investigation , officials said .
' Paired ' Agents Allegedly Spied for Cuba
Gwendolyn Myers worked at a local bank , not the government , but the indictment notes that the Cuban Intelligence Service " sometimes employs husband and wife ' paired ' agents to achieve its intelligence goals in the United States . "
The affidavit says Cuban Intelligence Service frequently communicated with clandestine operatives in the United States by broadcasting encrypted shortwave radio messages , and that the Myerses possessed the necessary type of radio and admitted to receiving the messages to an FBI source .
Although court documents say Cuban agents recruited Kendall Myers in 1979 , he did not begin his alleged spying until 1981 .
Investigators said his Cuban handler instructed him to obtain employment at either the State Department or CIA .
Although he applied for a CIA job in 1981 , the couple agreed Kendall Myers should work at the State Department instead because he " is not a good liar , " according to the criminal complaint .
Kendall Myers , a native Washingtonian , is great - grandson of Alexander Graham Bell , and the grandson of Gilbert Grosvenor , widely considered to be the father of modern photojournalism and the longtime chairman and editor in chief of National Geographic .
He was educated at Brown University and earned his masters and Ph.D. degrees from Johns Hopkins University , where he later worked as an adjunct professor of European studies for several years while also working at the State Department .
Myers married the former Maureen Walsh in 1964 .
He later married Gwendolyn Steingraber in 1982 .
It is not currently known if they have children .
Couple Under Scrutiny for Several Years
Investigators had kept tabs on the Myerses for several years , but ramped up their case in April of this year , when an undercover FBI counterintelligence agent posing as a Cuban representative approached Kendall Myers .
The undercover source met with the pair in various hotel lounges and rooms in Washington , D.C. , and during the meetings , the couple allegedly made incriminating statements detailing their knowledge of spy operations and acknowledging past spy activity .
According to the affidavit , Kendall Myers stated that he and his wife " do n't think we are able to do the work again ... [ because ] we 're a little burned out , " and that they " lived with the fear and the anxiety for a long time ... and still do . "
They allegedly said that they were enjoying spending more time together during retirement , and expressed a desire to be part of a " reserve army . "
But if convicted on the charges against them , they could instead face up to 35 years in prison .
Like the old competition to have the world 's tallest building , New York can't resist having the nation 's highest taxes .
So after California raised its top income tax rate to 10.55 % last month , Albany 's politicians leapt into action to reclaim high - tax honors .
Maybe C - Span can make this tax competition a new reality TV series ; Carla Bruni , the first lady of France , could host .
They can invite politicians from the at least 10 other states that are also considering major tax hikes , including Oregon , Illinois , Wisconsin , Washington , Arizona and New Jersey .
One explicit argument for the $ 787 billion " stimulus " bill was to help states avoid these tax increases that even Keynesians understand are contractionary .
Instead , the state politicians are pocketing the federal cash to maintain spending , and raising taxes anyway .
Just another spend - and - tax bait and switch .
In New York , Assembly Speaker ( and de facto Governor ) Sheldon Silver and other Democrats will impose a two percentage point " millionaire tax " on New Yorkers who earn more than $ 200,000 a year ( $ 300,000 for couples ) .
This will lift the top state tax rate to 8.97 % and the New York City rate to 12.62 % .
Since capital gains and dividends are taxed as ordinary income , New York will impose the nation 's highest taxes on investment income -- at a time when Wall Street is in jeopardy of losing its status as the world 's financial capital .
But who and where are all these millionaires to pluck ?
More than any other state , New York has been hurt by the financial meltdown , and its $ 132 billion budget is now $ 17.7 billion in deficit .
The days of high - roller Wall Street bonuses that finance 20 % of the New York budget are long gone .
The richest 1 % of New Yorkers already pay almost 40 % of the income tax , and the top 0.5 % pay 30 % .
Mr. Silver thinks he can squeeze more from these folks without any economic harm , arguing that recent income tax hikes did n't hurt New Jersey .
( Yes , the pols in New York actually hold up New Jersey , whose economy and budget are also in shambles , as their role model . )
The tax hike lobby in Albany points to a paper by Princeton researchers reporting that the number of " half - millionaires , " those with incomes above $ 500,000 , increased by 60 % from 2003 - 2006 after New Jersey taxes rose ( the top rate is now 8.98 % ) .
But this was a boom time for the national economy , especially in the financial industry where many New Jerseyites work , or at least used to work .
Enlarge AP Karl Malden starred in films such as On the Waterfront and A Streetcar Named Desire .
Karl Malden played everything from priests to generals , villains to song - and - dance men over the course of a career that began in the late 1940s .
The 97 - year - old Oscar winner died of natural causes Wednesday at his home in Brentwood , Calif. , surrounded by family including wife Mona .
The couple celebrated their 70th anniversary in December .
As an actor , Malden brought an Everyman quality to the screen and stage — whether playing Marlon Brando 's poker buddy in A Streetcar Named Desire , Carroll Baker 's cuckolded husband in Baby Doll or Gen. Omar Bradley in Patton .
The son of a Serbian father and a Czech mother , Malden was born Mladen George Sekulovich on March 12 , 1912 , in Chicago and raised in Gary , Ind .
He worked in the steel mills before enrolling in Arkansas State Teachers College .
He attended Chicago 's Goodman Theatre Dramatic School , then moved to New York , where he made his Broadway debut in Golden Boy in 1937 .
Malden joined the innovative Group Theater , where he attracted the attention of director Elia Kazan , with whom he launched a fruitful partnership .
With Kazan directing , Malden starred in such plays as Arthur Miller 's All My Sons and Tennessee Williams ' A Streetcar Named Desire , and in 1951 helped Kazan bring Streetcar to the silver screen .
Malden 's film debut , however , came in 1940's They Knew What They Wanted .
During his stint in the Army Air Force during World War II , Malden appeared in Winged Victory , which led to a brief contract with 20th Century Fox .
One of his most memorable roles is Streetcar 's Mitch , which he originated in the 1947 play .
Richard Watts Jr. , writing in the New York Post , described Marlon Brando's acting in the play as " an excellent piece of work , " and added , " even finer is Karl Malden , one of the ablest young actors extant . "
He won a supporting - actor Oscar for the film adaptation .
Of that Oscar night , Malden told the Orange County Register in 1989 : " Like a real New Yorker , I brought a top coat with me ( to the ceremony ) and placed it on the empty seat next to me . "
He added , " I saw that the winners were going backstage after their speeches and started to worry about my coat .
Humphrey Bogart , who was up for The African Queen , was sitting two seats away , and he was real nervous .
I leaned over to him and asked him if he'd watch my coat if I won , and he kind of looked at me in disbelief and said , ' Yeah , sure . '
Well , after I won , I was standing backstage , and then Bogie won .
I looked across the room and saw him walking around .
I ran up to him and asked him about my coat and he snapped at me : ' Forget the damn coat … you just won an Oscar . ' "
Malden would reunite with Kazan and Brando in 1954's
On the Waterfront , playing a priest to Brando 's longshoreman .
Malden again was nominated for a supporting - actor Oscar .
In 1956 , Kazan cast Malden against type as the lecherous Archie Lee in Baby Doll .
FAITH AND REASON :
The story behind Malden 's priest
But Malden was best known to the TV generation as Lt. Mike Stone , the no-nonsense cop in The Streets of San Francisco , which ran from 1972 - 1977 .
His co-star was a young Michael Douglas .
Malden even parlayed his Streets persona into a 21 - year stint as spokesman in a series of American Express ads .
" After 50 years of doing all those other things in the business , wherever I go , the one thing people will say to me is , ' Do n't leave home without it . '
What am I going to say ? " he told the Chicago Tribune in 1989 .
" It 's kind of frustrating in a way , but at the same time , American Express has been very good to me , and it 's given me independence . "
In 1988 , he was elected president of the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences , a position he held from 1989 to 1992 .
Malden was instrumental in pushing for a special salute to Kazan at the 1999 Oscars .
Critics noted that Kazan cooperated with the House UnAmerican Activities committee in 1952 and gave up names of supposed communists in Hollywood .
Brando refused to present Kazan with the award ; Robert De Niro ended up presenting the honor .
Malden accepted a lifetime achievement award presented to him by TV co-star Douglas from the Screen Actors Guild in 2004 .
" I 'm not retired .
I just quit .
I do n't want to work anymore , " he told the Orlando Sentinel at the time .
" I do n't want to go into something because they give me some money .
I 've had it . "
But of the award , Malden said , " It 's by the peers .
To me , the Life Achievement Award is the peak . "
Asked to name his favorite movie role , he said : " I love them all .
I 'm a workaholic .
When I was younger , I said , ' You ca n't hit a home run unless you get up to bat . '
I took everything .
That 's the way I learned .
If I waited for the right part , I 'd still be sitting here . "
The world 's airlines will collectively lose $ 9 billion US in 2009 — nearly double the previous projections — and face a slow recovery as the economic crisis saps air travel and cargo demand , an industry body warned Monday .
The International Air Transport Association , which represents 230 airlines worldwide , increased its loss estimate from the $ 4.7 billion it forecast in March , reflecting a " rapidly deteriorating revenue environment . "
Although there has been growing signs of a bottoming out of the recession , IATA said the industry was severely hit in the first quarter with 50 major airlines reporting losses of more than $ 3 billion .
Weak consumer confidence , high business inventories and rising oil prices pose headwinds for future recovery , the association said during a two - day global aviation conference in Kuala Lumpur .
Revenues are expected to decline by $ 80 billion — or an unprecedented 15 per cent from a year ago — to $ 448 billion in 2009 , and the weakness will persist into 2010 , it said .
" There is no modern precedent for today 's economic meltdown .
The ground has shifted .
Our industry has been shaken .
This is the most difficult situation that the industry has faced , " said IATA chief executive Giovanni Bisignani .
The Geneva - based association also revised its estimated loss for last year to $ 10.4 billion from $ 8.5 billion previously .
It said passenger traffic for 2009 is expected to contract by eight per cent from a year ago to 2.06 billion travellers .
Cargo demand will decline by 17 per cent .
The association expects the industry fuel bill to shrink by $ 59 billion , or 36 per cent , to $ 106 billion this year , accounting for 23 per cent of operating costs with an average oil price of $ 56 a barrel .
But crude oil prices have rallied in recent weeks , breaching the $ 70 a barrel level on Friday on hopes of economic recovery .
Bisignani urged governments to avoid protectionist policies and reiterated his call for more liberalization such as the lifting of restrictions on routes and co-operation between airlines to bolster the global airline industry .
" It would be a cheap and effective stimulus … liberalizing key routes today would create 24 million jobs and $ 490 billion in economic activity , " he said .
Over the next three years , he said about 4,000 aircraft are scheduled to be delivered .
This year alone , airlines are expected to spend about $ 25 billion to take delivery of more than 800 Western - built jets , draining cash for a second straight year .
" Aircraft ordered in good times are being delivered in recession , " Bisignani said .
" Finding customers to fill them profitably will be a challenge . "
IATA said carriers in all regions were expected to report losses , with Asia - Pacific to be the hardest hit amid a sharp slowdown in its three key markets — Japan , China and India .
The region 's carriers are expected to post losses of $ 3.3 billion , worse than the previous forecast of $ 1.7 billion but better than the $ 3.9 billion losses last year .
North American carriers are expected to lose $ 1 billion , far better than its $ 5.1 billion losses in 2008 , thanks to early capacity cuts and limited hedging by U.S. carriers .
Despite strong traffic , Middle East carriers will see losses deepen to $ 1.5 billion as the region 's intercontinental hubs are vulnerable to recessionary impacts in Europe and Asia .
A collapse for demand in premium services in all major markets will see European airlines lose $ 1.8 billion .
Latin American carriers are expected to lose $ 900 million and African airlines $ 500 million .

Reid needs someone to sponsor the abrogation of Do n't Ask Don't Tell ?
Let 's elect Jennifer Brunner in Ohio
The Obama administration , which came to office promising to protect gay rights but so far has not done much , actually struck a blow for the other side last week .
It submitted a disturbing brief in support of the Defense of Marriage Act , which is the law that protects the right of states to not recognize same - sex marriages and denies same - sex married couples federal benefits .
The administration needs a new direction on gay rights .
... In the presidential campaign , President Obama declared that he would work to overturn the Defense of Marriage Act .
Now , the administration appears to be defending it out of a sense of obligation to support a validly enacted Congressional law .
There is a strong presumption that the Justice Department will defend federal laws , but it is not an inviolable rule ...
In a letter to President Obama on Monday , Joe Solmonese , president of the Human Rights Campaign , a gay rights organization , said , “ I cannot overstate the pain that we feel as human beings and as families when we read an argument , presented in federal court , implying that our own marriages have no more constitutional standing than incestuous ones . ”
The brief also maintains that the Defense of Marriage Act represents a “ cautious policy of federal neutrality ” -- an odd assertion since the law clearly discriminates against gay couples .
Under the act , same - sex married couples who pay their taxes are ineligible for the sort of federal benefits -- such as Social Security survivors ’ payments and joint tax returns -- that heterosexual married couples receive .
“ ’ Do n’t ask , do n’t tell , ’ has outlived its usefulness .
It may have been a first step to inclusiveness in the military , but it has proved to be another ‘ separate but equal ’ concept that is used to exclude those who understand that forced silence is demeaning and unacceptable .
It ’s time to allow people to be free to speak of who they are , to respect them and allow them to be fully a part of the community that will move us forward through the coming social and economic change . ”
In a whiny excuse for inaction , Harry Reid said yesterday there is no sponsor for getting rid of Do n't Ask Don't Tell in the Senate .
He suggests the White House do it -- or the House .
Oh , really ?
No Kirsten Gillibrand ?
No Barbara Boxer ?
No Chuck Schumer ?
All three are up for re-election -- and the first two can't be re-elected without gay support .
Democrats in office have taken gay voters for granted too long .
Today ' scastigates the Obama Administration for another Bush - like response over gay rights .
Democrats are playing a dangerous game .
When gays like someone they stick with them forever -- look at Cher and Lisa Minelli -- and when they turn ... it is President Obama has talked about the fact that when his black father and white mother got married , in half the states in the U.S. that marriage was illegal .
Yes , until the Supreme Court threw out all the state 's " miscegenation laws " in 1964 -- a result of ( something we 've looked at before in relation to the release of Nanci Griffith 's new album , The Loving Kind ) -- interracial marriage was prohibited in many states .
Had thegovernment not overturned those archaic , discriminatory laws in 1964 , it 's unlikely that Obama would be president today .
As John Aravosis pointed out yesterday , gay donors are bailing on a $ 1,000 a head DNC gay fundraising dinner scheduled for June 25 honoring Joe Biden .
Instead of writing $ 1,000 checks , rich Democrats should be standing outside the Mandarin Oriental with protest signs .
Funny that Rahm Emanuel 's Frankenstein Supplemental bill -- which contains a little something for everyone , from used car salesmen and parents worried about their children catching the flu to crooked European banksters looking for a bailout -- did n't include a Do n't Ask Don't Tell repeal .
That would have been the way to pass it .
Ohio Secretary of State , Jennifer Brunner , states unequivocally that she will sponsor the bill when she 's elected to the Senate next year .
Her record on gay equality bears out her promise .
Forget that $ 1,000 check for the DNC and donate to Jennifer Brunner 's campaign instead .
He say he meant that ... whatever he did n't say yesterday .
I tried getting answers out of senators who are up for re-election in 2010 and who get substantial support from gay people .
They all said teh same thing : " No comment . "
Bright side of the coin : this 'll be the first time ever that I do n't have to write a check to Barbara Boxer .
Meanwhile , the Human Rights Campaign did the right thing and pulled out of the Biden DNC dinner ; others followed .
I spoke with Barney Frank 's office and was told that Barney is n't concerned because he was completely confident that there would be a Senate sponsor but that right now Congress is concentrating on passing ENDA ( the Employment Non-Discrimination Act ) .
I wish I was as confident as he appears to be .
I do n't think this has been publicly announced anywhere but Barney rounded up 7 co-sponors , besides himself : Tammy Baldwin ( D - WI ) , Jared Polis ( D - CO ) , Rob Andrews ( D - NJ ) , Ileana Ros-Lehtinen ( R- FL ) , Mike Castle ( R - DE ) and Mark Kirk ( R - IL ) .
I wonder if he asked any of the homophobic GOP closet cases like Patrick McHenry ( R-NC ) , Aaron Schock ( R- IL ) , Dana Rohrabacher ( R - CA ) or Adrian Smith ( R - NE ) to co-sponsor .
I forgot to ask .
ENDA hearing in July .

Mexico's navy has seized more than a tonne of cocaine stuffed inside frozen sharks , as drug gangs under military pressure go to greater lengths to conceal narcotics bound for the United States .
Armed and masked navy officers cut open more than 20 shark carcasses filled with slabs of cocaine after checking a container ship in a container port in the southern Mexico state of Yucatan , the navy and Mexican media said yesterday .
Download the new Independent Premium app Sharing the full story , not just the headlines
" We are talking about more than a tonne of cocaine that was inside the ship , " Navy Commander Eduardo Villa told reporters after X - ray machines and sniffer dogs helped uncover the drugs .
" Those in charge of the shipment said it was a conserving agent but after checks we confirmed it was cocaine , " he said .
Drug gangs are coming up with increasingly creative ways of getting drugs into the United States - in sealed beer cans , religious statues and furniture - as Mexico 's military cracks down on the cartels moving South American narcotics north .
President Felipe Calderon has sent 45,000 troops and federal police across Mexico to try to crush powerful smuggling cartels .
But traffickers armed with a huge arsenal of grenades and automatic weapons are far from defeated , worrying Washington as violence spills over into US states like Arizona .
Some 2,750 people have died in drug violence in Mexico this year , a pace similar to that of 2008 , when 6,300 were killed .
Led by Mexico 's most wanted man , Joaquin " Shorty " Guzman , smugglers from the Pacific state of Sinaloa are fighting a turf war with rivals .
Guzman seeks to control Mexican and Central American smuggling routes into the United States .
( Warning : This column may contain images and ideas not suitable for children or citizens of China . )
Examine , if you dare , the photograph at the top of this story .
It 's right there for any man , woman or child to see : a naked couple cavorts , bare limbs draped seductively across the frame , their fleshy faces pressed together like a couple of animals .
Clearly , this image is pornographic .
Or so says the Chinese government 's latest attempt to regulate the internet .
If that sounds stupid , it 's because it is .
But by potentially treating these porcine pixels as " harmful material for the public , " Beijing is straining under a self - imposed digital dilemma : how to promote the internet to boost economic growth and efficiency , while allowing the central government to maintain some degree of control over Chinese society .
If pigs are porn , then clearly the strategy still has some kinks .
( More on that in a moment . )
This past week , the Chinese government issued a sweeping directive : Beginning July 1 every personal computer sold in the country must include new software that filters pornography and other content from the view of China 's 300 million internet users .
According to the Wall Street Journal , Beijing aims to " construct a green , healthy and harmonious internet environment , and prevent harmful information on the internet from influencing and poisoning young people . "
The software , called Green Dam / Youth Escort , is designed to keep web surfers from sites the government deems dangerous , adding one more brick to the Great Firewall of China .
Beijing already employs 30,000 people to police the web , who try to shape opinion by flooding popular sites with positive comments about the Chinese Communist Party .
It also routinely blocks sites that mention the spiritual movement Falun Gong , the 1989 Tiananmen Square crackdown , the Dalai Lama and other sensitive topics .
On the 20th anniversary of the Tiananmen protests earlier this month , the government shut down Twitter , Flickr , YouTube and other popular social media sites .
But the coming imposition of Green Dam / Youth Escort has reportedly unnerved personal computer makers operating in China , such as Hewlett - Packard , Dell and Lenovo .
And with good reason .
More than 40 million PCs were sold in China last year , and demand is growing despite the global economic crisis .
The country is an irresistable and critically important market for any computer maker .
The internet , of course , is also good for the Chinese economy , which has slowed in recent months amid the global economic meltdown .
The web makes many business operations more efficient , from tightening supply chains to speeding orders and deliveries to improving communications .
So Beijing is caught between its need to promote economic growth , and its desire to retain political control over 1.3 billion people .
It 's that last part that has privacy and free - speech advocates up in hooves .
Most have roundly criticized Green Dam .
" It 's like downloading spyware onto your computer , but the government is the spy , " Charles Mok , chairman of the Hong Kong chapter of the Internet Society told The New York Times .
Nor , apparently , does the software work very well .
Computer experts say Green Dam is susceptible to hacking , crashes easily , runs only on computers that operate Microsoft Windows , and is ineffective when used with a Firefox browser .
Then there 's the matter of the naked pigs .
To determine whether a photograph is " pornographic , " the system reportedly is designed to identify the proportion of skin color .
White , pink and fleshy , therefore , is blocked by the software .
Sorry pigs .
You look too much like porn .
But a photo of actual , naked African women ?
Not a problem , according to Chinese who have tried out the system .
To be sure , the Chinese government is likely to hammer out at least some of these problems with Green Dam / Youth Escort , as well with other future regulations .
Ridicule is a powerful motivating force , and the internet is n't going away any time soon .
But until Beijing resolves this digital dilemma you can expect more ham - fisted hooey , and plenty of squealing , from all sides .

One of the most frequent questions I ’m asked is whether it ’s acceptable to end a sentence with a preposition .
I know many of you were taught that you should n’t end a sentence with a preposition , but it ’s a myth .
In fact , I consider it one of the top ten grammar myths because many people believe it ’s true , but nearly all grammarians disagree , at least in some cases ( 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 , 5 , 6 , 7 , 8 ) .
So before I lose you , let 's back up .
What is a preposition ?
What Is a Preposition ?
A preposition is a word that creates a relationship between other words .
It 's been said that prepositions often deal with space and time ( 1 ) , which always makes me think of Star Trek .
For example , the prepositions “ above , ” “ by , ” and “ over ” all say something about a position in space ; the prepositions “ before , ” “ after , ” and “ since ” all say something about time .

When Can a Sentence End with a Preposition ?
Here 's an example of a sentence that can end with a preposition :
What did you step on ?
A key point is that the sentence does n't work if you leave off the preposition .
You can't say , “ What did you step ? ”
You need to say , “ What did you step on ? ” to make a grammatical sentence .
I can hear some of you gnashing your teeth right now , while you think , “ What about saying , ' On what did you step ? ' ”
But really , have you ever heard anyone talk that way ?
I 've read long , contorted arguments from noted grammarians about why it 's OK to end sentences with prepositions when the preposition is n't extraneous ( 1 ) , but the driving point still seems to be , “ Nobody in their right mind talks this way . ”
Yes , you could say , “ On what did you step ? ” but not even grammarians think you should .
It sounds pedantic .
Baby P died after months of abuse despite visits from authorities
The 32 - year - old boyfriend of Baby P's mother has been convicted of raping a two - year - old girl in north London .
The crime came to light after the man was arrested over 17 - month - old Baby P's death .
The Old Bailey jury cleared Baby P's mother of cruelty to the girl .
In November the man was convicted of - and the mother admitted - causing the death of Baby P , now named as Peter .
Sentencing will be on 21 and 22 May .
The girl , like Baby P , was on Haringey Council 's child protection register .
The couple , who were remanded in custody , and the girl cannot be identified for legal reasons .
False names
The adults were tried under false names amid fears that an internet hate campaign could influence jurors .
It is telling that this man denied rape and in doing so forced a vulnerable child to endure a daunting criminal process
Det Ch Insp Graham Grant
Baby P carers ' lacked urgency ' Baby P given dignity of a name
The boyfriend will be sentenced for rape and for causing or allowing Baby P's death in August 2007 .
Baby P's mother and lodger Jason Owen , who was convicted of the same charge over Baby P , will also be sentenced .
The judge will be able to pass a life sentence on the boyfriend if he considers him to be a danger to the public .
Judge Kramer told the couple : " The likelihood is of very substantial sentences in both cases . "
Baby P died in Haringey after suffering months of abuse and despite visits by the authorities .
Video interview
In the latest trial , the girl - now four years old - became the youngest child to give evidence at the Old Bailey , through a video link .
The court was also shown her video interview with police when she was three , in which she said the man had hurt her .
Prosecuting , Sally O'Neill QC said the girl demonstrated the attack on her to the psychiatrist by using a doll and a toy bear .
By denying rape , the attacker forced the girl into giving video evidence Defence barristers argued that the child 's evidence was not reliable and the allegation could have been suggested to her by another child .
Medical evidence was inconclusive but a test showed a finding which " could be supportive " of the allegation .
Outside court , Det Ch Insp Graham Grant said there was no doubt the girl suffered terribly .
" This case has shocked everyone to the core , " he said .
" It is telling that this man denied rape and in doing so forced a young and vulnerable child to endure a daunting criminal process at the Old Bailey . "
He described the girl 's resilience as " extraordinary " .
" I sincerely hope that with continued support of friends and her family she will be able to lead a happy and fulfilled life , " he said .
' Heinous crimes ' Haringey Council said an investigation into the girl 's case was under way , examining the role of different agencies .
Council leader Claire Kober said of Friday 's verdict : " We have accepted that things went badly wrong with our child protection in 2007 .
" We live every day with the knowledge that more could have been done and apologise again to everyone affected .
We are committed to putting things right . "
Andrew Flanagan , chief executive of children 's charity NSPCC , said the offences were " among the most heinous crimes against small children we have ever seen " .
" Thankfully , those responsible have been convicted , " he said .
" Hopefully they will receive severe prison sentences which will keep them away from children for a very long time . "
Children , Schools and Families Secretary Ed Balls said : " People around the country will be horrified to learn that an adult living in the household of Baby Peter has also committed another vile and disgusting crime against a small and vulnerable child .
" I will not rest until we have implemented the recommendations from Lord Laming , swiftly and thoroughly , so that we can have the best child protection arrangements possible . "

After receiving thousands of emails from protesting swine , the World Health Organization announced they were changing the name of Swine Flu to Influenza A - H1N1 .
The politically correct organization swiftly changed the name of the flu to a less offensive , more scientifically correct moniker .
However , whether or not one is afflicted with Swine Flue , or Influenza A - H1N1 , the symptoms are exactly the same .
A flu , by any other name , would feel the same .
So it is with political parties .
The news of Arlen Specter 's defection from the Republican Party spread through the media faster than the above mentioned flu .
Most of the reports are speculating that the only reason for his sudden switch is to insure he 'll win his sixth term next year , as a Democrat .
Does that mean Specter 's political views have changed , or is he an elephant in a donkey suit ?
What exactly did Arlen Specter do to change his status from Republican to Democrat ?
Did he move his office across the hall ?
Throw away all those little elephants and replace them with jack - asses , I mean donkeys ?
It is a well known fact that a third party designated candidate has little orno no chance of being elected to Congress , let alone the Presidency .
Candidates jump party ships once they recognize their ship is sinking and eagerly climb aboard the one with the strongest sails , leaving their political principles and ideals , along with their former constituents , to sink slowly into the west .
It 's hard to stand up for what you believe in , when the deck you 're standing up on is sinking .
Those who feel it is more important to win an election , even if it means compromising their principles , are nothing more than self - serving cowards who would rather abandon ship .
Ron Paul was a Republican , then he defected to the Libertarian Party when they asked him to be their candidate for President in 1988 .
After he lost the election , ( no great surprise ) he returned to the Republican Party so he could be elected to Congress .
Whatever his political philosophy , he knew that he could never accomplish any change in government unless he were in a position of power , and the only way to gain entrance into that exclusive club called Congress , was to return to a major political party .
Then , instead of coming out in favor of either the Libertarian Party or Republican Party candidate , he backed the nominee of the Constitution Party .
So , does that make Ron Paul a Constiliberican ?
One can only imagine what their logo would look like !
Yet with all Paul 's Internet coverage , the money bombs , the revolutionary ideas of smaller government , lower taxes and individual liberty , the Republican Party electorate chose someone else .
And they lost .
Political party lines are continually blurred .
It someone is pro-choice , but is also totally against gun control , two opposing issues on any one political party platform , what box do they check on their registration ?
There is a growing trend for people to check “ American Independent ” , not knowing that it 's also is a political party .
So , what would happen if there were no parties ?
No us against them , no cute logos or animals to wear on a t - shirt .
There would be no sides to choose , no labels such as liberal or conservative , democrat or republican .
No giant political machine steering the direction of the country , one way or the other .
What if we only elected individuals with ideas similar to our own ?
What if we could elect those who have the intelligence , experience and ability to balance all the many ideologies under one umbrella , and not have to jump ship every time their Party starts sailing into rougher waters ?
Then we would know our candidates as people , not platforms .
We would know how they stand on important issues and what they think , independent of what their Party tells them .
They would win or lose their election based solely on these issues , not the box they checked on the voter registration form , or what floor their office was located .
Then perhaps , politicians such as Arlen Specter and Ron Paul would n't have to keep changing the color of their ties in order to remain in office .
What if they threw a Party and no one came ?
There are many people and organizations in the United States who oppose the American Climate and Energy Security Act ( ACES ) , and many of them have mailed letters , written emails , and called their Representatives and Senators in an effort to convince their legislator to vote against ACES .
Some of ACES ’ opponents have deep enough pockets that they can afford to hire lobbying firms to lobby against the legislation , and did so .
But someone took it much farther .
Someone hired public relations and lobbying firm Bonner & Associates to mobilize the grassroots to contact their legislators , and according to a Charlottesville Daily Progress article , at least one Bonner employee forged letters from two minority groups in an effort to convince U.S. Rep.
Tom Perriello of Virginia to vote against ACES .
According to the article , six letters ostensibly from two minority groups within Rep.
Perriello ’s district were forged by one or more employees within Bonner & Associates .
One letter was on letterhead from Creciendo Juntos , a nonprofit group devoted to solving Hispanic issues in Charlottesville .
The other five were supposedly from the Albemarle - Charlottesville NAACP .
All six letters were from people who did not work at the groups and two claimed organizational titles that do not exist .
S&R has obtained copies of the letters in question : Creciendo Juntos forgery and NAACP forgery .
The Daily Progress article reports that a partner with Bonner & Associates traveled to Charlottesville to apologize for the “ mistake ” and to inform Creciendo Juntos that the employee responsible had been fired .
However , Creciendo Juntos executive committeemember Tim Freilich wrote in a letter to Rep. Perriello that :
This was not a “ mistake . ”
This was a deliberately and carefully forged letter that used the logo , address and name of Creciendo Juntos without authorization .
( from Daily Progress article )
Given Bonner & Associates ’ history of astroturf lobbying and outright deception , it ’s difficult to dismiss Mr. Freilich ’s concerns .
According to the Daily Progress article :
The AARP Bulletin reported in 2006 that the “ 60 Plus Association ” hired Bonner & Associates in 2003 to manage what it called an “ Astroturf ” campaign against prescription drug legislation in Minnesota and New Mexico , meaning that it was an artificial version of a grassroots campaign .
Bonner & Associates hired callers to identify themselves as members of the 60 Plus Association and urge residents to ask their governors to veto the legislation .
Pharmaceutical company Pfizer later admitted that it had paid Bonner & Associates to undertake the campaign , AARP reported .
Furthermore , in an article originally published by the Baltimore Sun and reprinted at Common Dreams , Bonner & Associates was exposed as using similar tactics to oppose the prescription drug plan on behalf of PhRMA , the pharmaceutical industry trade group .
Although the tactics outraged some supporters of the prescription drug bills , those behind the campaign defended their actions as legitimate .
Welcome to the big leagues , they said .
“ It ’s a great exercise in the First Amendment , ” said Jack Bonner , founder of Bonner & Associates , the Washington lobbying firm hired by Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America ( PhRMA ) to kill the legislation .
The Baltimore Sun article goes on to describe the basic way the campaign worked : Bonner & Associates faxed misleading letters on Consumer Alliance letterhead to people in various purchased databases and the returned signatures were then attached to a petition against the drug benefit that was presented to legislators .
Furthermore , the contact that supposedly worked for Consumer Alliance was revealed to be a Bonner & Associates employee – after he lied to a reporter about his employer .
In a response to a request for PhRMA to be honest , the Sun article quotes Jack Bonner as saying “ It ’s democracy .
That is what this is about . ”
Since this story broke in the Daily Progress this morning , there has been a widespread and growing uproar about it .
Carl Pope of the Sierra Club issued a press release that said , in part , “ the alleged forgery of letters from organizations dedicated to protecting their communities forces one to question who is really behind the efforts to block America ’s progress towards a clean energy economy . ”
Paul Blumenthal , blogged at the Sunlight Foundation that “ this story was worth flagging as I ’d imagine it is the clearest cut argument for [ grassroots lobbying disclosure ] ” and “ Bonner & Associates has not filed a lobbying disclosure report since 2001 , so we have no clue which client is paying the firm to forge letters and lie to lawmakers . ”
Senator John Kerry wrote a diary entry at Daily Kos that reads in part :
Nothing should surprise us anymore after we ’ve seen powerful interests mislead about the science , twist the facts about climate change , resort to a whole host of tactics to try to hide a simple fact : the earth is in trouble because of manmade greenhouse gasses , our planet is getting closer and closer to a dangerous tipping point , and we must do something about this immediately .
But I have to say , this appears to be a desperate distortion too many … .
This moment is too important , the crisis is too grave , to let our debate be distorted by under the radar screen gutter moves – this one the most egregious example yet reported .
A blog post at Blue Virginia compared Bonner & Associates to the Tea Party Patriots , who told their members to call legislators and lie about their residency .
And the blog It ’s Getting Hot In Here made their opinion of the tactics abundantly clear just by the title – “ Fraud ?
Identity Theft ?
Impersonation ?
All In A Day ’s Work . ”
And Wonkette is most assuredly not amused .
This story has also started to get some legs in the legacy media .
Keith Johnson , writer of the Wall Street Journal ’s Environmental Capital blog , said the following : “ The fight over impending climate - change legislation in Congress appears to be getting dirtier . ”
Johnson also pointed out that Bonner & Associates has worked against climate disruption policies in the past , specifically organizing a “ web - based grassroots campaign ahead of the U.S. vote on the Kyoto Protocol in the late 1990s . ”
Mention of this has also shown up in The Hill ’s Briefing Room blog .
Ultimately , though , whether Bonner & Associates will be punished for lying and forging letters on official letterhead will not be determined by activists , bloggers , or reporters .
Jack Bonner and Bonner & Associates were accused of ethics violations for the group ’s activities on behalf of PhRMA , but the charges were dismissed by the Maryland State Ethics Commission .
If , as TPMMuckraker blogger Zachary Roth believes , additional letters turn up in other Representatives ’ offices , then the probability that this was a single rogue , overzealous employee ( as Bonner & Associates has claimed ) goes way down .
Similarly , there ’s a chance that Bonner & Associates might potentially face one or more legal actions as a result of these letters .
A case could probably be made for fraud and impersonation , possibly for trademark infringement .
And I feel confident that lawyers could find more charges as well .
In that same vein , Rep. Edward J. Markey of Massachussetts , Chairman of the Select Committee on Energy Independence and Global Warming , has taken an interest in this story :
Cathy O'Brien and Mark Phillips CIA Mind Control : Out Of Darkness , Into the Light
As the issue of torturing individuals held in detention facilities plays out in the news media , two of the most successful whistleblowers are speaking out on how CIA programs such as MK - ULTRA actually involved torturing U.S. citizens , our allies citizens and how these heinous atrocities were allowed to continue under the 1947 National Security Act .
Cathy O'Brien was a White House / Pentagon level MK - ULTRA mind control victim , who claims torture was used on her to fragment her personality to make her forget secrets and criminal covert operations she had been forced to participate in over a thirty year period .
" Many of the same criminals in control of the government today were in control of me , " Cathy says .
" And they are acutely aware that torture and trauma causes humankind to forget . "
Cathy adds , " Now that torture is finally a predominant political issue , the reality of how it 's actually being used continues to be kept from the public by those in control of the government and corporate media .
Those who control information control knowledge , which in turn controls the thoughts , perceptions , opinions , and actions of those they inform . "
What about the argument that torture is justified as a means to extract information ?
Cathy says , " Considering today 's technological advancements , pharmaceuticals , computerization , and classified mind manipulating weaponry , it 's clear to see that torture is not only archaic , but is actually a diversionary issue from more prevalent forms of mass mind manipulation being used on the human population . "
Cathy was rescued in 1988 by Mark Phillips , a U.S. Intelligence insider knowledgeable on CIA mind - control techniques who acted after he was told by a Chinese Intelligence officer that Cathy and her then eight - year - old daughter , Kelly , were mind - controlled slaves of the U.S. government .
Mark says that the super secret technology used on Cathy , Kelly and others is an , " evolved system of remote human physical and psychological manipulation that has only recently been officially recognized by accredited mental health physicians for what it is - absolute mind control . "
Cathy and Mark circumvented the news media 's blackout on their case with the greatest true life love story of extraction and recovery from the CIA 's mind control project ever told .
You can hear their story along with a discussion on the issue of torture at an event called " CIA Mind Control : Out Of Darkness , Into the Light " which will be held on Friday June 5th , 2009 in Los Angeles .
The event begins at 7 PM at Hollywood United Methodist Church located at 6817 Franklin Avenue ( at Highland Ave . ) .
For more info call 805-653-1588 or visit GoodKarmaPR.com .
A portion of the proceeds go to Children of the Night , a non profit that rescues children from the ravages of prostitution and domination of pimps .
Joining Cathy and Mark will be Dr. Colin Ross , a globally recognized expert on trauma related disorders and author of " The CIA Doctors : Human Rights Violations by American Psychiatrists . "
Dr. Ross provides proof , based on 15,000 pages of documents obtained from the CIA through the Freedom of Information Act , that there have been pervasive , systematic violations of human rights by American psychiatrists over the last 65 years .
As well , he proves that the Manchurian Candidate " super spy " is fact , not fiction .
He describes CIA documented experiments by psychiatrists to create amnesia , new identities , hypnotic access codes , and implanting new memories in the minds of experimental subjects .
Also scheduled to appear is comedian Roseanne Barr .
In addition to being a champion for the rights of abused children everywhere , she was treated by Dr. Colin Ross for DID recovery .
About The Speakers and Organizers ...

“ In Jewish tradition , if someone has a coin , half will be used to buy bread and the other half for a flower .
The gesture of giving a flower is nice , and soon we hope to provide many flowers in a variety of colors , ” announced Haim Dotan , the architect of AORA ’s new “ Power Flower ” at Kibbutz Samar .
On June 24 , AORA Solar had its Kibbutz Samar Launch Event , to show off “ flowery ” new technology that generates 100 kW of electrical power and 170 kW of thermal power .
With an audience of around 250 journalists , investors , scientists , and curious individuals from around the world , the AORA team showed off their site and later signed agreements with Spanish and Australian firms to start introducing their technology outside of Israel .
AORA boasts that they have developed the world ’s first commercial hybrid solarized gas - turbine power station , capable of producing green power 24 / 7 .
The hybrid nature of the system allows power to be generated around the clock , by operating on “ Solar - only mode ” during hours of sunlight , and “ hybrid mode ” using fuel to generate energy during hours of limited sunlight .
To make the system even cleaner , the objective is to use biofuels to power the hybrid mode .
Using a system of highly reflective mirrors called heliostats that move according to the position of the sun , heat is concentrated at 1000 degrees Celsius inside the flower part of the structure .
Elevated 30 meters above the ground , the tulip shaped flower has petals and contains a solarized micro gas turbine within .
AORA ’s flower structure and 30 heliostat mirrors are only able to supply 100 kW of power to the national grid ( enough to sustain approximately 70 homes ) , but the system does have a number of advantages because of this .
Since the structure operates on a smaller scale , new plants can be erected in just a few months , allowing energy to be generated at a site quickly and with reduced contracting costs .
The required land is only half an acre , so the system will be able to power smaller villages , and for larger projects more flowers and heliostats can be added quickly and independently of the original structure .
Part of the Aora ’s goal is to generate solar power for smaller communities that can use the power in their daily lives and will be able to have an attractive symbol of sustainability in their community as a source of pride .
Visually , the flower is quite a site as it stands 30 meters tall in vibrant orange , and resembles a large tulip .
Architect Haim Dotan said that one of the challenges , but also one of the beautiful things will be adapting the flower design to different places around the world .
According to the climates , resources , and cultures of the various places where AORA hopes to build structures , each flower will likely require different materials , colors , and design adjustments .
AORA ’s launch event was well attended and should generate more buzz about their product .
While the heliostat technology has been a popular concept , AORA seems to be developing a niche for smaller scale projects , and for bringing creativity and art to the field of clean energy .
The AORA team , led by CEO Haim Fried , wants to be part of the movement to make the Negev the “ Sun Valley ” of the world , where new innovation is always emerging , and environmental ethics are ever present in the schools and in the community .
As David Ben Gurion ’s dream was to make the Negev Desert bloom and populated with Israeli towns and cities , AORA ’s Power Flower will help this happen in green and artistic fashion .

The 100 Greatest Writers of All Time : 50 - 26
by ALEX CARNEVALE and WILL HUBBARD
You can read the first two parts of The 100 Greatest Writers of All Time here and here .
Let us continue this , if you will .
Other lists of this kind have been attempted , none very successfully .
We would like to stress that there is a crucial difference between " an important writer " and " a great writer " ; the latter is at this time our sole interest .
We will account for some of the names that did not make this list in a later dispatch .
There is nothing bad to say about anyone we list here , except in some cases that they were anti-Semitic or racist , hated women or hated men .
Literary crimes are usually relative , the caveats of which we shall enumerate :
50 . Toni Morrison
Let 's not let a couple clunkers haunt how clutch Morrison was in gems like Song of Solomon , Beloved , and The Bluest Eye .
Her explanation of the American midwest ; her command of place rivals Faulkner in its better moments .
Does she sometimes adhere too closely too symbols ?
Is she sometimes more complex than she ought to be ?
That is no blemish on the career of an immortal voice .
49 . Charles Olson
America 's Bard , the voice of New England .
Incredibly tall , incredibly wacked .
He is the father of much of the American verse that directly followed , but he would never know just how lasting his work would be .
He is our poet of the future , a deep thinker who lacked empathy for everyone but himself .
Self - involvement can became a kind of genius at this depth , or so we hope .
Recommended reading : " The Post Office " , The Maximus Poems , " The K " .
48 . John Steinbeck
Steinbeck never graduated from Stanford .
For a time , he worked as a handyman .
His shorter works are incredible forays in concentration on theme ; his longer works are a pleasure to drift into like little worlds .
As a journalist of war he has no peer except for Orwell , and he could be funny , and also so devastating with the world he left you in after you 'd turned the last page .
Recommended reading : Travels with Charley , East of Eden , Of Mice And Men , Tortilla Flat .
O'Neill with his second of three wives , Agnes , and their later disinherited son Shane on a beach on Cape Cod. 47 .
Eugene O'Neill
He wrote one comedy that made the stage — it happens to be one of the greatest stage comedies ever written , but he stopped there .
His mind was occupied by the tragedy that could befall mankind , griefs personal and national .
He believed the stage could depict this faithfully , and still more after that .
46 . Gustave Flaubert
Madame Bovary was the real first novel , the first impulse in the form with intellectual heft , a plot with bite , a voice of reason .
He wrote it from 1850 - 1855 , and it appeared in serialized form , as the greatest novel that had ever been written at that point in time .
Contracted syphilis in Lebanon .
Never much of a playwright .
He spawned the greatest European writer , Franz Kafka , and his evenhanded conception of the modern novel has lasted longer then his flavorful , romantic work .
But without him , how were we to begin ?
Recommended reading : Bovary , Memoirs of a Madman , his letters
45 . Ivan Turgenev
Tolstoy wrote of Turgenev : " His stories of peasant life will forever remain a valuable contribution to Russian literature .
I have always valued them highly .
And in this respect none of us can stand comparison with him .
Take , for example , Living Relic , Loner , and so on .
All these are unique stories .
And as for his nature descriptions , these are true pearls , beyond the reach of any other writer ! "
Tolstoy could be such an understated dick at times .
Recommended reading : Fathers and Sons , The Diary of a Superfluous Man
44 . Charles Baudelaire
He was the quintessential mama 's boy .
He went looking for his mother in almost every prostitute in Paris , contracting all manner of sexually transmitted diseases .
Fortunately the only effect these STDs had on his literary talent was , if anything , to enhance it .
Among his Parisians his reputation became pretty solid .
Proust loved the guy .
You can be a dandy and a genius , and one hell of a poet .
He was .
Recommended reading : The Flowers of Evil , Paris Spleen , Artificial Paradises
43 . Robert Lowell
Of the New England poets , his achievements were the serious kind .
He mentored many other greats , but his fidelity to his own vision , his moral look at the world he lived in , whatever it looked like to others , was firm .
His sonnets are the greatest besides Shakespeare's .
Recommended reading : For the Union Dead and Life Studies .
42 . Mark Twain
Aphorisms and all , Twain was an American as great as Lincoln or Leadbelly .
That is , deeply rooted in the land of his birth , yet unblemished by either bias or zealotry .
Tom Sawyer is for kids , but Huck Finn stands up to any other novel in this bastard language of ours .
He is evidence that this country should be .
41 . Robert Creeley
The German psychoanalyst / aphorist Bert Hellinger said that " rejection leads to resemblance , " and it is this fact that best characterizes Creeley 's career .
He turned away from and overcame the sentimentalists , redefined what the country called sentiment , and broke free again , a man who could not die without knowing every version of love .
The first three books are indispensable — The Charm , For Love , and Words — though there are later gems like Mirrors and Life & Death .
The man is also our most imitable poet , which if the converse of Hellinger 's words is also true , make Creeley a signal father of this country 's next generation of original writers .
40 . Iris Murdoch
What an inspired philosophical novelist !
She wrote things down that should have been already written down , with an inspired moral sense .
She was born in Dublin and her husband and life partner John Bayley at Oxford .
They made an irreplicable team .
She would elevate discourse to a heavenly routine .
Recommended reading : A Year of Birds , The Black Prince , The Sandcastle , The Sea , The Sea
39 . Arthur Rimbaud
The boy poet is a familiar role , but Rimbaud was the greatest of all boy poets .
Died shortly after his 37th birthday .
Wrote to and fucked Paul Verlaine .
He was tall , thin and bony .
Breton called him " a god of adolescence . "
He wrote poetry briefly when he was in his teens .
One man 's passing fancy is acknowledged as an titanic masterpiece by another man .
It is best to read John Tranter 's appreciation of him and see just what we mean .
38 . Mary Shelley
Created the most important novel of its century , the Pygmalion - inspired Frankenstein .
It is still fabulous reading today , and inspired more than almost any other work of fiction .
It is about man becoming the machine , and it identified the chief feature of life thereafter — technological innovation and how it would change humanity into something different than it was before .
For this Shelley made the perfect story , one that is more than a metaphor , it is a koan to what has yet to occur .
37 . Virgil
Born in France when it was Gaul , Virgil was the son of a farmer .
Eventually he followed Octavian and became a part of the political scene .
In the last ten years of his life , he composed The Aeneid .
Its address to Homer is evident .
He saw his father go blind , his two brothers die , one at childbirth , and one in a messy accident .
He was the greatest writer of his time , and were he here today we could reasonably account for him as the inventor of what would become Western literature .
36 . Emily Dickinson
Quietly , unobtrusively , she is the American poet , giving more to those that followed her than anyone else .
She is in every poet we read , every word that is written .
Even when she is not , she is there , in her lacks .
She eschewed the long vision of some of the finest poets in English , but no one did more with less , and this was her genius , along with something of a bitter wit .
A person can be alone in the universe , and yet as long as they have literature , they need never worry .
35 . Walt Whitman
America 's most delightful poet , Whitman has had a renaissance that many already saw coming .
His verve and vision are so far ahead of any of his peers , it 's a wonder he was n't hailed earlier .
He never drank .
In his great letter to Emerson he imagined an America greater and more important than we could even conceive of today .
He was born on Long Island .
He hated slavery .
He worked at nursing , journalism , homosexuality , teaching .
Recommended reading : " O Captain ! O Captain ! " , Leaves of Grass , his notebooks .
34 . D.H. Lawrence
He died in France in 1930 , but his final resting place is in Taos , New Mexico .
It is a strange and wonderful journey for the English transplant .
He called his life a savage pilgrimage , he was never given the right sort of attention in his lifetime .
As he walked through the streets , they should have bowed .
His criticism is above reproach , it is more a blog than any blog that has yet been created .
His novels and stories are fresher today than the day they were written .
He can be put down easily , but he is easy to love , too .
Recommended reading : Lady Chatterly 's Lover , Women in Love , essays .
33 . William Carlos Williams
Why is the New Jersey native so important to the project of American poetry ?
Why is he more than just " The Red Wheelbarrow " ?
Why is his Spring and All one of the ten greatest poetry manuscripts of all time ?
Like Pound who he hated , Williams ' aims were new and real .
They were the everyday , they were the eternal .
His ear is flawless , his grasp of both prose and poetry on the level of Shakespeare .
He is the greatest poet this country produced from its small towns , where he served as a doctor .

June 1 , 2009 -- Addressing the 400 - strong May 21 workshop with workers from the industrial heartland of Guayana , dedicated to the “ socialist transformation of basic industry ” , Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez noted with satisfaction the outcomes of discussions : “ I can see , sense and feel the roar of the working class . ”
“ When the working class roars , the capitalists tremble ” , he said .
Chavez announced plans to implement a series of radical measures , largely drawn from proposals coming from the workers ’ discussion that day .
The workers greeted each of Chavez ’s announcements with roars of approval , chanting “ This is how you govern ! ”
Chavez said : “ The proposals made have emerged from the depths of the working class .
I did not come here to tell you what to do !
It is you who are proposing this . ”
Nationalisation and workers ’ control
To the cheers of the workers , Chavez announced the nationalisation of six iron briquette , ceramics and steel companies , one after the other .
He said this started “ a process of nationalisations ” aimed at creating an integrated basic industry complex as part of building socialism .
Chavez also said it was necessary for there to be workers ’ control along “ the entire productive chain ” .
Plans for the industrial complex had to be “ nourished with the ideas of the working class ” .
Throughout the day , workers from local steel , aluminum and iron companies raised demands for greater worker participation in managing production , more nationalisations , and the need to sack corrupt and counterrevolutionary managers .
The workers were affiliated to the Socialist Workers ’ Force ( FST ) , which organises unionists in the United Socialist Party of Venezuela ( PSUV — the mass revolutionary party led by Chavez ) .
Saying this new phase would have to be “ assumed with responsibility ” , Chavez called on the workers to wage an all - out struggle against the “ mafias ” rife in the management of state companies .
Chavez said he would approve a new law to allow workers to elect state company managers .
“ Every factory should be a school , in order , as Che said , to create not only briquettes and sheets and steel and aluminium , but also , above all , new men and women , a new society , a socialist society ” , he said .
Chavez also called for workers to organise an armed militia .
Worker battalions in each factory should be equipped with weapons “ in case anyone makes the mistake of messing with us ” .
Post - referendum offensive
These moves are part of a push to deepen the Venezuelan revolution after the February 15 , 2009 , referendum that voted to remove restrictions on the number of terms public officials could stand for election .
At stake was the future of the revolution .
Its central leader , Chavez , was unable to stand for re-election in 2012 under pre-existing regulation limiting a president to two terms .
The referendum initiative followed the November regional elections , in which the PSUV won a majority of governorships and mayoralties , yet lost some key states to the right - wing opposition .
The opposition used newly won offices to launch an assault on grassroots organisations and the government ’s pro-poor social programs .
The referendum was part of a counter - offensive to strengthen the organisation of the revolutionary forces and win another mandate for the revolution ’s radical program .
As part of the campaign , around 100,000 “ Yes committees ” were organised in factories and communities across the country .
The “ Yes ” campaign , which won nearly 55 % or 6.3 million votes , was a decisive mandate to deepen the revolution .
The campaign raised the level of organisation among the revolution ’s base — workers , students , peasants , the urban poor and other sectors .
After the referendum , Chavez called for the restructuring of the PSUV .
The Yes committees were to be converted into “ socialist committees ” as grassroots units of the party .
Special emphasis was put on strengthening the social fronts .
In early May , Chavez reshuffled the PSUV regional vice - presidents , appointing those seen as his closest collaborators .
Attacks on capital
With this momentum , the government gave clear signals of how it intended to fight the global economic crisis and falling oil prices .
Rather than a pact with the capitalist class , as some within the revolutionary movement had called for , Chavez launched an offensive — with state intervention into , and in some cases expropriation of , capitalist firms .
This followed previous nationalisations in oil , steel , telecommunications , electricity and other industries .
This is part of ensuring state ownership over strategic sectors of the economy , to direct such sectors towards social needs .
Rice - producing factories owned by Polar , Venezuela ’s largest company , were temporarily taken over by the military in February after it was found the company was deliberately evading government - imposed price controls .
Under Venezuelan law , food companies are obliged to direct 70 % of production towards selected products at a set price .
This is to ensure enough affordable food is available to the poor .
Venezuelanalysis.com said on March 11 : “ During a recent surge in land reform measures , Venezuela ’s National Institute of Lands ( INTI ) [ took ] public ownership of more than 5000 hectares of land claimed by wealthy families and multi-national corporations . ”
INTI said it would review tens of thousands more hectares as part of its drive to ensure fertile land is directed towards food production for social needs , rather than corporate profits .
On May 7 , the National Assembly passed a law ensuring state control over a range of activities connected to the oil industry , previously run by multinationals .
The next day , “ the government expropriated 300 boats , 30 barges , 39 terminals and docks , 5 dams and 13 workshops on Lake Maracaibo , where there are large crude oil reserves ” , a May 9 Venezuelanalysis.com article said .
On May 20 , it nationalised a gas compression plant in the eastern state of Monagas under the same law .
Five days before , the government took over a pasta processing plant owned by US multinational Cargill after government inspectors found it was not producing price - regulated pasta as required .
Food vice minister Rafael Coronado said that after the 90 - day intervention period , inspectors “ together with the workers , the communal councils ” would decide what to do with the company .
Revitalised working class
On April 30 , announcing plans to expropriate the La Gaviota sardine processing plant , Chavez told a gathering of workers that “ wherever you see a private company , a capitalist company that is exploiting the workers and is not complying with the laws , that is hoarding , denounce it , because the government is willing to intervene ” .
La Gaviota had been shut for two and a half months by workers ’ protests demanding the boss comply with the collective contract .
The same day , the government and workers took over the Cariaco sugar processing plant , the scene of similar protests .
Some of the companies Chavez said would be nationalised on May 21 have also faced industrial disputes .
Chavez had previously threatened to nationalise Ceramicas Carabobo if the bosses refused to come to an agreement with the workforce .
Workers at Matesi had called for the company be nationalised due to the unwillingness of management to sign a fair collective contract .
Matesi and Tavsa were part of the previously state - owned steel production complex , Sidor , before being sold off separately in the 1990s to Techint , an Argentine company .
After a 15 - month dispute over the signing of a collective contract , the government nationalised Sidor , which was majority owned by Techint , decrying the “ colonialist mentality ” of the bosses overseeing super - exploitative conditions .
However , in Matesi and Tavsa , negotiations over collective contracts continued .
Inspired by the Sidor example , where a collective contract was signed after nationalisation , Matesi workers demanded their factory also be nationalised .
This increase in industrial militancy has resulted in a number of factory occupations .
This includes the Tachira - based coffee processing plant Cafea , which was closed by its bosses .
Its workforce , together with unions and the local community , have occupied the plant and are demanding it be nationalised .
Venezuelans , Bolivians target Australian companies
By Stuart Munckton
May 30 , 2009 -- Venezuela 's President Hugo Chavez announced the nationalisation of six companies on May 21 .
“ There will be no discussion ” , he said .
Two of the companies to be nationalised , Orinoco Iron and Venprecar , are part owned by Australian mining giant BHP - Billiton .
The companies produce 3 million tons of briquetted iron a year , Venezuelanalysis.com said on May 22 .
The moves are part of restructuring the economy so it serves to needs of Venezuela ’s people — not the desire of major shareholders half way around the world to maximise profits .
When the corporate - owned media in Australia next repeat the standard lie that the repeatedly elected Chavez government is a dictatorship , remember that the media is not a disinterested bystander .
The Australian capitalist class has lost out due to Chavez ’s policies .
The Venezuelan people , however , are happy with the people - first socialist policies , which have halved of poverty rates since 2003 .
Chavez ’s approval rating , after more than a decade in office , is above 60 % , a May poll by a company considered sympathetic to the opposition found .
Venezuelanalysis.com said on May 15 that another poll by a company considered favourable to the government found most respondents believed that in one year , their personal economic situation would be “ better ” or “ much better ” .
This is an astonishing result given the global economic crisis .
In Bolivia , an indigenous community is seeking to force Australian mining company Republic Gold to abandon a projected gold mine in Amayapampa .
The community is angry that its land will be destroyed so profits can fill bloated bank accounts across the Pacific .
A company representative was kidnapped and forced to sign an agreement to stop the mine , although the company has since insisted it will go ahead .
Australian corporations such as Republic Gold and BHP have treated the Third World as nothing more than a source of resources and cheap labour to be exploited .
Unfortunately for them , this is beginning to change .

Although carbon dioxide emissions from industry are declining on both continents , those from transportation account for almost one - third of all greenhouse - gas emissions in the United States and 22 percent in European Union countries .
Across the globe , but especially in Europe , where European Union countries have pledged to reduce greenhouse gas production by 2012 under the United Nations ’ Kyoto protocol , there is great pressure to reduce car emissions .

The New York Times
Last year the European Environmental Agency warned that car trips to school  along with food importing and low - cost air travel  were growing phenomena with serious implications for greenhouse gases .
In the United States and in Europe , “ multiple threads are warping traditional school travel and making it harder for kids to walk , ” said Elizabeth Wilson , a transportation researcher at the Humphrey Institute of Public Affairs at the University of Minnesota .
Among those factors are a rise in car ownership ; one - child families , often leery of sending students off to school on their own ; cuts in school - bus service or charges for it as a result of school - budget cutbacks and fuel - price gyrations ; and the decline of neighborhood schools and the rise of school choice , meaning that students often live farther from where they learn .
Worse still , said Roger L. Mackett , professor at the Center for Transport Studies at University College in London , there is growing evidence that children whose parents drive a lot will become car - dependent adults .
“ You ’re getting children into a lifelong habit , ” he said .
In Lecco , car use has proved a tenacious habit even though the piedibus has caught on .
“ Cars rule , ” said Augosto Piazza , the founder of the city ’s program , an elfin man with shining blue eyes , a bouncing gait and a yellow vest .
As he “ drove ” along a bus route on a recent morning , store owners waved fondly to the familiar packs of jabbering children .
Yet as they pulled up to Carducci School , dozens of private cars were parked helter - skelter for dropoffs in the small plaza outside as gaggles of mothers chatted on the sidewalk nearby .
“ I have two kids who go to different schools , plus their backpacks are so heavy , ” said Manuela Corbetta , a mother in a black jacket and sunglasses , twirling her car keys as she explained why her children do not make the 15 - minute trek .
“ Sometimes they have 10 notebooks , so walking really is n’t practical . ”
Well , it saves a lot of time , because they close down the entire intersection for all traffic it seems ...
They are building a new cyclist tunnel under a major highway in my city , which takes over a year to build , just because traffic keeps running on the roads .
The widening of that road here from 4 to 6 lanes takes like 4 - 5 years for only 2 km .
Japanese researchers monitoring the activity of giant jellyfish in Chinese waters are warning of a potentially historic and catastrophic invasion this year .
Marine surveys conducted in late June have revealed alarming numbers of Nomura 's jellyfish -- massive creatures that grow up to 2 meters ( 6 ft 7 in ) in diameter and weigh as much as to 220 kilograms ( about 450 lbs ) -- lurking in the Yellow Sea and East China Sea .
The researchers warn that ocean currents may bring swarms of the monster jellies to Japan , which has been plagued by similar invasions in recent years .
Nomura 's jellyfish , 2007 ( Photo : Sankei )
Based on what they have seen so far , the researchers warn this year 's onslaught of Nomura 's jellyfish ( Nemopilema nomurai , or Echizen kurage in Japanese ) could deliver a massive blow to Japan 's fishing industry , rivaling even the devastating 2005 deluge that caused tens of billions of yen ( hundreds of millions of dollars ) in damage nationwide .
The surveys are being conducted by a team led by Shinichi Ue , a professor of biological oceanography at Hiroshima University who also chairs a government research committee tasked with developing technology to predict and control jellyfish explosions .
Ue has been monitoring the population density of Nomura 's jellyfish in the southern Yellow Sea and northern East China Sea since 2006 .
Between June 20 and 24 , 2009 , Ue 's team observed numerous specimens with umbrellas measuring 10 to 50 centimeters across , and they calculated an average distribution of 2.14 jellyfish per 100 square meters .
This figure is more than 200 times higher than the 0.01 jellyfish per 100 square meters observed in the same region in 2008 .
It is also nearly triple the 0.77 jellyfish per 100 square meters observed in 2007 , when the fishing industry in the Sea of Japan suffered widespread damage .
Nomura 's jellyfish , 2007 ( Photo : Sankei )
To make matters worse , this year 's swarms appear to be taking a more direct and southerly route to Japan , unlike in 2007 when the jellyfish appeared to take a more northerly route , approaching the Sea of Japan coast from the direction of Korea .
According to the researchers , the ocean currents could bring unprecedented numbers of Nomura 's jellyfish to Japan 's Pacific coast , which typically sees far fewer of the monster blobs than the Sea of Japan coast .
Nomura 's jellyfish typically bloom in Chinese waters in spring , and they mature into adults as ocean currents slowly carry them north .
By July , when the first swarms reach Tsushima ( just north of the southern island of Kyushu ) , many jellyfish are as large as sumo wrestlers .
At this size , it only takes about 5 or 10 of them to destroy a commercial fishing net .
In addition to damaging nets , the giant jellyfish are blamed for killing other fish with their venom , lowering the quality and quantity of catches , increasing the risk of capsizing trawlers , and stinging fishermen .
In 2005 , the fishing industry reported over 100,000 cases of jellyfish - related damage nationwide .
At the peak of the invasion that year , an estimated 300 to 500 million monster jellyfish passed through the Tsushima Strait into the Sea of Japan each day .

U2 and Bono ’s long - held commitment to “ save the planet ” has come into question after it emerged they have a carbon footprint big enough to fly the band to Mars and back .
The Irish rockers campaign to fight poverty and AIDS in Africa and Bono called on the world ’s population to take better care of the earth .
Speaking in Tokyo last year he said : “ My prayer is that we become better in looking after our planet . ”

However , according to an environmentalists ’ website , the band ’s 100 - date 18 - month world tour will see the multi-millionaires clock up an incredible 70,000 air miles in their fuel - guzzling private jet .
The £ 90 m U2360 tour also features three 390 - tonne stages criss - crossing the globe , along with 200 crew and backstage staff .
The opening night in Barcelona ’s Nou Camp last week featured the space station - style stage and satellite link - up with the International Space Station .
Perhaps appropriately , the tour ’s carbon footprint can also be measured in space terms , with their colossal emissions of up to 65,000 tonnes of CO2 enough to fly Bono , the Edge , Adam Clayton and Larry Mullen Jr from earth to the planet Mars — and back .
The figure was calculated by experts from carbonfootprint.com , a company which specialises in assessing environmental damage .
U2 ’s CO2 emissions are the equivalent of the waste created by 6,500 average British or Irish people in an entire year , or equal to leaving a standard 100 watt lightbulb on for 159,000 years .
The band ’s vast emissions are dozens of times bigger than Madonna ’s carbon footprint on her 2006 world tour , despite her extravagant demands and 250 staff .
She produced 1,635 tonnes in air transport .
U2 ’s PR agency RMP did not return a request asking if the band were buying carbon offsets to contribute towards the damage of their enormous emissions .
Carbonfootprint.com ’s environment consultant Helen Roberts said : “ The carbon footprint generated by U2’s 44 concerts this year is equal to carbon created by the four band members travelling the 34.125 million miles from Earth to Mars in a passenger plane .
“ You also have to add the carbon emissions from the same number of concerts again next year .
“ Just looking at the 44 concerts this year , the band will create enough carbon to fly all 90,000 people attending one of their Wembley concerts to Dublin .
To offset this year ’s carbon emissions , U2 would need to plant 20,118 trees . ”
Pollution experts said U2’s 44 concerts in Europe and North America this year will produce 20,117.50 tonnes of CO2 emissions , unless the band unexpectedly decide to ship to equipment to the US , in which case the footprint would be 5091.41 tonnes .
Bono and his bandmates will generate 64.42 tonnes of CO2 by flying 22,037 miles to this year ’s gigs in their private jet , currently stationed at Nice airport , near their Cote d’Azur holiday villas in the south of France .
Most of the carbon footprint comes from transporting the three 390 - tonne stages , using 3,286.60 tonnes of CO2 , with another 916.07 tonnes for extra equipment .
Next year they are expected to play 20 concerts in North America in June and July and 20 dates in Europe in August and September .

Users taking the purity pledge promise to refrain from sex until marriage A UK software developer has released a " purity ring " application for Apple 's iPhone .
Users can take a purity pledge - a promise to refrain from sex until marriage - and then display a spinning purity ring graphic on the phone .
The application goes on sale at the official App Store for £ 0.59 ( $ 0.99 ) .
Wall Entertainment , the firm behind the application , said it was taking an old idea and applying it to a new technological medium .
" It 's a novel application , " the company 's director , Henry Bennett told the BBC .
" Kids are engaging with their phones in a way their parents never did , so this is a way of them showing they have taken the pledge . "
Started in the US , the Silver Ring Thing ( SRT ) is the organisation behind the purity ring symbol and was founded by Denny and Amy Pattyn in 1996 .
It was their response to what they saw as a worrying rise in the number of pregnancies among teenage girls .
In the UK , SRT is based in West Sussex and run by a group of volunteers .
But Mr Bennett said there was - for now - no link between SRT and the iPhone purity ring .
" We 've contacted the SRT to let them know about our app and we 're now waiting to see whether they will endorse this product . "
While there are millions of people who have taken the purity pledge in the US , in Britain the figure is far smaller .
Mr Bennett said that they were waiting for sales figures from the Apple App Store , but said it would be " interesting " to see how well it sells in America .

It looks to me like the Pentagon's " target country " is the United States of America , and they are doing a damn fine job !
Jeff Gannon and Talon News as exposed on DailyKos over the past few days are probably a NORTHCOM Psy Ops operation .
We know the Bush administration promotes failure .
Even so , Eberhart 's promotion to NORTHCOM is shocking .
Eberhart was in charge of NORAD on 9/11 - something for you conspiracy buffs to contemplate !
NORAD failed to defend the US against the 9/11 attacks under circumstances that remain cloudy .
The 9/11 attacks were then used as the justification " proving " the need for NORTHCOM , the first US command since the Posse Comitatus Act of 1878 , and expanding the role of the military within our borders - and Eberhart was put in charge .
Even scarier , if martial law is ever imposed in the United States , NORTHCOM will be tasked with implementing it against the American people .
In the meanwhile , Eberhart is preparing the way with Psy Ops and datamining and surveillance using the services Science Applications International Corporation ( SAIC ) .
Evidence for NORTHCOM 's role in coordinating US Psy Ops against the American people is building .
Strongest evidence came from an advertisement to contractors documented at ParaPolitics :
An advertisement for an " influence operations specialist " with a Top Secret security clearance for the U.S. Air Force appeared on the Web sites of military contractors several weeks ago .
The position would " coordinate [ Air Force ] inputs to NORAD - NORTHCOM influence operations , " according to the ad .
It defined those operations to include " PSYOPS themes and messages for use in foreign countries , public affairs themes and messages , " as well as " deception plans . " . . .
One section of the Air Force job description said the influence operations specialist was to coordinate with the Army 's 4th Psychological Operations Group ( POG ) , as well as with NORTHCOM public affairs , " deception planners " and other agencies .
Kelly said the influence operations specialist might well interact with the Army 's 4th POG , a normally secretive unit that drew attention in 2000 when it was reported that it had made arrangements with CNN and NPR to send them interns to learn the news business .
. . .
Last autumn , the Pentagon awarded a $ 300,000 contract to Science Applications International Corp. ( SAIC ) to design an " effective strategic influence " campaign to combat global terror .
SAIC is one of the competitors for the Air Force contract that includes the influence operations specialist position .
The company would not comment on the contract or the position .
Nor would Titan Corp. , another competitor for the contract .
Now , follow closely !
SAIC promoted the false Iraq weapons threat through its pundit vice president David Kay , who was then appointed by George Tennet to find the non-existent WMDs ( despite being fired by UNSCOM in 1992 for falsifying evidence of Iraqi WMDs ) .
SAIC carried on its payroll members of the Iraqi Reconstruction and Development Council in advance of the Iraq war and used them to promote false intelligence and plant stories in the US and foreign media ( although Allawi and Chalabi were funded directly by the Pentagon through their political parties ) .
The IRDC were flown into Baghdad immediately after the war and appointed to all senior positions in government ministries .
And SAIC runs the Voice of the New Iraq radio station .
Naturally , with the success of its Iraq regime change , disinformation and reconstruction strategy , SAIC is the ideal company to bring the same " values " to America .
In addition to Psy Ops , SAIC is now bidding contracts for voter registration and electronic voting systems .
And you thought Halliburton and Carlyle Group were scary !
Eberhart has been working with SAIC , and others to implement the military 's psy ops strategies within the United States .
Effectively , they have decided that the US public is the enemy , and that it is right and proper for the military to use its Psy Ops methods to subvert the public .
In December 2003 the New York Times uncovered award of a contract to SAIC to " create effective strategic influence " in the war on terror .
In terms of the agenda for martial law , it appears that NORTHCOM is responsible for leading efforts to datamine against the American public .
The Los Angeles Times had a story on NORTHCOM which provides frightening hints as to Eberhart 's real scope and purpose :
" We must start thinking differently , " says Air Force Gen. Ralph E. " Ed " Eberhart , the newly installed commander of Northern Command , the military 's homeland security arm .
Before 9/11 , he says , the military and intelligence systems were focused on " the away game " and not properly focused on " the home game . "
" Home , " of course , is the United States . . . .
" We are not going to be out there spying on people , " Eberhart told PBS ' NewsHour in September .
But , he said , " We get information from people who do . "
Some of that information increasingly comes not from the FBI or those charged with civilian law enforcement but from a Pentagon organization established last year , the Counterintelligence Field Activity ( CIFA ) .
. . .
CIFA , moreover , has been given a domestic " data mining " mission : figuring out a way to process massive sets of public records , intercepted communications , credit card accounts , etc. , to find " actionable intelligence . "
It is already gathering the data [ PDF file ] .
Every time you use your credit card , General Eberhart is learning more about you !
[ TIA ] could potentially allow the government to track the routine activities of Americans , from travel plans to credit card transactions to medical records .
....
Though some DARPA officials envisioned turning the system over to civilian law enforcement , it 's clear that military officials were keenly interested in the technology .
In November 2002 Maj. Gen. Dale Meyerrose , chief information technology officer for NORTHCOM , said : " I 've been to [ visit ] Admiral Poindexter .
He and I are talking about TIA . "
Note the name Poindexter ?
Would that be the same Admiral Poindexter who earned seven felony convictions in the Iran / Contra debacle ?
Of course it would !
On Thursday , February 14 , 2002 , John Poindexter was appointed by President George W. Bush to lead the Information Assurance Office at the Department of Defense 's Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency .
Despite Mr. Poindexter 's criminal record of lying to Congress , the President thinks he is " an outstanding American and an outstanding citizen who has done a very good job in what he has done for our country , serving in the military " .
It is at the IAO that Mr. Poindexter began work on Total Information Awareness , a plan to watch Americans like the Stasi watched East Germans -- but using technology this time , instead of people .
Mr. Poindexter 's friend Edward Aldridge told FOXNews that " John had a real passion for [ Total Information Awareness ] . "
Shortly after news reports about Total Information Awareness began surfacing , Senator Chuck Schumer of New York urged Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld to find a replacement .
" If we need a big brother , John Poindexter is the last guy on the list that I would choose , " Schumer told ABC's This Week program .
NORTHCOM may also be running some black ops commandos within the USA according to speculation .
Well , America was a nice little experiment in democracy while it lasted .
Glad I 'm over on this side of the Atlantic today !
As business slows , brothel seeking to add male prostitutes
Beyond the Sun Nevada Brothel Association
( UPDATED STORY : Applications roll in for brothel ’s male prostitution jobs )
Business is so slow at the Shady Lady Ranch that the owner of the Nye County brothel wants to add a few shady men to her roster .
Bobbi Davis , the owner of the bordello located about 150 miles northwest of Las Vegas , is set to start interviewing men who aspire to be prostitutes .
“ We ’ll start out with one or two , ” Davis said , adding that she is “ looking for men in their early 30s to mid-50s ” who are in good shape and want to entertain women .
The applicants might soon even be able to shop their resumes around .
George Flint , spokesman for the Nevada Brothel Association , said the ailing economy has four other bordellos considering the possibility of adding men .
But Flint does n’t think the idea will work .
Joe Conforte tried it 30 years ago when he owned the Mustang Ranch outside Reno “ and found it was not a viable concept , ” Flint said .
Flint said the concept also is “ probably socially unacceptable . ”
Davis disagrees .
She wants to try it out and see what kind of reaction she gets .
“ We feel this is an untapped resource , ” she said .
When Heidi Fleiss , “ the Hollywood madam , ” talked about opening a bordello for women customers , it generated worldwide publicity , Davis noted .
But Fleiss could n’t get a license because of a felony conviction .
Davis said the charges for the new services will be based on the time spent because women do n’t want “ quickies – wham bam , thank you madam . ”
The minimum would be two hours , probably at a cost of $ 500 , she said .
Three hours would cost $ 700 and four hours , $ 1,000 .
An overnight stay would be $ 2,000 .
Flint cautioned that the administrative code in Nye County would have to be changed for this to work .
The regulations regarding prostitution refer to female body parts only .
“ All of the Nevada Administrative Code is built on the female anatomy , ” said Flint .
Eve Harrington ( Anne Baxter ) is waiting backstage to meet her idol , talented but aging Broadway star Margo Channing ( Bette Davis ) .
It seems innocent enough as Eve explains that she has seen Margo in EVERY performance of her current play .
Margo and her friends take Eve under their wing but only theatre critic Addison DeWitt ( George Sanders ) sees through Eve 's evil plan , which is to take Margo 's parts and her fiancé , Bill Simpson ( Gary Merrill ) too .

TEGUCIGALPA ( Reuters ) - Honduras ’
Congress approved a decree on Wednesday to crack down on opposition during a nightly curfew imposed after the recent coup .
The decree , covering the curfew period , allows security forces to hold suspects for more than 24 hours without charge , and formalizes the prohibition of people ’s right to free association at night .
A national report on Indigenous social and economic trends has shown a worsening in the gap between Indigenous and non-Indigenous Australians on child abuse .
The report titled Overcoming Indigenous Disadvantage has been released by Indigenous Affairs Minister , Jenny Macklin , at the Council of Australian Governments ( COAG ) meeting in Darwin .
It is compiled every two years by the productivity commission and measures 50 indicators of disadvantage between Indigenous and non-Indigenous Australians .
The latest report shows there has been no improvement in 80 per cent of the economic and social indicators .
It reveals Indigenous children are six times as likely to be abused than non-Indigenous children .
Since 2003 , this gap has widened from being four times as likely .
Prime Minister Kevin Rudd says all governments will have to redouble their efforts in response .
" This report on Indigenous disadvantage is a devastating report , " he said .
Neglect and violence
It shows the rate of substantiated notifications for child abuse or neglect for Indigenous children has more than doubled since 1999 - 2000 , from 16 per 1000 children to 35 per 1000 children .
At the same time , the rate for non-Indigenous children has risen from five to six per 1000 .
The report says 41 out of every 1000 Indigenous children were subject to care and protection orders , while five out of every 1000 non-Indigenous children were under similar orders .
Indigenous policy professor John Altman says the child abuse gap increase probably reflects the ongoing affects of the marginalisation of Indigenous people .
" Relatively , Indigenous people live in greater poverty , have poorer housing , a poorer education and poorer employment prospects , " Professor Altman said .
" And the fact that those gaps exists probably explains to a large extent the high levels of child abuse . "
Other violence - related data in the report showed poor outcomes for Indigenous people .
Indigenous people were hospitalised as a result of domestic violence at a rate 34 times higher than non-Indigenous people .
The Indigenous homicide rate was seven times higher than the non-Indigenous rate .
Aboriginal people were 13 times more likely to end up in jail as non-Indigenous people .
The imprisonment rate for Indigenous women and men has increased by 46 and 27 per cent respectively since 2000 .
No progress
It says Indigenous literacy and numeracy levels have not lifted .
The proportion of Indigenous 19 - year - olds who finished their high school studies in 2007 was only 36 per cent , compared with 74 per cent for their non-Indigenous counterparts .
There was somewhat better news in employment data , with the percentage of Indigenous people employed growing from 43 per cent to 48 per cent between 2001 and 2006 .
However , the gap between the Indigenous and non-Indigenous workforce remained at 24 percentage points .
Mr Rudd says trying to find new ways of closing the gap will be a major focus of today 's COAG meeting , which Indigenous leaders have been invited to attend .
" The fact that despite all the efforts in the past , when it comes to such basic things as literacy and numeracy standards , that we have achieved no effective progress , means that we have to redouble and treble our efforts to make an impact . "
The Productivity Commissioner , Gary Banks , says some economic indicators have improved but not the social measures .
" In many areas we 're still observing no change , " he said .
The Government is confident its Closing the Gap reforms will see improvements .
Statistics have a way of being cold and unsympathetic to the plight of the numbers they represent .
That is why when we hear that our national unemployment rate is 8.9 percent , there is little cause for alarm from the headline .
Yet when we parse the data we realize that 25,000,000 Americans are unemployed or underemployed with half a million more coming our way this Friday .
The employment situation on an aggregate basis simply does not reflect the devastation of this current recession .
A recession that can destroy $ 11.2 trillion in American household wealth is not a common recession .
It is the case that there are many MSA ( metropolitan statistical areas ) measured by the BLS that show some regions of our country are already in a deep and profound depression .
Out of the top 20 MSAs with high unemployment rates we find that 12 are in California :
Now why does this matter ?
First , there is a misconception with California .
What is portrayed on the media is this all powerful and extremely wealthy state ( well , maybe before our budget flew off a cliff at least ) .
Yet the reality is more akin to a banana republic run by a small ruling elite .
The next two groups are those struggling to remain in the middle class while the other half of the state barely makes ends meet .
That is why we find that 12 of the 20 top unemployment rates come from California .
California now has the highest unemployment rate since World War II coming in at 11 percent .
Yet as you can see from the charts above , many areas are already seeing depression level unemployment .
Let us take a look at a few samples :
The El Centro MSA has always had high unemployment rate .
In fact , there was a month in the early 1990s where the unemployment rate was higher than 40 percent !
Imagine that .
A rate that is usually on par with a war torn country .
Keep in mind that this is for the headline unemployment rate and not the U - 6 rate which is approximately twice as high for many areas .
The chart above shows that El Centro has faced some tough times before .
You will see this pattern emerge again with Merced California :
Why the ups and downs ?
These areas have a large group of migrant seasonal workers so the up and down trend is typical .
What is n’t typical is the blasting through the 20 percent mark .
As you can see , during the 1990s unemployment remained high , fell for the most part of the decade and has shot up due to our current recession .
In fact , for Merced the rate went from 10 percent to 20 percent all within a year .
That is astounding .
The early 1990s recession hit California hard .
Ironically this recession also had a housing bubble component but nothing coming close to the current housing bubble .
Yet what we are seeing with this current recession is other parts of the country hitting depression level unemployment rates and these areas braced tough times in the past much better .
Let us look at the Bend Oregon MSA :
With the chart above you can see that the 1990s recession pushed unemployment slightly above 10 percent .
The 2001 recession did n’t even get unemployment into the double - digits .
But just look at how quickly and severely the unemployment rate has gone up .
No time since World War II has the unemployment rate shot up so fast .
In the Bend MSA for example , the unemployment rate was 4.8 percent in October of 2007 and now stands at a stunning 17 percent , more than 3 times the rate from 17 months ago .
Some areas have never seen double - digit unemployment in a generation and are now seeing it for the first time .
Take the Elkhart Indiana MSA :
You see the same pattern as the Bend Oregon chart .
You see the early 1990s recession take rates up near the 10 percent mark .
And after 1992 , the unemployment rate remained stable for 15 years .
In fact , over this 15 year time frame the average rate came in at 3.8 percent , a stunningly low rate .
Even as early as April of 2008 , one year ago the unemployment rate stood at 5.1 percent .
Today the unemployment rate is at a whopping 18.8 percent .
The unemployment rate surged over 13 percent in one year !
Now what happened here ?
First in Elkhart County a large number of people have been struck hard by the rise in fuel cost .
Many jobs that were lost came from the recreational vehicle industry .
Of course the RV is a symbol of an old America .
An America with access to cheap fuel and easy money .
This is not the kind of America that is ready to adjust to the new austerity being experienced by millions .
These areas are going to need to retool and gear up for a new world .
As we are now seeing , oil prices are once again on the rise nearing $ 70 a barrel .
Home prices are still too expensive for most Americans who are seeing wage cuts or losing their jobs .
The reality is , the market volatility or green shoot talk is good for headlines , but until we see a stabilization in the unemployment rate there is no reason to talk about a bottom .
The Elkhart example is a perfect illustration of a community that was based on an industry that will no longer cut it in the U.S.
What industry will fill its place ?
Apply this same situation to a Detroit for example and you see a tough situation for the next few months .
More job losses are coming in areas where many people feel they are living in depression level situations .

Although Sony has categorically denied that a PlayStation 3 redesign , price drop , or reconfiguration would be in the future , rumors and " leaked details " keep popping up about PlayStation hardware revisions .
This week 's
Sony hardware buzz comes in the form of new photos leaked to the internet by factory workers producing what looks to be a slimmed down variation of the console .
The photos , which were first posted on a Japanese gaming blog , , show components of a PlayStation 3 console with a much smaller overall clearance .
Although the depth of the casing looks about the same , the comparatively shorter height of the device suggests a slim variation , similar to what we saw with PlayStation 2 Slim and the PSP Slim .
Daily Fix Video May 14th,2009
This news and more in the Daily Fix . - E3 Rumors
- A New MGS ?
- Warfare 2 Details
- Recession Victims
In theory , a PlayStation 3 Slim would fall into line with Sony 's previous product trends , but this bout of " evidence " is highly suspect .
For one , the device appears to feature a textured plastic finish , similar to the PS2 , however , Sony 's design trend with the PlayStation 3 and PSP product series has been focused on gloss or semi-gloss finishes .
Additionally , the typeset on the device and packaging is oddly similar to that of the PS2 - era , straying from the new PS3 font despite the fact that it is used in all of the console 's branding and promotional materials since launch .
Still , the photos have caused quite a stir around the web .
We 'll just have to wait and see if Sony makes a move on the PS3 Slim .

The Formula One Teams ' Association announced on Thursday night that it is setting up a breakaway championship .
Following a four - hour meeting at Renault 's Enstone factory , the eight members of FOTA - Ferrari , McLaren , Renault , BMW Sauber , Toyota , Brawn , Red Bull Racing and Scuderia Toro Rosso - said they had grown frustrated with the FIA 's stance against the organisation , and had no option but to create a series of their own .
" The teams cannot continue to compromise on the fundamental values of the sport and have declined to alter their original conditional entries to the 2010 World Championship , " said a statement issued by FOTA after the meeting .
" These teams therefore have no alternative other than to commence the preparation for a new Championship which reflects the values of its participants and partners .
This series will have transparent governance , one set of regulations , encourage more entrants and listen to the wishes of the fans , including offering lower prices for spectators worldwide , partners and other important stakeholders .
" The major drivers , stars , brands , sponsors , promoters and companies historically associated with the highest level of motorsport will all feature in this new series . "
F1 teams were given until Friday evening to remove the conditions attached to the provisional entries they posted earlier this month , or risk being left off the grid in 2010 .
FIA president Max Mosley wrote to the teams yesterday offering them some of the concessions that they wanted to see regarding governance of the sport , but made it clear that he was sticking to plans for the introduction of a budget cap .
In his letter , Mosley also urged the teams to sign up to the championship before sorting out the final version of the regulations and a redrafted Concorde Agreement .
In response to that letter , the teams met at Renault 's Enstone headquarters on Thursday evening for lengthy talks , where they finally decided that there was no way a compromise deal could be reached with the FIA .
The teams expressed frustration that their efforts to try and improve F1 had been rebuffed by the governing body and the sport 's commercial rights holder .
" Since the formation of FOTA last September the teams have worked together and sought to engage the FIA and commercial rights holder , to develop and improve the sport , " said the statement .
" Unprecedented worldwide financial turmoil has inevitably placed great challenges before the F1 community .
FOTA is proud that it has achieved the most substantial measures to reduce costs in the history of our sport .
" In particular the manufacturer teams have provided assistance to the independent teams , a number of which would probably not be in the sport today without the FOTA initiatives .
The FOTA teams have further agreed upon a substantial voluntary cost reduction that provides a sustainable model for the future .
" Following these efforts all the teams have confirmed to the FIA and the commercial rights holder that they are willing to commit until the end of 2012 .
" The FIA and the commercial rights holder have campaigned to divide FOTA .
" The wishes of the majority of the teams are ignored .
Furthermore , tens of millions of dollars have been withheld from many teams by the commercial rights holder , going back as far as 2006 .
Despite this and the uncompromising environment , FOTA has genuinely sought compromise . "
The announcement by FOTA looks certain to overshadow the British Grand Prix , which takes place at Silverstone for the final time this weekend and which Mosley is expected to attend tomorrow .
With FOTA 's stance now seemingly leaving no room for a deal possible , it 's likely that more new teams will be added to the FIA 's 2010 Formula 1 entry list .
The inclusion of Ferrari , Red Bull Racing and Scuderia Toro Rosso on that roster remains open to debate , however , with the FIA claiming that the teams committed themselves to F1 in a deal agreed several years ago .

Three advocacy groups have asked Google to commit to protect the privacy of readers in its book search service , which is poised for a major expansion under a pending class - action settlement .
The groups , the Electronic Frontier Foundation , the American Civil Liberties Union and the Samuelson Law , Technology and Public Policy Clinic at the University of California , Berkeley , have asked Google to limit the data it collects about users ’ reading habits , to commit to protect reader records by handing them over only in response to subpoenas or court orders , and to put into effect measures giving users control of their data .
The groups made the requests in a letter to Eric Schmidt , Google ’s chief executive .
In an accompanying blog post , the groups are urging people to send e-mail messages to Mr. Schmidt demanding privacy protections .
“ We ’ve asked that Google only respond to legitimate warrants when the government comes calling , for example , and we ’ve asked that they not share your private reading data with third parties without your permission , among other things , ” the groups wrote .
On its public policy blog , Google said it shared many of the privacy goals raised by the advocacy groups .
But Google also said that its expanded book search service would not be built until an landmark settlement of a copyright class action filed by authors and publishers is approved by a court .
( That settlement , which will allow Google to build an expansive digital library , has attracted criticism and is currently being scrutinized by the Justice Department for possible antitrust problems . )
Because the service has yet to be built , it was premature to draft a detailed privacy policy it , the company said .
“ The services authorized by the agreement have n’t been built or even designed yet , ” Dan Clancy , engineering director for Google Books , wrote .
“ That means it ’s very difficult ( if not impossible ) to draft a detailed privacy policy .
While we know that our eventual product will build in privacy protections — like always giving users clear information about privacy , and choices about what if any data they share when they use our services — we do n’t yet know exactly how this all will work .
We do know that whatever we ultimately build will protect readers ’ privacy rights , upholding the standards set long ago by booksellers and by the libraries whose collections are being opened to the public through this settlement . ”
Cindy Cohn , legal director at the Electronic Frontier Foundation , said that she decided to go ahead with the public campaign after months of discussions with Google .
She said that Google ’s response was insufficient and that the company should commit to guarantees in writing before the settlement is reviewed by a court in October .
And she dismissed the argument that Google could not make privacy guarantees until the product was built .
“ Whether to hand data only in response to a warrant or not is not a tech decision , ” she said in an interview .
“ Whether you are holding data for 30 days or longer is not a tech decision . ”
Other groups , including the American Library Association , have also raised concerns about privacy and have asked the court to exercise vigorous oversight of the settlement .
James Joyner thinks the coverage of MJ ’s death is over the top , and I completely agree .
I will , however , note that while the MJ coverage is over the top , it still pales in comparison to the three day self - absorbed wankfest that followed Tim Russert ’s death .
Also , via Michael Calderone , we learn that Meet the Press is bleeding out , losing close to a half million viewers since MC Rove ’s dance partner took over from the late Russert .
Clearly the bizarre strategy of packing every show with right - wing pundits and spewing right - wing talking points immediately following an election where the country told the Republican party to go to hell is paying dividends .
Clearly what Meet the Press needs is more appearances by President Gingrich .

There was a time when being the runt of the litter was considered a bad thing .
( Wilbur , the pig co-star of the title spider character in " Charlotte 's Web , " was almost killed for being a runt , as any children 's literature fan will remember . )
But nowadays , tiny dogs are fashionable -- as evidenced by the hotly contested Guinness World Records for smallest dog by height and smallest dog by length .
Scooter , above , is a 6 - month - old Maltese whose owner , Cheryl McKnight of New Zealand , believes will one day hold the title of smallest dog by height .
Scooter is just over 3 inches tall , measured from his feet to the top of his shoulder blade .
Although he 's still a puppy , McKnight says he has n't grown at all since he was 2 months old , and she believes he wo n't grow any taller -- certainly no taller than the current recordholder , an American Chihuahua .
McKnight 's sister breeds Maltese and gave Scooter to her as a gift .
The tiny animal eats from an egg cup and apparently has his share of challenges as a result of his stature .
" I ca n't take him for a walk or put a leash on him , " McKnight told the New Zealand Herald .
Another diminutive puppy vying for smallest - dog status is Tom Thumb , a Jack Russell terrier - Chihuahua mix puppy from Scotland .
Tom Thumb is even younger than Scooter , but his owners , Susan and Archie Thomson , are convinced he 'll still be shorter than the current record - holder for smallest dog by length when he 's an adult .
At three weeks old , Tom Thumb measured less than 4 inches from nose tip to tail tip ; Archie Thomson , a hobby breeder of Chihuahuas , told the Daily Mail he doubted the pup would grow " much bigger than an inch or two more . "
The current record - holder , another American Chihuahua named Heaven Sent Brandy , is fully grown and measures 6 inches long .
Coding and Testing : Testers and Programmers Working Together
Lisa Crispin , http://lisacrispin.com
One of my favorite quotes from Elisabeth Hendrickson is this : " Testing is not a phase ! "
We have to stop thinking of " testing " as some separate activity , removed from the rest of software development .
It takes a village to produce a high - quality software product , and we can't do it from isolated functional silos .
The idea of driving development with tests has been popularized by the agile development movement .
It 's not a new idea , but it seems to finally be taking hold on a large scale .
The fact is that testing and coding are inseparable components of software development .
We get the best results with testers and programmers work closely together .
How can we deliver real value to the business frequently ?
How can we know how much testing is enough ?
Let 's look at how testers and programmers collaborate to produce high - quality software .
Driving Development with Tests
In agile development , we write high - level test cases before coding even starts .
This is a good practice no matter what development methodology you 're using .
Testers are skilled at helping business experts clarify their requirements for a particular feature or piece of functionality , and using those to provide the big picture for what the code needs to do .
When coding starts , it 's time for testers to turn the examples of desired behavior that they 've elicited from customers into executable tests that will let the team know when the functionality is " done " .
If these tests are n't automatable , the programmers are unlikely to actually run them .
However , as we write tests that will be automated , we also think ahead to the important exploratory testing we 'll need to do as coding is completed .
Throughout this process , one or more testers will work together with one or more programmers to write tests , write code , write more tests , write more code , test some more , as many tiny iterations as needed until the appropriate business value is achieved .
When your team plans releases and iterations , think about the tests you 'll need to help guide coding .
Write appropriate task cards to write the test cases , automate them , and do the manual exploratory testing .
Write appropriate task cards to design code for ease of test automation .
A universal complaint among software teams is " we never have time to finish testing " and " testing gets squeezed to the end " .
The usual cause ?
The team plans too much work in one iteration .
Testers must actively participate in the planning .
Your team needs to be realistic and plan only the functionality that they can code and fully test before the end of the iteration .
No story is done until it 's tested !
Start Simply
As a tester , I am naturally attracted to the scenarios where the code may be vulnerable - the edge cases , boundary conditions , and soap opera - style sequences .
But to help my teammates write code , I have to start with the happy path .
Write a test that shows that basic core functionality works correctly .
Depending on your programming expertise and the tool you 're using , you may automate the test yourself , or the programmer may write the fixture that automates it .
The programmer may look at the test and realize she has misunderstood the requirement , or maybe she thinks the tester has .
This is great , because it means the tester and programmer have to talk .
Tests that encourage communication are the best kind .
The programmer writes code until the test can execute and pass .
Now it 's time to think of more complex test cases , and wander off into the potentially smelly areas of the code .
Note areas that might be interesting for later exploratory testing .
Remember the purpose of these tests : to guide coding .
Get the basics working , and add more tests as appropriate later on .
Assess Risk
No matter how much time we have for testing software , we can always use it up and wish for more .
We never have enough time , and short iterations of agile development add to the challenge .
Some quick risk analysis will help you decide where to focus your testing efforts .
List all the potential risks associated with the code you 're writing , including those that go beyond functionality , such as security , performance and usability .
Use the likelihood of a failure and the impact of that failure to help decide what tests to do first , and leave testing of lower - risk areas to last .
Small Chunks , Thin Slices
" Incremental and iterative " is the name of the game when you want to deliver value frequently , maintaining a sustainable pace .
When my team faces a complex story , we spend some time breaking it down into what we call " steel threads " , and others call " thin slices " or " tracer bullets " .
We start with a small , end - to - end path through the code which can be coded and tested , and tests can be automated for it .
Once the coding and testing are complete on that small increment , we add on the next chunk of functionality .
Let 's look at a team that is developing software for an Internet retail website .
They 're starting on this story :
As a shopper , I want to choose the shipping option for my order , and see the shipping cost , so I can decide which shipping option I want .
The team may decide that their first slice through this code is to present only one shipping option on the UI , calculate the cost for that option , and display it on the next page .
They might even take the UI out of the equation , and focus first on passing the shipping option , destination and item weight to an API which will return the estimated shipping cost .
That functionality can easily be tested " behind the GUI " , with a tool such as Fit or FitNesse .
Later " slices " add more shipping options , flesh out the UI , provide a way to change the shipping option , and navigate to the payment page .
Each small increment is produced by testers and programmers working together , writing tests that demonstrate correct code behavior , and code that makes those tests pass .
Coding and Testing Progress Together
Let 's look at an example of how a tester and programmer might work on a user story or feature .
Patty Programmer and Tammy Tester are working on a user story to calculate the shipping cost of an item , based on weight and destination postal code .
Tammy writes a simple test case in a tabular format that is supported by their Fit - based test tool :
Weight Destination Postal Code Cost 5 kg 80104 $ 7.25
Meanwhile , Patty writes the code to send the inputs to the shipping cost API and to get the calculated cost .
She shows Tammy her unit tests , which all pass .
Tammy thinks Patty 's tests look ok , and they agree Patty will check in the code .
Next , Patty checks in a fixture to automate Tammy 's tests .
Patty calls
Tammy over to show her that the first simple test is working .
Tammy writes up more test cases , trying different weights and destinations within the U.S.
Those all work fine .
Then she tries a Canadian postal code , and the test dies with an exception .
She shows this to Patty , who realizes that the shipping cost calculator API defaults to U.S. postal codes , and requires a country code for postal codes in Canada and Mexico .
She had n't written any unit tests for any other countries yet .
Tammy and Patty pair to revise the inputs to the unit tests .
Then Patty pairs with Carl Coder to change the code that calls the API .
Now the test looks like this :
Weight Destination Postal Code Country Code Cost 5 kg 80104 US $ 7.25 5 kg T2J 2M7 CA $ 9.40
This back - and - forth testing and coding process could take all kinds of forms .
Patty might write these " story tests " herself , in addition to her unit tests .
Or , she and Tammy may decide that they can cover all of Tammy 's acceptance tests with unit - level tests .
Patty might be in a remote office , using an online collaboration tool to pair with Tammy .
Either or both might pair with other team members .
They might need help from their database expert to set up the test database .
The point is that testing and coding are part of one process , in which all team members participate .
Tammy can keep identifying new test cases until she feels all the risky areas have been covered .
She might test with the heaviest possible item , and the most expensive destination .
She might test having a large quantity of one item , or many items to the same destination .
Some edge cases might be so unlikely she does n't bother with them .
She may not keep all the automated tests in the regression test suite .
Some tests might be better done manually , after a UI is available .
The Power of Three
Patty has written unit tests with Hawaii as the shipping destination , but Tammy thinks only continental destinations are acceptable .
They both go to talk to the product owner about it .
This is the Power of Three .
When questions arise , having three different viewpoints is an effective way to make sure you get the right solution , and you do n't have to re-hash the issue later .
This helps prevent requirement changes from flying in under the radar and causing unpleasant surprises later .
It 's vital that everyone on the development team understands the business , so do n't fall into the habit of only having a tester , an analyst or a programmer communicate with the business experts .
Ways to Improve Programmer - Tester Collaboration
The story about how Tammy and Patty work together shows how closely programmers and testers collaborate .
As coding and testing proceed , there are many opportunities to transfer skills .
Programmers learn new ways of testing .
Testers learn more about code design and how the right tests can improve it .
Pair Testing
Patty has completed the UI for selecting shipping options and displaying the cost , but has n't checked it in yet .
She calls Tammy over to her workstation and demonstrates how the end user would enter the destination postal code , select the shipping option , and see the cost right away .
Tammy tries this out , changing the postal code to see the new cost appear .
She notices the text box for the postal code allows the user to enter more characters than should be allowed for a valid code , and Patty changes the html accordingly .
Once the UI looks good , Patty checks in the code , and Tammy continues with her exploratory testing .
" Show Me "
Tammy is especially concerned with changing the postal code and having the new cost display , as they identified this as a risky area .
She finds that if she displays the shipping cost , goes on to the next page of the UI , then comes back to change the postal code , the new estimated cost does n't display .
She asks Patty to come observe this behavior .
Patty realizes there is a problem with values being cached , and goes back to her workstation to fix it .
Showing someone a problem real - time is much more effective than filing a bug in a defect tracking system and waiting for someone to have time to look at it later .
If the team is distributed and people are in different time zones , it 's harder to do work through issues together .
The team will have to make adjustments to get this kind of value .
One of my teammates is in a timezone 12.5 hours ahead , but works late into his nighttime to overlap with our morning .
We work through test results and examples when we 're both online .
Show the customers , too .
As soon as you have a prototype , some basic navigation , some small testable piece of code , show it to the customer and get their feedback .
Feedback , from our customers , from our automated tests , from each other , is our most powerful tool in staying on track and delivering the right business value .
Knowing When We 're Done
Remember : " No story is done until it 's tested " .
Now that we 've learned how testing and coding fit together , there 's not a big lag time from " coding is finished " to " testing is finished " .
By the time coding is finished , we usually have FitNesse tests covering all the functionality , including edge cases and boundary conditions .
We 've explored the functionality of each " thin slice " or " small chunk " .
Now we want to learn how the finished feature works , so we do end - to - end exploratory testing .
We may use automated scripts to help set up test data or scenarios , but mainly we 're using our heads , eyes , ears and intuition to make sure that this part of the product will delight the customer .
During this post - development testing , we might realize that although we have delivered the precise customer requirements , our feature might be lacking in usability , performance , security or some other aspect of quality .
We may find that the new code impacts some other part of the application in an unexpected way .
We might fix this right away , or write new stories to be done next iteration .
If we 've managed the scope of our work correctly , we have production - ready code at the end of our iteration .
There may be enhancements planned for later , but we 've produced stable functionality the business can use now .
We understood what the business people wanted , and found a practical way to implement it .
We have a suite of automated regression tests for this functionality , so when we make changes next iteration , we 'll know if we break anything .
The Payoff
When we divide our work into small , manageable chunks , plan and conduct testing and coding as part of a single development process , and focus on finishing one chunk of valuable functionality at a time , testing does n't get squeezed to the end , put off to a future iteration , or ignored altogether .
I 've seen this proven out on a variety of teams - like most pragmatic , common - sense approaches , it works .
Get your team together today and talk about how you can all - testers , programmers and everyone else involved with delivering the software - work together to integrate coding and testing .
Instead of investing in a big requirements document , capture requirements and examples of desired application behavior in executable tests , and write the code that will make those pass .
Meet with your business stakeholders to understand their priorities and explain how much work you can realistically take on each iteration .
Stop treating coding and testing as separate activities .
It wo n't happen overnight , but gradually your team will get better and better at really finishing each software feature - including all the testing .
Your customers will be delighted to get stable , robust software that meets their needs .
Your team will benefit from better - designed code that 's easier to maintain and contains far fewer bugs .
Best of all , testers and programmers alike will enjoy their work much more !

We were the first to report the Dodge Viper was dead before Chrysler actually killed it .
Now , like a zombie from a time before fuel economy , it 's back .
That 's right , Chrysler 's telling us today the Dodge Viper will live on !
Who would win in a fight between a 3 - headed hell hound and a snake ?
In a case important to a …
That 's right , Chrysler 's announced today production will continue on the legendary Dodge Viper SRT10 .
The automaker , which is also back from the dead , will also shelve plans to sell the Viper program .
Here 's the full press release with all the details .
Dodge Viper SRT10 Will Live On
Auburn Hills , Mich. , Jul 10 , 2009 - Chrysler Group LLC announced today that production will continue for the legendary Dodge Viper SRT10 .
Originally slated to cease production in December 2009 , the Chrysler Group Conner Avenue Assembly Plant - the exclusive home of Dodge Viper production since 1995 - will continue to build the V - 10 powered sports car .
Chrysler Group is no longer pursuing a sale of the Viper business assets .
" The Dodge Viper has successfully captured the hearts and imagination of performance enthusiasts around the globe , " said Mike Accavitti , President and Chief Executive Officer , Dodge Brand .
" We 're extremely proud that the ultimate American - built sports car with its world - class performance will live on as the iconic image leader for the Dodge brand . "
Introduced as a concept car in 1989 at the North American International Auto Show in Detroit , the Dodge Viper was designed and engineered to test public reaction to the concept of a back - to - basics , high - performance , limited production sports car .
The reaction was so overwhelming that customer orders began to flow in even before the auto show was over .
Chrysler Corporation immediately decided to determine the production feasibility on transforming the crowd - pleasing Dodge Viper show car into a limited - production sports car in no more than three years .
In May 1990 , after months of intensive study and testing , Chrysler Corporation announced that the Dodge Viper , powered by an aluminum V - 10 was a " go . "
Dodge Viper production began in May 1992 at the New Mack Assembly Plant and was moved to Conner Avenue in October 1995 .
Viper V - 10 engine production transferred from Mound Road Engine to Conner Avenue Assembly in May 2001 .
In 2008 , Dodge introduced the all - new , fourth generation Dodge Viper SRT10 .
With more horsepower , more torque and more than 30 exterior and interior color combinations , the latest Viper gives enthusiasts the performance they expect on the track and off , with more factory customization options than before .
For 2009 , the Dodge Viper SRT10 offers outrageous power , with an 8.4 - liter , 600 - horsepower ( 450 kW ) V - 10 engine contributing to blistering acceleration ( 0 - 60 mph in less than four seconds , 0 - 100 - 0 mph in the low 12 - second range ) , setting an American sports car benchmark .
To date , more than 25,000 Dodge Vipers have been built .

Financial Times Editorial , June 15 2009
Introduction
There is hardly any election , in which the White House has a significant stake , where the electoral defeat of the pro-US candidate is not denounced as illegitimate by the entire political and mass media elite .
In the most recent period , the White House and its camp followers cried foul following the free ( and monitored ) elections in Venezuela and Gaza , while joyously fabricating an ‘ electoral success ’ in Lebanon despite the fact that the Hezbollah - led coalition received over 53 % of the vote .
The recently concluded , June 12 , 2009 elections in Iran are a classic case :
The incumbent nationalist - populist President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad ( MA ) received 63.3 % of the vote ( or 24.5 million votes ) , while the leading Western - backed liberal opposition candidate Hossein Mousavi ( HM ) received 34.2 % or ( 3.2 million votes ) .
Iran ’s presidential election drew a record turnout of more than 80 % of the electorate , including an unprecedented overseas vote of 234,812 , in which HM won 111,792 to MA ’s 78,300 .
The opposition led by HM did not accept their defeat and organized a series of mass demonstrations that turned violent , resulting in the burning and destruction of automobiles , banks , public building and armed confrontations with the police and other authorities .
Almost the entire spectrum of Western opinion makers , including all the major electronic and print media , the major liberal , radical , libertarian and conservative web - sites , echoed the opposition ’s claim of rampant election fraud .
Neo -conservatives , libertarian conservatives and Trotskyites joined the Zionists in hailing the opposition protestors as the advance guard of a democratic revolution .
Democrats and Republicans condemned the incumbent regime , refused to recognize the result of the vote and praised the demonstrators ’ efforts to overturn the electoral outcome .
The New York Times , CNN , Washington Post , the Israeli Foreign Office and the entire leadership of the Presidents of the Major American Jewish Organizations called for harsher sanctions against Iran and announced Obama ’s proposed dialogue with Iran as ‘ dead in the water ’ .
The Electoral Fraud Hoax
Western leaders rejected the results because they ‘ knew ’ that their reformist candidate could not lose …
For months they published daily interviews , editorials and reports from the field ‘ detailing ’ the failures of Ahmadinejad ’s administration ; they cited the support from clerics , former officials , merchants in the bazaar and above all women and young urbanites fluent in English , to prove that Mousavi was headed for a landslide victory .
A victory for Mousavi was described as a victory for the ‘ voices of moderation ’ , at least the White House ’s version of that vacuous cliché .
Prominent liberal academics deduced the vote count was fraudulent because the opposition candidate , Mousavi , lost in his own ethnic enclave among the Azeris .
Other academics claimed that the ‘ youth vote ’ – based on their interviews with upper and middle - class university students from the neighborhoods of Northern Tehran were overwhelmingly for the ‘ reformist ’ candidate .
What is astonishing about the West ’s universal condemnation of the electoral outcome as fraudulent is that not a single shred of evidence in either written or observational form has been presented either before or a week after the vote count .
During the entire electoral campaign , no credible ( or even dubious ) charge of voter tampering was raised .
As long as the Western media believed their own propaganda of an immanent victory for their candidate , the electoral process was described as highly competitive , with heated public debates and unprecedented levels of public activity and unhindered by public proselytizing .
The belief in a free and open election was so strong that the Western leaders and mass media believed that their favored candidate would win .
The Western media relied on its reporters covering the mass demonstrations of opposition supporters , ignoring and downplaying the huge turnout for Ahmadinejad .
Worse still , the Western media ignored the class composition of the competing demonstrations – the fact that the incumbent candidate was drawing his support from the far more numerous poor working class , peasant , artisan and public employee sectors while the bulk of the opposition demonstrators was drawn from the upper and middle class students , business and professional class .
Moreover , most Western opinion leaders and reporters based in Tehran extrapolated their projections from their observations in the capital – few venture into the provinces , small and medium size cities and villages where Ahmadinejad has his mass base of support .
Moreover the opposition ’s supporters were an activist minority of students easily mobilized for street activities , while Ahmadinejad ’s support drew on the majority of working youth and household women workers who would express their views at the ballot box and had little time or inclination to engage in street politics .
A number of newspaper pundits , including Gideon Rachman of the Financial Times , claim as evidence of electoral fraud the fact that Ahmadinejad won 63 % of the vote in an Azeri - speaking province against his opponent , Mousavi , an ethnic Azeri .
The simplistic assumption is that ethnic identity or belonging to a linguistic group is the only possible explanation of voting behavior rather than other social or class interests .
A closer look at the voting pattern in the East - Azerbaijan region of Iran reveals that Mousavi won only in the city of Shabestar among the upper and the middle classes ( and only by a small margin ) , whereas he was soundly defeated in the larger rural areas , where the re-distributive policies of the Ahmadinejad government had helped the ethnic Azeris write off debt , obtain cheap credits and easy loans for the farmers .
Mousavi did win in the West - Azerbaijan region , using his ethnic ties to win over the urban voters .
In the highly populated Tehran province , Mousavi beat Ahmadinejad in the urban centers of Tehran and Shemiranat by gaining the vote of the middle and upper class districts , whereas he lost badly in the adjoining working class suburbs , small towns and rural areas .
The careless and distorted emphasis on ‘ ethnic voting ’ cited by writers from the Financial Times and New York Times to justify calling Ahmadinejad ‘s victory a ‘ stolen vote ’ is matched by the media ’s willful and deliberate refusal to acknowledge a rigorous nationwide public opinion poll conducted by two US experts just three weeks before the vote , which showed Ahmadinejad leading by a more than 2 to 1 margin – even larger than his electoral victory on June 12 .
This poll revealed that among ethnic Azeris , Ahmadinejad was favored by a 2 to 1 margin over Mousavi , demonstrating how class interests represented by one candidate can overcome the ethnic identity of the other candidate [ 1 ] .
The poll also demonstrated how class issues , within age groups , were more influential in shaping political preferences than ‘ generational life style ’ .
According to this poll , over two - thirds of Iranian youth were too poor to have access to a computer and the 18 - 24 year olds “ comprised the strongest voting bloc for Ahmadinejad of all groups ” [ 2 ] .
The only group , which consistently favored Mousavi , was the university students and graduates , business owners and the upper middle class .
The ‘ youth vote ’ , which the Western media praised as ‘ pro- reformist ’ , was a clear minority of less than 30 % but came from a highly privileged , vocal and largely English speaking group with a monopoly on the Western media .
Their overwhelming presence in the Western news reports created what has been referred to as the ‘ North Tehran Syndrome ’ , for the comfortable upper class enclave from which many of these students come .
While they may be articulate , well dressed and fluent in English , they were soundly out - voted in the secrecy of the ballot box .
In general , Ahmadinejad did very well in the oil and chemical producing provinces .
This may have be a reflection of the oil workers ’ opposition to the ‘ reformist ’ program , which included proposals to ‘ privatize ’ public enterprises .
Likewise , the incumbent did very well along the border provinces because of his emphasis on strengthening national security from US and Israeli threats in light of an escalation of US - sponsored cross - border terrorist attacks from Pakistan and Israeli - backed incursions from Iraqi Kurdistan , which have killed scores of Iranian citizens .
Sponsorship and massive funding of the groups behind these attacks is an official policy of the US from the Bush Administration , which has not been repudiated by President Obama ; in fact it has escalated in the lead - up to the elections .
What Western commentators and their Iranian protégés have ignored is the powerful impact which the devastating US wars and occupation of Iraq and Afghanistan had on Iranian public opinion : Ahmadinejad ’s strong position on defense matters contrasted with the pro-Western and weak defense posture of many of the campaign propagandists of the opposition .
The great majority of voters for the incumbent probably felt that national security interests , the integrity of the country and the social welfare system , with all of its faults and excesses , could be better defended and improved with Ahmadinejad than with upper - class technocrats supported by Western - oriented privileged youth who prize individual life styles over community values and solidarity .
The demography of voting reveals a real class polarization pitting high income , free market oriented , capitalist individualists against working class , low income , community based supporters of a ‘ moral economy ’ in which usury and profiteering are limited by religious precepts .
The open attacks by opposition economists of the government welfare spending , easy credit and heavy subsidies of basic food staples did little to ingratiate them with the majority of Iranians benefiting from those programs .
The state was seen as the protector and benefactor of the poor workers against the ‘ market ’ , which represented wealth , power , privilege and corruption .
The Opposition ’s attack on the regime ’s ‘ intransigent ’ foreign policy and positions ‘ alienating ’ the West only resonated with the liberal university students and import - export business groups .
To many Iranians , the regime ’s military buildup was seen as having prevented a US or Israeli attack .
The scale of the opposition ’s electoral deficit should tell us is how out of touch it is with its own people ’s vital concerns .
It should remind them that by moving closer to Western opinion , they removed themselves from the everyday interests of security , housing , jobs and subsidized food prices that make life tolerable for those living below the middle class and outside the privileged gates of Tehran University .
Amhadinejad ’s electoral success , seen in historical comparative perspective should not be a surprise .
In similar electoral contests between nationalist - populists against pro-Western liberals , the populists have won .
Past examples include Peron in Argentina and , most recently , Chavez of Venezuela , Evo Morales in Bolivia and even Lula da Silva in Brazil , all of whom have demonstrated an ability to secure close to or even greater than 60 % of the vote in free elections .
The voting majorities in these countries prefer social welfare over unrestrained markets , national security over alignments with military empires .
The consequences of the electoral victory of Ahmadinejad are open to debate .
The US may conclude that continuing to back a vocal , but badly defeated , minority has few prospects for securing concessions on nuclear enrichment and an abandonment of Iran ’s support for Hezbollah and Hamas .
A realistic approach would be to open a wide - ranging discussion with Iran , and acknowledging , as Senator Kerry recently pointed out , that enriching uranium is not an existential threat to anyone .
This approach would sharply differ from the approach of American Zionists , embedded in the Obama regime , who follow Israel ’s lead of pushing for a preemptive war with Iran and use the specious argument that no negotiations are possible with an ‘ illegitimate ’ government in Tehran which ‘ stole an election ’ .
Recent events suggest that political leaders in Europe , and even some in Washington , do not accept the Zionist - mass media line of ‘ stolen elections ’ .
The White House has not suspended its offer of negotiations with the newly re-elected government but has focused rather on the repression of the opposition protesters ( and not the vote count ) .
Likewise , the 27 nation European Union expressed ‘ serious concern about violence ’ and called for the “ aspirations of the Iranian people to be achieved through peaceful means and that freedom of expression be respected ” [ 3 ] .
Except for Sarkozy of France , no EU leader has questioned the outcome of the voting .
The wild card in the aftermath of the elections is the Israeli response : Netanyahu has signaled to his American Zionist followers that they should use the hoax of ‘ electoral fraud ’ to exert maximum pressure on the Obama regime to end all plans to meet with the newly re-elected Ahmadinejad regime .
Paradoxically , US commentators ( left , right and center ) who bought into the electoral fraud hoax are inadvertently providing Netanyahu and his American followers with the arguments and fabrications :
Where they see religious wars , we see class wars ; where they see electoral fraud , we see imperial destabilization .

WORTH RESIGNS : Dr Worth was minister for Internal Affairs , Land Information , Archives New Zealand , and the National Library , and associate minister of Justice .
Labour leader Phil Goff took an allegation of Richard Worth 's inappropriate behaviour towards a woman to Prime Minister John Key about a month ago , it emerged tonight .
Dr Worth resigned his ministerial portfolios abruptly last night citing personal reasons and Mr Key has since confirmed that Worth is the subject of a police investigation .
Do you know more about the resignation of Dr Worth ?
Email editorial@stuff.co.nz or call 04-4740098
Mr Key has confirmed he previously investigated allegations that former Internal Affairs Minister Richard Worth harassed women but nothing came of it .
Mr Goff 's allegation is understood not to be the one which resulted in Mr Worth resigning his ministerial portfolio .
At 4 pm today , police confirmed they were investigating a sitting Member of Parliament : " Police confirm that a complaint was made in Auckland two weeks ago and related to a recent alleged incident .
Preliminary inquiries were made and the complaint transferred to Wellington Police for further investigation by Detective Inspector Paul Basham , head of Wellington City CIB . "
Mr Key is refusing to divulge the nature of the investigation , other than to say it involves " criminal " allegations .
But when asked if there had been previous allegations of Dr Worth hassling women and making a nuisance of himself Mr Key confirmed that someone had brought an allegation to him " of that nature " .
" All I can say is I treated that allegation seriously , I investigated it and was satisfied with the answers I received . "
When asked if the matter before police was of a similar nature , Mr Key responded : " There are different circumstances here and circumstances that certainly would appear on first blush to warrant a police investigation … but also information that would confirm to me that he does n’t hold my confidence and should n’t be a minister . "
When asked if the police investigation involved a " sexual allegation " Mr Key said he was " not at liberty " to discuss that .
'' All I can tell you is his conduct does not befit a minister and I will not have him in my Cabinet , '' Mr Key told a press conference .
'' If he had n't resigned I would have sacked him . ''
Mr Goff 's spokesman confirmed rumours tonight that the Labour leader had raised a complaint with Mr Key about a month ago after a woman approached the party .
Mr Goff had decided not to raise the issue publicly and allow Mr Key to deal with it as the woman had not wanted to be in the public arena .
The complaint was about " inappropriate behaviour .
. . in the nature of unwanted attention . "
The spokesman did not know how the complaint was resolved or what action Mr Key took , but did not believe it was in any way linked to the new complaint that cost Dr Worth his job .
Key faced several questions from Mr Goff during Question Time today regarding the resignation .
Mr Key told Parliament this afternoon he had become aware of Dr Worth 's circumstances last Tuesday but had said there was a process to go through before any major decisions were made .
" I believe everyone is entitled to natural justice , " he said .
He said he had all the information surrounding the case on Monday and " could point to other Prime Ministers that took a lot longer to act . "
When asked about Dr Worth 's past performance Mr Key said " there have been instances where he could 've improved his performance , " and singled out Mr Worth 's trip to India as an example .
Mr Key said an outside party had informed his office of the allegation of a ' ' relatively recent ' ' incident last week .
Dr Worth had not come to him about it .
In a brief statement , Wellington police said they were conducting a preliminary investigation into an allegation that had been made against a sitting MP .
Dr Worth was a minister outside Cabinet , responsible for Internal Affairs , Land Information , Archives New Zealand , and the National Library , and associate minister of Justice .
In a statement this morning he said he was standing down with " deep regret " .
" I am resigning from the role for personal reasons , " he said .
" I tendered my resignation to the Prime Minister last night and he accepted . "
Mr Key said Dr Worth 's ministerial responsibilities had been temporarily transferred to Maurice Williamson and he would permanently reallocate them in " the near future " .
He said Dr Worth had advised him " of some private matters in respect of which he felt it appropriate that he should resign as a Minister . "
Dr Worth said he had been granted a fortnight 's leave of absence from Parliament .
It was up to Dr Worth whether he stayed in Parliament as an MP , Mr Key said .
He is the first minister to resign in the new Government , elected last November .
Mr Goff said Dr Worth 's resignation came " several months too late " .
In a statement , he said Prime Minister John Key had ample reason to sack Dr Worth earlier in the year but had lacked " the necessary leadership to do so . "
" The resignation of a minister is a very serious matter and it is incumbent on John Key to explain to the public why this has occurred .
" It is completely unsustainable for John Key to say that resignation from a high public office is for a secret or undisclosed reason unless there are personal family matters behind Dr Worth 's agreement to resign , " Mr Goff said .
Dr Worth , who entered Parliament in 1999 , has been embroiled in controversy this year , after The Dominion Post revealed that he helped to broker business for an aviation company he was associated with during a trip to India in February .
Although it was a private trip , Indian media quoted him in his capacity as internal affairs minister promoting New Zealand " as an ideal place for aviation training " .
He was publicly rebuked by Prime Minister John Key , who warned him not to embarrass the Government again .
He resigned from his business interests following the affair .
In April he faced questions over a potential conflict of interest after he visited a taxi driver allegedly attacked by members of a group that included the son of an acquaintance of Mr Worth .
Last weekend , Sunday News reported that Dr Worth had been called as a witness in a libel case involving rival gossip columnists Bridget Saunders and Rachel Glucina .

WHO IS RICHARD WORTH ?
From the lofty highs of an unsanctioned camel ride National 's Richard Worth has fallen into the midst of a police investigation which has seen him resign from his ministerial portfolios .
Dr Worth first entered Parliament as the MP for Epsom in 1999 .
He won the seat again in 2002 but was toppled by Rodney Hide in 2005 and returned as a list MP .
Dr Worth stood again in the Epsom electorate last year but did not make any real effort on the campaign - though both ACT and National denied making a deal to see Mr Hide safely win the seat .
Over the last 10 years Dr Worth has been a declining force in the National Party .
When he entered for National in 1999 he was a top lawyer , a partner and later chairman for Simpson Grierson , with experience in international affairs and business and a PhD from RMIT University in Melbourne .
He was the Consul for Columbia for six years and Monaco for eight .
In addition , he is a former president of the Hong Kong New Zealand Business Association and former chairman of the India Trade Group and Korea New Zealand Business Council .
Dr Worth , a former navy captain , was appointed an Officer of the British Empire ( Military Division ) and made a knight in the Venerable Order of St John of Jerusalem for his work with the order .
He was understood to have been promised the Speaker 's job if National won in 2005 .
They lost .
In 2008 he was appointed as a minister outside Cabinet .
Until today he was Minister of Internal Affairs , Minister for Land Information , Minister Responsible for the National Library and Archives New Zealand and Associate Minister of Justice .
In 2002 , Dr Worth garnered attention when he chose to take a camel ride , visit the pyramids , and shop at a market rather then attend a service to honour the Maori Battalion during an official trip to Egypt .
Soon after he returned to New Zealand he quit as a director of Prada America 's Cup ( NZ ) Limited because of suggestions it was disloyal for an MP to be linked to a challenging syndicate .
He said at the time he became a Prada board member before the previous Cup , when he was not an MP .
More recently Dr Worth was in trouble after he went to India on a private visit and promoted an aviation company in which he held shares and a directorship .
He resigned the directorship and sold the shares .
It was also reported that a company Dr Worth held shares in had links with another company which was investigated by the Serious Fraud Office .
Despite Labour 's calls for him to be fired , Prime Minister John Key stood by him - until now .
Dr Worth and his wife , Lynne , have one adult daughter .
His profile on the National Party website lists his hobbies as mountain climbing , Bollywood films , Korean classical music and the early works of Sun Tzu .

Naomi Klein in Bil'in , June 26 , 2009
I have a feeling that this will not be covered in the mainstream media at all .
The Faster Times :
( Naomi ) Klein is the author of the highly acclaimed , best - selling books No Logo and The Shock Doctrine , both staples of many Western liberal / leftist book collections .
She was invited to speak by the Palestinian Boycott , Divestment & Sanctions Campaign National Committee ( BNC ) because Klein is one of a growing number of high profile Western authors , artists and cultural figures who have signed on to a 2005 Palestinian civil society call to boycott , divest and sanction ( BDS ) Israel until it complies with international law .
Over three hundred people crammed the small venue which was followed by a lively question and answer session .
Although technically in the region on a book tour for the Hebrew release of Shock Doctrine , Klein focused her remarks on critiques of boycotting Israel as a tactic , and the motivation of Western states to torpedo the recently held Durban Review Conference held in Geneva this past April .
She ended by making an emotional appeal to those “ who are on the fence [ about the call for boycott ] to please join , ” acknowledging that her delayed endorsement of the boycott campaign in 2008 , three years after the call was initially made , “ was nothing but cowardice . ”
It 's not without controversy , but I do applaud Klein for speaking out .
I do n't think Klein is anti-Zionist or anti-Semitic at all -- although if this gets covered in the US at all , it will be on Fox and that 's exactly how they 'll characterize her .
However , in order for there to be any true negotiation for peace in the region , there MUST be a little more honesty and a little less knee - jerking on the subject .
Klein explains where she 's coming from :
This time I am doing a blog post in English .
It ’s not my native tongue , but I hope you can bear with it .
The reason I am writing this blog entry in English is the current censorship law proposal .
You might have heard about the German federal government planing to establish a censorship system for the internet .
Superficially speaking , they tell you it is to fight child pornography , but they are already thinking out loud about expanding this instruments .
Sites about Ego - Shooters have already been announced to be the next target .
File sharing sites will surely follow .
A lot of people stood up against it , by signing a petition to the German Parliament ( „ Deutscher Bundestag “ ) .
It was Tuesday I realized , that the right to sign a petition is granted to everyone by our constitution .
This means there is no restriction to age , citizenship or residence .
So even you people out there in the other countries can sign it , if you want to show , that you do not want a democratic state to employ instruments of censorship .
Sadly it ’s not that easy , since the e-petition - sytem ist only in German .
But if you want to give it a shot , read on .
We have some information in English here .
The petition can be found on the website of the Bundestag .
It translates as follows :
Text of the petition
We demand , that the German Bundestag declines the amendments to the telemedia law according to the proposal of the federal government of the 22nd of April 2009 .
We consider the proposed procedure of letting the BKA [ remark : „ Bundeskriminalamt “ , German Federal Police Administration ] index websites and providers blocking them untransparent and uncontrollable , since the „ block lists “ can not be inspected , nor are the criteria for putting a web site on the list properly defined .
We see a danger for the civil liberty of informational freedom .
Explanation
The overall goal – protecting children , preventing them from being abused and stopping the spreading of child pornography – is not questioned by us .
On the contrary , it is in everyones interest .
But the proposed methods are totally unsuitable , which was confirmed on many occasions by experts of a lot different areas .
Blocking of websites has no remarkable influence on the physical and mental integrity of abused children .
For everyone willing to support us , one of our members has made a screencast tutorial on how to sign the petition :
This interview with Carol Smith , senior vice president and chief brand officer for the Elle Group , the media company , was conducted and condensed by Adam Bryant .
Q . What is the most important lesson you ’ve learned about leadership ?
A . The importance of winning over employees as opposed to bossing employees .
I learned that lesson very , very early  in sixth grade .
Q. Tell me about that .
A . In sixth grade , I was head of the project to create a mural for the graduating class to hang in the auditorium .
That ’s a big deal .
And I got a clipboard , I remember , and then I had all this power and I started bossing everyone around .
And within days it was apparent that I was going to have a mutiny on my hands , and I was fired from the mural .
They took my clipboard away .
It was a lesson I learned very early in life about the difference between being the boss and being bossy .
I often tell people , “ Ah , that ’s a sixth - grade clipboard problem here . ”
I feel I ’m a leader without ever really thinking I ’m a leader , which is to say that I know when I walk into a room of employees , I command a presence , but I ’m always feeling like I ’m part of the gang .
I do n’t instantly sit at the head of the table .
I sit in the middle of the table , always .
I do n’t want to sit at the head of the table .
I want to be part of the process and part of the decision .
Following up on a previous post about the relative performance of STL vs gnulib , this post extends and completes the analysis to include the stl : : vector and stl : : deque containers .
These containers provide a more direct comparison against the Gnulib array - list and carray - list implementations .
The results are shown below .
Please refer to the previous post on this subject for details on how the results were collected including source code .
DISCLAIMER : Please note that the intent of the post is not to suggest that gnulib should be used instead of STL in C++ programs , but rather to point out that although not part of the C language specification , gnulib offers C programmers a set of containers whose performance is comparable to the STL container performance available to C++ programmers .
Search ( unsorted ) Performance
Note that the vertical axis represents seconds and the lower the bar for each algorithm , the better .
Based on the above results , it can be seen that the performance of the stl : : list is comparable to the gnulib linked_list for both insertions ( at the end ) and unsorted searching .
Gnulib array_list is comparable in implementation to the stl : : vector but proves to be almost 2 x faster for insertions and ~ 1.5 x slower for searching for this test .
The stl : : deque is also comparable to the gnulib array_list and proves to be slightly faster for insertions and just under 3 x slower for searching .
As a final note , this analysis only performed comparisons based on two tests – push back and unsorted find .
This is just an indication of performance and far from complete .
The results may well be different if different tests were chosen .

Mohammad Khatami says millions have lost faith in the electoral process
The former President of Iran , Mohammad Khatami , has called for a referendum on the legitimacy of the government , following June 's disputed elections .
Mr Khatami , quoted on Iranian websites , said millions of Iranians had lost faith in the electoral process .
The Iranian opposition , including Mr Khatami and the defeated presidential candidate Mir Hossein Mousavi , say the election was rigged .
Only the Supreme Leader , Ayatollah Ali Khamenei , can organise a referendum .
HAVE YOUR SAY I wanted Rafsanjani to ridicule Ahmadinejad directly , after all Ahmadinejad insulted Rafsanjani and his family Armenian , Tehran , Iran Ayatollah Khamenei has already declared the elections , which the incumbent , President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad , won by a landslide , as valid .
Thousands of opposition supporters took to the streets after the poll results were announced , to protest against what they saw as mass fraud .
At least 20 people are believed to have died in the clashes .
There were more public protests last Friday after a sermon by another important pro-reform figure , former president Ali Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani .
Mr Mousavi has continued to issue statements opposing the election result , saying detention of protesters would not end opposition .
" Is n't it an insult to 40 million voters ... linking detainees to foreign countries ?
Let people freely express their protests and ideas , " Mr Mousavi said on his Ghalamnews website .
' Mass fraud '
Mr Khatami said there was no alternative to having a referendum , which he called for an independent body to carry out .
" I state openly that reliance upon the people 's vote and the staging of a legal referendum is the only way for the system to emerge from the current crisis , " Mr Khatami said .
" People must be asked whether they are happy with the situation that has taken shape , " he said .
He suggested that an impartial body such as the Expediency Council should hold the referendum and pledged that his political supporters would respect the result whatever it was .
He also praised the sermon on Friday , by former president and current Expediency Council head Mr Rafsanjani , who said the government had lost the trust of millions in Iran .
In the sermon at Tehran University , Mr Rafsanjani also called for all those detained since the elections to be released .
His words - broadcast live on state radio - brought thousands back out onto the streets , the first public opposition demonstration for more than a week .
They chanted slogans in support of Mr Mousavi .
Police fired tear gas to break up crowds and witnesses said there were a number of arrests .

The board 's chairman , Dr. Dinesh Patel , said this morning that while the board agreed that Dr. Bean - Bayog had engaged in " substandard care , " there were no grounds to suspend her .
He cited affidavits from most of Dr. Bean - Bayog 's current patients and said the board had determined that her practice did not constitute an immediate threat to the public .
' Regresion and Transference '
Neither Dr. Bean -Bayog nor her lawyer , James J. Barry , returned phone calls Monday .
But in a statement to Boston television stations last Friday she termed the charges " outlandish and false , " saying , " I categorically deny that I ever had any sexual relations with this patient or that I otherwise exceeded the proper bounds of psychotherapy . "
The papers , filed by Mr. Lozano 's family as part of a medical malpractice and wrongful death lawsuit , charge that Dr. Bean - Bayog , who is 48 years old , manipulated Mr. Lozano " into a dangerous cycle of regression and transference wherein the patient was caused to become completely dependent , as a 3 - year - old child , on Dr. Bean - Bayog as his mother . "
At the same time , the suit contends , Dr. Bean - Bayog made him " participate in vivid sadomasochistic sexual fantasies , " and made him have sexual intercourse with her .
As evidence , the Lozanos ' lawyer , Andrew C. Meyer Jr. , introduced several thousand pages of letters and notes described as being in Dr. Bean - Bayog 's handwriting , including flash cards she gave Mr. Lozano with orders to " run over these cards every day until you know them all by heart and are starting to believe them . "
One card reads : " I 'm your Mom and I love you and you love me very very much .
Say that 10 times . "
Another card reads : " I love spending time with you .
I 'm going to miss you , so many things about you , the closeness and the need and the phenomenal sex and being so appreciated . "

" There will be , in the next generation or so , a pharmacological method of making people love their servitude , and producing dictatorship without tears , so to speak , producing a kind of painless concentration camp for entire societies , so that people will in fact have their liberties taken away from them , but will rather enjoy it , because they will be distracted from any desire to rebel by propaganda or brainwashing , or brainwashing enhanced by pharmacological methods .
And this seems to be the final revolution . "

First Nation To Plan 100 % Solar Power : It 's Tuvalu !
July 21st , 2009 by Susan Kraemer
Tuvalu is the tiny nation in the Pacific that sued the Bush administration because of sea level rise that was destroying its ability to sustain itself .
( Tuvalu ’s flag is number three above , with the stars of the Southern Cross . )
Climate change was affecting Tuvalu early – its gorgeous islands are only 3 feet above sea level .
Crops were being destroyed by encroaching seawater from rising sea levels .
Plans were being made to emigrate the entire nation to New Zealand by the end of the century .
Now it appears Tuvalu ’s remaining 12,000 residents have a stay put and fight back plan :
With the help of the NGO e8 and the Japanese government , Tuvalu has begun installing the first 40 KW of what is to be the first entirely solar powered nation by 2020 .
But if you ’re a nation with a less ambitious goal , do n’t be mad that you ’re not going 100 % solar too .
Its easier for Tuvalu than for you : 100 % solar powering the entire nation will only cost $ 20 million .
There ’s only 12,000 people in Tuvalu .
As the earliest of us to have been hit by climate change , Tuvaluans really get the true value of avoiding climate catastrophe , and want to exemplify the new way of living a zero carbon energy life in a new energy world .
Let ’s hope the rest of us wake up in time too .
But , good for you , Tuvalu !

libposix is a bold attempt to unify the implementation of the core functionality of all Unix systems .
libposix is :
A full implementation of the POSIX 2008 standard
A cross platform implementation , that should replace existing implementations of the system core libraries and unify the core Unix implementation for all systems
An exact implementation of POSIX 2008 and nothing else ( no extensions , no previous POSIX versions )
An implementation that works well with possible extensions to the core system functionallity ( ex : GNU , BSD )
An implementation of POSIX written from scratch
Free and open source software
The main goal of the libposix project is to successfully replace free Unix " libc " implementations with an implementation that is portable , conformant , easy to build , to cross - build , to use , to study and to mantain .

It 's probably not news to you that BushCo essentially outsourced the government , getting in return much higher costs - and much lower quality .
But then , government outsourcing was never meant to be efficient , except as a way of funneling money to friends and contributors :
The U.S. Special Operations Command , which has Army Special Forces units worldwide , has been criticized by the Pentagon inspector general for not providing adequate oversight of $ 1.7 billion in logistic support contracts at 20 locations and for allowing contractors to perform what are considered " inherently government functions . "
Federal government rules and regulations prohibit the hiring of contractors who perform actions reserved for government employees , yet a Special Operations Command unit managing the contract with L - 3 Communications Integrated Systems permitted contractor approval of such matters as overtime and acceptably completed work , according to a report by the Pentagon inspector general released this week .
The contracts called for L - 3 Communications to provide logistic support for Special Forces equipment including repair , maintenance and support that between 2003 and 2008 involved 2,148 separate tasks .
The Special Operations Forces Support Activity , which administered the contract , designated one government employee to be the contracting officer for the contract .
But the IG report noted that " it is not feasible for one individual to effectively oversee 2,148 task orders requiring surveillance in 20 locations . "
No L - 3 Communications official was available to comment on the report .
The report pointed out that no quality - assurance plan was developed for tasks that typically would guide contracting officers in determining whether contracting tasks were being completed as required .
Instead , the IG report said , the Special Operations Forces unit relied on complaints from those receiving the contractor services .
One example cited by the IG report was chipping and flaking paint on six helicopters because of poor preparation before painting .
" These aircraft needed to be repainted and , therefore , reduced the warfighter 's ability to support military operations as scheduled , " according to the report .
The contractor charged the government an additional $ 225,000 to repaint the aircraft .
A group of French workers facing layoffs obtained extra money after threatening to blow up industrial equipment at their plant , labor union representatives said on Friday .
Meanwhile , workers at two other companies continue their threats to blow up their workplaces .
The workers , at JLG , a manufacturing company , were the third in France to make similar threats this month , after workers from Nortel , the telecommunications equipment maker , and New Fabris , a car parts maker .
JLG workers at three plants in southwestern France had been on strike for three weeks over a management plan to lay off 53 of them .
After hearing news of the threats made at Nortel and New Fabris , they followed suit .
On Wednesday , the JLG workers placed four of the company ’s products — large platform cranes with a total value estimated at $ 352,400 — in a car park and surrounded them with gas cylinders and kindling .
After talks that lasted well into Thursday night , management met their demand that laid - off workers receive 30,000 euros , or about $ 42,300 , in compensation , and the strikers removed the gas cylinders and returned the cranes to the factory , said Christian Amadio , a JLG worker representative .
At Nortel , talks with management resumed , while workers at New Fabris are still threatening to blow up their factory .
New Fabris workers have given a 31st July deadline for Renault and Peugeot , which provided 90 % of the plant 's work , to pay them 30,000 euros each .
Such threats signal a new escalation in tactics used by disgruntled French workers after episodes in which managers were detained by employees on company premises .
Authorities have used tough language to denounce such actions but have refrained from sending in the police to break up protests .
France has a history of labor unrest , and the government wants to avoid an escalation of violence .
A new Japanese study finds that pigeons have “ advanced perceptive abilities ” which allow them to recognize beauty in the same way humans do .
The month - long , government - funded study found that the birds were able to differentiate “ good ” paintings from “ bad ” ones .
The research team from Tokyo ’s Keio University had conducted a previous study that found the birds were able to distinguish between a Picasso and a Monet .
In the current study , they wanted to see whether the pigeons actually had a preference for one over the other .
They obtained paintings by elementary school children and selected those that teachers and a control group of other adults deemed to be “ good ” and “ bad ” .
Next they displayed the images on a screen to the birds , rewarding them with food whenever they selected the “ good ” paintings .
The pictures included a wide variety of watercolors , pastels , still lives and landscapes , all of which were judged on their artistic merit , such as how clear and discernible the images were .
Professor Shigeru Watanabe of Keio ’s Faculty of Letters and Graduate School of Human Resources said the pigeons learned to peck at only the “ good ” paintings .
They even responded appropriately to images they had not seen before , Watanabe told the AFP .
However , in a report about the research , Keio University explained that the study “ did not deal with advanced artistic judgments . ”
“ But it did indicate that pigeons are able to learn to distinguish ‘ good ’ or ‘ beautiful ’ paintings the way an ordinary human being can , ” the report said .
The findings of Keio University ’s Centre of Advanced Research on Logic and Sensibility will be published in the journal Animal Cognition .

Great at times bad at others
Via Gerard over at Presurfer comes what is surely the most disturbing coffee set ever manufactured .
So disturbing in fact that I felt compelled to have a quick look for other blood stained consumer goods .
Here they are .

For more blood - splattered objects , take a look at this article over at WebUrbanist .
Real estate broker Carl Muhlstein maneuvered his silver BMW convertible through downtown Los Angeles traffic , one hand steering the car and the other pressing a cellphone to his ear .
“ Come on , ” he teased .
“ Insult me with an offer . ”
While some who swim the deep and often lucrative waters of commercial real estate have retreated to the golf course , Muhlstein is among those pushing on -- joking , nudging and networking in hopes of making deals in a time of no deals .
“ The conversations are tougher , the challenges are greater , the stakes are higher , ” Muhlstein said , as odds grow that a multimillion - dollar transaction may end badly for somebody .
“ Will the landlord lose the building ?
Will the tenants stay in business ? ”

Among his tasks is finding a buyer for Park Fifth , a stalled $ 1 - billion high - rise condominium and hotel development proposed for a block next to Pershing Square downtown .
At Playa Vista , he advised the owners of the enormous Spruce Goose hangar -- built by famed aviator Howard Hughes -- to take it off the block because prices are depressed .
Muhlstein tries to use humor to cope with hard times in the commercial real estate industry , a business in such pronounced distress that some experts predict its problems will thwart the nation ’s hopes for an economic recovery .
Nearly 16 % of office space in Los Angeles County is sitting vacant as tenants close up shop or move out of expensive properties .
Nearly a third of the space around up - market Playa Vista sits empty ; office buildings in the Inland Empire and parts of Orange County are completely vacant .
It all adds up to less work for brokers like Muhlstein , who make their living facilitating the sale and leasing of these properties .
Advertisement
Commercial brokerages such as CB Richard Ellis , Grubb & Ellis , Jones Lang LaSalle , and Cushman & Wakefield , where Muhlstein works , have contracted during the recession , collectively shedding thousands of workers as profits plummeted in the slow market .
Many brokers , who survive on commissions , are among the departed .
Still , brokers are a persistent lot , drawn to the business by the opportunity to earn lots of money .
When the market is good , top producers can earn $ 100,000 to more than $ 1 million a year on commissions of 2 % to 5 % on the value of a deal .
The risky , competitive field is still made up almost exclusively of men , a disproportionately high number of whom learned to battle at the top levels of collegiate sports .
Although brokers sometimes dress casually to woo laid - back clients in creative fields , the default uniform is a dark , well - tailored traditional suit , starched shirt with French cuffs and perhaps a pocket square to complement an expensive tie .
The entrepreneurial underpinning of the job is a draw to many , giving them control of their destinies in a way most salaried employees can’t achieve .

“ I have never been a big fan of somebody telling me how much money I can make , ” said Matt Heyn , who at 31 is among the younger generation of brokers at CB Richard Ellis .
Heyn drives about 25,000 miles a year leasing office space in northern Los Angeles County and parts of Ventura County .
Like other brokers , he said his job is increasingly demanding , with little time truly off duty , even on nights and weekends .
“ These days , if you do n’t return an e-mail within an hour , people ask why you have n’t gotten back to them , ” said Heyn , who confessed that he was initially interested in commercial real estate because he thought the flexible hours would give him time to play golf .
Even though he is working fast and putting in long hours , anxiety about the economy has meant that transactions are taking longer to put together .
Deals that could have been reached in six months in the past now are taking as long as a year to fall into place -- if they go through at all , he said .

Retail broker Myron Sokolsky of Grubb & Ellis said he worked for almost a year on a transaction that would have brought a new branch of a big national bank to Palmdale .
At the last minute the bank decided that Palmdale was n’t ready , Sokolsky said , and canceled the move .
To meet its contractual obligations , the bank has paid rent on the space for a year and a half but has n’t moved in , which means Sokolsky is still waiting for the second half of his commission , an amount due only when the tenant takes occupancy .
Meanwhile , Sokolsky spends hours each weekend visiting shopping districts to see how the stores are doing .
The former fashion retailer is trying to outsmart the slow market by divining which businesses are struggling , and then approaching their landlords to suggest replacement tenants .
A few brokers seem to have lost hope ; many are living on savings .
They may not be poor , but they ’re not on the gravy train .

Said Muhlstein : “ Too many brokers are defeatist .
Some guys are going to matinees and playing golf instead of focusing on their clients . ”
On a recent afternoon the tall , broad - shouldered broker devoured a tuna sandwich at his desk in Cushman & Wakefield ’s downtown offices .
A shimmering view of Los Angeles stretched out before him , Muhlstein reviewed pending deals with two junior brokers on his team .
Between bites , he talked strategy and fielded calls from clients , occasionally stopping to tap on his computer keyboard .
His office , perched on the 47th floor , was jammed with knickknacks and awards .
After lunch , Muhlstein packed up a battered brown briefcase and set out for NBC Studios in Burbank .
Advertisement
The network recently sold its 34 - acre complex to M. David Paul & Associates , and now the new owner must help NBC attract tenants to studios formerly occupied by “ Last Call With Carson Daly ” and “ The Tonight Show with Jay Leno . ”
Muhlstein pulled off his jacket and ambled around the NBC lot in the hot afternoon sun , examining the studios and other empty buildings that he hoped to help lease .
From NBC , Muhlstein rolled to Los Angeles City Hall .
After half undressing to get through the metal detector without setting off the alarm , Muhlstein rode the restored gold elevator to the 13th floor , where Deputy Mayor Bud Ovrom seemed happy to slip out of a meeting in a conference room to huddle in his office with the salesman .
Ovrum , who heads the city ’s Office of Economic Development , offered cold water and chatted amicably about the real estate market while Muhlstein got around to the point of his visit .
It was high time , he told the policymaker , for the city to offer incentives for companies to move into office buildings in the Playa Vista area , where vacancy rates are nearly 30 % .
The budding office market there looked unstoppable not long ago but now could use a lift .
Advertisement
“ The president of a company needs to say the city came through for him , ” Muhlstein said .
“ They need bragging rights to tell their board . ”
Ovrom offered sympathy but no concessions .
He said he was “ nauseated ” about Fox Interactive Media ’s decision last month to bail out on a planned move to Playa Vista , where it would have occupied half a million square feet .
Maybe , the men allowed , they could find a way to woo Comcast Corp. to Playa Vista .
The nation ’s biggest cable TV operator plans to consolidate regional offices by renting about 400,000 square feet in Burbank , Playa Vista or downtown Los Angeles -- a deal that could save a struggling landlord ’s bacon and lift the fortunes of a wilting neighborhood .
The broker ’s commission would n’t be so bad either .
Advertisement
Coaxing people to move ahead is a required skill for a broker .
Earlier in the day as he inched through freeway traffic from Burbank , Muhlstein tried to get a better offer on a building he ’s trying to sell in Santa Monica .
Muhlstein barked into his phone with mock sternness , this time playing the role of the aggrieved defender as a prospective buyer questioned the worth of a building in Santa Monica .
“ This is USDA Prime real estate , ” he said .
For a broker , red meat .

I decided to write an article about a thing that is second nature to embedded systems programmers – low level bit hacks .
Bit hacks are ingenious little programming tricks that manipulate integers in a smart and efficient manner .
Instead of performing operations ( such as counting the number of 1 bits in an integer ) by looping over individual bits , these programming tricks do the same with one or two carefully chosen bitwise operations .
To get things going , I 'll assume that you know what the two 's complement binary representation of an integer is and also that you know all the the bitwise operations .
I 'll use the following notation for bitwise operations in the article :
& - bitwise and | - bitwise or ^ - bitwise xor ~ - bitwise not << - bitwise shift left >> - bitwise shift right
Numbers in this article are 8 bit signed integers ( though the operations work on arbitrary length signed integers ) that are represented as two 's complement and they are usually named ' x ' .
The result is usually 'y ' .
The individual bits of ' x ' are named b7 , b6 , b5 , b4 , b3 , b3 , b2 , b1 and b0 .
The bit b7 is the most significant bit ( or in signed arithmetic - sign bit ) , and b0 is the least significant .
I 'll start with the most basic bit hacks and gradually progress to more difficult ones .
I 'll use examples to explain how each bithack works .
If you like this topic , you can subscribe to my blog , or you can just read along .
There is also going to be the second part of this article where I 'll cover more advanced bit hacks , and I 'll also release a cheat sheet with all these bit tricks .
Here we go !
Bit Hack # 1 . Check if the integer is even or odd .
if ( ( x & 1 ) == 0 ) { x is even } else { x is odd }
I am pretty sure everyone has seen this trick .
The idea here is that an integer is odd if and only if the least significant bit b0 is 1 .
It follows from the binary representation of ' x ' , where bit b0 contributes to either 1 or 0 .
By AND - ing ' x ' with 1 we eliminate all the other bits than b0 .
If the result after this operation is 0 , then ' x ' was even because bit b0 was 0 .
Otherwise ' x ' was odd .
Let 's look at some examples .
Let 's take integer 43 , which is odd .
In binary 43 is 00101011 .
Notice that the least significant bit b0 is 1 ( in bold ) .
Now let 's AND it with 1 :
00101011 & 00000001 ( note : 1 is the same as 00000001 ) -------- 00000001
See how AND - ing erased all the higher order bits b1 - b7 but left bit b0 the same it was ?
The result is thus 1 which tells us that the integer was odd .
Now let 's look at - 43 .
Just as a reminder , a quick way to find negative of a given number in two 's complement representation is to invert all bits and add one .
So - 43 is 11010101 in binary .
Again notice that the last bit is 1 , and the integer is odd .
( Note that if we used one 's complement it would n't be true ! )
Now let 's take a look at an even integer 98 .
In binary 98 is 1100010 .
01100010 & 00000001
-------- 00000000
After AND - ing the result is 0 .
It means that the bit b0 of original integer 98 was 0 .
Thus the given integer is even .
Now the negative - 98 .
It 's 10011110 .
Again , bit b0 is 0 , after AND - ing , the result is 0 , meaning - 98 is even , which indeed is true .
Bit Hack # 2 . Test if the n-th bit is set .
if ( x & ( 1 < < n ) ) { n-th bit is set } else { n- th bit is not set }
In the previous bit hack we saw that ( x & 1 ) tests if the first bit is set .
This bit hack improves this result and tests if n-th bit is set .
It does it by shifting that first 1 - bit n positions to the left and then doing the same AND operation , which eliminates all bits but n-th .
Here is what happens if you shift 1 several positions to the left :
1 00000001 ( same as 1< <0 ) 1<<1 00000010 1<<2 00000100 1<<3 00001000 1<<4 00010000 1<<5 00100000 1<<6 01000000 1<<7 10000000
Now if we AND 'x ' with 1 shifted n positions to the left we effectively eliminate all the bits but n- th bit in ' x ' .
If the result after AND - ing is 0 , then that bit must have been 0 , otherwise that bit was set .
Let 's look at some examples .
Does 122 have 3rd bit set ?
The operation we do to find it out is :
122 & ( 1<<3 )
Now , 122 is 01111010 in binary .
And ( 1 < < 3 ) is 00001000 .
01111010 & 00001000 -------- 00001000
We see that the result is not 0 , so yes , 122 has the 3rd bit set .
Note :
In my article bit numeration starts with 0 .
So it 's 0th bit , 1st bit , ... , 7th bit .
What about - 33 ?
Does it have the 5th bit set ?
11011111 ( - 33 in binary ) & 00100000 ( 1<<5 ) -------- 00000000
Result is 0 , so the 5th bit is not set .
Bit Hack # 3 .
Set the n-th bit .
y = x | ( 1<<n )
This bit hack combines the same ( 1 < < n ) trick of setting n- th bit by shifting with OR operation .
The result of OR - ing a variable with a value that has n-th bit set is turning that n- th bit on .
It 's because OR - ing any value with 0 leaves the value the same ; but OR - ing it with 1 changes it to 1 ( if it was n't already ) .
Let 's see how that works in action :
Suppose we have value 120 , and we want to turn on the 2nd bit .
01111000 ( 120 in binary ) | 00000100 ( 1<<2 ) -------- 01111100
What about - 120 and 6th bit ?
10001000 ( - 120 in binary ) | 01000000 ( 1<<6 ) -------- 11001000
Bit Hack # 4 . Unset the n-th bit .
y = x & ~ ( 1<<n )
The important part of this bithack is the ~ ( 1 < < n ) trick .
It turns on all the bits except n- th .
Here is how it looks :
~ 1 11111110 ( same as ~ ( 1<<0 ) ) ~( 1<<1 ) 11111101 ~(
1<<2 ) 11111011 ~(
1<<3 ) 11110111 ~(
1<<4 ) 11101111 ~(
1<<5 ) 11011111 ~(
1<<6 ) 10111111 ~(
1<<7 ) 01111111
The effect of AND - ing variable ' x ' with this quantity is eliminating n- th bit .
It does not matter if the n-th bit was 0 or 1 , AND - ing it with 0 sets it to 0 .
Here is an example .
Let 's unset 4th bit in 127 :
01111111 ( 127 in binary ) & 11101111 ( ~ ( 1<< 4 ) ) -------- 01101111
Bit Hack # 5 . Toggle the n-th bit .
y = x ^ ( 1<<n )
This bit hack also uses the wonderful " set n- th bit shift hack " but this time it XOR 's it with the variable ' x ' .
The result of XOR - ing something with something else is that if both bits are the same , the result is 0 , otherwise it 's 1 .
How does it toggle n- th bit ?
Well , if n- th bit was 1 , then XOR - ing it with 1 changes it to 0 ; conversely , if it was 0 , then XOR - ing with with 1 changes it to 1 .
See , the bit got flipped .
Here is an example .
Suppose you want to toggle 5th bit in value 01110101 :
01110101 ^ 00100000 -------- 01010101
What about the same value but 5th bit originally 0 ?
01010101 ^ 00100000
-------- 01110101
Notice something ?
XOR - ing the same bit twice returned it to the same value .
This nifty XOR property is used in calculating parity in RAID arrays and used in simple cryptography cyphers , but more about that in some other article .
Bit Hack # 6 . Turn off the rightmost 1 - bit .
y = x & ( x - 1 )
Now it finally gets more interesting !!!
Bit hacks # 1 - # 5 were kind of boring to be honest .
This bit hack turns off the rightmost one - bit .
For example , given an integer 00101010 ( the rightmost 1 - bit in bold ) it turns it into 00101000 .
Or given 00010000 it turns it into 0 , as there is just a single 1 - bit .
Here are more examples :
01010111 ( x ) & 01010110 ( x - 1 ) -------- 01010110 01011000 ( x ) & 01010111 ( x -1 ) -------- 01010000 10000000 ( x = - 128 ) & 01111111 ( x - 1 = 127 ( with overflow ) )
-------- 00000000 11111111 ( x = all bits 1 ) & 11111110 ( x - 1 ) -------- 11111110 00000000 ( x = no rightmost 1 - bits ) & 11111111 ( x - 1 ) -------- 00000000
Why does it work ?
If you look at the examples and think for a while , you 'll realize that there are two possible scenarios :
The value has the rightmost 1 bit .
In this case subtracting one from it sets all the lower bits to one and changes that rightmost bit to 0 ( so that if you add one now , you get the original value back ) .
This step has masked out the rightmost 1 - bit and now AND - ing it with the original value zeroes that rightmost 1 - bit out .
The value has no rightmost 1 bit ( all 0 ) .
In this case subtracting one underflows the value ( as it 's signed ) and sets all bits to 1 .
AND - ing all zeroes with all ones produces 0 .
Bit Hack # 7 . Isolate the rightmost 1 - bit .
y = x & ( - x )
This bit hack finds the rightmost 1 - bit and sets all the other bits to 0 .
The end result has only that one rightmost 1 - bit set .
For example , 01010100 ( rightmost bit in bold ) gets turned into 00000100 .
Here are some more examples :
10111100 ( x ) & 01000100 ( - x ) -------- 00000100 01110000 ( x ) & 10010000 ( - x ) -------- 00010000 00000001 ( x ) & 11111111 ( - x ) -------- 00000001 10000000 ( x = - 128 ) & 10000000 ( - x = - 128 ) -------- 10000000 11111111 ( x = all bits one ) & 00000001 ( - x ) -------- 00000001 00000000 ( x = all bits 0 , no rightmost 1 - bit ) & 00000000 ( - x ) -------- 00000000
This bit hack works because of two 's complement .
In two 's complement system -x is the same as ~x+1 .
Now let 's examine the two possible cases :
There is a rightmost 1 - bit b i .
In this case let 's pivot on this bit and divide all other bits into two flanks - bits to the right and bits to the left .
Remember that all the bits to the right b i - 1 , b i - 2 ... b 0 are 0's ( because b i was the rightmost 1 - bit ) .
And bits to the left are the way they are .
Let 's call them b i+1 , ... , b n .
Now , when we calculate -x , we first do ~x which turns bit b i into 0 , bits b i - 1 ... b 0 into 1s , and inverts bits b i+1 , ... , b n , and then we add 1 to this result .
Since bits b i - 1 ... b 0 are all 1's , adding one makes them carry this one all the way to bit b i , which is the first zero bit .
If we put it all together , the result of calculating -x is that bits b i+1 , ... , b n get inverted , bit b i stays the same , and bits b i - 1 , ... , b 0 are all 0's .
Now , AND - ing x with -x makes bits b i+1 , ... , b n all 0 , leaves bit b i as is , and sets bits b i - 1 , ... , b 0 to 0 .
Only one bit is left , it 's the bit b i - the rightmost 1 - bit .
There is no rightmost 1 - bit .
The value is 0 .
The negative of 0 in two 's complement is also 0 . 0 & 0 = 0 .
No bits get turned on .
We have proved rigorously that this bithack is correct .
Bit Hack # 8 . Right propagate the rightmost 1 - bit .
y = x | ( x - 1 )
This is best understood by an example .
Given a value 01010000 it turns it into 01011111 .
All the 0 - bits right to the rightmost 1 - bit got turned into ones .
This is not a clean hack , tho , as it produces all 1's if x = 0 .
Let 's look at more examples :
10111100 ( x ) | 10111011 ( x - 1 ) -------- 10111111 01110111 ( x ) | 01110110 ( x - 1 ) -------- 01110111 00000001 ( x ) | 00000000 ( x - 1 ) -------- 00000001 10000000 ( x = - 128 ) | 01111111 ( x - 1 = 127 ) -------- 11111111 11111111 ( x = - 1 ) | 11111110 ( x - 1 = - 2 ) --------
11111111 00000000 ( x ) | 11111111 ( x - 1 ) --------
11111111
Let 's prove it , though not as rigorously as in the previous bithack ( as it 's too time consuming and this is not a scientific publication ) .
There are two cases again .
Let 's start with easiest first .
There is no rightmost 1 - bit .
In that case x = 0 and x - 1 is - 1 . - 1 in two 's complement is 11111111 .
OR -ing 0 with 11111111 produces the same 11111111 .
( Not the desired result , but that 's the way it is . )
There is the rightmost 1 - bit b i .
Let 's divide all the bits in two groups again ( like in the previous example ) .
Calculating x - 1 modifies only bits to the right , turning b i into 0 , and all the lower bits to 1's .
Now OR - ing x with x - 1 leaves all the higher bits ( to the left ) the same , leaves bit b i as it was 1 , and since lower bits are all low 1's it also turns them on .
The result is that the rightmost 1 - bit got propagated to lower order bits .
Bit Hack # 9 . Isolate the rightmost 0 - bit .
y = ~x & ( x+1 )
This bithack does the opposite of # 7 .
It finds the rightmost 0 - bit , turns off all bits , and sets this bit to 1 in the result .
For example , it finds the zero in bold in this number 10101011 , producing 00000100 .
More examples :
10111100 ( x ) -------- 01000011 ( ~x ) & 10111101 ( x+1 ) -------- 00000001 01110111 ( x ) -------- 10001000 ( ~x ) & 01111000 ( x+1 ) -------- 00001000 00000001 ( x ) -------- 11111110 ( ~x ) & 00000010 ( x+1 ) -------- 00000010 10000000 ( x = - 128 ) -------- 01111111 ( ~x ) & 10000001 ( x+1 ) -------- 00000001 11111111 ( x = no rightmost 0 - bit ) -------- 00000000 ( ~x ) & 00000000 ( x+1 ) -------- 00000000 00000000 ( x ) -------- 11111111 ( ~x ) & 00000001 ( x+1 ) -------- 00000001
Proof : Suppose there is a rightmost 0 - bit .
Then ~x turns this rightmost 0 bit into 1 bit .
And so does x+1 ( because bits more right to the rightmost 0 bit are 1's ) .
Now AND - ing ~x with x+1 evaporates all the bits up to this rightmost 0 bit .
This is the highest order bit set in the result .
Now what about lower order bits to the right of rightmost 0 bit ?
They also got evaporated because because x+1 turned them into 0's ( they were 1's ) and ~x turned them into 0's .
They got AND - ed with 0 and evaporated .
Bit Hack # 10 .
Turn on the rightmost 0 - bit .
y = x | ( x+1 )
This hack changes the rightmost 0 - bit into 1 .
For example , given an integer 10100011 it turns it into 10100111 .
More examples :
10111100 ( x ) | 10111101 ( x+1 )
--------
10111101 01110111 ( x ) | 01111000 ( x+1 ) --------
01111111 00000001 ( x ) | 00000010 ( x+1 ) -------- 00000011 10000000 ( x = - 128 ) | 10000001 ( x+1 ) -------- 10000001 11111111 ( x = no rightmost 0 - bit ) | 00000000 ( x+1 ) --------
11111111 00000000 ( x ) | 00000001 ( x+1 ) -------- 00000001
Here is the proof as a bunch of true statements .
OR - ing x with x+1 does not lose any information .
Adding 1 to x fills the first rightmost 0 .
The result is max{x , x+1} .
If x+1 overflows it 's x and there were no 0 bits .
If it does n't , it 's x+1 which just got rightmost bit filled with 1 .
Hacker 's Delight
There 's a book 300 pages long entirely about bit hacks like these .
It 's called Hacker 's Delight .
Take a look .
If you liked the contents of my post , then you 'll love this book .
Bonus stuff
If you decide to play more with these hacks , here are a few utility functions to print binary values of 8 bit signed integers in Perl , Python and C .
Print binary representation in Perl :
sub int_to_bin { my $ num = shift ; print unpack " B8 " , pack " c " , $ num ; }
Or you can print it from command line right away :
perl - wle ' print unpack " B8 " , pack " c " , shift ' < integer > #
For example : perl - wle ' print unpack " B8 " , pack " c " , shift ' 113 01110001 perl - wle ' print unpack " B8 " , pack " c " , shift ' -- -128 10000000
Print binary number in Python :
def int_to_bin( num , bits=8 ) : r = '' while bits : r = ( ' 1 ' if num &1 else ' 0 ' ) + r bits = bits - 1 num = num >>
1 print r
Print binary representation in C :
void int_to_bin( int num ) { char str [ 9 ] = { 0} ; int i ; for ( i=7 ; i>=0 ; i--) { str[ i ] = ( num &1 ) ?'1':'0 ' ; num >>= 1 ; } printf ( " %s
" , str ) ; }
Have fun with these .
I 'll write about advanced bit hacks next .

Sony have finally unveiled Trico or , as it has been renamed , The Last Guardian , at E3 .
The previously leaked footage has been given an update and and , my God , it looks good .
It is much the same as the previous footage but the visuals have definitely been improved and we are given a little gameplay towards the end .
Team ICO ’s previous work is worshipped by many and this looks like a new masterpiece for us all .
Jack did n’t slip us a release date but it will be top of the posting priority when we know , so do n’t panic – we want this as much as you do .
Oh and it ’s another exclusive just for us PS3 owners .

Prime Ministers personal handling of the business conflict in the town of Pikalevo has set a precedent in the public dressing - down of the countrys top businessmen for neglecting their social responsibility .
More interesting is the fact that one of the people receiving the dressing - down was one of Russias most famous businessmen , Oleg Deripaska , who used to be the richest man in the country until the global financial crisis left him heavily in debt .
The high - point of the show was Putin virtually arm - twisting him into signing a contract , which was needed for the factory to start working again .
During the meeting , chaired by Putin , Deripaska was obviously unnerved , with cameras catching his every move and facial expression .
Never before has a person of his caliber been publicly humiliated this way in modern Russia .
Theism faces the problem of evil : why , in a universe created by a perfectly good being , do bad things happen ?
This has been variously answered by the creation by God of free will , a concept that turns out to be slippery to define , the existence a lesser deity that does evil , or just that God 's ways are inscruitable .
Atheists face the opposite problem : how does good come to exist in a universe governed only by laws of physics ?
The theory of evolution by natural selection , in particular the theory of kin selection , predicts that people should care only for themselves and to a lesser extent their relatives .
Atheists have answered this problem in various ways .
Under certain contrived circumstances , selfish people will act for the common good .
This has been particularly studied in the case of the prisoner 's dilemma game repeated a random number of times ( i.e. unknown to the participants ) .
Games such as this are the basis of our economic system ( in theory at least ) .
They have the useful property that we can model them with some accuracy , using game theory .
This gets us some way to an answer , but it does not explain why people not only sometimes act good , but seem to actually be good .
One answer , which seems to be in fashion at the moment , is that humans with their novel capacity for reason can transcend the desires programmed by evolution .
While this is not a theistic answer , it is an appeal to the supernatural , and I am personally unconvinced .
It also has the problem that we can not model it with game theory .
Even if people can transcend , the rational agents of game theory can not , and so whenever we try to construct mathematical models we fall back to the idea that people are selfish and that good is only a fortunate accident .
My own answer is that under the right circumstances it is rational to decide to become a person who cares for other people 's welfare .
I present my answer in the form of a two player platform game , in order to demonstrate that it is amenable to modeling .
You will need Python 2 and PyGame :
TPOG has been tested under Linux , but should work on other platforms .
This is GPL software , please tinker with it .
The game graphics are from Danc 's awesome PlanetCute sprite set .
You control Player 1 , the computer controls Player 2 .
The goal of the game is the same for both of you : to collect as many stars as possible .
Each star is worth 10 points .
Other things being equal , Player 2 is lazy .
She wo n't help you unless she has a reason to do so , even if this is at no cost to her , except by accident .
She assumes the same of you .
You can move and jump by pressing the arrow keys .
You can fall in love with Player 2 by pressing the " L " key .
This means you will act as though Player 2 collecting a star is worth 5 points to you .
This simulates the same amount of love as kin selection predicts siblings should feel towards each other [ 1 ] .
Points will be deducted for bad role - playing .
Similarly Player 2 may decide to fall in love with you .
Falling in love is visible to the other player .
Otherwise there would be no reason to ever do this .
The game presents several different scenarios .
Each scenario is independent .
At the start of each scenario , both players are purely selfish .
Your actions in a previous scenario have no effect on the next one .
There are a few things I have not implemented in this game that would bring it closer to real life .
Diminishing returns on stars .
Presently players in love will not share stars .
If they can , they will take them all for themselves for values of love less than 100 % , or give them all to the other player for values of love greater than 100 % .
Diminishing returns would cause players to share stars , allowing more possibilities for cooperation .
Chance events .
If there are chance events , mutual love can serve as an insurance policy .
Hidden or simulataneous moves .
Simulataneous moves are somewhat more difficult to model than turn taking .
Mutual love is a way to solve the notorious prisoner 's dilemma game , which involves simultaneous moves .
More than two players in the universe .
Finally , a couple of notes on how this effect , if it exists , should appear in the real world .
There is not enough time in an individual 's lifetime to learn how best to use this effect .
Our genes would have evolved to optimize the overall strategy , and prompt us to implement it using their usual proddings of emotion .
So I would expect our subjective experience of it would be a strong desire to enter into such arrangements , and pleasure upon doing so -- much as we feel hunger , and satisfaction from eating , or curiosity , and pleasure at finding things out .
The evolution of the ability to alter one 's motivations should be trivial , but the necessary corresponding ability to assess the motivations of others , which is what makes this first ability useful , is more difficult .
However , I think it should be within the capabilities of at least most mammals .
Suitably constructed behavioral experiments on animals should be able to detect these abilities .
This TED talk by Rebecca Saxe looks like a good start investigating the ability of humans to assess the motivations of others , by temporarily disabling this ability via Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation .
[ 1 ]
Of course , according to my theory , siblings may rationally decide to care for each other somewhat more than this .
By Andrew Benson
BBC Sport in Monaco
Jenson Button extended his championship lead with a fifth victory in six races as he led Rubens Barrichello to a Brawn one - two in the Monaco Grand Prix .
Button sealed his victory in the early stages of the race , when he managed the deteriorating tyres on his car far better than his Brazilian team - mate .
Barrichello was left to hold off the Ferraris of Kimi Raikkonen and Felipe Massa , who finished third and fourth .
Red Bull 's Mark Webber was fifth with world champion Lewis Hamilton 12th .
Williams 's Nico Rosberg , Renault 's Fernando Alonso and the Toro Rosso of Frenchman Sebastien Bourdais filled the remaining points places down to eighth .
McLaren driver Hamilton was never in contention after making a disastrous mistake to crash out in qualifying and then starting at the back of the grid after a penalty for changing his gearbox .
I 'm lost for words about him [ Button ] because he 's exceeding everything I thought possible .
Stunning
Brawn GP team boss Ross Brawn
In contrast , the man who looks increasingly likely to succeed him to the crown had a flawless afternoon .
His only mistake came after the chequered flag when he parked his car in the wrong place and had to run back along the pit straight for the podium ceremony .
Button 's victory extends his world championship lead over Barrichello to 16 points - and to 28 over the third - placed man , Red Bull 's Sebastian Vettel , who scored no points after crashing out of the race .
It was Button 's first win at Formula 1's most glamorous venue , and the drive of a champion in the making , taking advantage of circumstances as they unfolded to carve an unassailable winning margin .
" Before the weekend I said this race does n't mean anything different from any other , that was more to stop the pressure building up on me , " he told BBC Sport .
" It 's a bit of a lie really .
" We all know the truth - this circuit is fantastic .
" I said on the radio : ' we 've got Monaco , baby ' .
We 've got the victory and that means a lot , a one - two here is exceptional .
It 's going to go down in history [ what this team has achieved ] this year , for sure . "
His team boss , Ross Brawn , added : " I 'm lost for words with him because he 's exceeding everything I thought possible .
Stunning . "
Unlike all the other front - runners , the Brawns started on the super - soft tyres , which give better initial grip , but are subject to graining , when the surface of the tyre rips and reduces grip .
Button and Barrichello both suffered the problem from about eight laps into the race but Button coped much better and was able to extend his lead by as much as two seconds a lap .
That meant that Barrichello , who was less than two seconds behind his team - mate on lap six , was 18.2secs adrift by the time he made his first pit stop on 16 .
From that moment on , the race was effectively over , and Barrichello was left to concern himself far more with the Ferraris behind him rather than with beating Button to the victory .
" The tyres gave us a start , but we did n't expect them to give us so much trouble in the first stint , " added Brawn .
" But the drivers managed it well .
" It is a special race and it's a challenging weekend .
In such circumstances , to come first and second is stunning . "
Constructors champions Ferrari achieved their first podium of 2009 as they bid to recover from the worst start to a season in their long history .
Though Raikkonen and Massa were evenly matched , the Finn was able to convert his second place on the grid into third place , while Massa was caught up in some frenetic action in the opening laps .
606 : DEBATE
Three straight wins for the same engine - Mercedes .
It just goes to show how reliability and performance has moved forward in leaps and bounds in the world of motorsport ...
Philinux " I am very happy about the result because it shows we are working in the right direction , " said Ferrari team boss Stefano Domencali .
" We are catching up and getting closer .
I am very positive we will push on and this is just a start . "
Brazil 's Massa trailed Vettel from the start and soon began to climb all over the back of the German 's car as the Red Bull driver suffered similar tyre problems to the Brawns .
There was soon a huge queue behind him , right down to 12th place and by lap 10 , Vettel 's tyres were in such poor shape that he was no longer able to resist his pursuers .
First Rosberg - who had passed Massa after the Ferrari driver tried an overtaking manoeuvre at the chicane that did not come off - powered past the Red Bull , and then the others poured past , too , before Vettel pitted for new tyres at the end of the lap .
His race ended six laps later when he slammed into the barrier at Sainte Devote after making a mistake .
His team - mate Webber was much more impressive , jumping ahead of Rosberg at the first stops thanks to some consistently fast laps and consolidating that position through the middle of the race .
Hamilton , Monaco GP winner in 2008 , said he felt " quite satisfied " with his performance and vowed to return to Monte Carlo stronger .
" I was thinking of the ' Rocky ' films .
In the first one , he said ' I just want to see the end of the fight ' .
I pushed as hard as I could .
" Of course , I will be back next year to try and win . "

Welcome to Play Motorbike Games .
We have a large selection of dirt bike games , freestyle motocross games , ATV games and other 2D vehicle games available to play online .
This is my first time watching a high quality video of this trailer .
Upon watching it , I noticed something ...
The green guy , did he look and sound like Kevin Flynn ( possibly his program , Clu ) or was that just me ?
Maybe that 's why he knew Kevin Flynn was up there , because he 's connected to his user , after all ?
I also wonder if it has any connections to the Tron 2.0 game , maybe mentioning Alan and Jetthro Bradley ?
Also , I noticed that system programs tend to be red and regular programs to be blue .
Green programs , however , were corrupted programs in Tron 2.0 .
So either the green program in the trailer is Flynn 's corrupted program , or the movie has it's own direction and made green programs as users or some such .

It is rhetoric from people like Bill O'Reilly that has caused the death of this man .
No matter which side of the argument you are on .
This doctor performed legal surgeries .
Bill O' Reilly is a scumbag , and should be held accountable for his violent rhetoric .

O'reilly is such a hypocrit , he reports the news but he reports the news for FOX , when will people realize the the FOX news is not fair and balanced , its strictly for republicans anything that Obama do thats good , FOX news and their commentators will find something wrong with it .
O'Reilly , Hannity , & Beck are all old white men who think that the world should be based on their beliefs but in reality the world is would be better off if they was off the air !

Whoa , total word twisting going on - maybe o'reilly did n't come out swinging to show a little respect for a murdered man -how ever much he disagreed with WHAT the man did .
Call a spade a spade - what dr tiller did indeed do was kill babies in a quite barbaric fashion - for anyone who has children , u know that at 24 weeks , a fetus is considered viable .
Any hospital will use extraordinary measures to preserve a baby 's life .
This doctor did indeed kill babies .
Did he deserve to be murdered ?
No .
Did bill o'reilly calling dr tiller " the baby killer " cause an extremist to pick up a gun , walk into a church and shoot someone ?
Use ur common sense ... of course not .
For olbermann and maddow to get all nuts about it and rant about bill o'reilly taking responsibility is just ridiculous .

If there is actually such a thing as " evil , " O'Reilly is it .
Stupidity is one thing ; but to be gifted with an ability to convince people and then use it only to play games is something different and far worse .
O'Reilly probably believes exactly what his instincts tell him will get him the most money .
He probably thinks he is " clever . "
He should go to jail over this murder but , no , I do n't expect he 'll suffer one moment 's harm or a single second thought .

It 's staggering to think that you people think waterboarding a terrorist who would blow this nation up in a heartbeat is torture , but stabbing a unborn baby in the back of the head with scissors and then suctioning its brains out before you pull it out of it's mother 's womb is a woman 's CHOICE !
I would like to give you a CHOICE of being water boarded or suffering the fate of a late term aborted baby .
Which would you prefer ?
You have some very perverted " ideals . "

Didn't Oberman and Maddow see how obviously they were attempting to influence hatred towards O'Reilly ?
What will their response be if someone offs Bill ?
O'Reilly was catering to his audience and pulling in viewers as is his job .
If anyone is really guilty ( besides the murderer and our society 's lack - o - dazeicle firearm control )
It would be the Kansas legal system for giving Tiller the blind eye he paid dearly for .

Bill O'Reilly is not the slightest bit responsible for this killing , and you know it .
There is one and only one person to blame for this crime , and that is the shooter .
By the way , if I use your " logic " , I can thus proclaim that Code Pink , World Can't Wait , Medea Benjamin and a host of other yahoos are responsible for some anti-military nut killing some people outside a Little Rock recruiting center today .

not likely , liberals do n't incite or condone violence to achieve their ends , unlike neocon christo - fascists .
Obviously the little rock incident was a right wingers response to the horrific impact the church murder was going to have , just like the woman who carved a B on her own face , and then lied about it .

Have they accused O'Reilly of being a murderer , executing thousands , breaking the law , and carrying out a slaughter ?
Yes , if they demonized O'Reilly in that way , and someone took action on it , they too would need to be held accountable .
But they have n't .
On the other hand , O'Reilly did .

Feel free to show me where .
In the meantime , I was on the radio in San Francisco tonight explaining that O'Reilly was not " responsible " for the killing , only for helping to incite the sort of hatred that encourages such acts of terror by the type who would kill Tiller and / or then come out and applaud the murder , as so many of you wingnuts have so far done --- on this site , and so many others .
It seems we now have an American Taliban in this country , and their terrorism works .
Be sure to check out the Rachel Maddow video I just added above , featuring one of the founders of the anti-choice rightwing , who exposes how folks like you have been purposely manipulated by these cons , and how sorry he is to have ever taken part in the terror scam .

Do cable stations have to get a license , Phil ?
Is n't that only terrestrial ( air ) TV and radio ?
BTW , either way , cable , just as with air stations , live off the government dole ( air stations by the free licenses their granted to use our public airwaves , cable by the subsidies and dispensations they get to run their monopoly ) , and so I agree they should have to take responsibility for what they do .
But just do n't know if cable content providers ( channels ) have to get licenses to broadcast at all .

Over the air frequency allocations , station licenses .
Yes yes .
Change the law .
Current Law is flawed .
Public Files are the answer !
My FOCUS is public spectrum .
" The free licenses they are granted to use our public airwaves " --- CAN BE DENIED .
Perhaps I am in the strange situation since I grew up two blocks away from FOX 40 on Fruitridge Road .
So when I say FOX , that 's what I mean , over the air , receive via rabbit ears .
( now rabbit ears + converter box )
You wanna be a shock jock , or XXX rated channel , hard core music like me ?
Cable , or public access is your entry point .
However with that said , Cables , cross our roads , under our streets , have ease ways .
There may be an angle there as well .
I do n't know about that .
I am concerned with transmitters , satellites , public spectrum and regulation -- the ENGINEERS need to be running the show not big money , and NOT big government .
Brad asked
" Do cable stations have to get a license , Phil ? "
I am on public access which is based off of COMCAST .
( PEG ) Programming , _P_ublic _E_ducational and _G_overnmental programming .
They DO have to have a license .
And although you can complain , I do n't think they have to have a public file like a station using spectrum does .
But anybody acting in a responsible way running such a station would obviously be documenting everything , complaints or complements .
It 's all common sense .
Something I think our country has completely lost because of our crappy leadership and greed .
I know WHY your asking ..
e.g. kill off the worst of the worst e.g.
FOX , however I would have to say their 1st amendment trumps our hatred .
On the other hand when FOX LOCAL runs FOX NETWORK and lies and propaganda spew through , the public has all the right to shut their fruitridge road station down .
( Using FOX for an example ) Howard Stern should be allowed on cable , just like religious programming is .
Just like MY show is .
Just like FOX is .
But the LOCAL stations they get away with bloody murder in my opinion .
My # 1 Pet Peeve is electronic voting machine coverage , I have watched year after bloody year as they do n't investigate shit , completely ignore the PHYSICS OF ELECTRONICS and run pure propaganda or a short 30 second piece of crap nonsense , when the rest of their hour is OJ , Brittney , or Sports .
What do you think the people watching remember ?
Oh no wonder when you ask someone on the street what an electronic vote tabulation device is they look like your trying to rob them !
As far as radio goes , I do n't know much .
There 's AM , there 's FM , there HAM , CB , low power FM , wireless nets , gps , etc , etc .
Alternatively , if we can not get the FCC to clean this shit up , then there needs to be a new public over the air station ( paid for BY the fcc ) which is allowed to COUNTER ALL ASPECTS of corporate media .
It 's my opinion and I am sticking to it

Too Little Too late on O'Reilly .
The man is a Yellow Journalistic Menace .
In fact , I hesitate to include Journalism in this sentence because it has O'Reilly 's name in it .
Dr Tiller helped women who were in terrible straights .
When you can get pregnant , and you learn what can go wrong , the pregnancies this Doctor dealt with , are the stuff of nightmares for pregnant women .
And he had the compassion and the courage to help them through these difficult times , when they had to make what is probably the toughest decision of their lives .
I have yet to meet any little girl who says : " Golly Gee , I Can't wait til I can Menstruate , so I can get knocked up and have an abortion Mommy ! "
Abortion is not the first choice for most women .
And truthfully in the end , it does n't matter .
Women are either Free. Or . They are subject to special rules and punishments that rest on their unique reproductive capabilities .
No one could stop women seeking this Dr Tiller out for his services .
And they were legal services that were needed .
Targeting pregnant women would be Bad Public Relations .
So they targeted the Doctor and his staff for the last 20 or so years .
And when they couldnt shut him down professionally , they had him killed .
The Anti-Choicers put a hit out on him , just like they have other Doctors and Nurses who support a woman 's right to choose .
The entire movement is guilty of Domestic Terrorism .
If not directly , then certainly culpable for inciting violence and hatecrimes , Stalking , and terroristic acts such as sniper shootings , bombs , anthrax mailings , and other acts meant to intimidate and cause fear through threats of violence .
Its time that Christian Supremacists stop getting special rights .
They are subject to the law just like everyone else .
Not some Tribal Biblical Law , but THE LAW , on our books , that runs our courts .
They do not have the right to force their religious beliefs on other American Citizens under threat of death or maiming .

A comment by Randall Terry , founder of Operation Rescue , underscores why anti-abortion fanatics do n't have a clue : Pro-life leaders and the pro-life movement are not responsible for George Tiller ’s death .
George Tiller was a mass murderer and , horrifically , he reaped what he sewed .
Dr. Tiller was not " a murderer " or a " baby killer " -- not in the eyes of the law which does not regard an unborn fetus as a " baby . "
As Keith Olbermann observed last night on " Countdown " :
Two months ago , Dr. Tiller acquitted on charges he performed illegal late term abortions .
In 2003 Kansas law permitted late term abortions when two independent doctors agree a pregnant woman would be irreparably harmed by giving birth --- abortion in this country legal for the past 36 years .
While O'Reilly cannot be prosecuted for his remarks , his repeated efforts to dehumanize Dr. Tiller by falsely accusing him of the crime of " baby killing " ( which , if performed after a live birth and premeditated would have subjected the perpetrator to a first degree murder charge ) is a vicious libel .
It is disingenuous for Terry & O'Reilly to now try and distance themselves from an act of domestic terrorism their despicable slanders encouraged --- the same type of hate speech that brought out wing - nuts shouting " kill him " ( with reference to our President ) at Sara Palin rallies .
You can't play judge and jury in falsely convicting someone of a crime , then deny responsibility when a wing - nut vigilante carries out the sentence .
You can't light a fuse and then claim you are blameless when the bomb goes off .
Finally , if one wants to get beyond the process dehumanized caricature created by the likes of the Faux News Network , I would strongly urge watching Democracy Now 's excellent tribute in which you can hear the man , himself , describe his work .
As observed by his colleague , Dr. Shelly Sella , now afraid to appear on camera :
He was an exceptional man , an exceptional caregiver .
He trusted women .
He had faith in women .
And that came through in his work and in his life and the way that he treated patients and the way that he treated everyone who worked with him .
And that ’s really what drew me to work with him : his philosophy and his approach to women ’s healthcare .

An inadequate vocabulary or just sexual frustration .
So who cares , what have you been doing working on your incomplete sentences ?
or is it your psychological operation skills ?
Obviously you 've made your choice of who is right and who is wrong , you want to live in the gutter , your going to wake up smelling like sewage .
It 's the removal of public oversight in elections because of electronic vote tabulation devices , dirty tricks .
Watching the results of this infiltrate and corrupt our elections , watch as the this same corruption slowly transforms America from a constitutional republic , to the lawless state we have now .
All in a few short years .
unvalidatable electronic vote tabulation devices
false flags
broken oaths of office
spying
fascist media
abuse of state secrets to hide crime
the looting of our monetary system

murder
What 's not to scream " fuck " about ?
Or do you enjoy pretending to live under a rock ?
Maybe you 'd rather target folks who are trying to make a difference while ignoring facts ?
Or maybe you just pray we remain ignorant and keep supporting the same failed ( D ) vs. ( R ) arguments while everything goes to shit ?
It 's much easier to attack me , than to clean up the corruption in government , or get the propaganda off our airwaves .
It 's easier to start a flame war , than to actually try to solve anything .
Or perhaps your masters only allow you to stir the pot with anonymous two liners ?
I 'm sure if you sleep for only a few more hours , you ought to be able to spin where I said , " Okay , fuck America , I am just a fucking 2 AM rant .. " to where I somehow hate America .
Or want to rape Americans .
I admit that was a poor choice of words , leaving myself completely open to thought nazi's .
If I was n't tired , I might have said ,
" Okay , fuck people , ... "
But then you would probably argue I was trying to " fuck people . "
And you still would n't allow the intent of what I meant .
I mean hell you 've had your morning coffee already , right ?
Get busy , mangle what I said , I 'm sure by the end of the day you can remix it and have me rendered , interrogated , tortured and hung .
One more for the fema camp , one less honorable veteran to deal with .
Who hates America now ?
Is it the one screaming fuck this and fuck that or is it the anonymous two liner ?
I 'm sure America can see who quite clearly now .
When folks like you are threatened by a 2 AM rant from folks like me .
yeah 2 am and it's already 8:30 am ... tick tock .
I might have ruined this thread , but I did n't ruin America .

is there any way we could use it to help get the real news out to peops ?

This guy terminatd 60,000 fetuses over his 35 year ' career ' .
He is a criminal .
I feel sorry for his family and the babies he killed ( late - term abortions ) .
He made 1 million dollars a year .
Why do people think that late - term abortions is not a criminal and inhumane act ?
Babies can survive when they 're premature .
He killed them and he must answer for his crimes .
Like I said earlier , I only wish he was behind bars instead of getting the easy way out .
The nut who killed him was wrong and he will and should be locked up forever .

" my tv went fuzzy , on c span no less "
" is there any exsisting law on the books about censorship " Basically it 's called jamming the signal .

It 's actually an electronic countermeasure .
And it 's pretty common .
Yeah the FCC has laws for it .
However such laws may be trumped by top down orders from the military or other officials .
In other words they 'll look the other way when it 's information warfare , Broadcasters can claim they had a technical problem , which can be used for plausible deniability , which is then fed to the public .
I still believe a Public File would be better than what we have today .
Which is basically nothing but a bunch of arguing and blogging with no legal teeth to bite back .
The thing with a Public File is it can bite .
The hard part is to figuring out how to jam it down the FCC's ( an appointed position ) throat .

Abortion is a difficult issue .
I believe most of us - regardless of which side we are on - are uncomfortable with the so called Chinese abortion .
Which was brought on by the Chinese law allowing only one child per family .
It involves the drowning or suffocating of the child shortly after birth if they are not of the desired gender .

While you may not care for the Rule of Law , we have one , and I 'd think folks who call themselves " conservative " would have more respect for it .
" Murder " is defined by law .
In 35 years of practice in KS , Tiller was never found guilty of " murder " .
He was acquited , as recently as two months ago no other charges as well .
O'Reilly accused him of murder and execution , and of protecting child rapists .
All of which would be illegal .
Tiller was not charged , nor found guilty of any such thing .
That ( among so much else on a daily , documented basis ) is what O'Reilly said that was not true .

I must be the only post - abortion woman that is posting a comment , or is it that on one elses was published ?
Let me tell you from personal expierence that abortion is WRONG .
It not only is murdering of an unborn child , but the physical , emotional , and mental damage that is done to a woman is not being told by anyone in the abortion industry .
Telling a woman that it is a simple procedure is an out and out lie .
And yes it is an industry , because it is a money maker , and the abortionist can be any kind of a doctor , who is paid in cash , therefore does not pay any taxes , and the clinics are not regulated by the board of health .
So much for George Tiller respecting women .
Any one who choses to take a life , is violating Gods law , regardless if it is legal in any state .
And anyone who puts any law above Gods law is making themselves god , because they are making the decision of who has the right to live and die .
When they are not the one who created the life .
And we wonder why the United States is on its was to destruction .
This country has come down to a moral free - for - all , and anyone who holds fast to the foundations of our fore fathers is considered an extreme right winger and / or terrorist .

And as for " post- abortion woman " ...
I have known many women who have had that sad duty , and to a woman they had chosen it because they knew either that they could not cope with the pregnancy , or give a baby ( or another baby ) a decent life .
No one is ever happy to do it .
Plenty later wish their circumstances had been such that they could have had the babies , but , I am very thankful to be someone who does n't know anyone hypocritical enough to later say it was wrong to make that difficult decision in the first place .
We all are doing the best we can with what we have when we sit down to make these hard choices in our lives .

Fetuses older than 24 weeks can sometimes survive outside the womb with extreme amounts of technology , true .
So can frozen embryos .
I do n't hear any accusations of fertility doctors being called " baby - killers " because some perfectly viable embryos are destroyed rather than implanted .
Some perfectly viable embryos are even destroyed in the womb to give other embryos a fighting chance .
The octomom did n't want any of them destroyed and yet many of us , including probably some of the " baby - killer " pot - bangers , have chastised her for her selfishness .
Fertility doctors and those who seek treatment should be called " baby - killers ! "
Of course I do n't mean it , but the hypocritical anti-abortion right by and large do n't mean it either .
The logic they use to identify fetuses as babies ought to extend to embryos as well .
All partners who engage in intercourse where the woman is using an IUD ought to , by the same twisted logic , be called baby - killers as well .
An IUD prevents implantation of viable embryos .
Ignoring these facts but targeting abortion seekers and providers is just more sick hypocritical logic used by the " woman - killers . "

The fact that the mother 's life is on the line , and only then , is the procedure so spoken of by the " pro-life " people .
Is allowing the mother to die , pro life ?
How kind is it to bring a child into a world when one cannot fairly support him / her ?
The legal point in the pregnancy , where an abortion is allowed , without the mother 's life in jeapordy , the question still is unanswered , what constitutes a human conscience ?
Is a bumble bee ?
How conscience is the fetus ?
Is it fair to let the fetus grow into a child , when a child is required to have the right conditions to develop further into a healthy adult ?
How would it feel to carry the fetus into developing into a baby , and give birth to he / her and hand the child you carried to someone else , never to see them again ?
How would it feel to be a child and find out , your mother as you know her , is not your mother afterall , by blood , but your " siblings " are her natural children ?
The bottom line is , the mother 's life is viable .
The fetus is still a controversey at whatever stage is considered a definite human life .
The mother 's body , is owned by the woman , and our uteruses should be our OWN domain to do what we think is best for ourselves and / or humanity .
Often times , NOT having a child is more humane than having a child .
It 's more fun for them , these Theocratts , to jump up and down and act self - righteous though .
Oh , those same people , think that bombing civillian population , in countries where huge oil reserves are underground there , is a " nice " and " freedom bringing " kinda thing to do .
Then , they deny the professional statisticians estimates on how many actual breathing ( now not breathing ) human beings get slaughtered , and its many many many children that are long since out of the womb .

YouPoll Should O'Reilly & Hannity be charged with inciting violence ?
Conservative radio host , popular onetime Hannity guest , charged with inciting violence
Added 5 hours ago on June 4th , 2009
Reactionary radio host and white supremacist Hal Turner was taken into custody Wednesday after remarks urging Catholics to " take up arms " against two Connecticut lawmakers and a state ethics official over legislation being considered in the state legislature regarding the church .
Connecticut Capitol police got a warrant for Turner 's arrest .
The Hartford Courant fills in the details : Turner , who has been identified as a white supremacist and anti-Semite by several anti-racism groups , hosts an Internet radio program with an associated blog .
On Tuesday , the blog included a post that promised to release the home addresses of state Rep. Michael Lawlor , state Sen. Andrew McDonald and Thomas Jones of the State Ethics Office . " Mr. Turner 's comments are above and beyond the threshold of free speech , " Capitol Police Chief Michael J. Fallon said in an e-mail announcing the warrant .
" He is inciting others through his website to commit acts of violence and has created fear and alarm .
He should be held accountable for his conduct .
"
The remarks on the blog were a reaction to the recent controversy over a bill that would have changed the way the Roman Catholic Church is governed , taking power away from church officials and turning it over to lay members .
It was pulled in mid-March following an outcry from Catholics across the state and questions about its constitutionality .

Lora ,
If you are convinced beyond any doubt based on this evidence , then there is nothing really to say back to you .
If you did your research well on this , you will see that it is a wide debate among researchers which directly impacts this issue .
Since , there are numerous studies stating there is pain at a much earlier stage , I use this point merely as an emotional point to get at people 's hearts .
Beyond that , I live in a totally different world than you do .
In my society children are a blessing and pregnancy , while difficult , is the process to having a child .
My wife and I have two young boys .
The thought of abortion in anything less than life and death or rape , even if the pregnancy is unplanned seems impossible to me .
Unfortunately , you live in a world where children are a burden to the progress of women 's careers .
Maybe if women would understand that men work because they have to , and that money is earned and spent , but their contribution and purpose is fleeting short of that .
Women have the blessing to have and raise children , a pursuit which is eternal .
I 'm so sorry that women wish to attain equality by leading the same meaningless lives of most men who sole purpose is to make money to pay bills .
The modern feminist movement dealt a real death blow to a woman 's self esteem by telling them that if you do n't have a career like a man then you are fighting for equality .
Where do children fit in to your life view or world picture ?
Look at the birth rates today in the first world countries and you 'll see that they do n't .
The real fight here is what about the children in the society .
That 's what the pro-life people scream about , only to be answered back " woman 's rights . "
So where do kids fit in ?
A woman has every right not to have children .
If she can and chooses not to , I can almost guarantee you she will leading an emptier life .
In my society there are almost no abortions , large families , virtually no teen pregnancy or drug use and a tiny divorce rate .
I 'm fine , and so is my community .
Your society is a mess .
I feel for you that a man whose life was spent killing babies is considered a hero for women .
Get some inspiring heroes that encourage life and family and your society might actually survive .
Good luck .

You 've made a lot of assumptions about me that are untrue .

The tendency for several sci- fi alien species to merely be one or two facial features away from humanity .
Sometimes they 're not even that far away .
They look totally human and sound human .
In some cases , this may well be a disguise or A Form You Are Comfortable With , but in others this appears to be their natural appearance .
See Human Aliens .
You'd think that alien species would be radically different — insectoids , three - legged wombats , giant cats , etc. — but animal - cruelty laws tend to discourage fitting animals with prosthetics , and the effects budget only allows for latex and makeup , so we get humans with brow ridges , humans with extra nostrils , humans with Pointy Ears , humans with bony protrusions , and so on .
( Of course , the makers of Star Wars found a way around this by building and operating startlingly lifelike puppets , making Humanoid Aliens and Starfish Aliens possible . )
One odd consequence of this , however , is that in the Federation Council scenes in the Star Trek movies , you often see very strange , non-humanoid ( or only partly humanoid ) aliens , because the movies have the necessary additional budget for them .
These additional races are , of course , never seen in the TV series at all .
Advertisement :
Gene Roddenberry gave more reasons for this in an interview once .
Budget constraints aside , if you try to make aliens look completely alien , you 'll firstly make them look ridiculous ( cf. Doctor Who ) , and secondly make it doubly hard for the actor playing the alien to do anything mildly resembling acting .
This has actually been isolated to extremely specific requirements : if an audience can't see an actor 's eyes or mouth , their ability to empathize with or emotionally invest in that character is significantly impaired .
This is one reason why mooks , especially SF mooks like the Cylons or the Imperial Stormtroopers , are so often uniformed in face - obscuring helmets .
While not totally undoable with the post TOS Star Trek budget , the flamboyant and outlandish alien designs of Star Wars appeal to a more pulp Space Opera aesthetic from which Star Trek has historically chosen to distance itself , at least onscreen ; the expanded universe of comics and novels is a different beast .
Additionally , Roddenberry had always insisted that Star Trek was about human issues and that the aliens are intended as vehicles for social commentary .
This required aliens that may have been scientifically implausible ( humanoid appearance , ability to communicate in English and emote like humans , etc ) but easy for the human characters to interact with and the audience to relate to in the narrative .
Trek fans may assume that the pure hard SF adventures and alien encounters occur offscreen .

The anime equivalent is the alien with Pointy Ears , colorful facial markings , chromatic skin tones ( sometimes hair too , if Humans are restricted to normal colors ) , or cutesy animal - like traits .
Rubber foreheads also tend to be paired up with Humans Are White for some reason , likely the fact that back in the 60s /70s it was easier to get a black , Latino , or Asian actor on TV by gluing something to their heads and claiming that they were raceless otherworldly beings instead .
You will virtually never see a Caucasian - coloured Klingon , which means that the makeup department actually has to do a lot more work when a white actor plays one .
Another more scientific explanation of this is the theory that most advanced alien species will look roughly similar to humans due to the soap bubble theory that our physical layout is the most efficient one for an oxygen - breathing carbon - based life form .
Indeed , Star
Trek eventually stated that all of the human - like species in their universe originated from a common ancestor species that seeded life on other planets to encourage similar evolutionary roots , with an image of the ancestors being generally lacking in any notable features themselves .
The next step past Rubber Forehead Aliens ( catlike or buglike or lizardlike aliens that can still sit in chairs and hold weapons ) is Humanoid Aliens , possibly overlapping with Intelligent Gerbils .
Contrast with Starfish Aliens .
The Uncanny Valley can result if your RF Alien looks a little too human .
Possible sister trope to Bizarre Alien Limbs , if the make - up crew opts for weird rubber hands instead of facial appliances .

Yesterday , we wrote about a serious security flaw that could allow a remote attacker to take control of the victim 's iPhone by sending a specially constructed SMS message .
The vulnerability will be publicly demonstrated and explained in a couple of hours at the Black Hat security conference held in Las Vegas , and yet Apple has n't released a patch of any sort .
As researchers who had found the bug , Charlie Miller and Collin Mulliner explain at the Black Hat conference website ,
" We present techniques which allow a researcher to inject SMS messages into iPhone , Android , and Windows Mobile devices .
This method does not use the carrier and so is free ( and invisible to the carrier ) . "
And while security advisories such as this one appear on a monthly basis , often not being very dangerous to the general public , this threat seems to be real .
The attack was demonstrated on the iPhone of Cnet 's Elinor Mills ; here 's her explanation of how this attack works in practice :
" Here 's what happened : While I was talking on the phone to Charlie Miller , his partner , Collin Mulliner , sent me a text message from his phone .
One minute I 'm talking to Miller and the next minute my phone is dead , and this time it 's not AT&T 's fault .
After a few seconds it came back to life , but I was not able to make or receive calls until I rebooted . "
Although Miller and Mulliner mention Android and Windows Mobile phones as well , it seems they 're actually about to present several SMS - based attacks .
A vulnerability in Android was promptly fixed by Google , while another vulnerability in HTC 's code ( company that makes Android and Windows Mobile - based phones ) can render the phone useless , but it does n't allow the attacker to take control of it .
iPhone 's security flaw , enabled by a memory corruption bug in the way it handles SMS messages , is by far the most serious .
Currently , the only thing you can do to stop the attack is watch for odd - looking SMS messages ( empty or containing a single square character ) and turn off your iPhone quickly if you see one .
It all sounds quite scary ; we 're hoping to see a quick patch from Apple .
If this hack spreads - and big ones usually do - it might be a serious risk for every iPhone owner .

Nick Griffin elected for North West region , while Andrew Brons picks up another BNP seat in Yorkshire and Humber Press Association
Nick Griffin , the leader of the BNP , was today elected to the European parliament .
The far - right leader won a seat in the North West region .
Earlier Andrew Brons , another British National party politician won in the Yorkshire and Humber area .
It is the first time the party has had an MEP elected .
Griffin 's victory was only confirmed shortly before 2 am after a two - hour cliffhanger over the last of the North West 's eight seats saw the Greens fall narrowly behind the BNP and Ukip just failed to pull ahead enough to win a third seat .
There were furious scenes at the declaration when the highest polling candidate , Sir Robert Atkins , described the BNP as " an aberration " and condemned Griffin 's success as sad day for British politics .
He was followed by Labour 's Arlene McCarthy , who came second in votes cast and told the crowd at Manchester town hall that the BNP was " a party whose members include convicted rapists " .
Both won loud applause – but also jeers from BNP supporters in the Banqueting Hall who shouted " Get back to the trough ! " and " It 's democracy – you 're already insulting the voters again . "
When Griffin 's turn came to speak , all the other candidates took the unprecedented step of walking off the platform in protest .
The BNP leader laid into a " liberal elite which has built a dam , a wall of lies which has grown ever taller and ever thicker over the years to stop ordinary people protesting about the removal of their freedom . "
He added : " Well tonight that wall has been broken down in the North West and Yorkshire by hundreds of thousands of voters . "
Brons 's victory in Yorkshire saw the highest BNP poll , 9.8 % , with Griffin getting 8 % .
The party polled 8.9 % in the North East and 8.6 % in both the West and East Midlands , but the share was not enough to win a place in those regions .
They polled 6.1 % in the Eastern region , 5.5 % in London , 5.4 % in Wales , 4.4 % in the South East and 3.9 % in the South West .
Brons took a seat that was previously Labour 's second in Yorkshire , as the expenses debacle and internecine warfare in Labour turned traditional supporters away in droves .
The Labour vote crashed from 45 % to 25 % in Barnsley , where the BNP share climbed from 8 % to 17 % .
Griffin welcomed the victory as a vindication of the party 's claim that " we 're here to look after our people because no one else is " .
He said that feelings were particularly strong in Yorkshire , where former pit communities felt " at the bottom of the heap " .
Pointing to other big rises in the BNP vote to 15 % in Rotherham and nearly 12 % in Doncaster , Griffin said : " This is ordinary decent people in Yorkshire kicking back against racism , because racism in this country is now directed overwhelmingly against people who look like me . "
Griffin , who had to reach Manchester town hall for his own count in a police van after anti-fascist demonstrators blocked his convoy and hurled eggs , said immigration had become harmful to Britain , particularly with the spread of radical Islam .
" Take Bradford – it is n't immigration that 's happening there , it 's colonialism , " he said .
His own evening was one long lurch between advances and retreats for the BNP as declarations came in from the North West 's 39 counting areas .
In a reverse effect to Yorkshire 's , support fell in areas where the party had done well in the past .
In Burnley , where they won one of their first English county council seats on Thursday , it dropped from 17 % to 15 % .
But the slump in Labour 's vote was common to the North West and Yorkshire , leaving the battle for the last of the region 's eight seats open until the very end .
After the Conservatives had won two , and Labour , Ukip and the Liberal Democrats one each , the BNP and the Greens were at level pegging for the final two hours of counting .
Brons said after the Yorkshire count in Leeds : " The onslaught against us has been more than against any other party in recent times , but somehow we 've overcome it .
Despite the lies , despite the money , despite the misrepresentation , we 've been able to win through . "
A dapper , besuited figure who adopts the low - key approach encouraged by Griffin , Brons retired last year as a politics and government teacher at Harrogate College .
He then re-entered active politics for the first time since standing five times for the National Front in the 1970s after a brief spell as its leader , which ended in internal quarrels .
He joined the British National Socialist party as a teenager .
Lawmakers from both political parties expressed outrage today about Georgia 's use of federal stimulus money to lure the national headquarters of NCR Corporation away from Dayton , a move announced on Tuesday that will cost Ohio approximately 1,300 jobs .
The company said the City of Columbus , Georgia , will use federal stimulus dollars to buy a building where NCR will manufacture ATM machines .
The Columbus Ledger - Enquirer newspaper in Georgia reported the city wants $ 5.5 million in federal money for the purchase .
Republicans including House GOP Leader John Boehner and GOP gubernatorial candidate John Kasich of Westerville blasted Democrats for backing a federal stimulus package that could be used to finance interstate job poaching .
" The use of stimulus funds means that Ohio taxpayers were forced to pay for NCR 's move to Georgia , " said State GOP Sen .
Jon Husted of Kettering .
" I hope our federal officials will act quickly to stop this expenditure of tax dollars that would allow one state to lure away jobs from another . "
U.S. Sen . Sherrod Brown , a Democat from Avon , wrote a letter to Commerce Secretary Gary Locke that urged him to keep economic recovery money from being used to transfer jobs between states .
" Stimulus funds should not be used in a manner that benefits one local economy at the expense of another , " Brown said in the letter .
Lasting peace in Northern Ireland took another step forward Saturday when major Protestant paramilitary organizations announced that they had decommissioned some or all of their weapons , following a similar move years earlier by the opposing Irish Republican Army .
The Ulster Defense Assn. and the Ulster Volunteer Force , two fearsome groups responsible for hundreds of civilian deaths , said the time had come for peace and democracy in a territory riven for decades by deadly conflict between Catholics and Protestants .
“ The need for armed resistance has gone .
Consequently we are putting our arsenal of weaponry permanently beyond use , ” the Ulster Defense Assn. said in a statement .
It said it had begun destroying some of its arms in the presence of independent monitors and would continue until the process was complete .
The Ulster Volunteer Force said that it had already given up its entire stockpile .
The declaration was made at a Belfast news conference by a spokesman who was unmasked and in civilian clothes , a marked change from the days when gun-toting members issued statements wearing ski masks .

The group ’s weapons are “ totally , and irreversibly , beyond use ” in order to boost “ the establishment of accountable democratic governance in this region of the United Kingdom [ and ] to remove the pretext that loyalist weaponry is an obstacle , ” the spokesman said .
For years , the two paramilitary organizations carried out attacks on Catholic neighborhoods in their campaign to ensure that Northern Ireland remained part of the United Kingdom .
Both claimed responsibility for hundreds of shootings , bombings and other acts of violence estimated to have killed nearly 1,000 people during Northern Ireland ’s “ Troubles , ” in which more than 3,500 died .
The historic 1998 Good Friday Agreement between loyalists and republicans largely ended the armed conflict and called for full disarmament by both sides .
In 2005 , independent monitors confirmed that the Irish Republican Army had put its arsenal beyond use .
But a number of loyalist groups refused to follow suit , insisting that they needed to keep their guns for protection .

The announcements Saturday came after increasing pressure on the Protestant underground groups from the British government .
Late last year , the minister in charge of Northern Irish affairs , Shaun Woodward , said that the amnesty period for turning in weapons with no questions asked would expire in 2010 .
Woodward welcomed the disarmament announcements .
“ For those who have doubted the political process , it is proof that politics works and that guns have no place in a normal society , ” he said .
Dawn Purvis , a lawmaker with the Progressive Unionist Party , which has been linked to loyalist paramilitary groups , said , “ It is time to move on .
. . .
Peaceful , stable democracy is the way forward for Northern Ireland . ”

Sectarian strife is by no means ended .
In March , republican splinter groups killed a police officer and two British soldiers , raising fear that the “ dark days ” of open conflict could return .
But politicians on both sides of the divide condemned the shootings and vowed to forge ahead with the peace process .
The Ulster Volunteer Force said Saturday that it began preparing to get rid of its weapons last fall but broke off because of the killings .
It resumed the process after receiving assurances that authorities would wholeheartedly pursue those responsible .
Tensions across the religious divide will probably flare with the annual “ marching season ” about to begin , when partisans , mostly on the Protestant side , hold parades to declare their loyalties .

Sonia Sotomayor 's confirmation hearings provide an opportunity -- and presents difficulties -- for Republicans on Capitol Hill .
New justice battle may jolt GOP
To some Republican activists , an epic battle over Sonia Sotomayor is just the kind of jolt the Republican Party needs to get out of its doldrums .
But heading into the Supreme Court nominee ’s confirmation hearings that begin Monday , top GOP senators are still weighing how big of a fight to wage ahead of votes in the coming weeks in the Judiciary Committee and on the Senate floor .
Advertisement
Their strategy will carry potential benefits and pitfalls .
If they mount a vigorous and unified defense , they could energize their base and present a clear vision to the public about their view over the judiciary – but risk backlash from Hispanics and women ’s groups eager to see Sotomayor become the first female Latina justice .
But if they ’re divided and let the fight fizzle , the party will appear splintered on one of the biggest matters to face them since Barack Obama ’s election as president – while deflating a GOP base whose major issues of gun rights and abortion are at the heart of Sotomayor ’s nomination .
Deciding to mount a forceful opposition could be an easy decision if Sotomayor stumbles during her hearings , GOP senators say .
But absent that , the equation gets trickier – and no one wants to be the lone GOP senator to vote in support of her .
A bellwether on GOP opposition is Judiciary Committee member Jon Kyl , the No. 2 Republican in Senate leadership who represents Arizona , a state with a big Hispanic population .
Kyl has raised concerns with Sotomayor , including over statements she ’s made favoring the use of foreign law in guiding decision - making .
But he dismisses political fallout for the GOP if his party votes largely against her – and says his vote will strictly come down to her qualifications to sit on the highest court in the land – not her ethnicity .
“ It ’s not a good idea , I think , to continue to focus on something that on this day and age is just not an issue , ” Kyl said .
“ People are n’t bigoted and biased base on ethnicity .
And if they vote for or against somebody , it ’s not healthy for the media to infer that the reason for the vote had anything to do other than with the person ’s qualifications . ”
Asked if there was pressure to stay united , Kyl said : “ No , we have no party discipline on this at all .
People are entitled to vote however they want to vote . ”
Sen. Lindsey Graham ( R - S.C. ) , a more junior member of the committee , predicted that depending on her performance at the hearings , she could get as many votes as Chief Justice John Roberts did in 2005 , when he was approved by a 13 - 5 vote , which included all committee Republicans and three Democrats .
But if the GOP believes she did not answer her questions adequately , he said , it could turn into the situation that befell Samuel Alito in 2006 when he was approved by the committee on a straight 10 - 8 party - line vote .
“ I can probably guess there will be a few ‘ no ’ votes , ” Graham said .
“ The possibility of ‘ yes ’ votes exists based on how well she does . …
I think some of our colleagues will be looking at some of us in terms of how we ’ll vote in part on how they make a decision . ”
With Democrats holding a 12 - 7 majority on the Judiciary Committee and a 60 - 40 advantage in the full Senate , Sotomayor does n’t need any GOP votes to get confirmed if Democrats stay united .
But a party - line vote could damage her perception with the public .
Tom Goldstein , a Supreme Court expert at the law firm Akin Gump , said the confirmation process is “ so openly broken ” that a party - line vote wo n’t hurt her standing inside the court .
“ But the hearings are her real introduction to the country , so if the perception of her nomination is really politically charged , that could taint the public 's perception of her rulings for years . ”
The last time a Democratic president nominated Supreme Court justices , Stephen Breyer in 1994 and Ruth Bader Ginsburg in 1993 , they were overwhelmingly supported in the full Senate and were approved by the Judiciary Committee on an 18 - 0 vote .
Other than Alito and Clarence Thomas , both nominees of Republican presidents , the other sitting members of the court won wide approval in committee and on the floor , according to the Senate historical office .
For some Republicans , Alito ’s lack of Democratic support is still fresh in their minds – particularly since Obama as a senator voted against Alito and supported an unsuccessful filibuster attempt .
“ If I used the Obama standard , I ’d vote against her , ” Graham said .
“ You ’ll hear that sometimes in the hearing . ”
Sen. Dick Durbin ( D - Ill. ) , No. 2 Democrat in Senate leadership and Judiciary Committee member , said the Sotomayor situation is different based on her qualifications and approach to the law .
And he warned the GOP of political backlash this time around .
“ I think if it looks like a mindless opposition just because she ’s President Obama ’s nominee , I think the Hispanic community will notice that and it wo n’t sit well , ” Durbin said .
But if the GOP lets it go without a fight , they risk angering conservative activists as well .
Charmaine Yoest , head of the anti-abortion group Americans United for Life who is testifying at the Sotomayor hearings , said a strong vote in opposition is about principle – not politics .
“ The rank - and - file pro-life people out there are definitely looking for some heroes . ”
Sen. Jeff Sessions ( R - Ala . ) , top Republican on the Judiciary Committee , seems aware of the conflicting pressure – especially when it comes to explosive issues of race - based decision - making , an issue certain to be a focus at the hearings .
“ I do think it has to be handled correctly , ” he said .
“ I think the American people will respond well if they believe that the Republicans are committed that anyone going onto the Supreme Court is fair and just . ”
Sen . Chuck Grassley ( R - Iowa ) , who is undecided on how he ’ll vote , predicted that “ she will have bipartisan support . ”
And he said that given Utah GOP Sen .
Orrin
Hatch ’s occasional tendency to defer to a president on nominees , he could be the lone GOP senator to back Sotomayor if the others vote the opposite way .
Asked if he could be the lone GOP vote in support of her , Hatch said : “ No , I do n’t think that ’s the way it ’s going to be — we ’ll have to see . ”
“ I wo n’t vote for her if some of these questions are n’t answered satisfactorily , ” Hatch said .
“ As much as I support Hispanic people , this is for one of the most important positions in the world to me and I think to anyone with brains . ”
Start your Python project with optparse and logging
Python continues to be my favorite language to hack in .
It ’s useful for tasks big and small and has the advantage of being more readable and maintainable than a lot of other scripting languages .
I remember when , having learned the basics of Python , I decided to rewrite my home - built CD - to - MP3 script suite from its perl incarnation ( perl was my previous favorite language for system programming projects ) .
I knocked that project out in only about 2 hours , including a major redesign made easy by Python ’s object syntax and built in “ pickle ” for serialization .
Since then , I ’ve usually chosen Python for a variety of system programming tasks .
This includes things like making backups , deploying software , configuration file templating , web site scraping , health monitoring , and some bigger data crunching / graphing .
Time after time , these quick projects ( often at work ) turned into something bigger .
Eventually they get rolled into a product or adopted by the production operations group as standard kit .
At some point I realized that there was something that I was doing that made this transition from “ quick hack ” to “ standard tool ” easy : I always start my projects with logging and optparse in place from day zero .
During development , this means that I do n’t have to scatter print - style debugging statements throughout the code , I can just use logging .
debug ( ) and turn them on and off at will ( via command line flags ) .
Once deployed or passed on , it means other people using it can immediately start interacting with my script just like other familiar Unix utilities .
So , here is a variation on what my typical python script starts out with .
#!/usr /bin/python import logging def foo ( ) : " " " These will only get output if you turn up verbosity . " " " logging .
debug ( " This is debug . " ) logging .
info ( " This is info . " ) def bar ( ) : " " " These will all be output a default logging levels . " " " logging .
warn ( " Warning !
Things are getting scary . " ) logging .
error ( " Uh- oh , something is wrong . " ) try : raise Exception ( " ZOMG tacos . " ) except : logging .
exception ( " Just like error , but with a traceback . " ) if ' __main__ ' == __name__ : #
Late import , in case this project becomes a library , never to be run as main again .
import optparse # Populate our options , - h/-- help is already there for you .
optp = optparse .
OptionParser ( ) optp .
add_option ( ' - v ' , '- - verbose ' , dest = ' verbose ' , action = ' count ' , help =
" Increase verbosity ( specify multiple times for more ) " ) # Parse the arguments ( defaults to parsing sys.argv ) .
opts , args = optp .
parse_args () #
Here would be a good place to check what came in on the command line and # call optp.error ( " Useful message " ) to exit if all it not well .
log_level = logging .
WARNING # default if opts .
verbose == 1 : log_level = logging .
INFO elif opts .
verbose >= 2 : log_level = logging .
DEBUG # Set up basic configuration , out to stderr with a reasonable default format .
logging .
basicConfig ( level = log_level ) #
Do some actual work . foo ( ) bar ( )
This is obviously a pretty minimal setup , but it achieves what most people need .
You get option parsing and checking along with usage information .
You get warnings and errors spat out to sys.stderr ( leaving sys.stdout for actual program output ) .
You can specify - v to crank up verbosity .
A City of Sydney study found that alcohol - related crime had soared due to an increase in late - night licensed premises .
Licensing officers and council rangers were overstretched and extra police numbers were not sustainable , said the acting commander of Kings Cross police , Darren Schott : " There is a direct correlation between the density of alcohol establishments and the level of crime . "
A former Wayside pastor , the Reverend Ray Richmond , said drug use paled beside " the more destructive and pervasive alcohol problem " .
Local residents are saying the Cross is the worst it has ever been .
Cath Lyons , who has lived in the area since the 1950s , said : " It 's much worse than when the Americans were here in the 1960s , and the worst I 've known it , due to the alcohol .
It used to be that the worst that would happen to you walking through the Cross was that someone would pinch your bum .
Now you 're scared someone will push a broken bottle into your face . "
Residents have taken to escorting politicians on late - night tours .
The City of Sydney Greens councillor Chris Harris was taken on one last month .
" We took a two - hour walk on a Saturday night between 10.30 pm and 12.30 am , " Cr Harris said .
" On Bayswater Road , the outdoor crowds were so dense that a pedestrian could n't walk on the footpath .
Crossing Victoria
Street we saw well - dressed young people walking down the road drinking from wine - cask bladders .
We went inside residences and the noise from the street was extreme ; you could only live there if you shut all the windows and stayed in a room away from the street side .
If you live in the Cross , you can't expect to be living in Wahroonga , but there are limits to what people can reasonably take .
" The bars were bursting at the seams with people drinking , people were making an unbelievable noise in the street , and what was most disturbing was the age of the drinkers .
We saw young girls sitting on footpaths and I 'd be surprised if they were over 14 .
It was like a zoo , very scary and very confronting .
It 's way beyond the resources of police and council rangers to control it . "
Council had opposed the Sugarmill 's development application , he said , but the decision had been reversed in the Land and Environment Court .
Blame has been shifted between the council , the court and the State Government , but the result is such a concentration of licensed premises that " there is now approval for 10,000 people to be drinking in a very small area until 3 am , " Cr Harris said .
More DAs for extended drinking hours are " pouring in " , he said .
" City of Sydney rangers do n't have the power to detain or arrest or ask for names , " Cr Harris said .
" A police officer can go up to people to stop them drinking or [ tell them to ] take their drinks inside , but that can't do much .
The laws on responsible service of alcohol are obviously being widely ignored , but it 's unrealistic to expect a 20 - year - old bar person to police the biggest problem in the Cross . "
Carole Ferrier , who has led Cr Harris and other politicians on the tour , said : " It 's out of control , the concentration in a small area .
I do n't see how they can pull it back , but having politicians see it for themselves might be a start . "
In an ironic way , the alcohol boom has coincided with the success of the injecting centre , says the writer Mandy Sayer , a Kings Cross resident for 16 years .
" The seedy reputation kept a lot of people away , " she said .
" But now it 's the crowd that used to go to The Rocks , coming in and staying until 6 am . "
She said controls on drinking - stopping people buying more than two drinks at a time , and shutting bars for 10 minutes every hour - did n't work .
" People just move on to the next beer barn , and they can do that because there are so many . "
The all - night power of illegal stimulants has pushed the drinker 's clock later so people go out at 10 pm and stay out until dawn .
Laws pushing smokers outdoors are congesting public areas .
Outdoor tables , often in violation of licensing laws , enable bars to expand their limits .
As the Australian Bureau of Statistics reported this week , the total amount of alcohol available for sale across Australia rose by 8 million litres in the past two years - of all the intoxicants , legal and illegal , the one that is indisputably cresting the wave is alcohol .
Kings Cross is no longer ankle - deep in needles .
As the Wayside pastor , Graham Long , said : " In 10 years we 've gone from finding 150 needles a day down to two . "
Instead it is ankle - deep in smashed glass which , each Saturday , council workers clean up - another drain on ratepayers .
Loading
" I love it Sunday to Thursday , " said Ms Ferrier .
" But if I 'd known what it was like on Fridays and Saturdays , I 'd never have moved here . "
Here are my notes on setting up nginx as a reverse proxy with Apache , mod_python , and Django on Ubuntu Intrepid .
Nginx is used to serve my static media files while all other requests are passed on to the Apache / mod_python / Django web server .
I realize mod_wsgi has become the preferred way to deploy Django , but I 'm a little behind the times and am still using mod_python .
I hope to switch to mod_wsgi soon .
I have been using Amazon 's CloudFront service for delivering my static media files .
As far as I can tell , it has worked well .
My main reason for switching to nginx is so I can skip the extra step of uploading to Amazon .
Regarding my concern about the memory footprint of nginx , it looks like it is using around 5 mb with my two process configuration .
My configuration parameters are shown below .
I 'm running two sites , SaltyCrane and HandsOnCards on a Slicehost 256 mb plan .

As a Canadian living in the United States for the past 17 years , I am frequently asked by Americans and Canadians alike to declare one health care system as the better one .
Often I ’ll avoid answering , regardless of the questioner ’s nationality .
To choose one or the other system usually translates into a heated discussion of each one ’s merits , pitfalls , and an intense recitation of commonly cited statistical comparisons of the two systems .
Because if the only way we compared the two systems was with statistics , there is a clear victor .
It is becoming increasingly more difficult to dispute the fact that Canada spends less money on health care to get better outcomes .
Yet , the debate rages on .
Indeed , it has reached a fever pitch since President Barack Obama took office , with Americans either dreading or hoping for the dawn of a single - payer health care system .
Opponents of such a system cite Canada as the best example of what not to do , while proponents laud that very same Canadian system as the answer to all of America ’s health care problems .
Frankly , both sides often get things wrong when trotting out Canada to further their respective arguments .
As America comes to grips with the reality that changes are desperately needed within its health care infrastructure , it might prove useful to first debunk some myths about the Canadian system .
Myth : Taxes in Canada are extremely high , mostly because of national health care .
In actuality , taxes are nearly equal on both sides of the border .
Overall , Canada ’s taxes are slightly higher than those in the U.S. However , Canadians are afforded many benefits for their tax dollars , even beyond health care ( e.g. , tax credits , family allowance , cheaper higher education ) , so the end result is a wash .
At the end of the day , the average after - tax income of Canadian workers is equal to about 82 percent of their gross pay .
In the U.S. , that average is 81.9 percent .
Myth : Canada ’s health care system is a cumbersome bureaucracy .
The U.S. has the most bureaucratic health care system in the world .
More than 31 percent of every dollar spent on health care in the U.S. goes to paperwork , overhead , CEO salaries , profits , etc .
The provincial single - payer system in Canada operates with just a 1 percent overhead .
Think about it .
It is not necessary to spend a huge amount of money to decide who gets care and who does n’t when everybody is covered .
Myth :
The Canadian system is significantly more expensive than that of the U.S.
Ten percent of Canada ’s GDP is spent on health care for 100 percent of the population .
The U.S. spends 17 percent of its GDP but 15 percent of its population has no coverage whatsoever and millions of others have inadequate coverage .
In essence , the U.S. system is considerably more expensive than Canada’s .
Part of the reason for this is uninsured and underinsured people in the U.S. still get sick and eventually seek care .
People who cannot afford care wait until advanced stages of an illness to see a doctor and then do so through emergency rooms , which cost considerably more than primary care services .
What the American taxpayer may not realize is that such care costs about $ 45 billion per year , and someone has to pay it .
This is why insurance premiums increase every year for insured patients while co-pays and deductibles also rise rapidly .
Myth : Canada ’s government decides who gets health care and when they get it .
While HMOs and other private medical insurers in the U.S. do indeed make such decisions , the only people in Canada to do so are physicians .
In Canada , the government has absolutely no say in who gets care or how they get it .
Medical decisions are left entirely up to doctors , as they should be .
There are no requirements for pre-authorization whatsoever .
If your family doctor says you need an MRI , you get one .
In the U.S. , if an insurance administrator says you are not getting an MRI , you do n’t get one no matter what your doctor thinks — unless , of course , you have the money to cover the cost .
Myth :
There are long waits for care , which compromise access to care .
There are no waits for urgent or primary care in Canada .
There are reasonable waits for most specialists ’ care , and much longer waits for elective surgery .
Yes , there are those instances where a patient can wait up to a month for radiation therapy for breast cancer or prostate cancer , for example .
However , the wait has nothing to do with money per se , but everything to do with the lack of radiation therapists .
Despite such waits , however , it is noteworthy that Canada boasts lower incident and mortality rates than the U.S. for all cancers combined , according to the U.S. Cancer Statistics Working Group and the Canadian Cancer Society .
Moreover , fewer Canadians ( 11.3 percent ) than Americans ( 14.4 percent ) admit unmet health care needs .
Myth : Canadians are paying out of pocket to come to the U.S. for medical care .
Most patients who come from Canada to the U.S. for health care are those whose costs are covered by the Canadian governments .
If a Canadian goes outside of the country to get services that are deemed medically necessary , not experimental , and are not available at home for whatever reason ( e.g. , shortage or absence of high tech medical equipment ; a longer wait for service than is medically prudent ; or lack of physician expertise ) , the provincial government where you live fully funds your care .
Those patients who do come to the U.S. for care and pay out of pocket are those who perceive their care to be more urgent than it likely is .
Myth : Canada is a socialized health care system in which the government runs hospitals and where doctors work for the government .
Princeton University health economist Uwe Reinhardt says single - payer systems are not “ socialized medicine ” but “ social insurance ” systems because doctors work in the private sector while their pay comes from a public source .
Most physicians in Canada are self - employed .
They are not employees of the government nor are they accountable to the government .
Doctors are accountable to their patients only .
More than 90 percent of physicians in Canada are paid on a fee - for - service basis .
Claims are submitted to a single provincial health care plan for reimbursement , whereas in the U.S. , claims are submitted to a multitude of insurance providers .
Moreover , Canadian hospitals are controlled by private boards and / or regional health authorities rather than being part of or run by the government .
Myth :
There are n’t enough doctors in Canada .
From a purely statistical standpoint , there are enough physicians in Canada to meet the health care needs of its people .
But most doctors practice in large urban areas , leaving rural areas with bona fide shortages .
This situation is no different than that being experienced in the U.S. Simply training and employing more doctors is not likely to have any significant impact on this specific problem .
Whatever issues there are with having an adequate number of doctors in any one geographical area , they have nothing to do with the single - payer system .
And these are just some of the myths about the Canadian health care system .
While emulating the Canadian system will likely not fix U.S. health care , it probably is n’t the big bad “ socialist ” bogeyman it has been made out to be .
It is not a perfect system , but it has its merits .
For people like my 55 - year - old Aunt Betty , who has been waiting for 14 months for knee - replacement surgery due to a long history of arthritis , it is the superior system .
Her $ 35,000 - plus surgery is finally scheduled for next month .
She has been in pain , and her quality of life has been compromised .
However , there is a light at the end of the tunnel .
Aunt Betty — who lives on a fixed income and could never afford private health insurance , much less the cost of the surgery and requisite follow - up care — will soon sport a new , high - tech knee .
Waiting 14 months for the procedure is easy when the alternative is living in pain for the rest of your life .

The Organisation of American States tonight lifted Cuba 's half - century - old suspension in a dramatic decision to bring Havana back into Latin America 's diplomatic fold .
The pan-regional body rebuffed the United States , which lobbied against the move , and revoked a 1962 cold war measure which had marked the communist island as a pariah .
" The cold war has ended this day in San Pedro Sula , " said Manuel Zelaya , the president of Honduras , who hosted the 34 - member organisation in Honduras 's second city .
Dozens of foreign ministers from the Caribbean as well as central and South America stood to applaud when the announcement was made at the end of the two - day summit .
" This is a moment of rejoicing for all of Latin America , " Ecuador 's foreign minister , Fander Falconi , told reporters .
Cuba said it had no interest in rejoining the OAS , which Fidel Castro this week called a " Trojan horse " for US interests , but the opening of the door was a diplomatic victory for Havana and exposed Washington 's isolation .
Much of Latin America once considered Castro an anachronistic despot but since the 1990s the " maximum commandante " has won respect as an elder statesman and symbol of Latin American nationalism .
Only the US still lacks diplomatic relations with the island .
The US secretary of state , Hillary Clinton , said Havana should not be readmitted until it made concessions on democracy and human rights , a line echoed by the advocacy group Human Rights Watch which said political prisoners and repression continued under President Raul Castro .
Those arguments were swept away by largely leftist governments who thought the organisation had been beholden to Washington for too long .
" The vote to readmit Cuba to the OAS represents an unprecedented assertion of Latin American power in a hemispheric institution long dominated by the US , " said Daniel Erikson , an analyst at the Inter - American Dialogue thinktank and author of The Cuba Wars .
Washington recently softened its economic embargo against Cuba - a controversial policy enshrined the same year the OAS suspended the fledgling Castro government - but that was not enough to appease Latin leaders demanding bolder steps .
" The vote sends a powerful signal to the Obama administration that the path of moderate , incremental change in US policy towards Cuba is depleting America 's political capital in the region at an alarming rate , " said Erikson .
Latin leaders gave Obama a rapturous reception at an April summit in Trinidad and Tobago , his regional debut , but today 's decision showed a steely resolve to stand up to the " gringo " superpower which is considered to have bullied the region for over a century .
The US had hoped to engineer a compromise which would hinge Cuba 's entry on the condition it met OAS democratic requirements .
Instead , isolated and outnumbered , the US was cornered into a consensus agreement which said Cuba could rejoin after a " process of dialogue " in line with OAS " practices , proposals and principles " .
A US state department spokesman put a brave face on the outcome and said the US had dissuaded other members from automatically readmitting Cuba .
" The historic action taken today eliminates a distraction from the past and allows us to focus on the realities of today . "
In contrast to its diplomatic shine , Cuba 's economy darkened this week .
Government austerity measures cut fuel and food rations in response to tumbling government revenues .
As the Italian prime minister 's political allies start to edge away from him , revelations from another starlet have pitched him further into crisis
She is 23 , beautiful and ambitious .
And if her story turns out to be true , Barbara Montereale may yet prove to be the young starlet who brings about the downfall of the Italian prime minister , Silvio Berlusconi .
Montereale is the latest in a succession of young women who have come forward to testify to the private entertainments enjoyed by Berlusconi at his residence in Rome and his holiday villa in Sardinia .
For just over a month , ever since the prime minister 's wife , Veronica Lario , publicly accused him of " frequenting minors " , the Italian media have revelled in tales of squads of handpicked showgirls , models and actresses flown in for summer parties and risqué evenings at the Villa Grazioli in Rome .
The stories , complete with paparazzi photographs of topless women and a naked former Czech prime minister , have suggested a world whose inhabitants were living on the edge of moral propriety .
But yesterday 's interview with Montereale in La Repubblica , in the wake of his much - questioned friendship with an 18 - year - old model , Noemi Letizia , may convince many ordinary Italians that a line has been crossed .
According to Montereale , last November she travelled with Patrizia D'Addario , a former model and escort , to a dinner in Rome hosted by Berlusconi , and then to Berlusconi 's Sardinian retreat , Villa Certosa , in January .
For making the Sardinia trip , she was paid € 1,000 by hospital equipment vendor Giampaolo Tarantini , who is now under investigation by Bari investigators for abetting prostitution .
Montereale claims Berlusconi gave her " rings and necklaces that he said he designed " and a CD of Neapolitan love songs in Rome .
After her stay in Sardinia , she left with a bag containing " a very generous sum of money " .
She denied having sex with Berlusconi , but was happy to give a graphic account of how the November night with D'Addario in Rome had unfolded .
" Everyone knew at the dinner she was an escort , " Montereale told La Repubblica .
At the end of the dinner , she said " the agreement was that Giampaolo [ Tarantini ] and I would leave Patrizia alone with the PM , and that 's what we did . "
D'Addario , according to Montereale , returned to the hotel that had been booked for the women at 8 am the next day .
" She told me she had had sexual relations with the prime minister , " said Montereale .
" She added that she had not been paid .
She said she was n't interested in money because she wanted him to help her in relation to a hotel she wanted to build . "
Again according to Montereale , that prime ministerial assistance never materialised , leading an embittered D'Addario to tell her story last week and reveal that she had handed audio and video tapes to the police .
Asked to comment on the story , a spokesman for Berlusconi , Marco Ventura , said yesterday : " We have no comment ; we have nothing to say . "
But the aftershock of the visit by Montereale and D'Addario to the Villa Grazioli has contributed to the sense of crisis that is now in danger of overwhelming Berlusconi 's premiership .
In April , few would have imagined that the extraordinary attendance of Berlusconi at the 18th birthday party of Letizia would have led to such a devastating series of revelations .
Last week even the Roman Catholic Church , for which Berlusconi has been a useful ally , felt the need to distance itself from the prime minister .
Avvenire , the official newspaper of the Italian conference of bishops , said his own supporters now wanted him to come clean on his escapades .
" This is becoming more and more damaging , particularly since the Church has now waded in , " said James Walston , professor of international relations at the American University in Rome .
" It is not necessarily the scandal itself , which most people do not care about , but the fact it seems he is no longer in control .
The government will not , however , collapse in the near future , but he is certainly weaker . "
By last Thursday , Berlusconi felt compelled to rebuff rumours that a transition government , run by the governor of the Bank of Italy , could be set up if he resigned .
The next night , when he was booed and heckled at a political rally in Milan , the enraged prime minister berated his critics , shouting : " You disgust and repel me .
But you communists without dignity will never bring me down . "
Meanwhile Antonio Di Pietro , the former magistrate who has become a respected opposition politician , has compared Berlusconi with the Roman emperor Nero .
Even on the right , among Berlusconi 's political allies , there is growing concern and the beginnings of a revolt .
Gianfranco Fini , the speaker of the lower house of parliament and a key Berlusconi ally , has publicly warned that the number of starlets with stories to tell is threatening to turn voters away from politics .
The influential journalist and loyal supporter Giuliano Ferrara said that the prime minister " needs to choose his friends better " .
Some of the arguments used in Berlusconi 's defence border on the surreal .
Vittorio Feltri , the editor of the right - wing newspaper Libero , claimed that , ever since Berlusconi 's operation for prostate cancer in 1996 , he could no longer have sex .
" To say he is a sex maniac is simply ridiculous , " he wrote .
Nicolò Ghedini , Berlusconi's chief legal adviser , defended his client over the D'Addario affair by describing his client as a mere " end user " of the women , who was not therefore at risk in the Bari investigation .
For good measure , he added that " Berlusconi could have them [ women ] in large numbers for free " .
The prime minister himself , although clearly rattled , is still trying to banter his way though the storm , using the brazen style that has gone down well in the past with many voters .
On Friday , he spotted a female journalist whose sweater had slipped slightly off one shoulder .
" Are you trying to get invited to one of my dinners ? " he asked .
" I used to do one a month , now I need to organise three or four a week . "
But after the latest starlet breaks cover , how many Italian are still laughing ?

Update note : this is just one month of data , and not seasonally adjusted .
Port traffic gives us an early hint of changes in the trade deficit .
Usually I wait until both Los Angeles and Long Beach ports report monthly traffic , but this rebound might be significant .
( I 'll add Long Beach when the data is released )

This graph shows the loaded inbound and outbound traffic at the port of Los Angeles in TEUs ( TEUs : 20 - foot equivalent units or 20 - foot - long cargo container ) .
Although containers tell us nothing about value , container traffic does give us an idea of the volume of goods being exported and imported .
Inbound traffic was 6 % below last March and 35 % above last month .
Outbound traffic was 9.8 % below March 2008 , and 25 % above February .
We have to be careful because of the impact of the Chinese New Year on trade in February , but there does appear to be a significant rebound after trade collapsed in February .
BUSH DOES NOT UNDERSTAND WHAT ALL THE FUSS IS ABOUT IN IRAN By Colleen Smith , Staff Reporter Unless you have been in a cave , you know that there is widespread unrest after the Iranian presidential election .
Crowds of protestors insist that the election was a fraud , and that President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad had not won re-election .
I asked former President George W. Bush what he thought of events there , and his comments took me completely by surprise .
" Here in America , people do n't riot over a rigged election .
We have them all the time !
Most people know that elections are just a show like pro rasslin ' .
That is why so many do n't even vote .
Hell , I have never once been legitimately elected to public office , but it is no big deal .
There is a ruling class , and a following class .
It is decided which one you are part of when you are born most of the time . "
" They just do n't get it over there in the Far East .
When the slightest thing goes wrong , those moozlim ayrabs are out in the street hooting and hollering just like a bunch of wild Indians .
It 's about time the army and police beat some sense into them , and bring back some law and order like that general guy did in Pakistan .
Ayatollah Khomeini has already warned them that they are going to get their butts handed to them if they do n't knock it off , but they are n't listening .
He may have to go all Chinese on them . "
I asked the former President if he was joking , and he said , " Do I look like I 'm joking ? "
It was hard to tell if he was or not .
Maybe it was deadpan delivery , but he is not British , so why would he be trying to do British humor ?
While Bush 's comments were a shock , at least they were n't the wishy - washy non-comments that President Obama has been making .

Sunspots on a Cloudy Day
Credit & Copyright : Stefan Seip ( TWAN )
Explanation : On June 2nd , clouds over Stuttgart , Germany parted to reveal what has become a relatively rare sight , spots on the Sun .
In fact , the roughly 11 - year solar activity cycle is still in a surprisingly deep minimum and the years 2008 and 2009 have had the lowest sunspot counts since the 1950s .
Even the latest prediction is that the new cycle , Solar Cycle 24 , will reach a maximum in May 2013 with a below - average sunspot count .
The Solar Cycle 24 sunspots recorded here are in active region AR 1019 .
Previously , only two cycle 24 active regions with sunspots , AR 1018 and AR 1017 , were seen in May .
While dismantling John Harrison ’s pioneering clock Jonathan Betts found evidence he did not work alone as is usually assumed .
He also uncovered hidden features like this decorative bird deep inside the mechanism – check out this gallery to see more .
The story of John Harrison the “ lone genius ” who solved the problem of finding longitude at sea is in urgent need of a rewrite .
Discoveries made during repairs to Harrison ’s first successful “ sea clock ” – completed in 1735 – suggest that others contributed to his pioneering timepieces .
“ Harrison is always cast as a self - taught lone genius pitted against the establishment .
The truth is , that is a great over - simplification , ” says horologist Jonathan Betts of the Royal Observatory , Greenwich , London .
Betts dismantled the device – called H1 – after it stopped last year when a connection between a spring and a swinging balance broke .
“ It ’s only when you take it apart and have it in your hands that it comes home to you : the story is n’t quite the one that ’s told . ”

See a gallery of images of H1 that show what Betts found .
Longitude legend
The John Harrison legend , made famous in 1995 by Dava Sobel ’s surprise bestseller Longitude , has the country carpenter - turned - clockmaker designing and building a series of innovative timepieces that kept near perfect time on long sea voyages – without any advice or help from others .
At the time , mariners were unable to calculate longitude accurately and hence could not pinpoint their position at sea .
Harrison ’s fourth marine timekeeper – H4 , a watch rather than a clock – became the first to qualify for the £ 20,000 offered by the British Government to whoever cracked the problem , although he spent decades fighting for his money .
Now Betts has uncovered evidence that Harrison was not the lone pioneer the legend would have us believe .
While carefully taking apart the 1500 components that make up H1 , he has found signs that the provincial craftsman may have had help from more experienced clockmakers to make some of the more sophisticated parts .
Lost and found
H1 had n’t stopped since being cleaned in the early 1960s and Betts is only the third person to have taken it apart since Rupert Gould , who in 1920 discovered the three large timekeepers H1 , H2 and H3 , broken and mouldering behind a cabinet at the Royal Observatory .
Gould spent years repairing and recreating broken and missing parts – and it was one of his replacement parts that stopped the clock in late 2008 .
A thin steel strip that connected one of the clock ’s springs to a swinging balance had rusted and snapped ( see the broken part ) .
“ Gould ’s repair lasted 80 years , which is n’t bad , but there are no signs of any wear on Harrison ’s parts , ” says Betts .
Harrison famously designed his clock so that there was no friction between moving parts and it never needed oiling .
Hints of help
While studying the dismantled masterpiece Betts came across features that suggested Harrison ’s legend is not quite accurate .
“ It ’s always said that he made the parts alone [ in rural Lincolnshire ] – except for some help from his brother .
But when you look at it , that does n’t quite add up . ”
For example , H1 ’s brasswork is too impressive to fit with the legend .
“ The received wisdom is that Harrison transferred his considerable woodworking skills to brass but working brass requires different skills , ” says Betts .
He may have learnt the techniques by studying expert brassworkers but H1 – his first brass clock – does n’t bear the hallmarks of a beginner , suggesting he probably commissioned someone else to help out .
Neither were H1 ’s dials all Harrison ’s work : the reverse of each bears the words “ upwards ” – an instruction to the engraver .
Another clue lies in the fusee mechanism , which evens out the pull of the mainspring .
At the time , even the best clocks made in London had fusees wound around with a cord of gut rather than a chain , says Betts .
But H1 used chain and was one of the earliest clocks to do so .
In fact , it has two fusee chains , each a metre long with each link in five parts , needing up to 2000 components for each chain .
‘ Specialised skill ’
“ Making them was a very specialised skill , and they were mostly fitted to watches , ” says Betts , “ That ’s so sophisticated , I find it hard to believe he made this in Barrow on Humber as a loner . ”
He thinks the chains were bought in London and believes that Harrison watched craftsmen at work there , asked their advice , and commissioned their help .
“ There was definitely more involvement from other people .
What we do n’t know is how far it went .
People thought he just sat down and made it all by himself .
It was surely not like that . ”
Betts has now made a new , non-rusting repair that should last longer than Gould ’s .
“ I ’m also doing a bit of light dusting , which is more important than it sounds , ” he says .
Although H1 shows no wear , it suffers from what Betts calls “ computer mouse syndrome ” – the accumulation of compacted fluff that eventually jams the rollers in older mechanically operated mice .
One of Harrison ’s innovations to avoid friction was to make parts roll over each other with minimal contact , avoiding the need for oil .
“ On those parts fluff is mashed to crud and has to be gently scraped off , ” says Betts .

The European Parliament elections had been widely expected to punish governments struggling to cope with the global economic crisis , and polls released by the ANP news agency and broadcaster NOS put the Right - wing Freedom Party on course to win four of the 25 Dutch seats in the parliament , after having none in the previous assembly .
This put Mr Wilders ' party second only to the ruling Christian Democrats , which got nearly 20 per cent of votes , according to the poll .
( CNN ) --
The anti-government protesters who have streamed into streets across Iran to protest this month 's presidential elections as rigged represent a small minority of the nation , Iran 's ambassador to Mexico , Mohammad Hassan Ghadiri , said Wednesday .
A supporter of Iran 's defeated presidential candidate Mir Hossein Mousavi protests in Athens on June 23 .
" The minority can't impose their opinion on the majority , " Mohammad Hassan Ghadiri told CNN en Español .
" They can't impose a dictatorship saying that the majority is not going to govern . "
There are acceptable ways of addressing electoral fraud , if any occurred , he said .
" But they go out on the street , they attack buses , they attack banks ; that affects the security of the country . "
He added , " The law does n't permit terrorism .
It does n't permit attacks on innocent people . "
He rejected assertions by the opposition that the election results showing Mahmoud Ahmadinejad winning by a landslide were rigged , pointing to a poll published in the Washington Post three weeks before the election that showed the incumbent with a commanding lead .
" The minority has lost the election , they have to accept the role of the majority , " he said .
" If there was fraud , they have to show it .
They have no proof . "
Asked why the government has made it impossible for nearly all international journalists to report from Iran , he accused the media of not accurately reporting events .
" In Tehran , there were much bigger demonstrations in favor of the government that you did n't report about , " he said .
Asked about the shooting of the 26 - year - old woman whose death captured on video has come to symbolize the anti-government forces , he said , " It is not clear who killed who , " he said , adding that " terrorists " were among the demonstrators .
" Some armed people have attacked police , " he said .
" Naturally , we have to respond . "
In an interview with CNN International , he was more blunt about accusations of brutality by government forces : " We do not beat up our people and we do not kill them , " he said .

Verizon Wireless will start selling a netbook - a cheaper , more basic version of a notebook - as early as next quarter , Bloomberg said , citing a person close to the project .
The devices are being developed with more than one PC maker , the news agency cited the person as saying .
Price and plan details are n't complete , the person told the news agency .
Verizon Wireless , owned by Verizon Communications Inc and Britain 's Vodafone Group Plc , competes with AT&T and Sprint Nextel in the wireless carrier market .
Verizon Wireless and AT&T see devices used mainly for data rather than voice as the next phase of wireless growth as the vast majority of the U.S. population owns mobile phones .
Verizon Wireless could not immediately be reached for comment .
Pop culture can be as forbidding as it is inviting , particularly in areas that invite geeky obsession :
The more devotion a genre or series or subculture inspires , the easier it is for the uninitiated to feel like they ’re on the outside looking in .
But geeks are n’t born ; they ’re made .
And sometimes it only takes the right starting point to bring newbies into various intimidatingly vast obsessions .

Geek obsession : P.G. Wodehouse
Advertisement
Why it ’s daunting : Logistics and aesthetics stand in the way of anyone wishing to dive into P.G. Wodehouse ’s canon .
His work sprawls over 90 books published over 75 years , most of which are constantly sneaking in and out of print , many of which have different British and American publication titles .
His short - story collections tend to overlap and make each other redundant .
But the issue of distance from the material can be even more challenging for novices .
People continue to read Wodehouse primarily for the structural perfection of his farce plots and the ways he slammed American and British slang against each other , mixed in upper - class starch , and saw what emerged .
But the whole environment — linguistically and socially — is far from any modern analogues : a sexless , genteel place where the greatest danger the mostly moneyed characters face is getting married to the wrong person .
( Or , in the case of the Jeeves - Wooster series , getting married at all . )
Wodehouse ’s characters were anachronisms from the moment he began writing them .
“ His picture of English society had been formed before 1914 , ” George Orwell noted .
“ Bertie Wooster , if he ever existed , was killed round about 1915 . ”
Possible gateway : The Mating Season
Why : With the exception of 1974 ’s Aunts Are n’t Gentlemen ( or The Cat - Nappers , depending what country you ’re in ) , the 34 short stories and nine novels of the Jeeves - Wooster cycle represent the most consistently amusing , well - paced series of Wodehouse ’s career .
The Mating Season is n’t as widely praised as The Code Of The Woosters or Jeeves In The Morning , but it ’s just as deft , and it does n’t have too many recurring characters to overwhelm novices .
In the relationship between feckless Bertie Wooster — a young British aristocrat with too much money , too little to do , and a perpetual aversion to any kind of commitment , romantic or otherwise — and his infinitely wise valet Jeeves , Wodehouse found the perfect excuse for infinite complications to be endured by Bertie and sorted out by Jeeves .
Much of Wodehouse ’s work circles the same basic setpieces and situations over and over ; the political meeting / village concert — begun with a dismal speech and frequently ending in disorder — is one of his specialties .
The one in The Mating Season is one of his best , from the vicar ’s fundraising speech onward : “ The Church Organ , he told us frankly , was in a hell of a bad way .
For years it had been going around with holes in its socks , doing the Brother - can - you - spare - a - dime stuff , and now it was about due to hand in its dinner pail . ”
Summarizing something in the most incongruous , inappropriate language possible is one of Wodehouse ’s most reliable tricks .
The book only features two returning characters besides Jeeves and Wooster , and both have their backgrounds summarized before the plot kicks in .

Next steps :
It ’s hard to go wrong with any of Wodehouse ’s numerous short - story collections .
For more Jeeves and Wooster , all you need — assuming you can find a used copy — is the complete anthology The World Of Jeeves , which looks far more daunting than it is .
For a general survey of the Wodehouse landscape , 1937 ’s Lord Emsworth And Others is a succinct introduction to Blandings Castle — home of Wodehouse ’s second - most - popular franchise — and Ukridge , the cynical get - rich - quick dreamer whose exploits provided Wodehouse with as much edge as he ever had .
Also included are members of the Drones Club , the social institution all Wodehouse ’s characters belong to , where narrators like The Oldest Member and Mr. Mulliner hold court , telling lengthy anecdotes no one particularly wants to hear .
There ’s even a smattering of his golf stories , which should amuse even those who ca n’t tell birdies from bogeys .
For one of his best non-series works , 1936 ’s Laughing Gas is a rare novel set almost entirely in America , neatly sending up Wodehouse ’s frustrating time in Hollywood .
As far as body - swapping comedies go , it deserves to be up there with Big , or at least above Freaky Friday .
Where not to start : Wodehouse did n’t really hit his stride until 1923 ’s Leave It To Psmith , when he figured out how to strain the earnestness and sap from romantic comedies and leave the buoyant farce ( “ musical comedies without music , ” as he described them ) .
Everything up to then , including the entire Psmith franchise , should be approached only by those already comfortable with Wodehouse ’s work .
Some of the closest he came to revealing anything of himself , the Psmith books give in to human sentiment and are firmly rooted in the public - school ethos Wodehouse was inculcated in — school spirit , cricket , and all the rest — which makes them fascinating biographical clues , but not ideal entertainment .
Reading any book not in the established series — Jeeves , Blandings , Mulliner , Drones , Ukridge — always means taking a risk .
Wodehouse ’s one - novel - only characters tend to be wan variations on the same archetypes developed better in his series : the leisurely young man in love , the wacky uncle , the lower - class swindler , the brassy bride , et al .

The UN has held an unprecedented public hearing in Gaza to broadcast live witness accounts from Palestinians who described seeing their relatives killed and injured during Israel 's January war .
One after another , they detailed Israeli rocket strikes and artillery shelling near a mosque , a UN school and on several homes across Gaza during the three - week war .
The two - day hearing is part of an inquiry by the UN human rights council into the war led by the respected South African judge , Richard Goldstone .
Israel has refused entry for the inquiry team , accusing the UN council of an anti-Israel bias even though Goldstone himself is Jewish .
But another round of hearings will be held in Geneva next week , for which some Israeli witnesses are expected to be flown in .
They may include residents of Sderot , near Gaza , which has suffered repeated Palestinian rocket attacks .
" The purpose of the public hearings in Gaza and Geneva is to show the faces and broadcast the voices of victims – all of the victims , " Goldstone said last week .
He had sat on South Africa 's constitutional court after the fall of apartheid and was a chief prosecutor on the UN criminal tribunals for the former Yugoslavia and Rwanda .
Yesterday 's public hearing was the first in a UN fact - finding mission , though there is little chance it will lead to prosecutions .
Up to 1,400 Palestinians and 13 Israelis were killed during the war .
Mousa Silawi , 91 , described an explosion at the entrance to a mosque in the Jabaliya refugee camp late on 3 January , which killed 17 people , including three of his sons and two grandchildren .
" After evening prayer a huge shell hit the mosque , " he said .
" It was absolutely incredible .
We starting screaming and calling for God . "
Silawi , who is blind , was led away to safety and was then told that his sons had died .
" Where is law ?
Where is justice ?
I have lived 91 years .
I have seen everything , but nothing of this sort .
It was such a catastrophe , " he said .
His son , Moteeh , the mosque 's sheikh , said there had been no warning before the missile struck .
" People came to the mosque for safety and we saw bloodshed , " he said .
" I was leading my father out when my own foot stepped on the head of a small child , " he said .
" I saw people carrying decapitated heads and parts of bodies .
I cannot describe what I saw …
What crime did the children commit ? "
In another case Ziad al - Deeb , a university student , described how an Israeli shell struck in the courtyard of his family home in Jabaliya on 6 January .
The blast killed 11 of his relatives and sliced off both his legs .
First he heard an explosion just outside the wall of the house and then moments later a second shell landed in their yard .
" In a single instant we had all of our joys replaced with blood , " he said .
" There was a severe whistling in my ears and a pillar of smoke and dust and that obliterated what happened .
When I looked up I found I had lost both my legs .
I was sprawled over the body of my own brother .
I looked for my father and others , and I found them motionless .
Most of them were dead . "
He lost his father , grandfather , two brothers and a sister in the blast , which was one of several mortar shells that fell in quick succession that afternoon near a UN prep school being used as a shelter for those fleeing the fighting .
Between 30 and 40 Palestinians were killed near the school .
An earlier UN inquiry has already found Israel responsible for the shelling .
After hearing his evidence , Goldstone said : " We extend our deep condolences to you and your family for your terrible loss and it makes your coming here all the more painful for you . "
Yesterday 's hearing was held at a UN office in Gaza City and then broadcast live to a hall at a nearby cultural centre , deserted save for a handful of journalists .
However , the hearing was broadcast on some television stations , including one al - Jazeera channel .
The UN inquiry team will issue a final report in August .
I played the demo for Resident Evil 5 a couple of months ago .
I felt like whoever put the thing together was trying to talk me out of getting the game .
I know Resident Evil has always been notoriously impoverished in the story department , but for the demo even that barely - perceptible vestige at narrative had been stripped away , along with all of the other things that might have made the experience compelling .
There was no building of tension , no explanation of the world or the characters , their purpose , or even the situation at hand .
No puzzles , no meaningful dialog , no in - game teaching of basic concepts before the fighting starts .
The demo simply drops you into zombietown and makes you fight zombies until an invisible timer runs out and you win .
At the end there was no hook , no situation where you can't wait to see what happens next , because you 're never given any clue as to what 's happening to begin with .
The only thing " demonstrated " in the demo is the raw combat mechanics , which I do n't think is the selling point here .
I doubt there are many players just dying to seize control of a musclebound turret - man who handles like a forklift in a phone booth .
All told , the demo offered only a few minutes of gameplay .
There was no real story , no sense of tension , no investment in the characters and their plight .
It was just an arena in which to shoot stuff that was bad and not shoot stuff that was good .
Nice try Capcom , but Robotron accomplished that much way back in 1982 .
Because complaining about bad entertainment is my favorite form of entertainment , I mentioned this on my blog .
The Capcom faithful came to the defense of their title .
" The demo was just for series veterans , not newcomers , " they said .
" It was just a gameplay demo , not a story demo . "
I do n't think that 's much of a defense .
Either this demo was intended for potential customers and failed utterly to offer them a compelling reason to take interest in the series , or the demo was aimed at fans who were already going to buy the game .
Either way :
What 's the point ?
Is n't the ultimate goal of marketing to get people to buy stuff ?
How does wasting everyone 's time move us any closer to that lofty goal ?
" Do n't be stupid .
Everyone knows the story of Resident Evil .
You shoot zombies .
You 're just looking for something to complain about . "
I 'd buy that argument if this was n't part of an overarching trend .
I spent a weekend going through a lot of Xbox 360 demos and was amazed at how many of them were just a few minutes of chaotic action that made no effort to engage the player or make them want more .
There were games I 'd never heard about that just began with the assumption that I was already familiar with the series .
The demo for Dead Space was the same as the Resident Evil 5 demo .
No explanation for who you are , where you are , what 's going on , or what your goals are beyond " go over there and press a button . "
You start in a hallway , read some tooltips , and then open a door and start blasting away like you 're playing 1992's Wolfenstein 3D .

Why would a survival horror game need any of that ?
all of the best foods have “ bizzaro ” versions : regular pizza has dessert pizza , apple pie has chicken pot pie , and monkey bread has …savory monkey bread ( though if you ’re looking for a really good sweet monkey bread recipe , go HERE ) .
this works out great , because while i have a serious sweet tooth , the girl usually prefers more savory flavors .
just like sweet monkey bread , the dough is a cinch to bring together .
i used green onion and parley with a bit of greyere cheese , but any combination of herbs works .
i could see adding some crumbled bacon as well …
when we were kids , the best part of making monkey bread was tearing it into tiny pieces and rolling it in cinnamon and sugar .
with savory monkey bread , you roll the pieces in herb butter .
then you arrange all the dough pieces in a pan , and brush them with more butter .
right before baking , you give it yet another brush of butter .
i guess it goes without saying , but the finished monkey bread is incredibly buttery and rich .
this would be great dish to just put out and snack on with some friends .
i wanted to give a gigantic shout out to everyone who donated to the susan g komen breast cancer 5 k last week .
if it was possible for me to give hugs through the internet , please know that i would .
it was a fun event and you all really came through .
you guys are the best .
and finally , i think i mentioned briefly last week that i was moving soon – well it ’s happening this weekend .
i’m saying goodbye to my current kitchen and hello to my new one .
pro : i now have a dishwasher !
con : i now have an electric range .
it may take some time to adjust .

Ahh - madillos :
Four orphaned babies nursed after mother is killed by poachers
He is so tiny that a plant pot makes a roomy enclosure .
This four - day - old armadillo is one of four being cared for by an environmentalist after their mother was killed by poachers .
Due to shortage of space in the local zoo , activist Kamilo Lara is caring for the animals at his home in Managua , Nicaragua .
Brothers in armour :
This four - day - old armadillo is one of four orphaned siblings rescued by environmentalist Kamilo Lara
When they are old enough - in about two months ' time - Mr Lara will release them back into the wild .
The tiny creatures , who are being bottle - fed , are Common Armadillo ( Dasypus novemcinctus ) , an endangered species , and were found and rescued by Mr Lara of environmental organisation Alerta Mundial ( World Alert ) .
Mr Lara eventually wants to create a rescue centre that will focus on restoring the natural habitat of the armadillos and other at - risk creatures .
Helping hand : Mr Lara bottle - feeds one of the armadillos in his home in Managua , although one of the creature 's siblings looks as though he would prefer to feed himself , below
Right now , the babies look fragile and tiny but once they grow , the hard , leathery plates for which they are famous will start to cover their stout bodies , head , legs and tail .
The bony plates earned the armadillo its name - the word is Spanish meaning ' little armoured one ' .
For the past four years , Republican reformers have been warning of political disaster ahead .
Our party 's ideas have fallen behind the times , we are losing key demographic groups , and we have suffered disappointment and defeat in four of the six national elections since 1998 .
You'd think that such a record would demand reform .
Yet most conservatives prefer to rationalize the dismal trends .
They say :
There 's nothing wrong with conservatism .
We lost in 2006 because of overspending and Iraq .
We lost in 2008 because of the financial crisis and John McCain .
There 's no need to change or adapt .
All we need to do is return to first principles .
Rush is right !
Last week , Gallup delivered seeming confirmation to these reform - averse conservatives .
The proportion of Americans who identify themselves as conservatives has jumped by three points in the past 12 months , from 37 percent to 40 percent .
That rise re-establishes conservatives as the single biggest ideological bloc in the electorate .
( Last year , conservatives tied moderates at 37 percent each . )
Meantime , only 21 percent of Americans identify themselves as liberals .
Good news !
Or is it ?
Let 's think harder about those numbers and what they really mean .
A big conservative bloc does not automatically translate into a big Republican vote .
Republicans managed to lose elections in 1992 and 1996 , and lose the popular vote in 2000 , even though conservative voter identification in those years reached 43 percent , 40 percent , and 40 percent , respectively .
Obviously , 40 percent of the vote is not a winning margin in a two - party system .
Even if we assume that every single one of those self - described conservatives votes Republican , the GOP still needs to pick up another 10 points or so from moderate voters .
Ironically , it is the very strength of conservatism that makes it more difficult for Republicans to appeal to moderates .
The Democrats know that their core group , liberals , is relatively small .
Better still , the liberals know it , too .
Sensing their own weakness , liberals allow their party to make compromises : to position itself closer to the center , to say things that appeal to moderate and conservative ears .
The large conservative bloc within the GOP feels no such need for compromise .
It feels free to chase moderates away .
Who needs them ?
The result is to divide the American political system between a cohesive and highly ideological Republican Party and a less ideological but larger Democratic coalition extending from the left through the middle .
Nor is it a valid assumption that all those who call themselves " conservative " will vote Republican .
Voters do not always use words in the same way that politicians and pundits do .
Which was the " conservative " position on the Dubai ports deal : The Wall Street Journal 's or Lou Dobbs ' ?
How do we reconcile the " conservative " view that the Social Security trust fund is an illusion and the alternative " conservative " view that the trust fund has been pillaged by unscrupulous politicians ?
Voters may describe themselves ideologically , but that does not necessarily mean that ideology ranks at the top , or even very high , on their list of concerns .
What does dominate their concerns is actual performance .
Bill Clinton was able to win re-election in 1996 — despite the conservatism of the electorate — because he could plausibly claim to have delivered prosperity , welfare reform , and reduced budget deficits .
Republicans were wiped out in 2006 and 2008 because GOP policy did not translate into benefits voters could see .
Maybe we just got unlucky .
But if the reformers are right about the obsolescence of Republican policy ideas , then those ideas may not work any better next time .
Even conservative voters would rather pay a 40 percent marginal rate on a rising income than a 36 percent rate on a stagnant one .
A last concern : the demographic trends of the electorate .
Voters under 30 look very different from voters over 30 .
Gallup divided the sample into four categories by age : 18 –29 , 30 – 49 , 50 –64 and over 65 .
Conservatives were the largest block in each of the latter three groups : 48 percent among the over 65s ; 42 percent among the 50 –64s ; 41 percent among the 30 –49s .
Under 30 , however , moderates were the largest group , with liberals and conservatives practically tied : 31 percent for liberals , 30 percent for conservatives .
Maybe these young people will grow more conservative with age .
But they differ from their elders in a number of ways that will not change :
They are less white , less religious , and more highly educated — all risk factors for voting Democrat .
If conservatism draws its strength from those segments of the electorate that are fated to fade in the years ahead , conservatism will fade with them .
Thus the urgency with which reformers make their case and seek conservative recruits : Join , or die .
There 's no question that the PSPgo was probably one of Sony 's worst - kept secrets , especially in the days leading up to E3 2009 .
While many of us drooled over the sliding screen and thinner design , the lack of a UMD had many scratching their heads .
One of the big questions
Sony faced after the PSPgo 's big reveal earlier this week was , what would happen with existing PSP games ?
Without the UMD drive , gamers upgrading to the newer PlayStation Portable will have no way to play their favorite games without hanging on to the older model , or purchasing the titles again -- in digital format - - from the PlayStation Network Store .
" We 're in the midst of putting together a good will program , " said John Koller , Director of Hardware Marketing for Sony while speaking with Gizmodo .
" We 'll be unveiling that soon [ because ] we actually think there 's a significant group that will be upgrading from the 1000 .
In the past , we 've seen a 20 - 25 % trade - up factor , and I assume that 's going to be the case here .
We 've modeled that .
So we 're looking at a good - will program - - a short term good - will program that would continue for years afterward . "
According to Mr. Koller , the method would be similar to Portable Copy , a means to insert a Blu-ray disk into the PlayStation 3 and transfer the movie over to the portable device 's memory stick .
In this case , consumers will not be " ripping " the UMD disks , but rather use a PlayStation Network digital distribution model in which users must register to use .
It 's also possible that consumers will be required to enter the game 's UPC number listed on the box in order to " unlock " a digital version .
And because Portable Copy is free , it 's easy to assume that the UMD service will be free as well although that bit of info went unconfirmed .
Mr. Koller also added that the company was currently looking at what kind of games will be offered through the service , indicating that not every UMD title will be available for digital download .
Currently the PlayStation Network offers " UMD Legacy " titles , a library of 39 classic UMD - based games including LocoRoco , MediEvil Resurrection , Ratchet and Clank : Size Matters , Untold Legends : The Warrior 's Code , and more .

Browser Security : Lessons from Google Chrome
Google Chrome developers focused on three key problems to shield the browser from attacks .
Charles Reis , Google
Adam Barth , UC Berkeley
Carlos Pizano , Google
The Web has become one of the primary ways people interact with their computers , connecting people with a diverse landscape of content , services , and applications .
Users can find new and interesting content on the Web easily , but this presents a security challenge : malicious Web - site operators can attack users through their Web browsers .
Browsers face the challenge of keeping their users safe while providing a rich platform for Web applications .
Browsers are an appealing target for attackers because they have a large and complex trusted computing base with a wide network - visible interface .
Historically , every browser at some point has contained a bug that let a malicious Web - site operator circumvent the browser ’s security policy and compromise the user ’s computer .
Even after these vulnerabilities are patched , many users continue to run older , vulnerable versions .
5
When these users visit malicious Web sites , they run the risk of having their computers compromised .
Generally speaking , the danger posed to users comes from three factors , and browser vendors can help keep their users safe by addressing each of these factors :
The severity of vulnerabilities .
By sandboxing their rendering engine , browsers can reduce the severity of vulnerabilities .
Sandboxes limit the damage that can be caused by an attacker who exploits a vulnerability in the rendering engine .

The window of vulnerability .
Browsers can reduce this window by improving the user experience for installing browser updates , thus minimizing the number of users running old versions that lack security patches .

The frequency of exposure .
By warning users before they visit known malicious sites , browsers can reduce the frequency with which users interact with malicious content .
Each of these mitigations , on its own , improves security .
Taken together , the benefits multiply and help keep users safe on today ’s Web .
In this article , we discuss how our team used these techniques to improve security in Google Chrome .
We hope our first - hand experience will shed light on key security issues relevant to all browser developers .
Reducing Vulnerability Severity
In an ideal world , all software , including browsers , would be bug - free and lack exploitable vulnerabilities .
Unfortunately , every large piece of software contains bugs .
Given this reality , we can hope to reduce the severity of vulnerabilities by isolating a browser ’s complex components and reducing their privileges .
Google Chrome incorporates several layers of defenses to protect the user from bugs , as shown in figure 1 .
Web content itself is run within a JavaScript virtual machine , which acts as one form of a sandbox and protects different Web sites from each other .
We use exploit barriers , such as address - space layout randomization , to make it more difficult to exploit vulnerabilities in the JavaScript sandbox .
We then use a sandbox at the operating - system level to limit the process itself from causing damage , even if exploits escape the earlier security mechanisms .
In this section , we discuss in more detail how these layers of defense are used .
Security Architecture
Google Chrome uses a modular architecture that places the complex rendering engine in a low - privilege sandbox , which we discuss in depth in a separate report .
1 Google Chrome has two major components that run in different operating - system processes : a high - privilege browser kernel and a low - privilege rendering engine .
The browser kernel acts with the user ’s authority and is responsible for drawing the user interface , storing the cookie and history databases , and providing network access .
The rendering engine acts on behalf of the Web principal and is not trusted to interact with the user ’s file system .
The rendering engine parses HTML , executes JavaScript , decodes images , paints to an off - screen buffer , and performs other tasks necessary for rendering Web pages .
To mitigate vulnerabilities in the rendering engine , Google Chrome runs rendering - engine processes inside a restrictive operating - system - level sandbox ( see figure 1 ) .
The sandbox aims to prevent the rendering engine from interacting with other processes and the user ’s operating system , except by exchanging messages with the browser kernel via an IPC channel .
All HTTP traffic , rendered pages , and user input events are exchanged via such messages .
To prevent the rendering engine from interacting with the operating system directly , our Windows implementation of the sandbox runs with a restricted Windows security token , a separate and invisible Windows desktop , and a restricted Windows job 12 object .
These security mechanisms block access to any files , devices , and other resources on the user ’s computer .
Even if an attacker is able to exploit a vulnerability and run arbitrary code in the rendering engine , the sandbox will frustrate the attacker ’s attempts to install malware on the user ’s computer or to read sensitive files from the user ’s hard drive .
The attacker ’s code could send messages to the browser kernel via the IPC channel , but we aim to keep this interface simple and restricted .
Getting existing code bases such as rendering engines to work fully within this type of sandbox sometimes presents engineering challenges .
For example , the rendering engine typically loads font files directly from the system ’s font directory , but our sandbox does not allow such file access .
Fortunately , Windows maintains a system - wide memory cache of loaded fonts .
We can thus load any desired fonts in the browser - kernel process , outside the sandbox , and the rendering - engine process is then able to access them from the cache .
There are a number of other techniques for sandboxing operating - system processes that we could have used in place of our current sandbox .
For example , Internet Explorer 7 uses a “ low rights ” mode that aims to block unwanted writes to the file system .
4
Other techniques include system - call interposition ( as seen recently in Xax2 ) or binary rewriting ( as seen in Native Client14 ) .
Mac OS
X has an operating system - provided sandbox , and Linux processes can be sandboxed using AppArmor and other techniques .
For Windows , we chose our current sandbox because it is a mature technology that aims to provide both confidentiality and integrity for the user ’s resources .
As we port Google Chrome to other platforms such as Mac and Linux , we expect to use a number of different sandboxing techniques but keep the same security architecture .
Exploit Mitigation
Google Chrome also makes vulnerabilities harder to exploit by using several barriers recommended for Windows programs .
8
These include DEP ( data execution prevention ) , ASLR ( address space layout randomization ) , SafeSEH ( safe exception handlers ) , heap corruption detection , and stack overrun detection ( GS ) .
These are available in recent versions of Windows , and several browsers have adopted them to thwart exploits .
These barriers make it more difficult for attackers to jump to their desired malicious code when trying to exploit a vulnerability .
For example , DEP uses hardware and operating - system support to mark memory pages as NX ( non-executable ) .
The CPU enforces this on each instruction that it fetches , generating a trap if the instruction belongs to an NX page .
Stack pages can be marked as NX , which can prevent stack overflow attacks from running malicious instructions placed in the compromised stack region .
DEP can be used for other areas such as heaps and the environment block as well .
Stack overrun detection ( GS ) is a compiler option that inserts a special canary value into each stack call between the current top of the stack and the last return address .
Before each return instruction , the compiler inserts a check for the correct canary value .
Since many stack - overflow attacks attempt to overwrite the return address , they also likely overwrite the canary value .
The attacker cannot easily guess the canary value , so the inserted check will usually catch the attack and terminate the process .
Sophisticated attacks may try to bypass DEP and GS barriers using known values at predictable addresses in the memory space of all processes .
ASLR , which is available in Windows Vista and Windows 7 , combats this by randomizing the location of key system components that are mapped into nearly every process .
When used properly , these mechanisms can help prevent attackers from running arbitrary code , even if they can exploit vulnerabilities .
We recommend that all browsers ( and , in fact , all programs ) adopt these mitigations because they can be applied without major architectural changes .
Compatibility Challenges
One of the major challenges for implementing a security architecture with defense in - depth is maintaining compatibility with existing Web content .
People are unlikely to use a browser that is incompatible with their favorite Web sites , negating whatever security benefit might have been obtained by breaking compatibility .
For example , Google Chrome must support plug-ins such as Flash Player and Silverlight so users can visit popular Web sites such as YouTube .
These plug-ins are not designed to run in a sandbox , however , and they expect direct access to the underlying operating system .
This allows them to implement features such as full - screen video chat with access to the entire screen , the user ’s webcam , and microphone .
Google Chrome does not currently run these plug-ins in a sandbox , instead relying on their respective vendors to maintain their own security .
Compatibility challenges also exist for using the browser ’s architecture to enforce the same - origin policy , which isolates Web sites from each other .
Google Chrome generally places pages from different Web sites into different rendering - engine processes , 11 but it can be difficult to do this in all cases , as is necessary for security .
For example , some frames may need to be rendered in different processes from their parent page , and some JavaScript calls need to be made between pages from different origins .
For now , Google Chrome sometimes places pages from different origins in the same process .
Also , each rendering - engine process has access to all of the user ’s cookies , because a page from one origin can request images , scripts , and other objects from different origins , each of which may have associated cookies .
As a result , we do not yet rely on Google Chrome ’s architecture to enforce the same - origin policy .
Recently , some researchers have experimented with browsers ( such as OP7 and Gazelle13 ) that do attempt to enforce the same - origin policy by separating different origins into different processes and mediating their interaction .
This is an exciting area of research , but challenges remain that need to be overcome before these designs are sufficiently compatible with the Web .
For example , supporting existing plug-ins and communication between pages is not always straightforward in these proposals .
As these isolation techniques improve , all browsers will benefit .
Reducing the Window of Vulnerability
Even after we have reduced the severity of vulnerabilities , an exploit can still cause users harm .
For example , a bug might let a malicious Web - site operator circumvent the same - origin policy and read information from other Web sites ( such as e-mail ) .
To reduce the danger to users , Google Chrome aims to minimize the length of time that users run unpatched versions of the browser .
We pursue this goal by automating our quality - assurance process and updating users with minimal disruption to their experience .
Automated Testing
After a vulnerability is discovered , the Google Chrome team goes through a three - step process before shipping a security patch to users :
The on - duty security sheriff triages the severity of the vulnerability and assigns an engineer to resolve the issue .
The engineer diagnoses the root cause of the vulnerability and writes a patch to fix the bug .
Often security patches are as simple as adding a missing bounds check , but other patches can require more extensive surgery .
The patched binary goes through a quality assurance process to ensure that ( a ) the issue is actually fixed ; and ( b ) the patch has not broken other functionality .
For a software system as complex as a Web browser , step 3 is often a bottleneck in responding to security issues , because testing for regressions requires ensuring that every browser feature is functioning properly .
The Google Chrome team has put significant effort into automating step 3 as much as possible .
The team has inherited more than 10,000 tests from the WebKit project that ensure the Web platform features are working properly .
These tests , along with thousands of other tests for browser - level features , are run after every change to the browser ’s source code .
In addition to these regression tests , browser builds are tested on 1 million Web sites in a virtual - machine farm called ChromeBot .
ChromeBot monitors the rendering of these sites for memory errors , crashes , and hangs .
Running a browser build through ChromeBot often exposes subtle race conditions and other low - probability events before shipping the build to users .
Security Updates
Once a build has been qualified for shipping to users , the team is still faced with the challenge of updating users of older versions .
In addition to the technical challenge of shipping updated bits to every user , the major challenge in an effective update process is the end - user experience .
If the update process is too disruptive , users will defer installing updates and continue to use insecure versions .
5
Google Chrome uses a recently open - sourced system called Omaha to distribute updates .
6
Omaha automatically checks for software updates every five hours .
When a new update is available , a fraction of clients are told about it , based on a probability set by the team .
This probability lets the team verify the quality of the release before informing all clients .
When a client is informed of an update , it downloads and installs the updated binary in a parallel directory to the current binary .
The next time the user runs the browser , the older version defers to the newer version .
This update process is similar to that for Web applications .
The user ’s experience is never disrupted , and the user never has to wait for a progress bar before using the browser .
In practice , this approach has proven effective for keeping users up to date .
A recent study of HTTP User - Agent headers in Google ’s anonymized logs reveals how quickly users adopt patched versions of various browsers .
3
We reproduce their results in figure 2 .
In these measurements , Google Chrome ’s auto - update mechanism updates the vast majority of its users in the shortest amount of time , as compared with other browsers .
( Internet Explorer is not included in these results because its minor version numbers are not reported in the User - Agent header . )
Reducing Frequency of Exposure
Even with a hardened security architecture and a small window of vulnerability , users face risks from malicious Web - site operators .
In some cases , the browser discourages users from visiting known malicious Web sites by warning users before rendering malicious content .
Google Chrome and other browsers have taken this approach , displaying warning pages if a user tries to visit content that has been reported to contain malware or phishing attempts .
Google works with StopBadware.org to maintain an up - to - date database of such sites , which can be used by all browsers .
One challenge with using such a database is protecting privacy .
Users do not want every URL they visit reported to a centralized service .
Instead , the browser periodically downloads an efficient list of URL hashes without querying the service directly .
To reduce the space required , only 32 - bit prefixes of the 256 - bit URL hashes are downloaded .
This list is compared against a list of malicious sites .
If a match is found for a prefix , the browser queries the service for the full 256 - bit hashes for that prefix to perform a full comparison .
Another challenge is minimizing false positives .
Google and StopBadware.org have tools to help publishers remove their pages from the database if they have been cleaned after hosting malware .
It is also possible for human errors to flag sites incorrectly , as in an incident in January 2009 that flagged all URLs as dangerous .9
Such errors are typically fixed quickly , though , and safeguards can be added to prevent them from recurring .
These services also have false negatives , because not every malicious page on the Web can be cataloged at every point in time .
Although Google and StopBadware.org attempt to identify as many malicious pages as possible , 10 it is unlikely to be a complete list .
Still , these blacklists help protect users from attack .
Conclusion
There is no silver bullet for providing a perfectly secure browser , but there are several techniques that browser developers can use to help protect users .
Each of these techniques has its own set of challenges .
In particular , browsers should minimize the danger that users face using three techniques :
Reduce attack severity by applying the principle of least privilege in the browser architecture .
This technique limits the damage caused when an attacker exploits a vulnerability .
Reduce the window of vulnerability by ensuring updates are developed and deployed as quickly as possible .
This technique minimizes the number of vulnerable browsers an attacker can target .
Reduce how often users are exposed to attacks by filtering out known malicious content .
This technique protects users during vulnerable time windows .
The Google Chrome team has focused on each of these factors to help provide a secure browser while preserving compatibility with existing Web content .
To make Google Chrome even more secure , we are investigating further improvements to the browser ’s security architecture , such as mitigating the damage that plug - in exploits can cause and more thoroughly isolating different Web sites using separate sandboxed processes .
Ultimately , our goal is to raise the bar high enough to deter attackers from targeting the browser .

Most current and historic problems in computer and network security boil down to a single observation : letting other people control our devices is bad for us .
At another time , I ’ll explain what I mean by " other people " and " bad . "
For the purpose of this article , I ’ll focus entirely on what I mean by control .
One way we lose control of our devices is to external distributed denial of service ( DDoS ) attacks , which fill a network with unwanted traffic , leaving no room for real ( " wanted " ) traffic .
Other forms of DDoS are similar : an attack by the Low Orbit Ion Cannon ( LOIC ) , for example , might not totally fill up a network , but it can keep a web server so busy answering useless attack requests that the server can’t answer any useful customer requests .
Axel Arnbak , Hadi Asghari , Michel Van Eeten , Nico Van Eijk - Security Collapse in the HTTPS Market
HTTPS ( Hypertext Transfer Protocol Secure ) has evolved into the de facto standard for secure Web browsing .
Through the certificate - based authentication protocol , Web services and Internet users first authenticate one another ( " shake hands " ) using a TLS / SSL certificate , encrypt Web communications end - to - end , and show a padlock in the browser to signal that a communication is secure .
In recent years , HTTPS has become an essential technology to protect social , political , and economic activities online .
Sharon Goldberg - Why Is It Taking So Long to Secure Internet Routing ?
BGP ( Border Gateway Protocol ) is the glue that sticks the Internet together , enabling data communications between large networks operated by different organizations .
BGP makes Internet communications global by setting up routes for traffic between organizations - for example , from Boston University ’s network , through larger ISPs ( Internet service providers ) such as Level3 , Pakistan Telecom , and China Telecom , then on to residential networks such as Comcast or enterprise networks such as Bank of America .
Ben Laurie - Certificate Transparency
On August 28 , 2011 , a mis-issued wildcard HTTPS certificate for google.com was used to conduct a man - in - the - middle attack against multiple users in Iran .
The certificate had been issued by a Dutch CA ( certificate authority ) known as DigiNotar , a subsidiary of VASCO Data Security International .
Later analysis showed that DigiNotar had been aware of the breach in its systems for more than a month - since at least July 19 .
It also showed that at least 531 fraudulent certificates had been issued .
The final count may never be known , since DigiNotar did not have records of all the mis-issued certificates .

The image of Neda Agha - Soltan dying on a Tehran street just a week ago spread round the world in hours .
Via the internet 's most powerful media – YouTube , MySpace , Facebook – a lo- fi cell phone video showed the world her dying moments , after she was shot by a sniper as she watched Iranian security forces clash with demonstrators angry at the presumed " stealing " of Iran 's presidential election .
Close - ups of her face , streaked with blood , joined the landmark images of recent history : US soldiers raising the flag after capturing Iwo Jima from Japan in 1945 ; a naked child screaming from napalm burns as she flees in Vietnam , 1972 ; the lone student facing down Chinese tanks in Tiananmen Square , 1989 .
Within hours , the power of Neda 's final moments had inspired songs , poetry and the creation of websites such as Nedanet , where hackers offer Iranians ways to circumvent online censorship .
The web has made Tehran the world capital of online dissent , and Neda is at its hub .
Download the new Independent Premium app Sharing the full story , not just the headlines
A Facebook page called " Angel of Iran " , one of 50 , was set up to mourn her and candlelit vigils sprang up across the world .
" Such a beautiful young lady to have been subjected to the slings and arrows of a corrupt Islamic regime , " lamented one entry .
Her face adorned placards last week at unauthorised demonstrations in Tehran and elsewhere , even though security forces turned out in ever greater numbers to crush protests .
Despite the repression , Neda 's slaying appears to have stiffened the resolve of those who support the opposition leader Mir Hossein Mousavi 's drive to get the election results annulled .
It has also drawn the scrutiny of the world .
President Barack Obama , previously reluctant to be seen to stir up already troubled relations with Iran , called the video heartbreaking .
" We have seen courageous women stand up to brutality and threats , and we have experienced the searing image of a woman bleeding to death on the streets , " he said .
" While this loss is raw and painful , we also know this : those who stand up for justice are always on the right side of history .
I think that anybody who sees it knows that there 's something fundamentally unjust about it . "
His sentiments were echoed countless times in tributes across the internet .
One blogger wrote : " I do n't quite understand what 's going on in Iran right now , but I am so touched by this woman 's story .
I am most touched because she was just a regular person .
A regular person who wanted to have regular freedoms like the kind of freedoms I would want if I were her .
Sometimes it's hard for me to be sympathetic with people fighting for a cause because I have become a bit desensitised by all the images of fighting , war , burning vehicles , bombs , etc .
But this woman brought it all home to me again .
When I heard her story and saw her picture , I could imagine that being me . "
In Iran , the fact that Neda was not a protester was academic .
Her fiancé , Caspian Makan , said : " Neda 's goal was not to support Mousavi or [ President ]
Ahmadinejad , she was just in love with her country .
She was a young woman , but gave a big lesson to everybody ... Neda just wanted to have freedom for everybody . "
The security forces warned relatives and neighbours of the dead woman not to speak or mourn her publicly , associates said .
They even banned her family from commemorating her death in the local mosque and asked them to take down the black mourning banners in front of their house .
But friends and acquaintances have continued to celebrate her life and mourn her death online .

Neda Agha-Soltan was born in Tehran in 1982 .
Her father worked for the government .
A family of modest means , they are said to be typical of Iran 's middle class .
Neda was loyal to the country 's Islamic roots and traditional values , friends say , but also curious about the outside world , which was easily accessed through satellite TV , the internet and occasional trips abroad .
The second of three children , she studied Islamic philosophy at Tehran 's Islamic Azad University until deciding to pursue a career in tourism .
She took private classes to become a tour guide , including Turkish - language courses , friends said , hoping to one day to lead groups of Iranians on trips abroad .
Travel was her passion , and with her friends she saved up to go on package tours to Dubai , Turkey and Thailand .
She also loved music , especially Persian pop , was herself an accomplished singer and was taking piano lessons .
" She was a person full of joy , " said her music teacher and friend , Hamid Panahi .
" She was a beam of light .
I 'm so sorry .
I was so hopeful for this woman . "
The speed with which Neda became an emblem of resistance clearly took the Iranian authorities by surprise .
They moved swiftly to stifle protests around her death .
She was buried quickly and with no wake .
Those people who tried to defy the authorities faced physical threats and intimidation .
Last Friday , small groups of people gathered at Tehran 's Behest-e Zahra cemetery to mourn her .
Members of the government 's Basij militia had beaten passers - by , so mourners arrived in groups of two or three , muttering brief prayers before leaving .
Neda 's grave , marked by a small cement block , was covered with flowers and green ribbons , the signature colour of Mousavi 's campaign .
" What sin did she commit ? " asked a young woman who was in tears as she knelt by the grave .
An elderly man who came with his family – one of the children wearing a green wrist - band – said , " Pray for our future . "
The authorities ' attitude has only served to feed the online rebellion .
When the bullets and batons failed to stem the tide , the authorities came up with their most incredible explanation of her death , suggesting on Thursday that the BBC 's expelled correspondent , Jon Leyne , arranged for Neda to be killed so he could get good propaganda pictures .
They even suggested she might have been shot in the back by a protester .
Both suggestions were dismissed as " outrageous nonsense " by Arash Hejazi , the 38 - year - old Iranian doctor who tried in vain to save Neda .
Dr Hejazi , who studies at Oxford , was in Tehran on business when he witnessed the killing .
" As a doctor I 'd seen death before , but I never thought I 'd have such a feeling .
It was not just her death , but the injustice of the thing and the gaze in her eyes as life was leaving her , " he wrote in a blog .
Fearing for his life , Dr Hejazi fled Iran and fears he may not be able to return .
President Ahmadinejad said yesterday that Mr Obama had made a mistake by criticising Iran over the violence inflicted on protesters .
Amid a security clampdown , added to on Friday when a cleric demanded protesters face the death penalty , the opposition is struggling to maintain momentum in its campaign to get the election results annulled .
FEDERAL WAY , Wash. , May 21 ( UPI ) --
Police in Washington state said a suspect used his genitals as a puppet while standing over an air conditioner intake at an apartment complex .
The police report of the incident said Timothy Wayne Martin , 44 , of Auburn , Wash . , was arrested after residents of the Arcadia Apartment Complex in Federal Way called police at about 10:30 a.m.
May 13 and reported a man standing over an air conditioner intake wearing only an unbuttoned flannel shirt and " was apparently manipulating " his penis with a string " like a puppet , " Seattlepi.com reported Thursday .

Police said Martin was arrested at the scene and still had the string attached to his penis .
He was charged under the state 's felony indecent exposure statute due to having two prior convictions for similar crimes .
Martin was also in possession of a small quantity of methamphetamine at the time of his arrest .
Police said he also had a pornographic magazine .
The suspect was taken to the Norm Maleng Regional Justice Center in lieu of $ 25,000 bail .

Emmanuel Santos looks at the rise of an important new environmental struggle in the Dominican Republic .
ENVIRONMENTAL ACTIVISTS around the Dominican Republic are mobilizing to stop the construction of a cement factory in the Los Haitises national park .
The factory would displace 500 peasant families and degrade one of the most important ecosystems in the country and the Caribbean region .
Los Haitises is located in the municipality of Gonzalo , one of the poorest towns in the country , and is a repository of vast water reservoirs that benefit more than 1 million people .
The move to allow construction of a highly toxic factory amounts to a new government privatization of public lands .
It 's also part of a recent right - wing assault on civil liberties that led to the outlawing of abortion in April .
That success has given the government more confidence to bypass the country 's environmental laws .
But resistance is building .
On May 16 , hundreds of activists set up an encampment in Los Haitises to protest a recent government concession granted to the Consorcio Minero Dominicano ( Dominican Mining Consortium ) to extract limestone from sedimentary rocks to manufacture cement .
In the recent weeks , the local population led huge mobilizations against the mining company to defend the biodiversity that sustains the local economy and their lives .
What you can do Tell the Dominican Embassy in the U.S. that you oppose the government concession to build the cement factory .
Telephone 202-332-6280 , fax 202-265-8057 , or e-mail [ email protected ] .
Spanish readers can find information and updates about the encampment and the struggle to save Los Haitises at the Eco Lucha RD and Salvemos Los Haitises Web sites .
Contact [ email protected ] with letters of solidarity and to find out how you can help .
As soon as news spread about the proposed cement factory , student activists organized a campaign to revoke the government concession .
In addition , the left and some labor unions expressed solidarity with the struggle and joined the encampment .
Meanwhile , the nominally left - wing Dominican Revolutionary Party ( PRD ) , the second - largest opposition party , is calling the government to revoke the concession .
The government concession was issued by Jaime David Fernández Mirabal , the environment minister .
He is under criticism for going against the advice of his own technicians in the Environment and Natural Resources Department , who issued a report warning of the environmental destruction the construction of a cement factory in Los Haitises could unleash .
Mirabal was vice president from 1996 to 2000 during the first administration of current President Leonel Fernández .
That government also privatized national landholdings , including the sale of public beaches in order to attract foreign investment in the tourist sector .
Participants in the encampment at Los Haitises National Park ( Pastor de la Rosa )
Today , however , many commentators say that Mirabal is out of touch with public opinion , since he refuses to back down in spite of widespread opposition to the cement factory .
Geologists and environmentalists have joined the opposition to the factory , pointing out that Mirabal 's decision violates more than 20 environmental laws .
( Fernández , for his part , is on an official European visit to avoid criticism ) .
Moreover , a second report issued jointly by the Academy of Science and the Environmental Commission of the State University ( UASD ) called for the immediate revocation of the government concession and relocation of peasant 's communities who have been displaced throughout the years .
Since the 1980s , thousands of Haitian and Dominican peasants have been forcefully removed from Los Haitises by the military .
Though the Dominican government promised to pay compensation for their lands and crops , compensation never arrived in most cases .
Prior to carrying out any evictions , the government criminalizes peasants with the aid of the mainstream media by accusing them of cutting down trees and destroying the biodiversity of the park .
But the sole purpose of evicting peasants to declare Los Haitises a protected area was to exert more private control over the forest and exploit its natural resources .
The real criminals here are n't the local peasants , but politicians and powerful economic interests .
They may not get their way , however .
Student activists are bringing together a new generation of environmentalists and left - wingers for the first time to build a united front of sorts .
This will lay the ground for a stronger environmentalist movement in the future .
It 's important that we show solidarity with the people of Los Haitises to win the fight against privatization of national resources and displacement of people from their homes before it is too late .

I am not a hard - core gamer .
I 'm not even a medium - core gamer .
My core , gaming - wise , could best be described as " nougaty . "
Oh , I play a lot of games , across all sorts of genres , but it 's always on standard difficulty .
The only game I 've gotten 100 percent completion on is the odd Sudoku .
I had kind of a heavy World of Warcraft thing going on for a while , but claiming to be a hard - core gamer because you play a lot of Warcraft is like claiming to be a criminal mastermind because you can't stop shoplifting nicotine patches .
Even though I 've somehow managed to come to terms with the fact that I do n't care about videogames more than every other thing in the entire universe , sometimes a game rubs it in my face .
Most recently it was Super Mario Bros 2 , a game released in 1988 for the Nintendo Entertainment System .
I downloaded it on the Wii — supposedly not a hard - core system — and realized that I am nothing .
I may not have mastered games like Halo 2 , but at least I finished them .
This is because they have this obscure little feature called " save games . "
You might not have heard of it — it 's kind of obscure — but here 's how it works .
Say you spend four hours fighting a boss where you have to perfectly time your attacks while dodging flame and giant rock fists .
First off , saving your game lets you go straight to the boss instead of having to mow through mooks every time you lose a fight .
Secondly , and perhaps more importantly , saving your game makes it so that you never have to look at that monster ever again .
It 's like a bad date ; once you get through it , it 's over .
You can seek counseling and move on .
In the years since save games were invented , I 've come to think of it as an essential and important part of the game experience .
Playing Super Mario Bros 2 — which I somehow managed to miss back in 1988 — reminded me that saves are the tool of the weak and feeble , and that true hard - core gamers all but died out with the Thompson Twins .
The Wii has a save feature that lets you stop playing and pick the game up later — essentially an extended pause button — and the game has a limited number of continues , but if you use up your lives and continues , it 's back to World 1 - 1 for you .
I have n't even gotten to World 3 - 1 yet , and already I hate World 1 - 1 with an aching , gnawing passion .
It 's not that World 1 - 1 is tough , it 's just that I have to look at it over and over .
And Super Mario Bros. 2 is actually a fairly forgiving game for the time .
There is , notoriously , no accepted definition for " hard - core gamer . "
Is the classification based on which games you play , how you play them or which platform you prefer ?
Checking out gaming message boards , apparently the term is usually used to mean " someone who likes the same games I do . "
It sounds like we could use a standard definition .
So here 's my proposal .
Every game , in addition to the standard easy , medium and expert modes , must have a " 1988 mode . "
In 1988 mode , you do n't get to save the game , ever .
If you lose , you start over from the beginning of the game .
Every hit from an enemy reduces your hit points by 25 percent , minimum .
Extra lives and hit points are tough to come by , not handed out like Mardi Gras beads to bosomy exhibitionists .
This applies to all games , not just shooters and platformers and the like .
Lose against the big boss in an RPG ?
Hey , guess what , you 're Level 1 again and townsfolk are going to remind you to press X to pick things up .
Flub " Painkiller " in Rock Band 2 ?
Time to start over with " Eye of the Tiger . "
Only those who complete a game in 1988 mode get to call themselves " hard - core . "
Everyone else , from tourney winners to Minesweeper addicts , is a " casual gamer . "
Gotta draw the line somewhere .

In its bold march to become a credible collaboration and communication suite for businesses , Google Apps has encountered a frequent roadblock that has proven more vexing than expected to circumvent : good old Microsoft Outlook .
Google apparently underestimated how attached employees are to Outlook , the venerable e-mail program that epitomizes the " fat " collaboration and communication PC applications that Google despises and has vowed to eradicate from workplaces with its Web - hosted Apps suite .
Google announced Gmail For Your Domain -- the cornerstone for what would become Google Apps -- in February 2006 , positioning its webmail service as an alternative hosted e-mail system for businesses vis- à -vis expensive and hard - to - manage internal messaging servers like Microsoft Exchange .
Although it gave Gmail support for POP3 ( Post Office Protocol 3 ) and IMAP ( Internet Message Access Protocol ) so that end - users could synchronize messages with Outlook and other PC e-mail applications , Google resisted for years creating a specific Outlook synchronization tool .
For Google , adopting Apps involved accepting a new way of communicating and collaborating in the workplace , namely with Web - hosted applications , the software - as - a - service ( SaaS ) model that it views as the future , versus what it considers the pass é , desktop - centric Outlook and Office .
In addition to POP3 and IMAP , Google also developed its Gears browser plug - in for providing offline access to Apps components like Gmail and the Docs office productivity suite .
Yet , even when given the possibility to use Gmail as an e-mail front end with and without an Internet connection , enough workplace users bristled at the thought of giving up Outlook .
Apparently , the resistance became more strident as Google has tried to market Apps to larger businesses , those with 1,000 or more end -users .
Last month , Google unveiled , rather surprisingly , its Outlook synchronization tool for Apps , spinning the occasion as a happy one , when in fact it could as well be viewed as a capitulation , a concession of defeat .
Google has found out that , yes , many companies are happy to ditch Exchange for Gmail if it means saving money and eliminating the grief of maintaining Exchange in - house .
However , and maybe to a degree unexpected by Google , it also discovered that many companies consider it a deal - breaker to lose the functionality that the Outlook - Exchange combo provides , thanks to the deep links that exist between this client - server tandem .
So Google embarked -- probably grudgingly -- down the path that other e-mail vendors have traveled with little success : trying to replicate the Outlook - Exchange experience with their back - end e-mail server and Outlook .
Here was Google apparently getting dragged into the Microsoft way of doing things , creating -- gasp ! -- a piece of PC software : an Outlook plug - in .
The problems and complaints started immediately .
Right away , industry analysts cautioned CIOs and IT managers to examine the Google tool closely , warning them that it could n't fully replicate in Gmail the functionality of the Outlook - Exchange combination , lacking basic features like the ability to synchronize Outlook notes and tasks , for example .
Barely a week after the tool 's announcement , Google acknowledged it had several embarrassing bugs , including that it broke Windows Desktop Search , which is used to search Outlook data .
While Google scrambled for a fix , the Windows Desktop Search workaround sounded like an IT manager 's nightmare : Uninstall the Google tool , unless you had version 1.0.22.1945 , in which case you had to first install the latest version and then uninstall it to re-enable indexing .
Over at Redmond , Microsoft posted its own take on the problem in an official blog , characterizing the issue as " a serious bug / flaw " and overruling Google 's workaround remedy .
Uninstalling the Google tool would n't solve the problem , Microsoft said , providing step - by - step instructions for adjusting affected registry keys .
It took Google two long weeks to deliver the fixes for the search problem and other bugs .
Bill Pray , a Burton Group analyst , thinks it was a strategic mistake for Google to build the Outlook sync tool .
Google will never be able to offer full parity with Outlook - Exchange , so die - hard Outlook holdouts will never be happy , he said .
Meanwhile , Google will spend significant resources and effort not only to increase the plug - in 's capabilities , but to also keep it up - to - date with the latest Outlook patches and upgrades , Pray said .
" It will take Google a lot of time , maintenance and continued effort to maintain the interoperability , " Pray said .
A better strategy for Google would have been to play to the strengths of the Apps suite and of Gmail in particular , betting on winning the support of the new generation of enterprise end -users , he said .
" Strategically , it costs more than it is worth to keep that Outlook connector working well than it is to compete on the strength of your own e-mail client [ software ] alternative , " Pray said .
Prior to the launch of Apps Sync for Microsoft Outlook , Google was on the offensive , finding new ways to compete against Outlook by highlighting the differences between the Microsoft fat client and the server - centric , hosted Gmail .
" What Google will find is that while it will initially satisfy some demand with the Outlook connector , the connector will ultimately fail against the enterprise expectation that it work perfectly , " Pray said .
People joining the workforce increasingly are comfortable and familiar with webmail services like Gmail , a trend that is organically reducing Outlook 's appeal , he said .
By bending over backwards to accommodate Outlook holdouts , Google is weakening its case for the use of Gmail and Apps , Pray said .
Google holds a different view .
The goal for the first version of Apps Sync for Microsoft Outlook was to meet " 90 percent to 95 percent " of Outlook users ' needs , which was accomplished , said Rajen Sheth , Google Apps senior product manager .
That includes the synchronization of e-mail , calendar items and contacts between Outlook and Gmail in " much the same way " as it works between Outlook and Exchange , he said .
While acknowledging that the tool does n't offer full feature parity right now , Sheth promised that Google will extend its functionality aggressively .
" As you know , with Google , our first release is never our last release .
We have a strong philosophy of getting something out there in the market that is strong and meets the needs , but then continue to iterate on it to add more and more functionality , " Sheth said .
" You 're going to see us do that aggressively with this product , just like we do with everything else .
We 'll continue to add releases to it , to add features , to make it better and better and go from 90 [ percent ] to 95 percent to close to 100 percent of the use cases , " Sheth added .
Many people embrace Gmail 's end - user interface when their companies adopt Apps , but companies of all sizes have vocal contingents of workers with a deep attachment to Outlook , for which the IMAP synchronization falls short , he said .
" There 's a specialized experience that Outlook users have when using it with Exchange Server , and we wanted to make their experience with Google Apps to be as close as possible to that experience , " Sheth said .
Google remains convinced that what it views as the benefits of the Web - based Gmail user interface will continue to be recognized in workplaces and will win converts even among Outlook die - hards .
Outlook loyalists can be found even in places that help companies adopt Google Apps , such as systems integrator Epicentro in Milan , Italy .
Epicentro provides
Apps implementation services and has also used the suite internally since 2006 , when it migrated from Exchange to Gmail .
After several years , it still has " a few active users " of Outlook , said Mauro Ginelli , a Google Enterprise Applications specialist at Epicentro .
After testing the plug - in , Epicentro plans to install it on its Outlook users ' computers .
Ginelli thinks Apps Sync for Outlook will help convince potential customers to switch from Exchange to Apps .
It gives Outlook users synchronization for e-mail , calendar and contacts , and can smooth out a progressive migration to the Gmail interface , as opposed to sudden and forced transition , he said via e-mail .
Rob Ardill , IT consultant at Metro Wireless and Networking in Adelaide , South Australia , also foresees that Apps Sync for Outlook will help him convince clients to give up Exchange for Apps , but believes that Google needs to take the product farther .
" If Google is serious about stealing Exchange customers , then they must offer native 1:1 features .
This offering really targets those who have considered defecting to Google Apps and did n't want to jump without basic Outlook integration , " he said via e-mail .
" Those looking for more advanced features will certainly stay with Exchange . "
It thus remains to be seen whether Apps Sync for Outlook will be a successful endeavor or a futile attempt to beat Outlook at its own game .

Saudi beauty queen Aya Ali al - Mulla trounced 274 rivals to win a crown , jewellery , cash and a trip to Malaysia , and all without showing her face .
With her face and body completely covered by the black head - to - toe burqa mandatory in the conservative Muslim kingdom , 18 - year - old Mulla was named “ Miss Moral Beauty ” on Friday .
There was none of the swimsuit and evening gown competitions and heavy media coverage of beauty pageants elsewhere when the contest was decided in the eastern city of Safwa .
Instead , the winner and the two runner - up princesses had to undergo a three - month test of their dutifulness to their parents and family , and their service to society .
This included a battery of personal , cultural , social and psychological tests .
Miss Moral Beauty , which was inaugurated last year , is Saudi Arabia ’s first pageant for women .
The only pageants being held earlier were for goats , sheep , camels and other animals , aimed at encouraging livestock breeding .
Mulla and other contestants spent nearly 10 weeks attending classes and being quizzed on themes including ‘ Discovering your inner strength , ’ ‘ The making of leaders ’ and ‘ Mom , paradise is at your feet ’ — a saying attributed to Prophet Muhammad to underline that respect for parents is among the faith ’s most important tenets .
The contestants also spent a day at a country house with their mothers , where they were observed by female judges and graded on how they interacted with them .
It was unclear exactly what Mulla did to pip her rivals in the huge field , but Saudi newspaper Al - Watan reported that the high school graduate had good grades and hopes to go into medicine .
She raked in a 5,000 - riyal ( $ 1,333 ) prize , a pearl necklace , diamond watch , diamond necklace , and a free ticket to Malaysia with her win .
Beauty contests focused on physical beauty are non-existent in segregated Saudi Arabia , where women can not mix with unrelated men , and must appear in public completely covered — even in photographs .
“ The real winner in this competition is the society .
The winners represent the culture of the society and its high Islamic morals , ” one of the organisers told Al - Watan .
Nachwuchsjournalistenpreis „ Folgen der Internetpiraterie “ – ausgerichtet vom SPIEGEL
Da muss man sich wirklich mal kurz die Augen ausreiben : Beim diesjährigen Schülerzeitungswettbewerb hat sich der SPIEGEL , eigentlich das Qualitätsaushängeschild des deutschen Magazinjournalismus ( im Rahmen des allgemeinen Verfalls das deutschen Printjournalismus gen Glamour und Quote ) ja ein paar schöne Partner an Bord geholt : Neben der Schaubühne Berlin , der SOS Kinderdörfer , DasTelefonbuch und respect .de finden wir in der Riege auch den Bundesverband Musikindustrie , der die folgenden Ziele auf der Partnerseite für sich beansprucht :
Ziele der Arbeit sind unter anderem :
* die Weiterentwicklung des nationalen und internationalen Urheberrechts
* die Schaffung geeigneter rechtlicher Rahmenbedingungen für einen effizienten Schutz geistigen Eigentums
* die Stärkung der Musikindustrie als wesentliche Säule der wachsenden Kreativwirtschaft
* die Anerkennung von Musik als wichtigen Kultur - und Wirtschaftsfaktor
Ein wirtschaftlich starker Partner ist der Verband in jedem Fall , und schreibt dafür im Rahmen des Wettbewerbs auch gleich einen Sonderpreis aus , den man nur als schäbige Anleitung zum Auftragsjournalismus bezeichnen kann .
Und ohne Reflexion ( schäm dich , SPIEGEL ! ) ist auf den Seiten von Spiegel Online nun folgendes zu lesen :
Geht ’s noch , SPIEGEL ?
Nicht mal der Versuch einer Verschleierung ?
Wieviel muss man zahlen als Partner des Schülerzeitungswettbewerbs – und ist es das wert , seine Credibility zu verbrennen ?
Wunderbarer Kommentar auf Keimform dazu ( Spon = SPIEGEL online ) :
Herzlichen Glückwunsch , Spon !
Ihr habt gezeigt , was Journalismus im schlechtesten Fall ist : Hörigkeits - Berichterstattung im Interesse derjenigen , die Geld und Einfluss haben und diese Privilegien verteidigen wollen .
Ihr zeigt , wohin die Reise geht : Objektivität , Abwägung von Argumenten und “ Bandbreite ” werden sorgfältig innerhalb des Rahmens des ideologisch Vorgegebenen und den Mächtigen ( in diesem Fall : einem noch immer einflussreichen und finanzmächtigen Industriezweig ) Gefälligen praktiziert − und damit wertlos , ja sogar negativ , nämlich zu Erfolgsfaktoren für die Durchsetzung der verlangten Ansicht .
Schlimmer noch , ihr habt gezeigt , wie man diese auch bei Erwachsenen schon reichlich unschönen Praktiken durch ein Belohnungssystem frühzeitig in den Köpfen junger Menschen verankert .
Wie man Nachwuchsjournalisten dafür , dass sie systemkonform und brav schreiben , eine erhebliche Belohnung gibt ( nicht nur das Geld , sondern vor allem einen wichtigen Schritt auf dem Weg zum Erreichen ihres Berufswunschs ) .
Ihr habt die Korrumpierung auf eine neue Stufe gehoben und anschaulich demonstriert , warum man dem etablierten Journalismus zunehmend das Vertrauen entzieht .
Also jammert bitte nicht demnächst wieder darüber .
Here ’s a composite of all the tools together , a sort of metal age electrician ’s alphabet .
Some people have viewed this project through the lens of sustainability .
While self - sufficiency and locally sourced material would certainly seem to be sustainable , my methods fail quite spectacularly in environmental analysis .
For one , I used an estimated 20 kg of charcoal to produce perhaps 20 g of metal .
Much of this was wasted in the learning curve , but it was used just the same .
This is a fuel to metal ratio of 1000:1 .
The worst modern metal process I am aware of , the Pidgeon process operating in China to produce magnesium with coal , has a ratio of 25:1 , 4000 % more efficient than my process .
Sourcing charcoal from forest fire trees uses carbon that would probably end up in the air anyway , but this resource would run out so quickly if used on any scale .
Moreover , I had zero emissions control .
While roasting my copper ores , I directly vented all the gases being produced .
The noxious sulphur dioxide , chief precursor to acid rain , gagged me when I got too close .
Moreover , I got sick twice after this phase of the process .
At first I assumed this was from the sulphur , but after further reading , my symptoms more closely resembled mild arsenic poisoning .
Arsenic is a heavy metal usually found in ores of copper that sublimates away during the roasting process .
So I have to issue a “ do n’t try this at home ” warning .
The only way I can see this process being described as sustainable is that I was distracted from more effective activities of consumption for 6 weeks .
But this is easily canceled out by the 3 round - trip cross-continental voyages taken to complete the project .
Copper production on the island of Cyprus probably ended because of complete , and permanent , deforestation to make charcoal .
In other words , more primitive or Earthy processes are not necessarily more sustainable .
My project is about the origin of technologies - the ability for them to emerge out of context - but not their ability to sustain themselves .
A sustainable society is not really the most natural option ; humans began as a nomads exhausting the resources of places and then moving on .
Maybe people in the future will look back on us just as we can look back on our predecessors , and see the answer to a lasting society lying on the ground all around us , just waiting to be put together with the right information .
* Do n’t use paper towels at all if you can .
Use old clothes as rags .
Have cloth napkins ( we just use microfiber clothes you can buy in bulk at Big Lots or an auto place )
* Do n’t drink anything that comes in cans .
Drink tap water preferably , make tea ( use loose leafs or herbs you can grow ) , or make lemonade .
* Turn off and unplug anything you can .
Hang dry clothes .
Only flush toilets as necessary .
Do everything you can to save on utilities .
Do n’t turn on lights more than you have to , and then use fluorescent bulbs and the fewer the better .
*
Do n’t ever buy something thinking
“ It ’s only $ 1 ! ” Those things add up quick , even candy bars and chewing gum .
Big things : focus on housing , transportation , and any regular bills ( cancel cable / satellite if you have it ) .

Avigdor Lieberman ’s attempt to turn Israel into fascist state rejected
Much has been made among individuals like Christopher Hitchens and the like of Foreign Minister Avigdor Lieberman ’s fascist past .
He was a member of Meir Kahane ’s racist and fascist “ Kach Movement , ” and has long discussed forcing people living within Israel ’s borders to swear an oath to the country and its symbols .
Well his proposal was shot down by a ministerial vote of 8 - 3 , with only members of his ultra- right wing fascist Yisrael Beitenu party rejected this idea outright .
Here ’s the story from the AP :
The Israeli government on Sunday threw out a proposal aimed at minority Arabs to require an oath of loyalty to Israel as a Jewish state or risk losing their citizenship , dealing a blow to the country ’s ultranationalist foreign minister , who spearheaded the proposal .
Avigdor Lieberman , a rising force in Israeli politics , made the proposal a central plank of his election campaign last February .
The message , which sought to play on the perceived disloyalty of Israel ’s Arab citizens , helped propel his Yisrael Beitenu Party to a strong third place finish in the parliamentary vote .
Lieberman ’s electoral success was seen as evidence of growing polarization between Israel ’s Jewish and Arab citizens .
Many Israeli Arabs , once considering themselves bridges between Israel and the Arab world , have become alienated in the Jewish state and side openly with the Palestinians in their struggle against Israel .
Arabs make up about one - fifth of Israel ’s 7 million citizens .
The draft would have allowed the Interior Ministry to strip even native Israelis of their nationality if they refused to swear allegiance to the Jewish state and “ its symbols and values ” and profess their willingness to perform military service .
Cabinet Secretary Tzvi Hauser said the proposal was rejected 8 - 3 by a ministerial committee on legislation .
With the exception of Yisrael Beitenu , all parties in the government , including Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu ’s Likud , opposed the proposal .
Netanyahu has not commented on the draft .
Many Israelis have described the proposal as racist .
It also met resistance from the ultra-Orthodox Shas Party because it could have affected ultra-Orthodox Jews , most of whom are currently exempt from military service on religious grounds and would not be eager to endorse the symbols and values of the state , which they consider too secular .
Firstly , the idea of a loyalty oath is 100 % rooted in authoritarianism , or at the least horrendous , a monarchy .
Secondly , forcing people who do n’t even believe in the symbols of Israel to be loyal to them is even worse .
Thirdly , to think of anyone who is n’t a right wing Jew as an enemy is the same kind of fucked up nonsense that got this country in trouble during the 2002 - 2005 period .
It ’s not even remotely a part of a free society .
How the fuck did someone as blatantly opposed to freedom and any notion of even 20th century thinking like Avigdor Lieberman get such a high ranking post ?
His existence in the Israeli government is a tough pill to swallow for leftist supporters of Israel ( like myself ) .
For the first time , NOAA scientists have demonstrated that tsunamis in the open ocean can change sea surface texture in a way that can be measured by satellite - borne radars .
The finding could one day help save lives through improved detection and forecasting of tsunami intensity and direction at the ocean surface .
“ We ’ve found that roughness of the surface water provides a good measure of the true strength of the tsunami along its entire leading edge .
This is the first time that we can see tsunami propagation in this way across the open ocean , ” said lead author Oleg Godin of NOAA ’s Earth System Research Laboratory and the Cooperative Institute for Research in Environmental Sciences , in Boulder , Colo .
Large tsunamis crossing the open ocean stir up and darken the surface waters along the leading edge of the wave , according to the study .
The rougher water forms a long , shadow - like strip parallel to the wave and proportional to the strength of the tsunami .
That shadow can be measured by orbiting radars and may one day help scientists improve early warning systems .
The research is published online this week in the journal , Natural Hazards and Earth System Sciences .
The new research challenges the traditional belief that tsunamis are too subtle in the open ocean to be seen at the surface .
The findings confirm a theory , developed by Godin and published in 2002 - 05 , that tsunamis in the deep ocean can be detected remotely through changes in surface roughness .
In 1994 , a tsunami shadow was captured by video from shore moments before the wave struck Hawaii .
That observation and earlier written documentation of a shadow that accompanied a deadly tsunami on April 1 , 1946 , inspired Godin to develop his theory .
He tested the theory during the deadly December 26 , 2004 , Indian Ocean tsunami , the result of the Sumatra - Andaman earthquake .
Godin and colleagues analyzed altimeter measurements of the 2004 tsunami from NASA ’s Jason - 1 satellite .
The data revealed clear evidence of an increased surface roughness along the leading edge of the tsunami as it passed across the Indian Ocean between two and six degrees south latitude .

Tsunamis can be detected in several ways .
One detection method uses a buoy system that warns coastal communities in the United States of an approaching tsunami .
NOAA ’s Deep - ocean Assessment and Reporting of Tsunamis ( DART ) early warning system uses sensors on the ocean floor to measure changes in pressure at each location .
The DART network of 39 stations extends around the perimeter of the Pacific Ocean and along the western edge of the North Atlantic Ocean and Gulf of Mexico .
The technology provides accurate , real - time information on the amplitude , over time , of an approaching tsunami .
NOAA 's tsunami warning centers then use this information to forecast the tsunami's impact on coastlines .
A second method uses space - borne altimeters to detect tsunamis by measuring small changes in sea surface height .
Only a handful of these instruments are in orbit and the observations are limited to points along a line .
The new study presents a third way to detect tsunamis — by changes in the texture of the surface water across a wide span of the open ocean .
Godin ’s research confirmed his theory that a tsunami wave roughens the surface water through air - sea interaction .
First the leading edge of the tsunami wave stirs up the surface winds .
Those same winds , which become more chaotic than the wave itself , then churn the surface waters along the slope of the wave .
Because rough water is darker than smooth water , a contrast forms between the dark , rough water of the wave and the bright , smooth water on either side of it .
Common scientific instruments , called microwave radars and radiometers , are able to detect this contrast , known as a tsunami shadow .
When orbiting the Earth , microwave radars and radiometers can observe a band of ocean surface hundreds of kilometers wide and thousands of kilometers long .
If programmed correctly to observe sea surface roughness , they could potentially map an entire tsunami , said Godin .
The paper , “ Variations in sea surface roughness induced by the 2004 Sumatra - Andaman tsunami , ” by O. A. Godin , V. G. Irisov , R. R. Leben , B. D. Hamlington , and G. A. Wick , appears in Natural Hazards and Earth System Sciences , a journal of the European Geosciences Union .
' Monster ' stabbed sisters 37 times A man who repeatedly stabbed two sisters in their Birmingham flat , turning it into a " cauldron of blood " , has been jailed for life .
Mohammed Ali , 29 , of Old Snow Hill , used three knives to kill on - off girlfriend Yasmine Larbi - Cherif , 22 , and her sister Sabrina , 19 , last year .
Ali , whose own barrister described him as a " hateful individual " , must serve a minimum of 34 years .
A judge rejected Ali's claim that he was provoked into the killings .
The sisters ' bodies were found in their flat in the Jupiter complex .
During the trial at Birmingham Crown Court , jurors heard Ali , who stabbed both women in the lounge before dragging their bodies into a bedroom , described as an " evil monster " .
You barbarically and brutally butchered these two girls
Mr Justice Hamblen
The court heard Yasmine , a salsa dancer originally from Algeria , had also undergone " a beating " in the attack last September .
Ali claimed he was provoked after Yasmine had laughed at him about the time he had spent in prison on remand after she made an allegation of rape against him which was later withdrawn .
Ali's claim that he had been provoked was rejected ( photo : Caters )
She had become pregnant by him twice , resulting in two terminations , the trial heard .
Sentencing Ali , who was not in court , Mr Justice Hamblen at the Royal Courts of Justice in London said : " You barbarically and brutally butchered these two girls , turning their flat into a cauldron of blood .
" This was n't a case of provocation .
" It was a case of anger and retribution in the case of Yasmine and of cover - up in the case of Sabrina . "
The court had heard that on 14 September Ali stabbed Yasmine twice and her sister 35 times before dragging their bodies into a bedroom .
Bloodstained clothes
He twice went into the kitchen to rearm himself after breaking two of the knives .
Ali was captured on CCTV leaving their flat in Ryland Street carrying a bag thought to contain his bloodstained clothes .
He was arrested two days later at a ferry terminal in Dover , Kent , trying to leave for France .
He originally arrived in the UK as an Iraqi asylum seeker , but had told friends he was Moroccan .
In mitigation , defence barrister Michael Bromley - Martin QC told the court Ali had led a difficult life before his arrival in Britain in 1999 and called him a " troubled , if not damaged " man .
Det Ch Supt David Mirfield , of West Midlands Police , said he was pleased with the sentence which had brought to a close months of investigation and hard work .

Washington , DC : Massachusetts Democrat Barney Frank , along with co-sponsors Ron Paul ( R - TX ) ; Maurice Hinchey ( D - NY ) ; Dana Rohrabacher ( R - CA ) ; and Tammy Baldwin ( D - WI ) , will reintroduce legislation today to limit the federal government ’s authority to arrest and prosecute minor marijuana offenders .
The measure , entitled an “ Act to Remove Federal Penalties for Personal Use of Marijuana by Responsible Adults , ” would eliminate federal penalties for the personal possession of up to 100 grams ( over three and one - half ounces ) of cannabis and for the not - for - profit transfer of up to one ounce of pot – making the prosecutions of these offenses strictly a state matter .
Under federal law , defendants found guilty of possessing small amounts of cannabis for their own personal use face up to one year imprisonment and a $ 1,000 fine .
Passage of this act would provide state lawmakers the choice to maintain their current penalties for minor marijuana offenses or eliminate them completely .
Lawmakers would also have the option to explore legal alternatives to tax and regulate the adult use and distribution of cannabis free from federal interference .
To date , thirteen states have enacted laws ‘ decriminalizing ’ the possession of marijuana by adults .
Minor marijuana offenders face a citation and small fine in lieu of a criminal arrest or time in jail .
“ The federal government has much more important business to attend to than targeting , arresting and prosecuting adults who use marijuana responsibly , ” NORML Executive Director Allen St. Pierre said .
“ This is an issue that ought to be handled by the states , not the Feds . ”
According to nationwide polls , three out of four voters believe that adults who possess marijuana should not face arrest or jail , and one out of two now say that cannabis should be regulated like alcohol .
The reintroduction of the Frank / Paul bill comes one week after the duo reintroduced HR 2835 , The Medical Marijuana Patient Protection
Act of 2009 – which seeks to halt federal interference in states that have enacted medical marijuana laws – and just days after Rep. Mark Kirk ( R - IL ) called for federal legislation to sentence certain first - time marijuana offenders to 25 years in prison .
“ The US Congress has a definite choice , ” said St. Pierre .
“ They can choose the path of compassion , fiscal responsibility , and common sense by supporting Barney Frank ’s and Ron Paul ’s efforts , or they can continue down America ’s failed drug war path by endorsing Rep.
Kirk ’s draconian legislation .
It is abundantly clear which direction the voters wish to go ; will their elected officials follow ? ”
Additional information about the ‘ Act to Remove Federal Penalties for Personal Use of Marijuana by Responsible Adults ’ is available at NORML ’s Take Action Center .

With an impending 28th birthday on my mind , I spent some quiet time this evening reflecting on my recent past .
And I ’ve come to realize that my 20 ’s taught me a lot about life .
So , I figured I ’d share a few lessons I ’ve learned along the way .
If you ’re smiling right now , you ’re doing something right .
It ’s not so much what you say that counts , it ’ how you make people feel .
The biggest mistake you can make is doing nothing because you ’re scared to make a mistake .
No matter how it turns out , it always ends up just the way it should be .
Either you succeed or you learn something .
Win -Win . Freedom is the greatest gift .
Self - sufficiency is the greatest freedom .
If you catch yourself working hard and loving every minute of it , do n’t stop .
You ’re on to something big .
Because hard work ai n’t hard when you concentrate on your passions .
It ’s not about getting a chance , it ’s about taking a chance .
You ’ll rarely be 100 % sure it will work .
But you can always be 100 % sure doing nothing wo n’t work .
Sometimes you just have to go for it !
Complaining is like slapping yourself for slapping yourself .
It does n’t solve the problem , it just hurts you more .
The one with nothing to hide is always the one left standing tall .
You can press forward long after you can’t .
It ’s just a matter of wanting it bad enough .
There ’s a big difference between knowing and doing .
Knowledge is basically useless without action .
In work and business , when they need you more than you need them , you have succeeded .
Everything that happens in life is neither good nor bad .
It just depends on your perspective .
We are all weird .
And life is weird .
And when we find someone whose weirdness is compatible with ours , we call it love .
True friendship and true love do sustain the tests of distance and time .
You ca n’t change who you are .
You can only change what you know and how you apply this knowledge .
It is okay to be angry .
It is never okay to be cruel .
Even when you feel like you have nothing , someone else likely has far less .
Find them and help them .
You ’ll see why .
Having a thousand credentials on the wall will not make you a decent human being .
But genuinely helping one person everyday will .
Remember , change happens for a reason .
Roll with it .
It wo n’t be easy , but it will be worth it .
And I leave you with this question :
How old would you be if you did n’t know how old you are ?
Exclusive Little more than a month after acquiring Virtual Iron for an undisclosed fee , Oracle is effectively killing the company 's virtualization product .
In a letter to Virtual Iron 's sales partners , Oracle says it " will suspend development of existing Virtual Iron products and will suspend delivery of orders to new customers . "
And in a second letter to a partner speaking with The Reg , the company says it will not allow partners to sell new licenses to anyone - including existing customers - after the end of this month ( i.e. in 11 days ) .
Before then , partners can only sell licenses to existing customers under certain conditions .
" Until June 30 , 2009 , Oracle may approve granting add - on licenses to existing Virtual Iron end customers , or licensing end customers who had demo’d or otherwise evaluated the former Virtual Iron products and do not require further delivery , " the second letter reads .
As many expected , Oracle intends to meld Virtual Iron 's product with its own Oracle VM .
Both are based on the open - source Xen hypervisor .
" Oracle has completed a thorough review of the Virtual Iron product portfolio , and intends to fully integrate Virtual Iron technology with Oracle VM , Oracle 's server virtualization and management product , " Oracle 's letter to partners reads .
" When the integrated product becomes generally available , Virtual Iron customers will be able to move to the new , integrated product and benefit from a more feature rich - solution than is available today . "
But Oracle has not said when the combined product will arrive , and Virtual Iron 's partners and customers may feel that Oracle has left them out to the cold in terminating the company 's product so swiftly .
Presumably , it will take several months - if not a full year - to combine the two products .
Oracle says it will still provide support for Virtual Iron .
But if existing customers can no longer load the product on additional machines in their data centers , they may be forced to switch to another product - in which case , support is moot .
" So basically , anyone that built their hosting infrastructure on VI ... is now totally in the shit , " that partner tells us .
" Unless they buy a whole bunch of licenses before the end of June , they will be unable to buy any more node capacity for their clusters .
Oracle are shutting down the product , without giving customers some sort of replacement .
That 's a huge customer / partner channel shafting . "
Oracle 's letter does not say Oracle itself will refrain from selling licenses to existing customers .
The possibility remains that Oracle could accommodate existing accounts on its own - " shafting " partners but not customers .
But this seems unlikely .
Judging from financial numbers recently turned up by The New York Times , Virtual Iron has relatively few customers in danger of shafting .
According to The Times , the company had just $ 3.4 million in revenue last year , after spending $ 17.7 million on sales , marketing , research , development , and administrative costs .
Oracle 's motives are unclear - to say the least .
It may have bought Virtual Iron for its engineering talent and its code .
Or it may have bought the company simply to keep it away from competitors like VMware and Citrix .
Or both .
But it 's surprising that the company would risk losing Virtual Iron 's existing customers and partners .
Oracle has not responded to our requests for comment .
Perhaps the company is merely looking to save on support costs .
In its letter , the company says " Oracle has retained Virtual Iron support personnel , so the same people who provided support prior to the acquisition will continue to do so going forward . "
But our source says the company has let go all but about ten people from VI 's staff , and that two are on temporary contracts .
In its letter to partners , Oracle says it will continue to provide general support of the Virtual Iron Extended Enterprise Edition product through September 3 , 2009 for version 4.4 and through January 14 , 2010 for version 4.5 , according to existing agreements .
And it will offer lifetime support for all products .
But , again , this may be a moot point if customers can no longer buy new licenses .
" Oracle offering ' lifetime support ' to existing VI customers ... is a joke , as the product will effectively be dead , " the Virtual Iron partner says .
Meanwhile , Oracle has urged Virtual Iron partners to become Oracle partners .
" We value your investment and expertise in server virtualization , and encourage you to begin your partnership with Oracle right away , " the letter reads .
" In order to start the process , a letter terminating your current Virtual Iron partner agreement is being sent to your company . " ®
Update : Former Virtual Ironer speaks
According to a former Virtual Iron employee speaking with The Reg , the company has roughly 1,500 resellers and between 2,000 and 3,000 customers worldwide .
And many of these customers have purchased between 500 to 1,000 licenses .
Large customers include the FBI , Lackland Air Force Base in San Antonio , Texas , and several ISPs in both the US and the UK .
" To know that you can't buy anymore licenses in the future is pretty disruptive , " the former employee says .
He suspects that Oracle has no interest in courting Virtual Iron 's partners or customers .
He says that Oracle only negotiated with Virtual Iron through Oracle 's CTO office .
" Marketing and sales were never involved , " he explains , " which led me to believe they were only interested in the technology itself . "
Oracle is on the verge of acquiring Sun , which offers its own virtualization products , but during discussions over the purchase of Virtual Iron , Oracle said that it preferred Virtual Iron 's technology .
He says that Oracle has retained maybe 15 employees , and he believes Oracle has retained most of the support staff because it is legally obligated to provide support for existing Virtual Iron customers .
The Game Audio Mixing Revolution
By Rob Bridgett
[ In the second installment of Rob Bridgett 's series on the future of game audio , following his suggestion that audio mixing is primed for a revolution , the Scarface and Prototype audio veteran gathers mixing case studies on titles from LittleBigPlanet to Fable II , and concludes by looking at the next 5 - 10 years in the field . ]
Case Studies
In this installment , I would like to look in depth at several video game audio mix case studies .
I think it important for these studies not to contain just examples of projects I have been involved with here at Radical Entertainment , but also the varying tools and techniques that are used on other titles by other developers .
In this way we can begin to see common ground -- as well as the differences in approach from game to game and from studio to studio .
So , as well as comments on two of the games that I worked on , I reached out to the audio directors of titles including Fable II , LittleBigPlanet , and Heavenly Sword to explain the mixing process in their own words , as follows :
Scarface : The World Is Yours ( 2006 ) Xbox , PS2 , Wii , PC
Rob Bridgett , audio director , Radical Entertainment
" Scarface was the first game we had officially " mixed " at Radical , and we developed mixer snapshot technology to compliment some of the more passive techniques such as fall - off value attenuation which we already had .
The mixer system was able to connect to the console and to show the changes of the faders as they occurred at run-time , we could also edit these values live , while listening to the changes at run-time .
The entire audio production ( tools and sound personnel -- myself and sound coder Rob Sparks ) was taken off site to Skywalker Ranch for the final few weeks of game development .
We used an experienced motion picture mixer , Juan Peralta , who worked with us on a mix stage at Skywalker Ranch to balance the final levels of the in - game and cinematic sound .
Mixing time took a total of three weeks : two weeks on the PS2 version ( our lead SKU ) in Dolby Pro Logic II surround , and a further week exclusively on the Xbox version in Dolby Digital .
We also hooked up a MIDI control surface , the Mackie Control , to our proprietary software to further enable the film mixer to work in a familiar tactile mixing environment .
In terms of methodology , we played through the entire game , making notes and / or tweaks as we went .
One of the first things we needed to do was to get the output level down , as everything during development had been turned up to maximum volume , in order to make certain features audible above everything else .
Once we had established our default mixer level , we tweaked generic mixer events such as dialogue conversation ducks and interior ambience ducks which carried through the entire game .
We also spent time tweaking mixer snapshots for every single specific event in the game too , for example each and every NIS cinematic had its own individual snapshot , so we could tweak levels accordingly .
In total we had somewhere in the region of 150 individual mixer snapshots for the entire game , for individual mission specific events , generic events and cinematics .
Skywalker also has a home listening room with a TV and stereo speaker set - up , and we would often take the game there to check the mix . "
Above : A screenshot ( click for full size ) of Radical 's mixer snapshot technology in our proprietary engine ' Audiobuilder ' as used on Prototype .
Show in the main window are the various buses , to the left of which are the lists of predefined snapshots .
At the bottom left is also a run-time level meter that shows the output levels from the console ( whether it be the 360 , PS3 or PC )
Prototype : ( 2009 ) Xbox360 , PS3 , PC
Scott Morgan , audio director , Radical Entertainment
" Scott Morgan and myself spent a total of six weeks mixing the in - game content for this title .
Three weeks were spent on the Xbox 360 mix ; we also spent a further week on the PS3 with the cloned values from the 360 .
This was because we used a different audio codec on this platform and the frequencies of the sounds that cut through were noticeably different .
We also spent a further two weeks tweaking the mix , as final ( late ) cinematic movie content drifted in , and we integrated this into the game - flow .
In many ways we started mixing a little early -- four weeks prior to beta .
At this point in development the game code was fairly fragile and we experienced a lot of crashes and freezes which hindered the mix progress .
This meant , unfortunately , that on some days we got very little done , because of these stability issues .
These issues tended to disappear after beta , when the game code was considerably more solid .
The methodology used was that we played through the entire game , making notes and tweaking buses as we went .
The first day was spent getting the overall levels adjusted to a reasonable output level , we mixed at a reference listening level of 79dB .
We compared the game with both Gears of War 2 ( a much louder title ) and GTA IV ( a much quieter title ) in order to hit a comfortable mid-ground .
From then on , we played through the game in its entirety , tweaking individual channels as we went , with particular attention on the first two to three hours of gameplay .
One of the newer techniques we adopted for the mix was to record the surround output into Nuendo via one of the 8 - channel pre-outs on the back of the receiver .
What this allowed us to do was to see the waveform and compare levels with earlier moments in the game for internal consistency .
It also gave us instant playback of any audio bugs that we encountered , such as glitches or clicks , which we could get a coder to listen to and debug much faster than having them play through and reproduce .
This also gave us instant playback of any sounds that were too quiet , such as dialogue lines for mission - specific events , so we could quickly identify the line and correct the volume .
The game was mixed in a newly constructed 7.1 THX approved mix stage built at Radical Entertainment in 2008 .
We used our proprietary technology ( Audiobuilder ) , much improved from the Scarface project , but using many of the same mix features and techniques ( passive fall - off and reverb tuning with reasonably complex mixer snapshot behavior and functionality ) .
We again used hardware controllers , a Mackie Control Pro + 3
Extenders , that were able to display and give us tactile tuning control over all the bus channels on fader strips .
It has to be said that mixing a game at a reference listening level can be a fatiguing experience , especially over three or four weeks .
It is true that the sheer quantity of action and destruction in Prototype adds to this , so we devised a routine of regular breaks and also took whatever opportunity we could to test the mix on smaller TV speakers .
One of the most useful things about the way the Radical 's mix studio is equipped is that we have RTW 10800X - plus 7.1 surround meters , which allow us to see clearly and instantly what is coming from what speaker and very quickly debug any surround sound issues or double - check the game 's positional routing .
It is interesting to note that we used no LFE in the Prototype game whatsoever .
Knowing how much LFE is over - used in video games , it was decided early on that we would rely on crossover to the sub channel from the main speakers to provide the entire low end , in this way it gave us a far more controlled and clean low frequency experience . "
Fable II ( 2008 ) Xbox 360
Kristofor Mellroth , audio director , Microsoft Game Studios
" Kristofor Mellroth and Guy Whitmore flew out to Lionhead studios on Fable II to mix the game along with the dialogue supervisor Georg Backer and the composer / audio director Russ Shaw , who were already on site in the UK .
Using a very effective three - plus person team , they got a game that is very cleanly mixed .
We tend to mix games over two - plus days .
Set aside a minimum of two days , because you need time to digest the changes from the previous day .
Ear fatigue and exhaustion do factor in when you spend long hours mixing .
Ideally you 'd have a week .
The process is sort of painstaking and we try to play through the " golden path " during the final mix , but even then it 's usually too long to accomplish in our travel time - frame .
Instead , we know the key moments to test - mix .
We also test the entire range of game mechanics against each other .
With Fable , we knew what the key moments were .
We made sure to use debug to skip to them and play through as real players would .
One of the keys of game mixing , especially in the system for Fable II , is that radius is as , or more important than , volume modifiers .
Since we plan and chart radius mathematically we know how to change the values on one element of one game object and how that should stay in relation to other sounds .
This is a roundabout way of saying :
If radius sword hit = 60 meters while radius sword scrape = 30 meters , and we want the sword to have a bigger radius by five meters , it 's really easy to change all sword elements in one pass without noodling too much .
The math solves it for you .
This is very important when mixing for two player co-op .
Dynamic range is something else we push hard for .
We figure out what our loudest sound is and what our baseline quiet sound is .
Then we start to stack - rank sounds between .
For instance , I know in gameplay that X should be louder than Y unless factor Z is in play .
This gets really complicated but it is a good reality check when you 're getting lost in the piles of assets .
For Fable II it was Troll slam attack vs. player footsteps .
That is our maximum dynamic range .
That means when a troll is slamming his fists , even your legendary gunshot should be quieter .
This edge - case is also a good check if you 're wondering what your mix should sound like when you 're at another edge case , say two players on the same screen with one at max distance shooting at the troll in the foreground .
Should you be able to hear that max distance player reload ?
If you do , does it take you out of the emotional experience of fighting a giant monster ?
We wrestle with these questions and sometimes make compromises but in general I 'm happy with the results .
It worked well on Crackdown and it 's worked pretty well on Fable II .
It 'd be a lot easier if we could draw our own falloff curves !
If I had that I could have " cheated " the radius in just the perfect amount instead of relying on linear or equal energy falloffs .
This is something we need to add to the Lionhead tools for future titles and I 'd consider it a mandatory feature for all tool sets . "
LittleBigPlanet ( 2008 ) PS3
Kenneth Young , audio director , Media Molecule
" LBP uses FMOD , so we had to roll much of our own mixer functionality .
It uses FMOD 's channel groups to specify what is being mixed .
It does n't have a control UI ( other than notepad ) , but we do have real - time update of mix settings ( though stuff needs to be re-triggered to get the new values , so I 'd usually restart a level to get them ) .
We also have an in - game debug visualization of group levels .
We have an overall parent ( master ) snapshot where the level of every channel group is specified .
You can only have one of these active at any given time , but you can change it .
Then we have child ( secondary ) snapshots which override the parent -- these can contain one or as many channel group specifications as is required for that mix event .
It is hard - coded so that when two child snapshots are in place , and they both act upon a given channel group , the second snapshot cannot override the settings of the first .
( This works for LBP , but I can see why you 'd want explicit control over that -- or perhaps have a priority system in place ) .
We can specify level and also manipulate any exposed effect settings .
In the code which calls the snapshot we specify a fade - in and fade - out time for the smooth addition and subtraction of the child snapshot .
This is mainly used to cope with rather high level changes in the game 's context ; entering the start menu , a character speaks etc .
Interestingly , despite the fact the characters speak with gibberish voices , it sounded weird not ducking other sounds for them .
Before the fact I assumed it would n't matter what with their voices not containing any explicit information , but not focusing on their voices whilst they are " speaking " makes what they are saying ( i.e. what you are reading ) feel inconsequential .
I guess that 's a nice example of sound having an impact on your perception , and highlights the importance of mixing .
Other functionality which has an effect on the mix is auto - reduce on specified looping sounds so that after , say , 15 seconds from initial event trigger a loop will be turned down by a given amount over , say , 30 seconds so that it makes an impact and then disappears .
That 's hard - coded .
In terms of mixing time , as is typical , it was just me , and I mixed in the same room as the audio was developed in .
I tested the mix on other setups in the studio as well as taking a test kit home to try it out in a real - world environment , taking notes on things that could be improved .
The mix was a constant iterative process throughout development with a couple of days during master submission dedicated to final tweaks . "
LittleBigPlanet 's mixer debug screen ( click for full size )
Heavenly Sword ( 2007 ) PS3
Tom Colvin , audio director , Ninja Theory
" Heavenly Sword also used FMOD .
FMOD provides the ability to create a hierarchical bus structure as described in the section above .
Each bus can have its own volume and pitch values , which can be modified in real - time .
At the time , FMOD had some performance constraints related to the number of sub - buses within the bus structure , so we tried to keep the hierarchy as simple as possible .
The Ninja Theory tools team built our own proprietary GUI , which allowed us to configure mix snapshots , and adjust the mix in real - time .
We were able to prevent the game from updating the mix if desired , so we could play with a mix template without the game suddenly changing the mix on us while we were working .
We also had an in - game onscreen debug UI that showed us what mix templates were active , their priorities and so on .
Mixer snapshots were largely activated and deactivated by scripted events .
This was one of the weaknesses of the mix system -- the game scripts were not the easiest things to work with -- they obviously could n't be changed while the game was running , and reboot times were long , so it was pretty time consuming getting the mix templates to switch on and off in the right places .
We decided to set up a blanket set of empty templates before the mix session , so we would n't have to spend time actually getting the templates to switch on and off whilst mixing .
This constrained the scope of the mix somewhat .
NT 's audio coder ( Harvey Cotton ) devised a snapshot priority system , which simplified implementation a great deal .
The priority system made sure that the snapshot with the highest priority was the one you actually hear .
Here 's an example of how this would work .
You 're in a combat section of the game , and you perform one of the special moves , and then pause the game during this special move -- what would happen with the mix system ?
A default low priority mix would always be active .
When the special move was initiated , a higher priority " special moves " template would be activated ( we used scripted events fired from animations to do this . )
When the user pressed pause , the pause mix would activate , and having the highest priority , would then take over from the special move mix .
At this point , three different mix templates are " active " , but only one is audible .
The game is un-paused , and we move back to the next lowest priority template , the special move ends , and we move back to the default .
The priority system is important because it prevents you from needing to store the game 's previous mix state , in order to return to it once any given scenario has finished .
Throughout development we constantly checked the mix on as many setups as possible -- a reasonable spec TV , our own dev-monitors , crappy PC speakers , etc .
During mastering , we had a week to set up the final mix templates .
The mixing environment was a calibrated mix room .
Our one week of mixing did n't really feel like enough .
There were all sorts of content changes we wanted to make at the mix stage , which just were n't possible due to time constraints . "
Game Mixing : The Next Five ( to Ten ) Years
I was going to call this section ' The Next Five Years " , but looking back over the last five years , I am reminded how glacial progress seems to be in these areas .
If all this stuff happened in the next three years , our jobs as sound designers would be awash with exciting new possibilities and endless high quality sonic possibilities , but wait ... slow down , slow down ....
I would like to explore some of the areas where I see video game mixing heading in the next few years .
There are certainly a great many opportunities , and many ways to go about integrating new features and techniques .
In many respects it is the types of games themselves that will push these requirements .
The richer the visuals and the more control over visuals that is gained over the coming years , we will see an undoubted increase on the focus of sound .
Establishing a Reference Listening Level for Games
Work is already underway in this area .
For some years now it has been impossible to know the recommended reference listening level to mix a game at .
It could be either 85 dB , the same as that of theatrical movie releases , or 79dB , the same as DVD remixes or TV , or just match the output of a competitive game .
The first is designed specifically for films to be heard in a theatrical context , the second is designed to reconfigure the mix to a home environment , specifically to allow dialogue , that while in a theatre and played loud can be clearly heard , is lost and less audible in the home environment .
Typically there is slightly less dynamic range in a home entertainment mix for this reason , and a great deal of dynamic range in a theatrical mix , but these two mixing systems depend solely on the playback levels of the content being either 85 or 79 .
Common sense would suggest that games should match the same output levels of DVD movies .
However , games tend to have much longer moments of loudness , or action , in them than movies , which typically have a story dynamic of dialogue , action , dialogue .
With racing games or action games in particular , the narrative dynamic is far more intense for longer , and so it is arguable that 79 dB could be established for game reference listening levels .
The higher the reference listening level , the more dynamic range and quieter certain sounds will be to achieve dramatic effect .
The lower the level , the louder the output levels will be .
Currently , games are incredibly loud and very mismatched in terms of output levels -- not only from console to console , but from game to game .
Even games released by the same studio have inconsistent output levels .
As mentioned before , there is even internal inconsistency within the same game of differing levels between cinematics and in - game levels to contend with .
Once a recommendation for a standard is published , it will be much easier to know where the output levels of the game need to be .
Enrichment of Software Tools , Both Third - Party and Proprietary
In - house tools and third - party solutions will solidify on a basic feature set that is solid , robust and reliable enough to ship many games .
It is onto this basic core feature set that additional systems and add - ons will be developed .
Audiokinetic 's
Wwise has a particular focus for interactive mixing technology and has already proven a solid basic mixing structure with its bus ducking and bus hierarchy .
The more enhanced and developed that third - party tools become , the more pressure there is on in - house tools to compete with these solutions and to have the same , if not more features .
This subsequent climate then puts pressure on in - house technology to be more agile and versatile , which in turn results in further innovation , eventually spreading out to the wider industry .
I asked Simon Ashby , product director of Wwise at Audiokinetic , to share some of his thoughts on both the limitations and future directions of mixing for video games :
" The barrier for high quality mix in games is mainly caused by the fact that we are still not really good with storytelling in our games .
We have trouble mapping and controlling the emotional response of the player in order to pace the story with the right intensity progression and a larger emotional palette .
We still ask the end user to execute repetitive actions and because of this , several games end up offering a monotonous experience .
As long as games are produced this way , the mix quality will remain inferior to that which films achieve , despite the quality of the tools .
Wwise offers both active and passive systems for the developer .
Passive mixing is achieved by effects such as the peak limiter or auto - ducking system .
The active system on the other hand is represented by the ' state mechanism ' , which operates like mixer snapshots with custom interpolation settings between them .
The event system also offers an active system with a series of actions such as discreet volume attenuation , LPF and effect bypass , and these can be applied to any object in the project .
Video game mixes have further complexities , as the game experience can last between four to 10 times longer than movies and they have far more unpredictable assets to mix .
The main complexity remains the interactivity , where the mixer has to take into account various different styles of gameplay ; the soundtrack emerging out of a single game played by a Rambo - kamikaze gamer is way different than the one from a stealth type of gamer even though it is the same game using the same ingredients .
In terms of new mixing features for Wwise , we usually do n't reveal our mid and long term plans since we cannot vouch for the future .
That said , you can be sure that we have a series of new features in our roadmap covering both passive and active systems that will help bring mixing technology for games to a previously unforeseen pro level . "
Dedicated Mix Time at the End of Production
In many cases , the mix of a game is a constant iterative process that goes on throughout the entirety of development , with perhaps some dedicated time at the end of the project to make final tweaks .
That amount of time is often very short , due to the proximity of the game 's beta production date to the gold master candidate date , but I expect that time to get bigger as the quality of mixing tech and the understanding of sound needing to iterate after design and art have finished tweaking is better understood .
Taking games off - site to be mixed , or to dedicated in - house facilities is also an area that will increase the amount of time needed to complete a mix .
Who should and who should n't attend the mix is also not currently fully understood .
One thing is for sure , though : it is often a minimum two - person job .
Lots of questions and doubts come up in a mix , is something too loud , is it loud enough , and to be able to bounce these questions off another set of ears is very important as a sanity check .
Established Terminology
Right now , particularly with proprietary tech , there are a huge variety of naming conventions that are very different from one mixing solution to the next .
The third - party market does not suffer so much from the differing terminology as there are only a couple of leading solutions on the market , both with similar terminology .
Over the coming years , there will certainly be a more established vernacular for interactive mixing .
Terms such as snapshots ( sound modes ) , side - chains ( auto ducking ) , ducking , buses , defaults , overrides , events and hierarchical descriptions like parents and children will become more established and solid -- referring to specific interactive mixing contexts .
Once this happens , a lot more creative energy can be spent in using and combining these features in creative ways , rather than worrying about what they are called and explaining them and their functionality to others .
Mapping to Hardware Control Surfaces & Specially Designed Control Surfaces
The world of post - production mixing is all about taking your project to a reference level studio and sitting down in front of a mixing board and tweaking levels using a physical control panel .
The days of changing the volumes of sounds or channels using a mouse pointer on a screen , or worse , a number in a text document , are almost behind us .
The ability to be able to hook up the audio tools to a hardware control surface , such as the Mackie Control Pro , via MIDI , have enabled physical tactile control of game audio levels and have opened up the world of video game mixing to professional mixers from the world of motion picture mixing .
There are several big players in the control surface market , all of which have their own communication protocols , such pro film devices like Digidesign 's Pro-Control line of mixing boards , not to mention Neve products , have a presence in the majority of the world 's finest studios .
Once access to these control surfaces is unlocked by video game mixing tools , a huge leap will be made into the pro audio world .
Right now , it is still quite an intense technical and scheduling challenge to mix a game at a Hollywood studio , hauling proprietary mixing tech and consoles ( such as Mackie controls ) along to the studio in question .
The ability to mix a game on a sound stage in the world 's best post - production environments , without having to compromise the control surface , will enable huge shifts in the quality and nuances of mixing artistry .
Again , the technology is only the facilitator to the artistic and creative elements that will become available .
Putting video game sound mixes into the hands of Hollywood sound personnel and facilities will allow a really interesting merging of audio talent from the worlds of video game and movie post production .
Of course there may also emerge a need for a very customizable " game - only " mixing surface , which accommodates many of the parameters and custom control objects that I have described .
Something along the lines of the JazzMutant multi- touch Dexter control surface , which can easily display 3D sound sources and allow quick and complex editing of EQ or fall - off curves , may actually end up leading the way in this kind of mixing and live tuning environment .
Specialized Game Mixers ( for - hire personnel )
Once the technology and terminology is in place and is well understood by game sound designers and mixers , it will only be a matter of time before real masterpieces of video game sound mixing begin to emerge .
It is only when the technical limitations have been effaced and effective and graceful mixing / tuning systems are in place that artistic elements can be more freely explored .
Ultimately , the mix of a game should be invisible to the consumer .
They should not recognizably hear things being " turned down " or changing volume , in much the same way as a convincing movie score or sound design does not distract you from the story .
The mix is ultimately bound by these same rules -- to not get in the way of storytelling .
Ironically for games , the hardest scenes to mix in movies are prolonged action scenes , and to some extent many video games boil down to one long protracted fire - fight .
The focus of attention changes constantly and mixing needs to help the player to navigate this quickly changing interactive world by focusing on the right thing at the right time , be that elements of dialogue , sound effects or music .
It is easy , then , to envisage a situation where a specialized game mixer is brought on to a project near to the end of development to run the post - production and to mix the game .
As a fresh and trusted pair of ears , this person will not only be able to finesse all the technical requirements of a mix such as reference output levels and internal consistency , but will also work with the game director and sound director on establishing point - of - view and sculpting the mix to service the game - play and storytelling .
Industry Recognition for Game Mixes
In order for video game mixes to be recognized and held up as examples of excellence , there need to be audio awards given out for ' best mix ' on a video game .
The Academy Awards , for instance , recognize only two sound categories , Sound Editing and Sound Mixing , which should encourage those awards ceremonies wanting parity with Hollywood .
Once awards panels begin to recognize the artistry and excellence in the field of mixing for games , there will be greater incentive for developers to invest time and energy in the mix .
Unforeseen Developments : Game Audio Culture
As with any speculative writing , there is always some completely left - field factor , either technological or artistic , that cannot ever be predicted .
I am certain that some piece of technology or some innovation in content will also come along , either in film sound , in game sound or from a completely different medium all together , that will influence the technological and artistic notions of what a great game mix will be .
Often it is a revolutionary movie , such as Apocalypse Now or Eraserhead , that redefines the scope and the depth to which sound can contribute to the story - telling medium , the repercussions of which are still being felt in today 's media .
These are areas that I like to define as game or film " sound culture " -- often enabled by technology , such as Dolby , but pushed in an extreme direction by storytellers .
These are the kinds of games that I expect to emerge over the next 10 years given the technological shifts that are occurring today , essentially : game audio culture defining experiences .

The Voter 's Paradox By Leon Felkins Written 10/14/95 Revised 8/19/00
Introduction " No snowflake in an avalanche ever feels responsible . "
-- STANISLAW LEC
It is said that society is in a moral crisis .
And , what is worse , it seems to be deteriorating at an ever increasing rate .
We all agree that something needs to be done .
Our politicians and preachers say we need to help each other more , we need to have " family values " , we need to contribute to society and we need to have high moral standards .
But there is a fundamental reason why none of this is going to happen .
That reason may be a paradox for which there is no answer .
This essay will serve as an introduction to this fascinating social problem which I will call the " Voter 's Paradox " . [ 1 ]
A few nights ago , my wife and I were driving along one of the lesser traveled highways .
We came upon a person with a broken down vehicle in obvious distress .
My wife said , " Maybe we should help " .
But I said , " I think not - it is not worth the risk " .
She responded , " But what if someday you were stranded and needed some help .
Would n't you want someone to stop ? "
Her reasoning is noble and her attitude is just exactly what our society needs .
But her logic is faulty .
It is faulty on at least two counts .
First off , my wife and I personally had much to lose and little to gain by helping this person .
There would likely be time and expense involved to us in getting the stranger 's car going again .
And , there was some risk in that we could have been harmed by the person .
The only practical reward for all this was a possible future gain of being helped in a similar situation .
And that brings us to the second fault ; how is the recipient of our compassion going to spread the word to the population that the two of us are compassionate people ( so that we might be rewarded someday when we need help ) ?
Of course , it would not happen .
Helping this person would have no effect on our chances of ever receiving similar help in this large anonymous society we now live in .
That example illustrates a phenomenon that is ubiquitous to our society .
When an individual has reason to contribute to what is basically a group activity in which the benefits of the group activity are shared by the group , certain puzzling phenomena are evident that can only be described as " diabolical " .
While there is no generally accepted terminology for these phenomena , various manifestations are often referred to as the " Voter 's Paradox " , the " Volunteer 's Paradox " , " Collective Action problems " , the " Tragedy of the Commons " , " Many - Person Prisoner 's Dilemma " , etc. , or , in general , the " Social Dilemmas " .
The well known , two - person , " Prisoner 's Dilemma " is just a special case of the " Social Dilemmas " .
In this essay , these social phenomena , which Garrett Hardin described ( see References at end of this essay ) as " problems that have no technical solution " ( a nice way of saying it is a paradox ) and other such problems belonging to the " social dilemmas " ( SD ) , will be represented by one term -- " The Voter 's Paradox " ( VP ) .
The " Voting Paradox " , seems to be an excellent representation of a wide variety of Social Dilemmas .
The definition for " paradox " used in this essay is " a person , situation , act , etc. that seems to have contradictory or inconsistent qualities " from Webster 's dictionary .
Basically , what we have are two apparently contradictory truths in the same phenomenon .
One reason that the Voting Paradox is a good candidate to represent Social Delimmas in general is that it seems to be a double paradox !
The first can be expressed as , " while it is true that a particular personal endeavor would return a benefit to all members of the group such that all individuals would receive rewards that , in totality , more than compensate for that individual 's contribution , it is also true that that particular individual would receive an even greater net return by not contributing anything ! " .
I will call this the " free - rider " aspect .
This aspect of the phenomena is consistent with a related dilemma , the " Prisoner 's Dilemma " which has received much study and is well reported in the scientific press ( see the associated article , " Prisoner 's Dilemma " ) .
The second paradox is that , " while it is true that the outcome of a group effort is made up of the sum of the individual efforts , in many cases a particular individual 's contribution makes no significant and / or measurable impact on the outcome " .
I will call this the " my vote does n't count " aspect .
I will go into more detail on the Voting Paradox , in particular , in the Examples section .
Is Rationality the Problem ?
" What is rational is real ;
And what is real is rational " .
-- Hegel
The basis for the social dilemmas is rationality .
So , what do we mean by " rationality " ?
First , it is considered to be rational for individuals to look after their own best interests .
It is hard to imagine that a free individual can do anything else .
Now , we know that a computer or robot performs actions without any such " self - interest " motivation .
A robot simply does what it is told to do .
I suppose a human could also be in a robotic state also , in which case there would be no need for self - interest motivation .
Hopefully , most of us cannot be described as robots although it sometimes seems that way when you see people mindlessly spending their money for useless products just because a TV salesperson suggests it .
Further , a case can be made that people who mindlessly accept directions from others , that is meme - driven people , of which the trend seems to be more of every day , are not much more than robots .
But for those of us who have not totally succumbed to the euphoric state of the meme - controlled mind , and who still have to make decisions continuously throughout the day , rational self interest has to be the criteria ( but maybe we humans are not always rational .
See my essay , " Humans are Rational , are n't they ? " ) .
Even a person who claims to be an altruist will admit that the reason she wants to help other people is that it makes the her feel good , and therefore , is performing a selfish act .
A person who gives her money to a robber has the choice of parting with the money or possibly her life .
Choosing life over money is a rational self - interested decision .
With regard to the social dilemmas , the choice is between looking after one 's own interest or looking after a large , often anonymous , group 's interests .
The problem is complicated by the disproportionate impact that the contribution might make between giving it to yourself or the group .
For example , maybe I could send in a $ 1,000 to President Clinton to help with the national debt .
That $ 1,000 means a lot to me but it will have an insignificant impact on our country 's welfare and it will not be noticeable by anyone .
So , the problem is not just that I am selfish , but that the individuals of the group get little from my contribution compared to what I would get giving it to myself .
[ 2 ]
The act of voting that I have chosen to be representative of the social dilemmas , seems to be an irrational act for the individual .
It has some cost and it would appear that one vote cannot impact the election results .
Some say that there is a rational justification for voting and that is the possibility of breaking a tie .
But the probability of breaking a tie in any election of any reasonable size is incredibly small .
An excellent analysis of this probability is in the book , Democracy and decision listed in the references at the end of this essay .
In any case , tie breaking is not the reason most people vote .
An Action can be both Good for the Individual but Bad for the Group Specifically , the claim here is that a situation can exist such that : ( 1 ) while everyone would be better off if everyone contributes ( cooperates ) , a particular individual is always better off not contributing ( defecting ) and ( 2 ) the individual 's contribution will not affect the outcome anyway .
That both of these conditions are satisfied for a voter in a national election is obvious on reflection .
We are all better off if most people vote , but my vote will make no impact and it does cost me to vote .
Hence the term , " Voter 's Paradox " for this type of social dilemma .
The reader should not be too quick to cynically dismiss this assertion as some academic pathological construct .
On the contrary , the situation described is extremely common -- as I will attempt to show in this essay by providing examples occurring in all walks of life .
Philosophers and social scientists claim that the VP is a special case of the well studied " Prisoner 's Dilemma " phenomenon .
" The Voter 's Paradox " , is similar to the " The Prisoner 's Dilemma " in the payoff matrix ( where the " other player " is everyone else ) but is much more complex and much more common in the real world .
The VP phenomenon includes both contributions by an individual to a group shared benefit as well as the withdrawal of some portion of a group shared asset .
The " contribution " example is best illustrated by the voting process itself .
The " withdrawal " example is well illustrated by the so - call " Tragedy of the Commons " in which excessive withdrawals of a shared asset are done by certain individuals .
This aspect is often called " freeloading " or " freeriding " .
Some Examples to help Clarify the Concept Here are a few examples of Social Dilemmas .
More are listed here .
Water Shortage in Los Angeles
Let 's say you live in Los Angeles and one day the city announces that , due to a water shortage , everyone should cut back on consumption .
In particular , the city says that you should only shower once a week .
Now you have been working in the garden and you really would like a shower !
What are your options ?
If you do n't take a shower , the water situation gets -- for all practical purposes -- no better but you are uncomfortable and stink like a clogged sewer .
If you do take a shower there is great benefit to you but the small amount of water that you consume is insignificant compared to the total in the reservoir and , in fact , no one will notice .
Put another way , your consumption when spread over the millions of residents in Los Angeles is of no consequence .
( But " what if everyone did the same ? " .
we are not talking about everyone , we are talking about one person -- namely you . )
Elections
There is some cost to you in voting . [ 3 ]
While it may be small for some , it is significant for others .
Some people go to a great deal of effort just to vote .
What return do they get for this effort ?
Zilch !
A single vote can only impact an election when there is a tie , which has essentially zero chance of happening in a state or national election .
( To be more precise , " The chance that your vote will count in a democratic election is much less than one over the number of elementary particles in the universe " according to Pierre Lemieux ' excellent and comprehensive article , " The Voting Gamble " . )
The typical response to this is " Well , what if everyone did that ? "
Of course , that would be a disaster .
But we are not talking about everyone , we are talking about the impact of ONE individual 's action .
Any activity , if " everyone does it " , is likely to have a major impact on society .
The next time you buy or sell a few shares of stock , consider " What if everyone does it ? " .
What if everyone flushed the commode at the same time you do ?
Etc. But like the Prisoner 's Dilemma , if you do " cooperate " by voting and everyone else does , society as a whole is greatly benefited .
On the other hand if everyone declines to vote -- which rationally they should -- we have a disaster .
Yet each individual has a greater reward by not voting !
That is the paradox .
The Voting Paradox has more sinister effects than just discouraging voting .
Realizing that their vote will have essentially no effect on the election outcome , many people do n't bother to get involved with politics at all !
A quote from the book , Pathologies of Rational Choice Theory , says it well ; " The hypothesis of ' rational ignorance ' holds that the citizens know little beyond what they can learn costlessly , because they have no incentive to expend resources to become knowledgeable about political affairs . [ 3 ]
In light of the small probability that any voter 's ballot will prove decisive in an election , the rational citizen reasons that the benefits of casting a well - informed vote will not offset the expenditure of time and money spent gathering information . "
This view of the true cost of voting was expanded further in the November 4 , 1996 , issue of the newspaper , Investor 's Business Daily , in an article called " Is Ignorance Rational ? " .
The publication of this essay is very noteworthy as it represents one of the few times that the popular press has taken note of this phenomenon .
It is particularly noteworthy that this is a conservative , no - nonsense , newspaper !
A summary quote from this essay is : " Each person knows his vote wo n't decide the election , so he does n't follow the issues " .
While many people will agree with me that their one vote will have no impact on the election results , they say , " But still , Leon , we should vote -- it is our duty . "
Good point .
But that philosophy has an interesting implication ; you should vote strictly for who you would like to be elected .
That is , you can meet your call to duty for voting for the lesser candidates , like Ron Paul , that while highly desirable by you , have little chance to be elected .
That is , now that you accept that your vote will not help or hurt anyone , you can meet your call to duty by voting for the person you like .
This issue is well examined and explained in an article by Art Carden , " Your Vote Wo n't Matter .
Do n't Waste It " .
Environmental Degradation
The environment is a " commons " shared by all of us .
Obviously there is incentive to freeride and to destroy .
The question is " how to minimize individual abuse of an environment shared by all " .
While most people think that the heavy hand of government must be brought in , some argue that that " ai n't necessarily so " .
A good essay presenting this argument appeared in the September , 1993 issue of Atlantic Monthly , " Can Selfishness Save the Environment ? " by Matt Ridley and Bobbi S. Low .
It may be that the government solution is a solution that creates problems worse than the orginal .
Miscellaneous Examples
We are confronted with this paradox daily in our lives in many ways .
To list a few :
The disastrous national debt , the Balkins situation ( " it was not in our personal interest to help them " ) , the rampant crime situation , the exploding welfare situation , the exploding medical costs , the insurance and legal mess , the deteriorating educational programs , the environmental crisis , etc. , etc .
All these -- and many other -- situations are characterized by the conflict between the " individual " interest and the " group " interest .
In some cases the " individual " may actually be a community , a state , an ethnic group or a nation .
For example , my congressman , to help assure he will be elected again , continues to sponsor spending programs for our area of the country .
Sure , the nation suffers ( like Los Angeles , above ) but we local folks are greatly benefited ( like the individual taking a bath in Los Angeles ) .
What if every congressman did that ?
They do .
That 's the problem !
Group Size and Anonymity
The VP results from the fact that for the individual there is greater reward for defecting than there is for cooperating .
So why do many ( most ? ) people cooperate ?
One reason is that cooperating can have many hidden rewards .
No doubt , most people get a " feel good " reward when they help others or carry out their civic duties .
Certainly , they are greatly rewarded if everyone knows about it .
If these inner rewards are large enough , then it can become rational to cooperate .
But therein is a major problem .
When mankind consisted of small family of hunter / gatherer groups every person 's actions were known by everyone else .
Even in modern times , people in small communities cooperate because their actions are displayed to everyone in the community .
On the other hand , most of us live in large cities in which no one knows or cares what we as individuals do , for the most part .
If I send in an extra thousand bucks with my income tax because I really want to help the poor and the military , no one will know .
My reward just does n't come close to my cost , the thousand bucks .
That is the situation most of us are in today and that is why defection continues to grow over cooperation .
The conclusion is obvious and many studies have shown ( see the Hubermann reference ) that people cooperate more if they are kept in small groups .
Large organizations do better if they organize into many small components .
People live fuller lives if they live in small towns .
A political conclusion can be drawn here : have we done the right thing in centralizing our government in Washington ?
Classifying Social Dilemmas
The following is a short introduction on the various aspects of social dilemmas with brief indications of significance .
[ Note , this section is in its initial development ! ]
Continuous vs. Step Inputs
The PD is characterized by a " step " input : cooperate or defect .
The VP , in elections where each person has only one vote , also has a step input : vote or not vote .
Other social dilemmas may have a continuous input however .
Consider voluntary contributions to a " Community Center " in which everyone can share as desired .
Your contribution can be any amount .
Most group efforts are such that a person can make variable contributions , including taxes .
( It is a bit peculiar that most of the literature on the social dilemmas tries to identify the phenomena with the PD when the PD is characterized by step input and social dilemmas are characterized typically with a continuous input .
So , we see such terms as " Many - person Prisoner 's Dilemmas " used to represent the general social dilemmas .
If the " Tragedy of the Commons " is reduced to only two players ( two farmers sharing a pasture ) it still does not become a Prisoner 's Dilemma game .
The important conclusion here is that all the research and simulations of the various forms of the PD are not likely to be applicable to the general social dilemmas ! )
Continuous vs. Step Outputs
An election is a step output .
We do n't get 45 % Bush and 55 % Clinton but we get either all Clinton or all Bush .
But some social dilemmas have variable outputs .
Consider the " Commons " .
If I add another cow to the pasture , all those who share the Commons will each get slightly less return .
Jointness of Supply
If an output from a group effort is in joint supply , one person 's consumption of it does not reduce the amount available to anyone else .
Public TV is a good example of a public good that -- once on the air -- can be consumed by a person without diminishing the service to anyone else .
On the other hand , public highways , sewers , utilities , are not in joint supply .
The more I use , the less is available to the rest of the group .
Impossibility of Exclusion
The environment , freedom , public television , public highways , etc. are generally impossible to exclude from a person who wants to use them whether that person contributed or not .
That is , people can easily freeride if they want to .
Size of Group
When the group of players is small , the analysis of the game is fairly straight forward .
If one person freerides , then the cost is divided over the other players .
A good example is the example given by Glance and Huberman in the Scientific American , March , 1994 ( See references ) article in which a group of people are having dinner and intend to split the bill evenly .
Some of the participants take advantage of this and load up with the most expensive dinners on the menu !
But what if the group is very large -- say all the citizens in your state or country -- is it still useful to consider the group as being individuals ?
I think not .
It seems to make more sense in this situation to regard the individual as interacting with the group .
For example , in the Voter 's Paradox , if I decline to vote , I am not defecting against any individuals but society as a whole .
If I were to represent the situation with a matrix , it would only show the payoffs for me and " the rest of the group " .
A further assumption would be that I am anonymous .
This fact creates additional problems above and beyond the small group freeriding situation .
And emphasizes the inappropriate use of the PD as a model !
A Basis for Morality ?
Like the players of the Prisoner 's Dilemma , we are confronted with a situation in which , rationally , an individual should defect ( freeride ) but we will all suffer if both players ( the individual and the " rest of society " ) take that action .
While there are other actions that will help to alleviate the problem , the most promising and most general solution is well known and has a long history : morality .
If somehow we can establish that cooperating is the moral thing to do and we can convince everyone ( or , at least , most everyone ) to be moral , then we have solved the problem .
People will vote , politicians will not steal , teenagers will avoid irresponsible sex , people will conserve resources or not pollute the environment , and so on .
Could it be that human society is so constructed that to survive , morality is necessary ?
An intriguing thought -- a nonreligious basis for morality !
And a powerful one : either we cooperate or we face a total destruction of civilization as we know it .
For more on this issue , see my essay , " A RATIONAL JUSTIFICATION FOR ETHICAL BEHAVIOR " .
Solutions : Some Successes , Many Failures Metering or Directly tying the return to the cost
The paradox goes away when a person is directly rewarded or punished by her actions .
The strategy would be to delete or minimize the " group " component in the cost / benefit equation .
That this is not always possible is recognized .
Many " Public Goods " could really be converted to " Personal Goods " .
For example , in the water usage problem or the garbage removal problem , a simple solution would be to monitor each person 's usage and charge them accordingly .
Toll roads are another example .
Small Groups
As discussed above , we have few problems with the free - rider aspect of the VP when everyone in the group is personally acquainted with each other .
Coercion and other Outside Inducements Garrett Hardin stated in his 1968 paper that the solution to the class of problems discussed here -- those having " no technical solution " -- is " mutual coercion , mutually agreed to " .
Practically , this means government control , a democratic government , most would say .
But that has its downside too -- a big downside !
Using the Government to do your dirty work Most activist groups use the government to enforce cooperation when it is obvious that voluntary cooperation will not do the job .
The Environmental movement would be dead if left up to the voluntary cooperation of the citizens .
In fact , it is difficult to find a purely voluntary program that is successful -- even if the citizens agree to its necessity !
Another example is " culture " .
Those that would provide " culture " to the masses know that the masses would not support this by any voluntary sacrifice .
So they use the force of law to give the masses what they " need " .
There is a dear price to pay in using the government to solve the Social Dilemmas .
The government primarily controls by means of laws .
The laws passed to force personal " cooperation " of the free - riders , hurt us all .
For example , the criminal justice system is a failure due to the lack of " cooperation " of the various responsible individuals ; the judges , the police , the prison administrators , etc .
As discussed elsewhere in this series of essays , each of these people find that looking after their own interests [ 4 ] is at odds with solving the crime problem .
Guess which wins !
To combat this " defection " the government ( from citizen pressure , by the way ) has passed Mandatory Sentencing laws and other such disastrous laws .
This not only results in cruel and excessive punishment for some who have done little or no harm to society but also has generally complicated the Criminal Justice system even more !
Jonathan Baron 's essay entitled " Political action vs. voluntarism in social dilemmas and aid for the needy " , published in Rationality and Society , 9 , 307-326 , provides an analysis of the comparative benefits of doing nothing , voluntary contribution , and attempting to induce the government to force people to do what is " good for them " .
Using Religion to induce cooperation Religions have been quite effective in inducing people into cooperating and acting in the group 's best interests .
However , religion 's technique of increasing the reward and / or punishment by promising an afterlife is not easy for many to accept .
The force of religion as a means of invoking cooperation seems to be declining as the population has become more educated and " world - wise " .
Using propaganda to encourage cooperation
The news media and the educational establishment have been quite effective in seducing members of society into " doing the right thing " .
The enormous guilt that many people feel if they do n't throw their aluminum can in the recyclable bin is a testimony of the power of propaganda .
The disadvantage is that propaganda can be misdirected .
Examples are too numerous to mention in this limited space !
