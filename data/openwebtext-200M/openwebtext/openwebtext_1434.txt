There is a tiny period of time between the registration of a visual stimulus by the unconscious mind and our conscious recognition of it ― between the time we see an apple and the time we recognize it as an apple .
Our minds lag behind our eyes , but by how long ?
And how does this affect our reactions to the world around us ?
Some estimates say the time delay lasts only 100 milliseconds , others say 500 milliseconds .
A new study by Tel Aviv University psychologists says that the answer is somewhere close to the latter , but can vary depending on the complexity of the stimulus .
Researcher Moti Salti and his supervisors Dominique Lamy and Prof. Yair Bar - Haim of TAU 's Department of Psychology reported their findings in the Journal of Cognitive Neuroscience .
" We are hunting for the brain activity associated with conscious perception , " says Salti .
" When you wander through this world , you see and hear things that may reveal themselves to your conscious mind ― and others that do n't .
We are interested in what cues the brain gives us to open that unconscious perception to the conscious mind -- what makes our conscious mind tick . "
A conscious connection
This basic science , Salti says , wo n't immediately provide marketers with the basis for a new and advanced kind of subliminal advertising .
But it may answer long - debated questions about the mysterious nexus between our conscious and unconscious minds .
In their study , the researchers measured neural activity related to conscious perception .
They connected test subjects to an electroencephalograph ( EEG ) that measured their brain activity , then exposed them to rapid visual stimuli ― square cubes on a computer screen that flashed on and off very quickly .
Participants were instructed to indicate whether they had seen the stimulus and to report its location on the screen .
Some participants were able to identify where the stimulus appeared , but could not identify it as a square cube , allowing the researchers to explore how brain activity correlated with conscious perception .
Finding what the eyes can't see
The study sought to map what the eyes do not " see , " but the brain or unconscious mind registers .
The EEG data showed that the conscious mind kicked in about a half second -- 300 to 400 milliseconds ― after exposure to the stimulus .
" The time it takes for the conscious mind to kick in depends on the complexity of the stimulus , " says Salti .
" The more complex the stimuli -- like eye color or words written on a passerby 's T - shirt ― the longer the conscious mind will delay .
Our new discovery is n't only about timing this effect , but also about using unconscious perception as a tool for studying consciousness . "
Until about 20 years ago , science neglected the field of consciousness , saying it was too subjective for precise scientific examination .
Now the very complexity of the problem encourages young psychologists to study the mystery of consciousness ; they argue that the conscious mind is a " splendor of creation " and helps us understand humanity itself .
Salti is about to begin a post - doctorate study position at INSERM in France , the European equivalent of America 's National Institutes of Health , under Prof. Stanislas Dehaene .

Where does consciousness come from ?
Artists frequently turn to technology for inspiration or commentary , utilizing components such as chips , ink cartridges and disk drives to make their art .
Remember the Mona Lisa created from motherboard bits or the motorcycle from old hard drives ?
Now , London artist Nick Gentry has turned forgotten floppy disk drives into art by using them as a canvas for mixed media paintings .
" The whole world was totally reliant on these physical media formats , " he says .
" Now suddenly we are at a time where they are obsolete , replaced by countless intangible data files .
Will humans be compatible with our own technology ? "
Inspired by Brazilian - born artist Vik Muniz 's giant world map made entirely of old computer parts , Gentry adopted floppy disks as his medium .
" I looked at using the disks in a grid to create photo - fits , constructing imaginary faces and identities that could draw connections to the personal information stored on the disks , " he says .
For instance , a metal circular hub on the reverse side of the disk worked as a metaphor for the human eye .
The number of disks varies in each painting .
A small one can use up to 6 disks , while larger paintings can take up 100 disks or more .
" I ask people to donate the disks through my website but mainly I buy them , " Gentry told Wired.com .
" They are still relatively cheap to buy as they are seen by most people as junk . "
To create a piece , Gentry starts with a preparatory sketch that is mapped into a grid , with each section the size of one disk .
Spray paint is applied to the disks using a stencil to preserve the label and metal slider .
The disks are then placed in tonally appropriate areas , almost like pixels , to create a collage , he says .
Gentry then uses oil paint to finish other details of the piece .
The paintings are priced from £ 300 to £ 700 ( approximately $ 470 to $ 1,100 ) .
Get a glimpse of a few more of his paintings below .

Which bank should I choose ?
Get personalized bank recommendations in 3 easy steps .
Get started
As a certified public accountant and former Internal Revenue Service agent , I know firsthand the thrills that come along with a tax audit .
And more importantly , I understand the eerie feeling when the IRS determines your business owes tax money .
The IRS audits only a small percentage of tax returns .
But if your business is one of the lucky few , understanding the appropriate steps to take will determine whether or not your outcome is favorable .
First , it is essential to understand how a tax return is selected for audit .
There are many reasons a tax return could be chosen for an audit , including the following .
DIF scoring .
Tax returns filed with the IRS are assigned a computerized score , known as a discriminant index function , or DIF , score .
The higher the score , the more likely it is for the return to be selected for examination .
Although the IRS does not reveal the mathematical formula , factors such as deductions that are greater than reported income can increase the DIF score .
Examination referrals .
Audits of a related party can also trigger a tax audit .
For example , while auditing the tax return of XYZ Corp. , an agent may discover payments were made to ABC Co .
As a result , the agent may check ABC ’s tax return to ensure these payments were reported .
If the income was not reported , the agent may request an audit of the ABC return .
Document matching .
In addition to DIF scoring and examination referrals , the IRS matches income reported by the payer on 1099 or W - 2 forms to the payee ’s individual tax return to ensure the income is reported .
Following are four small - business strategies for beating an IRS audit .
1. Dispute the ‘ hobby loss ’ theory
As an IRS agent , one issue that continued to surface during audits was whether business activity was considered a hobby for tax purposes .
According to the Internal Revenue Code Section 183 , deductions are limited when an activity is not engaged in for profit .
This is known as the “ hobby loss rule . ”
If business losses have been disallowed due to the hobby loss rule , it is essential to prove the following .
Business profitability strategy .
Did the business implement an advertising campaign ?
Is there a documented marketing plan ?
Provide the agent with information or plans that outline the business ’s plan to increase profitability in subsequent years .
Prior success .
Provide evidence that shows the business has had profitable years in the past .
If there are factors that may have contributed to recent losses , submit evidence that shows the loss is temporary due to economic downturns , a loss of a substantial client or other circumstances that may be considered temporary .
2. Claim missed deductions
Many business owners may not know it , but an audit is also a great time to submit documentation for expenses not previously claimed on the tax return .
If you discover you have overlooked certain deductions , you may be able to claim them .
Mark DeBose , director at DeBoseRobinson LLC , an accounting firm in New Orleans , says , “ Many taxpayers overlook common deductions , such as home office expense and business mileage .
In addition , on the personal tax return , taxpayers often overlook expenses such as charitable contributions and mileage related to charity and medical .
Because of these overlooked deductions , taxpayers often pay more than they are required ( to pay ) . ”
Take time to review your return under audit , or have an accounting professional review it for you .
A business can deduct expenses that are ordinary and necessary in carrying out the trade or activity .
This is a great time to submit documentation for overlooked deductions .
Such deductions may reduce the taxpayer ’s liability or possibly generate an overpayment of taxes , which can offset any deficiencies determined by the IRS .
Common missed business expenses include :
Home office business deduction .
If a taxpayer has a home office that is used exclusively and regularly for that purpose , the business may be able to deduct expenses related to the use of the home .
Business mileage .
Businesses should keep a mileage log of business - related travel for the taxable year .
The IRS allows for a standard deduction rate of 55 cents per mile traveled .
Or the business can choose to deduct actual car expenses , such as insurance , repairs , gasoline and oil .
Taxpayers should determine which method would provide a higher tax deduction .
Business gifts .
Generally , a business may be able to deduct up to $ 25 per gift given during the course of a business .
For more information regarding business deductions , review IRS Publication 535 , “ Business Expenses . ”
3 . Be creative in substantiating your deductions
Just because your business may not have certain documents to substantiate expenses on the tax return does not mean all is lost .
Keep in mind that the IRS allows for third - party documentation , oral testimony and other forms of verification substantiating expenses .
For example , if a business lacks documentation to support business mileage reported on the tax return , consider using Google maps , clients ’ records and past invoices to estimate mileage traveled during the taxable year in question .
Also , if you have reported certain expenses but no longer have receipts or documentation to document these items , take time to retrieve prior bank records or credit card statements .
It is also beneficial to make contact with vendors to request proof of payment
4 . Get professional help
If you feel overwhelmed by the mere mention of the IRS , it may not be a bad idea to get a tax attorney , accountant or enrolled agent to fight on your behalf .
That way , you can remove yourself , emotions and fears from the equation completely .
In addition , it also requires the IRS to make direct contact with the agent on your behalf .
Begin by submitting Form 2848 , “ Power of Attorney and Declaration of Representative , ” to the IRS .
But before signing your name on the dotted line , take time to research the tax professional to determine whether he has the qualifications and / or experience to tackle your audit case .
Question whether he ever has represented others before the IRS and how many cases have been successful .
Get a clear understanding of the fees charged for representation during an audit .
And more importantly , speak with other clients to obtain an understanding of their experience with your designated tax professional .
We would like to thank Kemberley Washington , CPA and assistant dean of student programs at Dillard University in New Orleans , for her contribution .
Simon Johnson has been honing his case against Wall Street oligarchs for months .
The MIT economist made a convincing argument this week that the financial sector has engulfed economies in the U.S. and Europe , and that this led to the financial crisis .
A second financial crisis is inevitable , according to Johnson , thanks to recent policies that have made the financial sector even bigger than before .
Coming to the game late on this one , but it 's a biggie : following the Florida ownership " love - in " last week , the Rochester Democrat and Chronicle 's Kevin Oklobzija - beat writer for the AHL Amerks - drowns the party with a heavy dose of local reality .
As in , the Americans stink and the parent Panthers - wandering their own special patch of purgatory - are nowhere to be found at a time when the Olympic break should demand at least a happy hour meeting between the two organizations .
This was not a simple hit job from frustrated media who can't help but become emotionally attached ( at an arm 's length ) to the club they cover ; when it 's clear the Florida coaching and scouting staffs are steering wide of the increasing ugliness at Blue Cross Arena , the reporter becomes the messenger .
Read the comments after the article ; Amerks ' fans are onboard .
No word out of Sunrise in response to Oklobzija 's claims , though how one responds to " I have been dumbfounded since November that the organization ’s goalie coach ( Rob Tallas ) spends the majority of his time with the NHL team , as if Tomas Vokoun needs someone to talk about angles every day , " probably requires some tact and perhaps a reasonable explanation , but it 's difficult to imagine what that might entail .
Not only are the Rochester players being ignored , but their coach as well , states Oklobzija .
... beyond seeing just what their kids and veterans are doing , would n’t the Panthers like to know why fans here have turned on the development coach , Benoit Groulx .
Why some in Tuesday ’s crowd were chanting " Groulx Must Go ! " as the game ended ?
Rochester has a firm grasp on their long hockey history and a deserved pride toward the Amerks which is second to none among clubs of the American Hockey League .
When they speak , someone had best be listening .
Is there a real , quantifiable strain between the organizations ?
Perhaps , though perhaps not ; as Florida fans are far too familiar , losing tends to magnify everything .
If trouble is indeed brewing , the clubs have until November to iron out the kinks ; the affiliation expires following next season .
Reporting from Kabul , Afghanistan --
Afghan officials said Monday that at least 27 civilians were killed in a NATO airstrike in a southern province that borders Helmand , where thousands of coalition troops are taking part in an offensive in and around the town of Marja .
Western military officials said the incident in Uruzgan province , which occurred Sunday , was under investigation .
It said U.S. Army Gen. Stanley A. McChrystal , the commander of all Western forces in Afghanistan , had already conveyed “ sorrow and regret ” to President Hamid Karzai , a highly vocal critic of civilian casualties .
Military officials said the airstrike was not connected to the assault on Marja , which is the largest coalition offensive since the start of the war in 2001 .
But it is certain to inflame sensitivities over the issue of civilian deaths and injuries in fighting between Western forces and the Taliban .
The incident apparently revolved around a trio of civilian minibuses being mistaken for an insurgent convoy as they traveled along a major highway .
A statement from NATO ’s International Security Assistance Force confirmed that “ airborne weapons ” were used against the vehicles , which at the time were believed to be carrying militants on their way to stage an attack .
But arriving ground forces found women and children at the scene , the military said .
It did not say whether any suspected fighters were present as well .
NATO did not give an estimate of the number of dead , but Afghanistan ’s Cabinet said at least 27 had died in the strike .
A spokesman for the Interior Ministry , Zemari Bashary , said more than a dozen other people were hurt , and NATO said the military had provided emergency treatment and transported them to medical facilities .
The Cabinet condemned the strike , calling it “ unjustifiable . ”
The incident threatened to overshadow what coalition forces had billed as an important milestone in Marja -- the first visit by the newly appointed civilian governor of the subdistrict .
His arrival represented the first Afghan government presence in at least two years in Marja , which had become the largest Taliban sanctuary in Helmand province .
Insurgents had operated freely in the town and its environs until thousands of coalition troops , spearheaded by U.S. Marines , launched their effort Feb. 13 to retake the town .
In advance of the Marja campaign , Western commanders promised to take all possible measures to safeguard civilian lives .
Marines had been fighting under stringent new rules of engagement laid down last summer by McChrystal .
Troops are not supposed to fire on insurgents unless they are wielding a weapon , or unless they are seen throwing one aside .
Even so , NATO says at least 16 civilians have been accidentally killed by Western troops in the course of the offensive .
After days of intense clashes , the town was quieter on Monday , according to Marine spokesman Capt .
Abraham Sipe .
“ I do n’t know if it ’s a trend , but it ’s good to see our Marines get a break after so much firefighting , ” he said .
Staff writer Tony Perry contributed to this report from Nawa , in Helmand province .

Considerable progresses made in controlling quantum gases open up a new avenue to study chemical processes .
Rudolf Grimm 's research team has now succeeded in directly observing chemical exchange processes in an ultracold sample of cesium atoms and Feshbach molecules .
They report on their findings in the journal Physical Review Letters .
Complex processes , which to a large extent cannot be observed directly , determine when chemical reactions build molecules or conversely release molecular bonds .
Some of these processes need energy ( endoergic processes ) and others release energy ( exoergic processes ) .
For the first time , great progresses made in the field of ultracold atomic and molecular gases have facilitated the realization of elementary chemical processes in a fully controlled way , where all particles can be prepared in a specifically defined quantum state .
In an international first , together with American researchers , Rudolf Grimm and his team of physicists have now succeeded in directly observing and also energetically controlling an exchange process in a quantum gas .
" Our experiment showed that it is possible to control exchange processes involving ultracold molecules , " Grimm says excitedly .
Directly observed processes
The scientists optically trap cesium atoms and cool them dramatically .
A Feshbach association results in an ultracold particle cloud consisting of about 4,000 molecules and 30,000 atoms , where a part of the atoms are arranged in dimers .
By applying a microwave pulse , the atoms are transferred into another quantum state without the molecules being modified .
After preparing this mixture of molecules ( A+A ) and atoms ( B ) , the experimental physicists apply a certain magnetic field , which allows them to fully control the binding energy of the molecules .
The collision of the molecules and atoms results in an exchange process when a certain threshold of binding energy is reached .
The original molecules decay to atoms ( A ) and new molecules are produced ( A+B ) .
" Since the energy produced in this exoergic process is very low , the reaction products remain in the trap , " explains Rudolf Grimm .
" Thus , we were able to directly observe the chemical process for the first time ever . "
Leading in the field of quantum gases
The research group led by Wittgenstein awardee Rudolf Grimm of the Institute for Experimental Physics of the University of Innsbruck and the Institute for Quantum Optics and Quantum Information ( IQOQI ) of the Austrian Academy of Sciences ( ÖAW ) assumes a leading role in the research on ultracold quantum gases .
For example , in 2002 the physicists produced the first Bose - Einstein condensate of cesium atoms .
This success was followed by the realization of a first Bose - Einstein condensate of molecules and a Fermi condensate .
The quantum physicists are now able to produce more complex molecules in ultracold quantum gases .
" A totally new field of research opens up , which promises possibilities to study diverse chemical reactions in a controlled way by using ultracold quantum gases , " explains Grimm .
The Ontario government is inching along toward privatizing public assets , but has not yet determined what to sell , says Finance Minister Dwight Duncan .
In a major speech Friday at a Canadian Club luncheon at the Fairmont Royal York Hotel , Duncan admitted he was “ doing what the spinmeisters call pre-conditioning ” on the eve of Monday ’s speech from the throne and the provincial budget later this month .
“ The upcoming throne speech and budget will not announce the sale of any asset we currently own , ” the treasurer told a business audience of about 400 people .
“ We will continue to examine whether our government businesses could be unleashed to provide new jobs and economic opportunity for Ontario families , ” he said .
That ’s an apparent reference to the Liquor Control Board of Ontario booze monopoly , the Ontario Lottery and Gaming Corp. gambling empire , Ontario Power Generation , and Hydro One .
“ There are new models for maximizing assets that protect and preserve the public interest , ” said Duncan , who is faced with a record $ 24.7 billion budget deficit .
“ It is possible to significantly increase revenue and maintain regulatory control , ” he noted .
“ The question we ’re grappling with is : are our assets being maximized to the advantage of all Ontarians ? ”
While Premier Dalton McGuinty ’s Liberals ran against privatization in the 2003 and 2007 elections , they have embraced private - public partnerships ( P3s ) to build dozens of new hospitals .
“ As we review and research our options , we ’ve established a number of principles : government regulation and protection of the services provided to Ontarians are critical , ” said Duncan .
“ Any changes to the structure of our assets must create jobs and growth , ” he said .
“ The bottom line is simple : our objective is the long - term interest of all Ontarians . ”

California state lawmakers are scheduled to hear testimony tomorrow in support of taxing and regulating the commercial production and distribution of marijuana for adults age 21 and older .
[ Paul Armentano 10/29 update : Archived video of the entire hearing is now available online here .
The hearing is three hours long and archived in three separate parts . ]
[ Paul Armentano updates : Just a quick update for folks .
There is extensive media coverage of today ’s hearing .
Go to Google News and type in “ Ammiano marijuana . ”
There are well over 100 news items , ranging from the New York Times to UPI to Bloomberg to AP , etc .
The hearings were also carried live on The California Channel , but the video has not yet been archived .
( Check back to the Cal Channel website tomorrow or Friday , but here ’s a five minute clip care of youtube . )
NORML ’s testimony from today is available here and here .
Following the hearing , many of us met with numerous key lawmakers ( and their staff ) on the Public Safety and Health Committees to discuss the issue further .
( I had four meetings myself . )
As for “ what ’s next ? ”
First off , this was an INFORMATIONAL HEARING only .
There will be NO Committee vote at this time .
There will likely be a second informational hearing scheduled before the Assembly Committee on Health .
After that , the Public Safety Committee is anticipated to hold a separate hearing specific to AB 390 , the Marijuana Control , Regulation , and Education Act in January 2010 .
IF we have the votes at that time to pass the bill out of Committee , the Chair ( who is the bill ’s sponsor ) will call it for a vote sometime this spring .
If we do n’t have the votes on the Committee , then the bill will languish in Committee .
It ’s that simple . ]
Members of the California Assembly Committee on Public Safety have called for the hearing , entitled “ Examining the Fiscal and Legal Implication of the Legalization and Regulation of Marijuana . ”
The hearing will be chaired by Assemblyman Tom Ammiano ( D - San Francisco ) , sponsor of Assembly Bill 390 , the Marijuana Control , Regulation , and Education Act .
It will take place at 10 am in room 126 of the State Capitol .
A press conference will take place prior to the hearing at 9 am in Capitol Room 317 .
California NORML Coordinator Dale Gieringer is scheduled to testify before the Committee at noon .
[ Editor ’s note : Read Dale ’s written testimony here . ]
NORML has also submitted prepared testimony to the Committee , which is available online here .
Several representatives from law enforcement , including the California Police Chiefs Association and the Office of the Attorney General ’s Bureau of Narcotics Enforcement , are scheduled to testify in opposition to the bill .
“ The criminal prohibition of marijuana provides law enforcement and state regulators with no legitimate market controls , ” states NORML Deputy Director Paul Armentano in prepared testimony .
“ This absence of state and local government controls jeopardizes rather than promotes public safety .
I urge this Committee to move forward with the enactment of sensible regulations for legalizing marijuana . ”
Tomorrow ’s hearing marks one of the first times since 1913 that the California legislature has debated ending criminal prohibition .
If you live in California you can contact your member of the Assembly in advance of tomorrow ’s historic hearing here .

Young people ‘ turned off ’ by Tea Party movement ’s racist undertones , McCain says
The daughter of former presidential candidate John McCain has sharply criticized the Tea Party movement , accusing it of “ innate racism . ”
In an appearance on ABC’s The View , Meghan McCain also took issue with a number of recent statements from Sarah Palin , criticizing the former Alaska governor for defending Rush Limbaugh ’s use of the word “ retard ” and for suggesting that President Obama launch a war against Iran in order to win a second term .

McCain described Former Republican congressman Tom Tancredo’s call for a literacy test for voters as “ innate racism . ”
In his opening speech to the Tea Party convention last week , Tancredo urged the creation literacy tests for voters , a move some observers likened to a return to the Jim Crowe laws of the pre-Civil Rights Act era .
“ People who would not even spell the word vote or say it in English put a committed socialist ideologue in the White House … named Barack Hussein Obama , ” Tancredo told the Tea Party crowd .
“ It ’s innate racism , and I think it ’s why young people are turned off by this movement , ” McCain retorted on The View .
“ I ’m sorry , but revolutions start with young people , not 65 year old people talking about literacy tests and people who ca n’t say the word ‘ vote ’ in English , ” McCain added .

McCain , a self - described “ progressive Republican , ” criticized Palin ’s assertion that President Obama could get himself re-elected to a second term if he launched a war against Iran .
“ You should never go to war unless its the absolute last circumstance , ” McCain said .
As for Palin ’s defense of Rush Limbaugh for using the word “ retard ” after calling for White House Chief of Staff Rahm Emanuel ’s resignation over the same word last week , McCain said it was a symbol of “ exactly what is wrong with politics today .

“ We ca n’t placate and say Democrats can say one thing and Republicans can say another thing , ” she said .
McCain added that the rhetoric coming from the Tea Party movement and from Republicans like Palin “ will continue to turn off young voters , and anybody who says different is smoking something . ”

The following video was broadcast on ABC’s The View , Feb. 8 , 2010 .
WASHINGTON - Even the White House 's top spokesman is getting in on the act of mocking former Republican vice presidential nominee Sarah Palin for looking to talking points written on her palm during a speech to " tea party " activists .
Robert Gibbs showed the words " hope " and " change " on his hand as he started his daily briefing with reporters on Tuesday .
Many in the room , where President Barack Obama had spoken just moments before about the need for bipartisanship , groaned at the political shot .
Palin spoke Saturday in Nashville and photographs and video show she had " energy , " " tax " and " lift American spirits " on her hand .
During one question , she looked down at the palm of her hand for a cue .
In her speech she mocked Obama 's use of teleprompters .
GQ : In the beginning of the book you talk about two sides of Islam , but you simplify your characterization rather quickly , saying its goal is " to conquer and enslave the earth , " and that Allah had " no problem with murder ; in fact , he insisted on it . "
We often hear President Obama , like George W. Bush before him , say that Islam is n't our enemy , that it 's a religion of peace — that it 's violent extremists we 're in conflict with .
Do you reject that ?
MY : Absolutely , I do .
That is blasphemy .
That is a lack of knowledge .
U.S. presidents say such things because of diplomacy , because Islam also exists in America , and they must respect people 's beliefs , respect the constitution .
What I 'm saying is the problem is there , in the Koran .
That even if there 's a good side of Islam , at the end of the day it serves evil .
GQ : But are n't there two sides to Christianity as well ?
The side that launched the crusades , and that many believe is still active , steering the last administration 's foreign policy .
Are n't we really talking about the human failing here , not tied to a particular faith ?
MY : No , no , no , no .
This is what I 'm trying to avoid .
I point to the book , to the god .
I am not pointing to the people .
I judge and compare books and gods .
In Christianity , it 's very clear that the god we worship is equal to love .
The bible says , ' God is love ' .
The god we worship was sacrificed , crucified on the cross , tortured , spit on , and was still forgiving .
This is our highest example .
The god of Islam tells his people , " Beat your wife .
Go kill infidels .
Go Kill Christians and Jews . "
This is in the Koran ; it has been for 1400 years .
Their god tells them to kill everybody who does n't believe in the god of the Koran .
The problem is ideological — it 's not a people problem .
Now , most Muslims do n't obey the order of god to kill infidels .
This is why I say Muslims have more morality than their god .
To be honest with you , I 'm amazed at how Muslims keep their humanity after reading the Koran .
GQ : When you first went to prison and were recruited by Shin Bet , you said you wanted to be a double agent , to deceive Israel and further jihad .
Yet you soon came to work on Israel 's behalf .
Can you talk about that transformation ?
MY : You know , this is a long process , it did n't come over night .
If you get yourself out of politics , religion , everything , and think as a human , think based on love to everybody , at that moment you have a choice : to be an animal , or to be a human .
I choose to be a human being , with conscience and responsibility .
GQ : Of your Shin Bet handler , you write , " every time we met , I learnt more about life , justice , and security . "
But in light of the news coming out of Dubai in recent weeks , it seems the Israelis are still using assassinations and any available means to prosecute this war .
If they 're wise and just , why have n't they learned what you have , that an ideological war needs an ideological solution ?
MY : Intelligence communities are very closed communities , but at the same time , you do n't only learn how to fight terrorism .
You need to learn about life , about West and East , geography , history , culture , there are many , many things that you learn in order to be able to solve puzzles .
And I had many questions .
So I had to use my mind to understand what was going on in that world , and I started to see things in a different way .

Doubts have been cast on the Israeli rebuttal of the Goldstone Report after it emerged last night that a bomb was defused last year at a Gaza flour mill that Israel had officially said did not come under air attack during last year 's war .
The presence of a large part of the fractured Mk 82 bomb was reported to a demining team at the end of January 2009 , and technicians were dispatched to defuse the 500lb device the following month .
The flour mill is the only one in Gaza , and the Goldstone Report , commissioned by the United Nations , said its destruction “ was carried out for the purpose of denying sustenance to the civilian population ” .
The discrepancy in accounts of what happened at the flour mill came to light on a day in which domestic and international debate over the Goldstone Report and Israel 's response was fuelled by a reprimand issued to two high - ranking officers .
Israel said a brigadier general and a colonel had “ exceeded their authority in a manner that jeopardised the lives of others ” by authorising the firing of artillery shells into the area of the main UN compound in Gaza .

A Sydney cabbie is in the doghouse after refusing to allow a guide dog and its high - profile owner - Disability Discrimination Commissioner Graeme Innes - into his vehicle .
James
Young could n't have picked a worse person to turn away than Mr Innes , who is a lawyer and human rights advocate .
He promptly reported the cabbie to the Department for Transport which launched a prosecution .
On Wednesday , Young was fined $ 750 and ordered to pay $ 2,500 in costs at a Sydney court .
It 's by no means the first time Mr Innes and his golden labrador Jordie have been refused a cab - an offence under federal and state law .
A recent Guide Dogs NSW / ACT survey showed one in three guide dog owners were turned away by cabbies in the past 12 months , with Sydney drivers the worst offenders .
A spokesman for the organisation suggests it may stem from cultural differences .
" Some of it is simply down to taxi drivers not understanding the law , " Guide Dogs spokesman Charles Ulm told AAP .
" Some of it is cultural too .
We do n't have evidence for that , but many taxi drivers come from countries where dogs are looked down upon . "
Mr Innes said he approached Young 's taxi in Market Street last April and was told he was n't welcome .
" I would n't say he was rude , but he was quite firm the dog or I was n't getting in , " Mr Innes told AAP .
Guide Dogs community education coordinator Dannie Hogan says plenty of drivers are very helpful to blind or visually impaired customers .
" We work closely with the NSW Taxi Council and we know there are many taxi drivers that willingly assist passengers with impaired vision , " she said .
" But there are still too many reports of drivers who refuse passengers travelling with their guide dogs .
" We found that refusals are more likely to occur in Sydney .
Taxi drivers in regional areas tend to build up a rapport with their regular passengers . "
Guide Dogs has worked with the NSW Taxi Council for six years , educating drivers about guide dogs .
It plans to launch an advertising campaign in May to create further awareness of the issue .
Ironically , the ads will be placed on the back of taxis .
" This is a timely reminder to any public transport provider of their responsibilities and requirements , " NSW Taxi Council CEO Peter Ramshaw said in a statement to AAP .
" The majority of taxi drivers do the right thing and it is in the industry 's interests that those who breach the regulations are forced to change their behaviour . "
HUNTSVILLE , AL -- Adding to an impressive string of positive press , Huntsville has been named America 's best city for job growth prospects .
Moody 's Economy.com , which previously ranked the Rocket City No. 2 for employment potential , elevated Huntsville to the top spot in its latest review of 378 metropolitan areas .
Auburn - Opelika is ranked second nationally by Moody's , with Phenix City - Columbus , Ga. ( seventh ) , Mobile ( 12th ) and Montgomery ( 22nd ) also faring well .
The new rankings appear in the latest issue of The Economist , a respected British financial publication .
" It 's extremely significant , " Joe Vallely , Huntsville 's economic development director , said Tuesday .
" Anytime you get a No. 1 ranking nationwide by a respected firm like that , it 's big .
They do n't just give those puppies out . "
An Economist story titled " Alabama 's small cities are poised for recovery , " mentions Cummings Research Park , HudsonAlpha Institute for Biotechnology , AEgis Technologies , which created the three - dimensional models of Vancouver that NBC used in last month 's Olympic broadcasts , and CFD Research , a defense firm researching insect - mounted cameras and glucose - based batteries .
" Eat your heart out , Birmingham , " the article concludes .
Huntsville 's previous Moody's Economy.com accolades were partly based on the continuing relocation of 4,700 military jobs from suburban Washington .
Assistant economist Martin Soler Garcia , who studies the city for Moody's , could not be reached Tuesday to talk about the latest review .
Vallely said job - growth rankings , which are widely reported in the financial media , can " spur renewed interest " from companies that have flirted with moving to the Rocket City and help validate the decision of those that are already here .

Gordon Brown has finally confirmed the rumours of a disastrously bad - tempered relationship with Tony Blair .
Speaking during a gruelling and personal interview with Piers Morgan to be broadcast over the weekend , the prime minister also suggested he should have been the one to lead the Labour party when John Smith died .
" I believed I could do the job , I believed that I 'd got the experience and built up the experience to do it , " he said .
Brown vs Morgan :
The transcript
" I do n't deny that , that there were fights about different issues but it 's always the case .
" In fact it 's better to be open and honest and say there were disagreements about certain things but at the same time we managed , I think in the national interest , to get things sorted out . "
But he conceded their relationship has been " incredibly difficult " .
Analysis :
The art of crying
Speaking about the famous meeting in the Granita restaurant , where the two men allegedly formulated a handover plan , Mr Brown said : " I 'd already agreed with Tony before that dinner that he would stand for the leadership and I would stay on as the shadow chancellor , as the person in charge of economic policy .
" And there 's an understanding that at some point Tony would stand down and he would support me if , when , that was the case .
And that 's where we left it . "
The most moving part of the interview - heavily trailed before broadcast - relates to Mr Brown 's thoughts on the death of his daughter .
" Nobody actually really told us for a week , it just gradually dawned on us that , that something was going wrong and she was n't getting bigger , she was n't growing and , no matter what treatment that was being given to her , she was n't able to respond to it , " he said .
" And I could hold her hand and I could feel that she knew I was there and there was nothing that you could see that was actually wrong , but she just was n't growing .
" And then probably after a week Sarah and I ... she was in the special care .
I turned to the doctor and I said : ' She 's not going to live , is she ? '
" And he said : ' No , I do n't think so .
She 's not going to live ' . "
Mr Brown then went on to praise his wife , saying : " Sarah and I , we 're a modern love story .
We have been very fortunate .
She is beautiful , she 's elegant , she 's compassionate , she 's dignified , I 'm very , very proud of her . "
The interview will have been tough going for the prime minister , who has previously attempted to keep his private life private .
Barring introductions from his wife at the Labour conference the last two years , Mr Brown has been notable for keeping his family out of the public eye , unlike Tory leader David Cameron whose comfort with letting the cameras into his home has been one of the defining characteristics of his leadership .
He will have struggled with some of Mr Morgan 's more puerile questions , including one asking the prime minister if he had joined " the mile high club " .
Nick Clegg is still trying to get over his Nick " Cleggover " nickname after confessing in an interview with mr Morgan that he had slept with around 30 women .
ITV1's Piers Morgan 's Life Stories interview with Mr Brown will be shown on Valentine 's Day .

Information graphics , or infographics , are visual representations of information , data or knowledge .
The graphics are used where complex information needs to be explained quickly and clearly , such as on signs and maps and in journalism , technical writing and education .
Today , infographics surround us in the media , in published works both mainstream and scientific and in road signs and manuals .
They illustrate information that would be unwieldy in text form and act as a visual shorthand for everyday concepts , such as “ Stop ” and “ Go . ”
Creating an effective infographic requires both artistic sense and a clear vision of what to tell the audience .
The following are some cool infographics we have collected .
Some are colorful , some are simple , but all are informative and visually pleasing .
Not only do they provide information in a format that is easy to understand , but they are also artistic creations in their own right .

( PhysOrg.com ) --
Exerting delicate control over a pair of atoms within a mere seven - millionths - of - a- second window of opportunity , physicists at the University of Wisconsin - Madison created an atomic circuit that may help quantum computing become a reality .
Quantum computing represents a new paradigm in information processing that may complement classical computers .
Much of the dizzying rate of increase in traditional computing power has come as transistors shrink and pack more tightly onto chips — a trend that cannot continue indefinitely .
" At some point in time you get to the limit where a single transistor that makes up an electronic circuit is one atom , and then you can no longer predict how the transistor will work with classical methods , " explains UW - Madison physics professor Mark Saffman .
" You have to use the physics that describes atoms — quantum mechanics . "
At that point , he says , " you open up completely new possibilities for processing information .
There are certain calculational problems ... that can be solved exponentially faster on a quantum computer than on any foreseeable classical computer . "
With fellow physics professor Thad Walker , Saffman successfully used neutral atoms to create what is known as a controlled - NOT ( CNOT ) gate , a basic type of circuit that will be an essential element of any quantum computer .
As described in the Jan. 8 issue of the journal Physical Review Letters , the work is the first demonstration of a quantum gate between two uncharged atoms .
The use of neutral atoms rather than charged ions or other materials distinguishes the achievement from previous work .
" The current gold standard in experimental quantum computing has been set by trapped ions ...
People can run small programs now with up to eight ions in traps , " says Saffman .
However , to be useful for computing applications , systems must contain enough quantum bits , or qubits , to be capable of running long programs and handling more complex calculations .
An ion -based system presents challenges for scaling up because ions are highly interactive with each other and their environment , making them difficult to control .
" Neutral atoms have the advantage that in their ground state they do n't talk to each other , so you can put more of them in a small region without having them interact with each other and cause problems , " Saffman says .
" This is a step forward toward creating larger systems . "
The team used a combination of lasers , extreme cold ( a fraction of a degree above absolute zero ) , and a powerful vacuum to immobilize two rubidium atoms within " optical traps . "
They used another laser to excite the atoms to a high - energy state to create the CNOT quantum gate between the two atoms , also achieving a property called entanglement in which the states of the two atoms are linked such that measuring one provides information about the other .
Writing in the same journal issue , another team also entangled neutral atoms but without the CNOT gate .
Creating the gate is advantageous because it allows more control over the states of the atoms , Saffman says , as well as demonstrating a fundamental aspect of an eventual quantum computer .
The Wisconsin group is now working toward arrays of up to 50 atoms to test the feasibility of scaling up their methods .
They are also looking for ways to link qubits stored in atoms with qubits stored in light with an eye toward future communication applications , such as " quantum internets . "

Well , I may say there were no surprises , but in fact the Greek economy contracted more than many observers expected in the fourth quarter , while downward revisions to the rest of 2009 converted the present recession into the country ’s worst since 1987 .
Evidently the latest numbers offer the first warning that all may not be as simple as it looks on paper for the Greek government ’s plan to set their finances straight .
As far as I am concerned the latest numbers simply confirm what should already have been abundantly evident – correcting the fiscal deficit without straightening out the rest of the economic distortions is going to make economic growth something which is very hard to come by .
Accelerating Contraction
According to the Greek National Statistics Office gross domestic product contracted by 0.8 percent in the fourth quarter , significantly more than the 0.5 percent drop forecast in a Reuters survey of economists .
The data clearly reveal that Greece ’s downturn actually picked up speed from a revised 0.5 percent in the third quarter , casting doubt over government estimates of a return to growth in the second part of this year , and raising yet more issues about the evolution of the debt to GDP ratio .
On a year - on - year basis , the economy shrank 2.6 percent in the fourth quarter following a revised fall of 2.5 percent in the third .
The sweeping data revision showed Greek GDP contracted by 2 percent in 2009 as a whole , considerably more than the government ’s earlier 1.2 percent estimate , making for the worst annual performance in nearly 30 years .
The latest batch of data changes only serve to further undermine the government ’s already badly dented statistical credibility , even if the Greeks are far from being alone in carrying out this type of revision .
But it is the scale of the revisions which is so striking in the Greek case – GDP shrank , for example , by a quarter - on - quarter 1 percent in the first quarter of last year : twice the earlier estimate , and the sharpest quarterly contraction since 2005 .
In the second quarter , GDP fell 0.3 percent , compared with an earlier estimate of a 0.1 percent , while third - quarter GDP shrank 0.5 percent revised from the earlier estimate of 0.4 percent .
Rather than leaving the impression that government GDP figures are “ doctored ” what the revisions suggest is that the government actually has little real idea of what is going on in the economy at any given moment in time , a conclusion I personally find even more disturbing .
The revisions will also push up the figure for Greeceâ€™s budget deficit last year , possibly by 0.1 percent , leaving the current “ final , final figure ” standing at something like 12.8 percent while the debt to GDP ratio may increase 1.2 percentage points to 114.6 percent .
But then the Greek Finance Ministry have just amended the 2009 fiscal cash execution data they provide on their website , and have added close to 6 billion Euro to the December expenditure number , making for a final total of 11.8 billion Euro for the month .
This number takes the full - year deficit to 37.9 billionn – up from the 29.4 billion Euro previously reported , with the implication that there will be a further substantial increase in the 2009 central government budget deficit .
To date no explanation has been offered for the revision , although a good guess would be it is associated with the payment hospital supply arrears , in which case the general government deficit may well have been proportionately reduced .
As I pointed out in this post , even after all the glare of public scrutiny considerable uncertainty still surrounds the 2009 deficit number , and the latest revision is just one more stunning example of the kind of payments changes which one can find made without further explanation .
As I say , the biggest doubt here is n’t the sincerity of the numbers , but the ability of the government itself to control what actually happens .
Little Relief In Sight
While the current pace of GDP contraction may slow somewhat there is little actual hope for a real and sustainable return to growth in the Greek economy in the forseeable future , and especially as the impact of the fiscal correction starts to bite .
Unsurprisingly Greek industrial output continued its fall in December , and was down 2 % from November .
And the January PMI suggested that the contraction in industrial output continues and may even be accelerating .
Commenting on the Greece Manufacturing PMI survey data , Gemma Wallace , economist at Markit said : â€ œThe onset of the new year brought little hope of a near - term recovery in Greek manufacturing .
Accelerating contractions in new orders , output and employment caused the headline PMI to sink to an eight - month low .
Meanwhile , firms were struggling to cover rising costs , as strong competition and unfavourable demand conditions rendered them unable to raise charges .
Domestic demand also shows few signs of life , and retail sales are falling steadily .
As are new car sales .
While Greece has not had the kind of private credit boom that countries like Spain and Ireland have seen ( in terms of the levels of indebtedness ) credit was increasing at an annual rate of over 20 % before the crisis hit , and this boom in borrowing has now clearly run out of steam .
But in fact there was no bubble in house prices in Greece .
And private construction activity ( housebuilding ) has been falling since 2003 .
Nonethless a very substantial current account deficit was created , as the competitiveness of domestic manufacturing industry wilted .
This deficit has been reducing , but both goods and services exports have been falling , so there would seem to be little likelihood at this point of a tourism - driven economic expansion .
Europe ’s Tough Love May Be More Substantial Than It Seems At First Sight
Rumours still abound regarding the possibility of an eventual EU bailout package .
The central scenario still remains the same , namely that money will be made available eventually , as and when needed ( probably by end of March ) , even if the precise mechanism to be used is not yet clear .
Speculation continues that the IMF may well play some sort of role , although , again , at this point in time it is far from clear what precise form their participation might take .
US economist Jeffery Frankey this week added his name to the long list of those who have now come out in favour of a role for the fund ( I have long had my name on the venerable list ) , and makes at least one novel argument : that core Europe , far from expressing their reservations about a hypothetical IMF role , should in fact be only too happy to welcome one .
Europeans worry that if Greece were put into default , troubles in Portugal and Spain would appear as quickly as heads on a hydra .
Perhaps it is glib for an American , on the other side of the Atlantic , to discount the financial strains that Greece is placing on Europe â€ ” including Mediterranean contagion , loss of prestige of European institutions , and depreciation of the euro .
But in fact it is the northern Europeans who should be most eager for the IMF to come in .
They should be the most worried about what they are going to say to Portugal , Spain , Italy and Ireland , if instead they have just bailed out Greece .
Meanwhile the IMF itself continues to wait courteously on the sidelines , limiting itself to stating , as IMF First Deputy Managing Director John Lipsky put it this weekend , that the Fund “ is willing to support Greece as thought appropriate by the Greek authorities ” .
And judging by the latest statements by Greek Prime Minister George Papandreou , thinking is something the Greek administration will be doing a lot of in the coming days , especially after the recent demonstration of “ tough love ” ( lots of words but little tangible support ) from their European counterparts .
Papandreou reportedly criticised the European Union ’s response to the country ’s financial crisis as “ timid and too slow ” in a televised cabinet meeting in Athens on Friday .
He also asserted that the EU lacked coordination , and had effectively undermined Greece ’s credibility .
Speaking on his return from Brussels , Mr Papandreou said that while Greece had received a statement of support , delays and conflicting statements over the past few months had actually served to make matters worse .
“ But in the battle against the impressions and the psychology of the market , it [ the EU response ] was at the very least timid , ” the BBC report him as saying .
Basically Papandreou ’s comments are completely out of place , even if they are intended for domestic consumption .
It was always unrealistic for Europe ’s political leaders to agree to more than general guidelines for how a rescue plan might take place at last week ’s meeting .
A firm commitment was virtually impossible , partly because some of the possible solutions – bilateral lending , for example – would very likely have to be approved by the relevant national parliaments , if support was to go anywhere beyond small token sums .
An important list of outstanding issues still need to be decided , including ( 1 ) the size of any eventual loan or guarantee ; ( 2 ) the extent of burden sharing between the other Eurogroup countries ( Germany and France are expected to be the heavyweights but others will surely participate as well ) ; ( 3 ) the terms of the loan ( whether it is only to be short term – 6 months has been mentioned ) ; and ( 4 ) the precise terms of conditionality ( conditions are expected to be tough , and include specific commitments on what to do if programme execution falls short of estimated objectives . )
Given the complexity of all this , and the amount of fine tuning still to be carried out , it is hardly suprising that nothing substantial was announced , and especially given the fact that the Eurogroup are entering into what effectively consitutes new institutional terrain , while France and Germany , for example , may be very reticent to get too far involved with their Southern neighbours at the cost of loosening ties with – say – the UK and Sweden , which is why Frankel may have a very solid point .
The Planned Correction Simply Is Just Not Doable As Things Stand
Nothing is going to change the fact that if Greece really does tighten fiscal policy by 3 or 4 percentage points of GDP over the next four years , growth is going to be almost non-existent .
This is going to be a long hard slog and providing a temporary bridging loan to guarantee Greeceâ€™s solvency this year will not avoid the fact that the same will be needed next year , the year after and the year after that .
Societe Generale , The Economic News
As is by now very well known Greece has one of the highest government debt levels as percentage of GDP among the OECD countries .
The governmentâ€™s gross debt burden is expected to rise sharply to 135 % in 2012 , based on the latest EU Commission projections – up from 99 % in 2008 .
This rise is driven by ongoing fiscal deficits , which hit a minimum of 12.7 % in 2009 , as a result of the unexpectedly large size of Greece ’s economic downturn .
The deficit is expected to continue to be large in 2011 – as a result of the continuing shortfall in tax revenues .
On the governmentâ€™s own estimates the budget deficit is expected to remain significantly above the EU budget deficit ceiling of 3 % until 2012 .
Thus the Greek government will have substantial borrowing requirements through 2012 , with something like â‚ ¬45.2 billion gross issuance being needed in 2010 ( in addition to the recently issued â‚¬8 billionn of 5 - year GGBâ€™s ) and a further â‚ ¬45 billion or so in 2011 .
Greeceâ€™s Stability and Growth Programme ( SGP ) , which was submitted to the EC on January 14 , 2010 , is ambitious both in terms of magnitude and given Greeceâ€™s track record in fiscal consolidation .
The plan aims for a reduction in the fiscal deficit of 10.7 percentage points of GDP over four years , from 12.7 % of GDP in 2009 , to 2 % of GDP in 2013 .
This magnitude of fiscal consolidation is unprecedented in Europe and raises questions regarding the credibility of the plan – in light of Greeceâ€™s poor track record in fiscal consolidation that failed in the past due to lack of political commitment .
The plan also assumes a GDP growth rate well in excess of EC and IMF forecasts .
According to Dan Lustig ( lead analyst in Mitsubishi UFJ ’s Greece team ) who prepared the above chart the planâ€™s implementation will be “ very challenging , given Greeceâ€™s large public sector , weak economic growth prospects and the potential for social upheaval , due to the necessity for significant public sector expenditure cuts ” .
A Hard Package To Implement
The main guidelines of the new tax bill and the key themes regarding the Governmentâ€™s income policy to be introduced into the Parliament for voting in the upcoming days were recently released by the Finance Ministry .
These include :
Tax Measures
The upper tax rate of 40 % will be applied on annual incomes above â‚ ¬60,000 .
This will replace the existing â‚ ¬75,000 threshold .
The new tax scale implies tax cuts to annual incomes below â‚ ¬40,000 and increases for incomes above this sum .
The government have created 6 new
tax brackets for incomes between â‚ ¬12,000 and â‚ ¬60,000 , and tax levels will range from 18 % to
38 % .
The progressive character of the tax scale is basically aimed at transferring tax burdens to higher income groups , while alleviating tax burdens from low income categories .
Incomes ranging from â‚ ¬12,000 to â‚ ¬16,000 are to be taxed at 18 % as compared with the current 24 % tax rate on incomes ranging from â‚ ¬12,000 to â‚ ¬30,000 .
Since around 95 % of individual tax records show incomes below â‚ ¬30,000 this implies that low income groups should be less affected by the changes in the tax scale , although it is important to bear in mind that there is probably widespread underreporting of income .
Interestingly the â‚ ¬12,000 tax - free income bracket includes a provision that tax payers need to submit receipts for goods and services in order to qualify .
This measure has the objective of helping the tax service crosscheck data and encourages individuals to demand VAT denominated invoices for purchases .
There will be :
– an increase in the fuel tax rate which aims to boost revenues by â‚¬934 million in 2010 .
– an annual tax rate increase on real estate held by offshore firms ( rising to 10 % vs. the current 3 % ) .
– A Tremonti type tax amnesty whereby undeclared bank accounts deposits outside Greece can be repatriated at a 5 % tax rate for 6 months after the bill is put into effect so long as the money is transferred into 1 - year term deposits .
– the introduction of a new progressive tax scale on large real estate holdings valued
above â‚¬400,000
– VAT will be applied to a wider category of transactions , and electronic cash registers will be obligatory in an increased number of designated activities ( including gas stations , kiosk , taxis , and street markets ) .
Such measures are expected to significantly boost VAT revenues , since many professional activities ( like lawyers and doctors ) were previously largely exempted from the 19 % VAT system .
Regarding the income policy ( which will be retroactive and applied to 2010 incomes for employees in the public sector in the widest sense of this term ) :
– civil servantsâ€™ wages will be frozen in 2010 , although seniority pay increases will be applied as usual .
– there will be a 10 % cut in civil servantsâ€™ allowances .
Contrary to earlier announcements , the cut in allowances in public sector will not be proportional to the employeeâ€™s income ( i.e. greater cut for high income groups and lower cut for lower income employees ) .
According to press reports , the decision to apply a uniform 10 % cut in allowances across the board was due to the legal impediments to doing it any other way .
Nevertheless , the allowance cut , as well as the wage freeze measure , are the key instruments for the government effectively lowering the wage bill of the budget in 2010 , in its effort to control government spending .
– As a consequence , the gross monthly income of public sector employees will decline by as much as 5.5 % .
– The upper limit for overtime payment is reduced by 30 % .
– State sector pensioners will get an increase of 1.5 % , in line with governmentâ€™s inflation forecast for 2010 of 1.4 % .
Pensioners earning more than EUR 2,000 on a monthly basis will get no increase .
– There will be a hiring freeze for the public sector for 2010 ( partially excluding the health , education and security sectors ) , and an application of the rule of 1 replacement for every 5 people who leave from 2011 onwards .
Furthermore , a widespread re-allocation of civil servants will be instigated , along with the consolidation of much public enterprise , in order to increase the effectiveness of public administration .
Most of the measures announced were included in the Stability & Growth Programme and are consistent with the governmentâ€™s earlier announcements .
The Labour Ministry has also announced that it is planning to raise the retirement age as part of changes aimed at amend and support the state - run pension system .
The Minister highlighted that unless a reform is implemented the pension system will face serious funding problems by 2015 .
The proposals which will be sent to the committee of experts and social partners charged with drafting the pension reform bill include the following :
– Increase by 2 years of the effective average retirement age to 63 years of age by 2015 .
– Abolishing all incentives to early retirement .
– Encouraging workers to stay on the job longer ,
– Separating the health - care and pension systems , with the former being incorporated
into the National Health System .
– Harmonisation of the male and female retirement age in the public sector , in line with
EU directives .
– The establishment of an independent entity overseen by the Central bank to manage social -
security fund reserves .
Raising the bar for nullification
February 6 , 2010
" The several states composing the United States of America are not united on the principle of unlimited submission to their general government "
" where powers are assumed [ by the federal government ] which have not been delegated , a nullification of the act is the rightful remedy : that every State has a natural right in cases not within the compact , to nullify of their own authority all assumptions of power by others within their limits : that without this right , they would be under the dominion , absolute and unlimited , of whosoever might exercise this right of judgment for them "
That this Assembly doth explicitly and peremptorily declare , that it views the powers of the federal government , as resulting from the compact , to which the states are parties ; as limited by the plain sense and intention of the instrument constituting the compact ; as no further valid that they are authorized by the grants enumerated in that compact ; and that in case of a deliberate , palpable , and dangerous exercise of other powers , not granted by the said compact , the states who are parties thereto , have the right , and are in duty bound , to interpose for arresting the progress of the evil , and for maintaining within their respective limits , the authorities , rights and liberties appertaining to them .
Federal agents have flouted the United States Constitution and foresworn their oath to support this Constitution by requiring registration of the purchasers of firearms and ammunition , and these requirements violate the limits of authority placed upon the federal agents by the United States Constitution and are dangerous to the liberties of the people
( B) Notwithstanding any other provision of law , no public official of any jurisdiction may require registration of purchasers of firearms or ammunition within the boundaries of this State .
(C) Any person violating the provisions of this subsection ( B ) is guilty of a felony and upon conviction must be punished by a fine not exceeding five thousand dollars , or a term of imprisonment not exceeding five years , or both .

Around the country , twenty two states are currently considering a bill known as the " Firearms Freedom Act . "
This bill declares that guns , accessories , and ammunition made within a state , sold within that state and kept in that state are not subject to federal laws or regulations under the " Interstate Commerce Clause " of the Constitution .
Montana and Tennessee passed a Firearms Freedom
Act into law in 2009 , and a number of states are moving that direction in the 2010 legislative session .
In South Carolina , where a Firearms Freedom
Act was also introduced in 2009 , some representatives have taken things a step further .
Introduced in the South Carolina General Assembly this week is House Bill 4509 ( H4509 ) , which if passed , would make law that " no public official of any jurisdiction may require registration of purchasers of firearms or ammunition within the boundaries of this State .
" No caveat for regulations under the commerce clause .
No caveat for types of firearms either .
This bill says NO to all gun registrations  period .
The principle behind such legislation is nullification , which has a long history in the American tradition .
In the Kentucky Resolutions of 1798 , Thomas Jefferson wrote in response to the hated Alien and Sedition Acts : and In short , nullification means this :
The state is taking a position that a particular federal law is unconstitutional , and thus , the law in question is void and inoperative , or ' non-effective , ' within the boundaries of that state ; or , in other words , not a law as far as that state is concerned .
But nullification is much more than just mere rhetoric .
To nullify a federal law in practice requires active resistance to it by the people and the state government .
In the Virginia Resolution of 1798 , James Madison wrote of the principle of interposition :
Here Madison asserts what is implied in nullification laws  that state governments not only have the right to resist unconstitutional federal acts , but that , in order to protect liberty , they are " duty bound to interpose " or stand between the federal government and the people of the state .
H4509 includes strong language to assert this principle , and it applies to both state and federal agents : Supporters of such legislation point to laws passed by other states that have effectively nullified federal laws around the country .
Fourteen states have now defied federal laws on marijuana .
And , two dozen states have refused to comply with the Bush - era Real ID Act , rendering that 2005 law virtually null and void today .
Guns , national ID cards , and weed might be just the early stages of a quickly growing movement to nullify other federal laws seen as outside the scope of their constitutionally - delegated powers .
In states around the country this year , bills have been proposed to defy or nullify federal laws on health care cap and trade , and even the process of collecting federal income taxes
The final goal ?
It 's a long way off  a federal government that follows the strict limits of the constitution , whether it wants to or not .

when a girl is licking the underside of the head of your penis and looking up at you at the same time .
Democrats in Congress , primarily U.S. senators , have developed very serious sensory system problems ; they do n't have a vision for America ; they do not seem to hear what the American people have been saying ; and they do n't have the taste for fighting the powerful lobbyists and special interests groups that want to dismantle the American democratic process .
After months and months of debate , disagreement and vacillation , the once very promising health care reform legislation is at the brink of collapse .
This much is certain ; if the Senate Democrats fail to pass this legislation , critical to the future welfare of millions of Americans , then they will , in effect , be committing political suicide .
This will be their final act of betrayal of the American people and the people will respond by throwing many of them out of office later this year .
Passing effective health care legislation should have been a slam dunk ; this was the perfect time to finally get it done after many decades during which all attempts failed .
President Harry Truman , during his tenure as president in the late 1940's and early 1950's , visualized a universal - type of health care system for Americans .
His feelings on this issue were typified by this statement : " Millions of our citizens do not now have a full measure of opportunity to achieve and to enjoy good health .
Millions do not now have protection or security against the economic effects of sickness .
And the time has now arrived for action to help them attain that opportunity and to help them get that protection . "
A wonderful thought but it went nowhere .
Decades later no reform legislation has been enacted but there has never been an opportunity as promising as the one that is present today .
In the elections of 2008 the American people swept the Democrats into office and one of the many issues of importance to them was health care for all Americans .
President Obama sensed this and included it in his agenda .
So the Democratic Party was presented with a clear mandate to finally get it done .

By Charles Krauthammer - February 12 , 2010
WASHINGTON --
" We have an agreement until 2012 that Russia will be responsible for this , " says Anatoly Perminov , head of the Russian space agency , about ferrying astronauts from other countries into low - Earth orbit .
" But after that ?
Excuse me , but the prices should be absolutely different then ! "
The Russians may be new at capitalism but they know how it works .
When you have a monopoly , you charge monopoly prices .
Within months , Russia will have a monopoly on rides into space .
By the end of this year , there will be no shuttle , no U.S. manned space program , no way for us to get into space .
We 're not talking about Mars or the moon here .
We 're talking about low - Earth orbit , which the U.S. has dominated for nearly half a century and from which it is now retiring with nary a whimper .
Our absence from low - Earth orbit was meant to last a few years , the interval between the retirement of the fatally fragile space shuttle and its replacement with the Constellation program ( Ares booster , Orion capsule , Altair lunar lander ) to take astronauts more cheaply and safely back to space .
But the Obama 2011 budget kills Constellation .
Instead , we shall have nothing .
For the first time since John Glenn flew in 1962 , the U.S. will have no access of its own for humans into space -- and no prospect of getting there in the foreseeable future .
Of course , the administration presents the abdication as a great leap forward : Launching humans will now be turned over to the private sector , while NASA 's efforts will be directed toward landing on Mars .
This is nonsense .
It would be swell for private companies to take over launching astronauts .
But they can not do it .
It 's too expensive .
It 's too experimental .
And the safety standards for actually getting people up and down reliably are just unreachably high .
Sure , decades from now there will be a robust private space - travel industry .
But that is a long time .
In the interim , space will be owned by Russia and then China .
The president waxes seriously nationalist at the thought of China or India surpassing us in speculative " clean energy . "
Yet he is quite prepared to gratuitously give up our spectacular lead in human space exploration .
As for Mars , more nonsense .
Mars is just too far away .
And how do you get there without the stepping stones of Ares and Orion ?
If we can't afford an Ares rocket to get us into orbit and to the moon , how long will it take to develop a revolutionary new propulsion system that will take us not a quarter - million miles but 35 million miles ?
To say nothing of the effects of long - term weightlessness , of long - term cosmic ray exposure , and of the intolerable risk to astronaut safety involved in any Mars trip -- six months of contingencies versus three days for a moon trip .
Of course , the whole Mars project as substitute for the moon is simply a ruse .
It 's like the classic bait - and - switch for high - tech military spending :
Kill the doable in the name of some distant sophisticated alternative , which either never gets developed or is simply killed later in the name of yet another , even more sophisticated alternative of the further future .
A classic example is the B - 1 bomber , which was canceled in the 1970s in favor of the over - the - horizon B - 2 stealth bomber , which was then killed in the 1990s after a production run of only 21 ( instead of 132 ) in the name of post - Cold War obsolescence .
Moreover , there is the question of seriousness .
When John F. Kennedy pledged to go to the moon , he meant it .
He had an intense personal commitment to the enterprise .
He delivered speeches remembered to this day .
He dedicated astronomical sums to make it happen .
At the peak of the Apollo program , NASA was consuming almost 4 percent of the federal budget , which in terms of the 2011 budget is about $ 150 billion .
Today the manned space program will die for want of $ 3 billion a year -- 1/300th of last year 's stimulus package with its endless make - work projects that will leave not a trace on the national consciousness .
As for President Obama 's commitment to beyond - lunar space :
Has he given a single speech , devoted an iota of political capital to it ?
Obama 's NASA budget perfectly captures the difference in spirit between Kennedy 's liberalism and Obama's .
Kennedy 's was an expansive , bold , outward - looking summons .
Obama's is a constricted inward - looking call to retreat .
Fifty years ago , Kennedy opened the New Frontier .
Obama has just shut it .
Despite repeated confirmation that the ' paper of record ' was wrong , Clark Hoyt declines to recommend retractions
Describes O'Keefe as ' journalistically unethical , ' but recommends only that editors avoid ' dressed as pimp ' language in future coverage ...
Brad Friedman Byon 2/23/2010 , 5:35 am PT
The New York Times ' independent Public Editor , Clark Hoyt , after sending me an email originally standing by the paper 's misreporting of the James O'Keefe ACORN ' pimp ' story , now describes the rightwing activist 's misrepresentation of his highly - edited and heavily - overdubbed hit videos as " journalistically unethical . "
O'Keefe 's deceptive editing of those infamous tapes implied that he had presented himself in ACORN offices as a 70 's - era blaxploitation " pimp . "
It was the eye - popping , media - friendly , marquee headline that news outlets , including the Times , latched onto and ate up .
Except that it never happened .
The tapes were purposely manipulated in order to give the appearance that ACORN workers were so dumb they did n't even recognize that skinny little white kid as a phony pimp .
And that 's exactly how O'Keefe , and his employer Andrew Breitbart who published the misleading tapes on his websites , wanted them to be perceived .
We 've spent the last several weeks here reporting and demonstrating how the O'Keefe / Breitbart ACORN video hoax was exactly that --- a political partisan scam that was publicized uncritically by the New York Times , and dozens of otherwise reputable outlets .
Despite the Times ' repeatedly misreporting that O'Keefe was dressed or posed as a " pimp " while meeting with ACORN employees in those videos , and even after being shown in no uncertain terms that he did not , the Times ' Public Editor has declined to recommend the paper retract its reporting on this story .
The coverage at the " paper of record " undoubtedly helped lead to Congressional passage of federal legislation attempting to defund the community organization , and helped to bring on a subsequently crippling decline in other funding sources for the non-profit group which serves to provide support for low - and middle - income American families .
At the end of the remarkable email exchange between Hoyt and myself ( published in full at the end of this article ) , he says he recommended only that " Times editors ... avoid language that says or suggests that O'Keefe was dressed as a pimp when he captured the ACORN employees on camera . "
That , even though ...
former MA Attorney General Scott Harshbarger , whose investigation [ PDF ] of the edited versions of the videos found no illegal conduct by ACORN staff and observed that " at each and every " ACORN office visited by O'Keefe with his partner Hannah Giles ( who was dressed as a " prostitute " ) he was " dressed like a college student - in slacks and a button down shirt , " and ;
dressed as a " prostitute " ) he was " dressed like a college student - in slacks and a button down shirt , " and ; ACORN has stated on the record , based on interviews with their employees , that [ emphasis in original ]
" O'Keefe was not wearing that absurd costume when he visited our offices , " and ;
] " O'Keefe was wearing that absurd costume when he visited our offices , " and ; Giles herself has now twice admitted on the record ( once on video tape ) , that O'Keefe never wore his 70 's - era blaxploitation pimp costume in those offices , and ;
O'Keefe and Giles ' benefactor , Andrew Breitbart , who published and promoted the videos ( and misrepresented them himself in his own Washington Times column ) also finally acknowledged the pimp outfit was only used as a marketing gimmick , and ;
column ) also finally acknowledged the pimp outfit was only used as a marketing gimmick , and ; while the Times ' Scott Shane first reported on September 15th of last year that O'Keefe " visited Acorn offices ... dressed so outlandishly that he might have been playing in a risqué high school play " and , on September 18th , as traveling in " the gaudy guise of pimp and prostitute through various offices of Acorn , " and ;
the paper had reported similarly time after time since then ( without noting the existence of Harshbarger 's report even once ) , and ;
even though I directly debunked several pieces of " evidence " that Hoyt originally proffered for his original assessment that he " would not recommend a correction , based on the available evidence , " and offered him much more corroborated evidence along with it , and ;
even though he acknowledges his original evidence was , indeed , inaccurate , and ;
even though Congress voted to defund ACORN just days after the New York Times ' first inaccurate report ;
... Hoyt nonetheless wrote in his final communication to me : " I still do n't see that a correction is in order , because that would require conclusive evidence that The Times was wrong , which I have n't seen . "
But of course by now , he has seen , or at least he has been sent , " conclusive evidence that The Times was wrong . "
Yet he has still declined to recommend any retractions by the " paper of record . "
I am as utterly gobsmacked now as I was when Times ' Senior Editor of Standards Greg Brock originally cited an appearance by James O'Keefe wearing his pimp costume on Fox " News , " during which host Steve Doocy said the rightwing activist was " dressed exactly in the same outfit that he wore in these ACORN offices up and down the Eastern Seaboard , " as evidence to support their reporting .
Brock wrote , in a remarkable email exchange posted by The BRAD BLOG on February 8th , that " If there is a correction to be made , it seems it would start with Mr. O'Keefe himself .
We believe him .
Therefore there is nothing for us to correct . "
When the details from Harshbarger 's report were used to counter Brock 's use of O'Keefe and Fox as credible sources , he followed up with some vague information in support of standing by their reporting : a video said to reveal " at one point , the camera ... turned in such a way to catch part of the ' costume ' he was wearing .
And ACORN employees who saw him described his costume . "
Brock refused to offer specifics on what video he was referencing , or where the information could be found of " employees " said to have described O'Keefe 's costume .
In my email exchange with Hoyt , which came about as a result of the emails with Brock , he at least offered specifics for the references which Brock would not .
In each case , however , I was able to demonstrate to Hoyt how the supposed " evidence " in support of O'Keefe having dressed as a pimp in those offices , was completely inaccurate and without basis in fact .
In Hoyt 's initial email to me --- a week or so after I and others began emailing him at Public@NYTimes.com to request he review the matter --- he originally offered three reasons " The Times believes that on at least a couple of occasions O'Keefe did dress in his pimp outfit at an Acorn office . "
Therefore , he wrote , he stood by the paper 's reporting and " would not recommend a correction , based on the available evidence . "
Here are the three reasons that Hoyt gave for not recommending a correction , and a summary of the information that I shared with him in reply :
1 ) The Meaning of the Word ' And '
The most recent article in dispute , a January 30th feature article by Jim Rutenberg and Campbell Robertson , following on O'Keefe 's recent federal felony arrest for allegedly attempted to " maliciously interfere " with the phone system of Senator Mary Landrieu ( D - LA ) , described O'Keefe as having " made his biggest national splash last year when he dressed up as a pimp and trained his secret camera on counselors with the liberal community group Acorn . "
Hoyt appears to have looked at only that one article initially , and stood behind it because , as he wrote [ emphasis his ] :
" The story says O'Keefe dressed up as a pimp and trained his hidden camera on Acorn counselors .
It does not say he did those two things at the same time . "
While trying to give every benefit of the doubt , I responded that even if one accepts the notion that that wording was simply exceedingly misleading , there was no way to similarly justify Shane 's earlier reports , as linked above .
2 ) The Woman Who Was n't There
" Isemene Speliotis , who supervised the Acorn employees in the New York videos , told Rutenberg that she was especially disappointed that they gave advice to O'Keefe and Hannah Giles because the pair looked so ridiculous they could not possibly have been for real , " Hoyt wrote .
Having not recognized the name Isemene Speliotis --- she appeared in none of O'Keefe 's videos ---
I checked with ACORN who put me in touch with her that very Saturday .
As it turns out , Speliotis is the Executive Director at NY ACORN Housing Co. ( for those who do n't know , ACORN and ACORN Housing are two entirely different organizations ) and while she remembered speaking to Rutenberg " about six months ago , " she explained that she was n't even in the office when O'Keefe and Giles came in !
During our phone conversation Speliotis explained she was told by her staff what had happened , but never witnessed the pair herself , and was not told that O'Keefe was dressed as a pimp .
" I was at a meeting that day , " she told me .
" I did n't hear about this until later .
The only time I ever saw these folks was from the video . " " I spoke to my staff and they said that she was dressed inappropriately , and that he said he was a banker , " she said .
" I do n't think he was wearing a jacket , because it was summer , but that he was in a regular shirt and pants . "
I also heard from another senior official in the New York office , who asked not to be identified publicly given the harassment that ACORN employees have received since O'Keefe 's videos were released .
That supervisor confirmed that Speliotis " did not see them . "
" I was in the office and did not see the pimp outfit , " the NY ACORN official wrote via email on the same day .
" Everyone in the office was more focuses [ sic ] on her clothes and those that more directly paid attentuon [ sic ] said what we all knew to be true ... only one was dressed weirdly . "
While Brock had originally referenced " employees " ( plural ) said to have " described his costume , " Hoyt offered only Rutenberg 's reference to Speliotis to support the claim .
Moreover , ACORN 's communications director Kevin Whelan confirmed again to me that they were aware of no employees having described O'Keefe as dressed , or even representing himself as a pimp .
3 ) The Video Tape
Hoyt offered specifics on the video tape that Brock referred to , but refused to specifically cite .
Hoyt referenced " the 6:12 mark " of Part 2 of the D.C. video , the one which O'Keefe and Breitbart 's website deceptively describes to this day as a " Child Prostitution Investigation . "
" As O'Keefe is leaving the DC Acorn office , " Hoyt wrote , " you will see his reflection in a plate glass window .
You have to look closely , but it appears he is wearing the hat that is part of the outfit , and it appears to me that he is wearing other parts of the outfit .
The brim of the hat appears briefly in the frame just seconds later , as the camera is jostled leaving the premises . "
So I downloaded the video Hoyt referenced and went to the 6:12 mark and indeed could see a reflection in the plate glass window , purported to have been taped as the pair walked out of the office .
But the reflection , as you 'll see in the screen grab I sent to Hoyt ( included in the emails below ) , appears to be of someone in a long - sleeve white shirt .
I was able to see no black jacket , black fedora , or fur cape as he is seen wearing in very the next shot , seconds later , as the video cuts away to show a two - shot of O'Keefe and Giles , dressed as " pimp " and " prostitute , " walking down the street .
Next , I did a frame - by - frame screen - grab analysis of every frame in that second or two as the " camera is jostled . "
As you 'll see --- and as I shared with him in the emails --- there is no " brim of the hat " and no " parts of the costume " in any of those 24 frames .
The only thing seen appearing in the frame , is what appears to be the elbow of O'Keefe 's white sleeve , and then his hand , presumably reaching up to turn off the camera .
Furthermore , I offered Hoyt the D.C. weather report for July 25 , 2009 , the day O'Keefe says in his voice - over that he visited the D.C. office .
The report says that it was 90 to 93 degrees in Washington that day --- the day that he 's seen being introduced on tape --- to one of the workers by the receptionist --- as a " law student at Georgetown . "
Neither employee batted an eye at that introduction , despite the fact that O'Keefe , according to the New York Times , would have been wearing a black jacket , tie , black fedora , and fur cape in the middle of a 90 degree afternoon in July , in Washington D.C. , as he was introduced as a Georgetown law student inside the ACORN office .
As I wrote to Hoyt , after spending hours putting together the photographic analysis and other evidence :
This is all , admittedly , a ridiculous length to go to , of course , to make the point that the information the Times seems to have relied on when filing report after report after report suggesting , or outright saying , that he was dressed as that infamous pimp character that everyone has now seen him in , and believe that he wore in front of those " stupid " ACORN employees ( no wonder they need to have all their funding removed and be put out of business ! ) is incredibly thin for the " paper of record " , even with every benefit of the doubt .
...
It 's a ridiculous length to make this point , but all of this matters .
Big time .
Among the two largest reasons : A ) Because he's now facing federal felony charges and his past credibility is important to the future proceedings and B ) Because these videos , and the Times reports on them , resulted in the U.S. CONGRESS (! ) passing legislation to deny them federal funding based on what appears to be an entirely phony premise which both O'Keefe and Breitbart knowingly misrepresented publicly , and that the Times went along with , in error , time and again .
Several days later , after sharing all of the above , Hoyt wrote back to say that he had n't looked at the videos in " quite a long time ago , before this question of dress arose , " so he " decided it would be good to get a fresh pair of eyes on the case . "
He asked his assistant , Michael McElroy , to review all of the videos .
He says that McElroy told him " there is no video that clearly shows James O'Keefe in his pimp garb inside an ACORN office . "
Therefore ,
Hoyt wrote , " Under the circumstances , I am recommending to Times editors that they avoid language that says or suggests that O'Keefe was dressed as a pimp when he captured the ACORN employees on camera . "
" I still do n't see that a correction is in order , " he continued amazingly , " because that would require conclusive evidence that The Times was wrong , which I have n't seen .
The Times could seek out all the employees , but I do n't think that 's a realistic prospect worth the investment of effort . "
So they reported all of this , time and again , with ZERO evidence that the Times was right , but now find no need to issue a retraction because , as Hoyt says , there is not " conclusive evidence that The Times was wrong . "
Moreover , as I noted in reply , the effort of checking with the four different ACORN offices --- Baltimore , NY , D.C. , and Santa Barbara , CA , where videos had been published by O'Keefe and Breitbart by the time Shane first described O'Keefe 's " outlandish " and " gaudy guise " --- would most certainly be well " worth the investment of effort " to those least fortunate of low - income Americans for whom ACORN is often the only hope for certain services , like being able to put a roof over their heads .
I would also argue that it would be " well worth the investment " if only to try and restore the New York Times ' utterly shattered credibility at this point .
But Hoyt never responded in kind --- even after I sent him subsequent confirmation from Giles and Breitbart , admitting that O'Keefe was never dressed that way , which certainly amounted to " conclusive evidence that The Times was wrong . "
Hoyt had a bit more to say , as you can read in the full emails below , arguing , essentially , that even if that aspect of the Times ' reporting was wrong , the videos still appear to show some sort of wrong - doing by employees .
As I wrote in reply :
Your contentions are clearly ( and understandably ) biased by the videos which offer a very different picture from what actually happened in those offices , according to the transcripts .
I 'll not continue this already long email by detailing specifics of how , except to say that , contrary to what I read as your impressions , in every office the workers advised the pair that they must legally pay their taxes ( not hide the income as you suggest ) , no matter where it comes from .
In every office the workers were told a house was needed to escape an abusive pimp who had been abusing and stalking the girl .
In each and every office , workers , in various ways , advised the girl ( and O'Keefe , her " boyfriend " trying to help her escape ) to rethink what they were doing , and frequently offered her help , womens shelters etc .
But none of that makes any difference whatsoever here when it comes to the New York Times reporting the story accurately as it is " fit to print " .
I appreciate that you may not care for ACORN , for whatever reason , and you may even be offended by what the doctored - videos appear to show about the low - level employees ( no supervisors nor senior staffers ) who violated ACORN 's written protocols in various instances , and were fired immediately for having done so .
But your paper 's failure to follow appropriate journalistic protocols for vetting information before reporting it , and then failing to correct it when all evidence shows that it was blatantly wrong --- where no evidence , none , exists to show that they were correct --- is a sorry state for the " paper of record " to be in .
Whatever the employees of ACORN did or did n't do , does not exonerate the New York Times for having reported the story inaccurately , time and time again .
The Breitbart / O'Keefe hoax , unfortunately , had very serious , real - world consequences .
ACORN receives approximately $ 3.5 million per year in federal funds ( not the " billions " that Breitbart / O' Keefe still misreport to this day ) .
But while a judge has found the Congressional legislation unconstitutional , ACORN reports that funding has dropped off dramatically after all of this .
And the political assault on ACORN is a direct assault on democracy in the United States , given that the group legally helps register millions of low - and middle - income voters so that they may legally exercise their right to vote .
That is , of course , what is at the heart of the entire , years - long GOP smear campaign against the group .
Last September , in his own column , Hoyt took the Times to task following criticism from rightwingers .
He chided the paper for having been " slow off the mark " by waiting " nearly a week " after O'Keefe 's first video was released before reporting on it .
The paper took measures , thereafter , to improve on its " insufficient tuned - in - ness to the issues that are dominating Fox News and talk radio , " as Hoyt wrote at the time .
It 's been at least three weeks since we first called on the Times to correct this matter , and nearly six months since their original , damaging , and inaccurate reports .
So it 's remarkable that Hoyt has so - far failed to recommend appropriate corrections , retractions , apologies and an investigation to find out how this could have happened , and what the Times plans to do to ensure that it does n't happen again .
So , of course , it will .
To this day , O'Keefe and Breitbart have outright refused to release the full , unedited video tapes publicly .
We now know , based on the parts of the text transcripts they were willing to release , that the edited versions of the videos were exceedingly deceptive and misleading .
The transcripts show something very different than what was represented in those highly - doctored and heavily - overdubbed tapes .
Yet Breitbart and O'Keefe wo n't release the unedited footage for some odd reason , and the Times is still standing by their demonstrably inaccurate stories , even as there is every reason to believe the unedited tapes might reveal even more of the despicable political hoax that O'Keefe , Breitbart and , yes , the New York Times , have pulled on the American people .

Brad FriedmanRe : CLARK : Following Up on Bizarre emails with Greg Brock Brad ,
You asked me to review Greg Brock 's correspondence with Bob F. [ last name redacted for privacy ] and you over The Times 's Jan. 30 front - page story on James O'Keefe .
I decided to take a look at the fundamental issue : whether a correction is warranted .
First , I have to say that I think Mr. F. [ redacted ] mischaracterized what the article said .
Here is what he wrote : " In your Sunday article on James O'Keefe , you stated that he went into Acorn offices dressed as a pimp . "
Here is the exact language in the article by James Rutenberg and Campbell Robertson : " Mr. O'Keefe made his biggest national splash last year when he dressed up as a pimp and trained his secret camera on counselors with the liberal community group Acorn - eliciting advice on financing a brothel on videos that would threaten to become Acorn 's undoing . "
The story says O'Keefe dressed up as a pimp and trained his hidden camera on Acorn counselors .
It does not say he did those two things at the same time .
There is no question , looking at the videos , that O'Keefe dressed as a pimp in front of his camera , and there is no question in my mind , after watching the videos , that regardless of what he was wearing in the offices , he presented himself to Acorn staffers as a pimp , unless , of course , you believe that virtually all the sound on the videos was faked , something for which I have seen no evidence .
The same report commissioned by Acorn that you cite says , " there is no question that the visits occurred and the comments were made . "
The Times believes that on at least a couple of occasions O'Keefe did dress in his pimp outfit at an Acorn office .
Isemene Speliotis , who supervised the Acorn employees in the New York videos , told Rutenberg that she was especially disappointed that they gave advice to O'Keefe and Hannah Giles because the pair looked so ridiculous they could not possibly have been for real .
Separately , take a look at this link and go to the 6:12 mark .
As O'Keefe is leaving the DC Acorn office , you will see his reflection in a plate glass window .
You have to look closely , but it appears he is wearing the hat that is part of the outfit , and it appears to me that he is wearing other parts of the outfit .
The brim of the hat appears briefly in the frame just seconds later , as the camera is jostled leaving the premises .
Is this conclusive proof ?
No .
Is the admittedly hearsay evidence in Acorn 's internal report conclusive proof that O'Keefe dressed as a college student at each and every Acorn office ?
No .
In the end , I see no need for The Times to correct something it did not say .
And even if Mr. F's [ name of BRAD BLOG reader who original requested correction from Times redacted for privacy ] interpretation were accurate , I still would not recommend a correction , based on the available evidence .
Best , Clark Hoyt

Subject : RE : CLARK : Following Up on Bizarre emails with Greg Brock Brad FriedmanSaturday , February 13 , 2010 4:28 AM ' Public / NYT / NYTIMES'RE : CLARK : Following Up on Bizarre emails with Greg Brock Mr. Hoyt -
First , thank you very much for taking the time to review this matter .
You write that after review you " would not recommend a correction , based on the available evidence . "
Please allow me to offer several points of available evidence , including responses to the two assertions you offered said to back up the Times multiple mis-reporting on this matter .
I have review your points very closely , including a frame - by - frame analysis of the video you pointed to , which does not appear to back up your belief of what you thought you might have seen , as well as additional evidence to underscore that it is next to impossible that O'Keefe was wearing the pimp outfit in the offices of ACORN as you suggested , as Greg Brock suggested , and as the Times has reported again and again month after month .
I 've been working on this story for some time , and on the larger ACORN matter for several years --- though I have no business or personal relationship with them --- tracking consistent misreporting by media and purposeful misrepresentation by their foes for years .
To that end , I hope you will review my response in full below .
You wrote : " The story says O'Keefe dressed up as a pimp and trained his hidden camera on Acorn counselors .
It does not say he did those two things at the same time . "
For a start , that seems an extraordinarily semantic benefit of the doubt to offer the Times there , as I should think any reader would read the copy from James Rutenberg and Campbell Robertson 's Jan 31 article , as you quoted : Mr. O'Keefe made his biggest national splash last year when he dressed up as a pimp and trained his secret camera on counselors with the liberal community group Acorn - eliciting advice on financing a brothel on videos that would threaten to become Acorn 's undoing .
… to make the presumption that O'Keefe was " dressed up as a pimp " while he " trained his hidden camera on Acorn counselors " .
A point which is iffy at very best , and far more likely , wholly untrue , given the amount of checking I 've done into this matter , as based on my reporting which included reviewing all of the publicly released video tapes , text transcripts , the two independent reports , speaking to ACORN themselves and even to Breitbart cursorily via Twitter ( he refused to answer my repeated direct questions about this , for a reason I 'd suspect . )
All of that reporting points in the same direction :
He never wore the costume in the office .
Beyond that , while the syntax could mean what you 're suggesting , in trying to offer every benefit of the doubt to the Times , it nonetheless seems to strain credulity to presume that 's either what the reporters meant , or that it would be perceived by a regular reader as being two separate events ( 1 . He was " dressed up as a pimp " at one point , and 2 .
He trained his hidden camera on Acorn counselors " at another ) .
The amazed reactions I 've received since reporting that O'Keefe did NOT dress as a pimp in those offices , underscores that the vast majority of people familiar with this story in the slightest , have presumed he was dressed like that .
The Times reporting does nothing to dissuade that , despite the lack of evidence for it , and worse , actually underscores the false premise that helped make this story so popular .
That 's all particularly true , given a great deal of the other reporting that has appeared in the Times ( and other places , of course ) on the same matter .
Eg. Scott Shane , in the Times , Sept. 15 , 2009 wrote : it took amateur actors , posing as a prostitute and a pimp and recorded on hidden cameras in visits to Acorn offices
…
The undercover videos showed a scantily dressed young woman , Hannah Giles , posing as a prostitute , while a young man , James O'Keefe , played her pimp .
They visited Acorn offices in Baltimore , Washington , Brooklyn and San Bernardino , Calif. , candidly describing their illicit business and asking the advice of Acorn workers .
Among other questions , they asked how to buy a house to use as a brothel employing under - age girls from El Salvador .
Mr. O'Keefe , 25 , a filmmaker and conservative activist , was dressed so outlandishly that he might have been playing in a risque high school play .
The reporting above clearly indicates O'Keefe was " dressed…outlandishly " when he " visited Acorn offices " .
But there is no evidence that I have been able to find that he was .
None .
And again on Sept. 18 , 2009 , Scott Shane wrote :
But never has his work had anything like the impact of the Acorn exposé , conducted by Mr. O'Keefe and a friend he met through Facebook , 20 - year - old Hannah Giles .
Their travels in the gaudy guise of pimp and prostitute through various offices of Acorn …
By the time Shane 's first report above was published on Sept. 15 last year , referring to him " dressed so outlandishly that he might have been playing in a risque high school play " only the videos from 4 cities had yet been publicly released ( Baltimore 9/9/09 , DC 9/11/09 , NY 9/13/09 and San Bernardino 9/15/09 , --- all of those are linked here . )
So any such " outlandish " and " gaudy guise " , if it was visible on tape , would presumably be visible in one or more of the tapes from one or more of the cities seen in those four videos .
Yet , contrary to the Times reporting , I was unable to see him wearing any such guise in any of the offices , in any of the videos in those four cities .
Including the one you cited , but more on that in a moment .
As you know , that same opinion is expressed on the record --- though it was n't available by Sept 15th or 18th when Shane filed his reports above --- by AG Scott Harshbarger 's 12/7/09 report [ PDF ] : Although Mr. O'Keefe appeared in all videos dressed as a pimp , in fact , when he appeared at each and every office , he was dressed like a college student - in slacks and a button down shirt … By ACORN's own posted 12/7/09 analysis of O'Keefe 's released transcripts [ PDF ] :
While their press releases claim they were posing as a " prostitute and a pimp , " the transcripts show that O'Keefe consistently introduced himself as Giles ' boyfriend trying to protect her .
3
While we have seen videos of O'Keefe 's ridiculous " pimp " get - up , with Chinchilla cape , hat , and walking cane , these are all outdoor visuals .
In the actual videos in the offices , every view of O'Keefe shows him dressed in normal casual business attire .
… And once again by ACORN Communication Director Kevin Whelan via email , and reported by The BRAD BLOG on 2/10 /10 [ emphasis his ] : O'Keefe was not wearing that absurd costume when he visited our offices .
We know this from speaking to staff and from the videos posted online by O'Keefe himself which , when you can see any part of his outfit , show a regular dress shirt and slacks .
Still , while both Harshbarger 's specific and very direct findings and ACORN's own specific and very direct position certainly should have been --- at the very least --- noted in Rutenberg and Campbell 's Jan 31st Times article , at the very least for fairness and balance , Shane likely had none of those official statements when he reported , without qualification last September , on the " outlandish " and " gaudy " costumes that both O'Keefe and Giles were " dressed " in as " they visited Acorn offices in " those four cities .
While that reporting now appears to be wrong , it 's fair that Shane might not have realized that just days after the videos were released when he filed his initial reports .
But they now appear to be wrong nonetheless , and should be investigated for accuracy , and corrected prominently if they are found not to be , as I believe you will find .
There is , however , no excuse for the , at least , eight times that the NY Times has reported him as " dressed " or " posing " as a pimp since Harshbarger 's Dec. 7th 2009 report was released , without even noting that mitigating official finding in the Times reporting .
Especially as all of the reporting , and the analyses of the transcripts , shows that he described himself as her boyfriend trying to help her escape from an abusive pimp .
Even in O'Keefe 's own voiceover , for example , in the 9/15/09 San Bernardino tape , he intros it by saying " I posed as the local up and coming politician who wanted to use illicit sex money from the underaged girls to fund my future congressional campaign " .
So how effective could his posing as a " local up and coming politician " be if he was wearing a fur cape , a fedora , gaudy sunglasses and a walking stick ?
Credulity strained , at best .
But most disturbing on these point , the Times , to my knowledge , has never even reported on the Harshbarger report --- ACORN says they did n't even send a reporter to the telephone press conference when it was released - while the paper has reported time and again , even since the report was released on Dec. 7th , on O'Keefe and the videos themselves , and the various fallout from them .
Of course , if the Times has information not available to the naked eye , or to those above who reviewed the transcripts and videos , etc. , it 's still possible , as Greg Brock suggested , that he was wearing that outfit in one of the four cities mentioned .
But your paper has offered no evidence for it , and I have not been able to find any anywhere .
To that end , you offer two specific assertions in order to support the Times body of reporting on this , both of which you admit do not offer us " conclusive proof " and seem remarkably thin , even on close examination , to support something as important as this .
And it is important for reasons I 'll mention in a second .
But I thank you , at least , for offering specifics where Greg refused to .
On the first asserted piece of evidence , you write : The Times believes that on at least a couple of occasions O'Keefe did dress in his pimp outfit at an Acorn office .
Isemene Speliotis , who supervised the Acorn employees in the New York videos , told Rutenberg that she was especially disappointed that they gave advice to O'Keefe and Hannah Giles because the pair looked so ridiculous they could not possibly have been for real .
I 'm not familiar with the name Isemene Speliotis off - hand , and she does n't appear in O'Keefe 's NY videos to my knowledge , nor is she named in O'Keefe 's released transcript , nor does she appear , unlike the others in that video , on the list of staffers that O'Keefe shows himself in the video , as seen here …
So I have sent a query to ACORN to find out who she is , and if they know if she actually saw O'Keefe and Giles in the office first hand , and if her references to " the pair look [ ing ] so ridiculous they could not possibly have been for real " was based on her first hand knowledge seeing an actual " pimp costume " on O'Keefe in the NY office , or if , instead , she was referring to what she may have seen on Fox News or even read about in the NY Times instead .
From your description , it does n't sound like she described a pimp outfit --- and , indeed , we see a conservative white oxford shirt cuff at the beginning of the video ( important in a moment , concerning your second assertion ) .
But we 'll leave Isemene 's comments aside for now , until I can get more info about who she is and what she actually saw first hand .
As noted , ACORN has previously confirmed to me that they believe " O'Keefe was not wearing that absurd costume when he visited our offices , " and they " know this from speaking to staff . "
But we 'll see if I can get more specifics on the person you mention .
[ Ed note : I did get more specifics the next day , as you 'll see in my next note to Hoyt .
It turns out that Speliotis , the Executive Director of NY's ACORN Housing was not even in the office on the day that O'Keefe and Giles came in for the interview .
She told me , among other things , the next day that , " The only time I ever saw these folks was from the video . "
More details in my next note to Hoyt . - BF ]
On the second assertion , the only visual evidence you point me towards , or that I 'm aware exists anywhere , to directly support the Times reporting on this , you wrote , " take a look at this link and go to the 6:12 mark…etc . "
But it looks as if you forgot to include the link you referenced .
So , I 'm going to presume you 're referring to Part II of the DC video ( since u mention DC later in the graf ) as released by O'Keefe and Brietbart on 9/9/09 right here .
If you are referring to another video , of course , one that was not released publicly as part of Breitbart 's releases via BigGovernment.com , please let me know .
Particularly as Greg was unwilling to offer the video which he wrote about via email to say : " At one point , the camera was turned in such a way to catch part of the ' costume ' he was wearing " .
There is a shot , represented as the pair leaving the DC office , at the 6:12 mark in that DC video , so that 's what I presume you 're looking at , unless informed otherwise .
[ Ed note : Hoyt 's assistant Michael followed up to confirm that this is the video
Hoyt meant to link to .
- BF ]
Here 's what is at that 6:12 mark on that video :
You wrote about that frame and what follows it :
As O'Keefe is leaving the DC Acorn office , you will see his reflection in a plate glass window .
You have to look closely , but it appears he is wearing the hat that is part of the outfit , and it appears to me that he is wearing other parts of the outfit .
The brim of the hat appears briefly in the frame just seconds later , as the camera is jostled leaving the premises .
The shot above does seems to show a reflection of someone , but in a white long sleeve shirt with the cuffs unbuttoned or rolled up , and dark pants .
I see no black fedora - like hat that is a part of his pimp outfit .
And then the camera jostles , as you describe , for appx 24 frames before we see this shot of O'Keefe in that black fedora , black jacket and tie , and fur cape , at 6:18 :
In the intervening frames , you say you 're able to make out " The brim of the hat appears briefly in the frame just seconds later , as the camera is jostled leaving the premises " .
Those 24 frames , examined frame - by - frame as I have posted for you here , in order , do not appear to show a " hat that is part of the outfit " or any other " parts of the outfit " as you suggest .
Not to my eyes anyway .
However , something white ( not black , like the hat he is seen wearing above in the following shot ) is seen as the frame - by - frame analysis reveals a hand , and then what appears to most likely be O'Keefe 's sleeve at the elbow in a white oxford shirt ( consistent with the reflection you noticed ) , then his hand again , reaching up to presumably turn off the hidden camera .
As mentioned , I 've posted every video frame for you , in order , from that sequence , so you can confirm if this is what you were referring to , right here : https://bradblog.com/?page_id=7698
Here are just a few of those 24 frames that I believe you 're referring to , in order , before the shot switches to a cut-away , shot separately , featuring O'Keefe in his outlandish black jacket , tie , gaudy fur cape and black hat :
There is no evidence of any other part of what he is wearing in those shots that I can see , other than the white sleeve , but please let me know if you see anything I may have missed .
Moreover , at the beginning of that DC video ( Part I ) , just after O'Keefe is heard telling the receptionist " My girlfriend 's a prostitute " , the office worker then introduces him to the two workers featured in the bulk of the tape by saying " This gentleman is a law student at Georgetown . "
From your description of what you say you 're able to see in the window reflection above --- the only publicly released visual evidence that anybody has so far claimed that they are able to see of O'Keefe dressed as a pimp almost inside an office to my knowledge --- she has just introduced the guy seen in the last frame above , in the outlandish fur cape , black fedora hat , etc. with a straight face , as " a law student at Georgetown " .
Funny looking outfit to introduce him merely as a Georgetown law student , but okay .
She did this on July 25 , 2009 , according to O'Keefe 's voiceover on the tape --- mid-summer in July in D.C. , when the Washington Post reported temperatures that day were from 90 to 93 degrees Fahrenheit .
So we must accept that with 90 degree weather , this " law student at Georgetown " was wearing a fur cape over a dark jacket and tie , even though the reflection seems to be of someone in a long sleeve white shirt with the cuffs rolled up or open .
And yet nobody on the tape has said a word about the ridiculous outfit or even blinked an eye .
Nobody .
This is all , admittedly , a ridiculous length to go to , of course , to make the point that the information the Times seems to have relied on when filing report after report after report suggesting , or outright saying , that he was dressed as that infamous pimp character that everyone has now seen him in , and believe that he wore in front of those " stupid " ACORN employees ( no wonder they need to have all their funding removed and be put out of business ! ) is incredibly thin for the " paper of record " , even with every benefit of the doubt .
From last September 's reported " outlandish " and " gaudy guise " that so many have now seen on TV --- but never in any ACORN office --- all the way through December , after Harshbarger 's unmentioned - in - the - Times report , and all the way through the end of January when he was described as " dressed up as a pimp and trained his secret camera on counselors with the liberal community group Acorn " as Rutenberg and Robertson reported on Jan. 30 , 2010 .
It 's a ridiculous length to make this point , but all of this matters .
Big time .
Among the two largest reasons : A ) Because he's now facing federal felony charges and his past credibility is important to the future proceedings and B ) Because these videos , and the Times reports on them , resulted in the U.S. CONGRESS (! ) passing legislation to deny them federal funding based on what appears to be an entirely phony premise which both O'Keefe and Breitbart knowingly misrepresented publicly , and that the Times went along with , in error , time and again .
All of this while the Times , I know for a fact , is very well aware of the years - long rightwing attack on this group , where one falsehood after another has been alleged as based on a partisan political agenda to put these guys --- who legally register millions of low and middle - income citizens ( who vote overwhelmingly Democratic ) to legally vote --- out of business .
The Times has been very good on reporting that part of the GOP / ACORN story .
But horrible on this aspect , I 'm sorry to say .
Finally , though I do a great deal of investigative reporting for a number of other media outlets , most of my work is on my own blog .
Yet , I would be laughed outta " the business " if I even tried to support my reporting with a reason resembling the one first offered for all of this by your Senior Editor for Standards , Greg Brock , when he , incredibly , asserted :
Our article included that description because Mr. O'Keefe himself explained how he was dressed --- and appeared on a live
Fox show wearing what HE said was the same exact costume he wore to ACORN 's offices .
…
If there is a correction to be made , it seems it would start with Mr. O'Keefe himself .
We believe him .
Therefore there is nothing for us to correct .
Fox News ?
" We believe him " ?
Those are now the standards for supporting the reporting at the " paper of record " ?!
Without an even " as he said " , or " according to Fox News " ?
Do you suppose Andrew Breitbart or the other folks on the Right would accept reporting as fact , based on sourcing such as " Nancy Pelosi said so on MSNBC , so we believe her " when all available evidence pointed to the fact that Pelosi was lying and MSNBC was out and out flat wrong ?
They would demand a retraction or correction , they'd be right to do so , and the Times would most likely offer it .
When O'Keefe was on that live Fox show that Greg Brock referenced ( and linked to in his email ) , Fox 's Steve Doocy introduced him , as he sat on the couch in that pimp outfit , by saying , " He 's dressed exactly in the same outfit that he wore to these ACORN offices up and down the Eastern Seaboard . "
O'Keefe did n't say a word in disagreement .
Yet we know , if only from the shots of his white cuffs in the NY video , and from what appears to be his white shirt sleeves in DC , that that is not true .
Nonetheless , Greg says the NYTimes included that description , because of that appearance .
Later , when called on that , Greg asserted new reasons --- remarkable in and of itself for the Sr. Editor of Standards who by his own 2007 assertion is the Times ' " senior editor who oversees corrections " .
The new reasons mirror the same ones you mentioned , and which I examined above : " At one point , the camera was turned in such a way to catch part of the ' costume ' he was wearing .
And ACORN employees who saw him described his costume . …
We stand by our reporting . "
Yet he then refused to offer evidence for either of those two claims .
In the first instance suggesting the video was not publicly released ( you suggest otherwise ) , and in the second , asserting that someone else --- not the Times or Rutenberg , as you suggest --- had carried out interviews with employees ( plural ) who " described the costume " .
Short of the ACORN employee you mention offering some kind of confirmation to the specifics of the " outlandish " and " gaudy guise " the paper has reported he wore , or some other instance of some ACORN worker somewhere describing the costume , it seems very clear that the NYTimes has been presumably - unknowingly reporting a purposely forwarded fiction , a hoax , meant to enhance a political hit - job story with a spectacular , if phony , visual exclamation mark .
It seems they have done so with virtually zero evidence to back up that reporting .
I do n't meant to suggest anything nefarious having been done by the paper .
But I do mean to highlight what , by all available evidence , seems to be a massive fail , for whatever reason , particular for what is still the " paper of record " .
" If there is a correction to be made , " Times Senior Editor for Standards Greg Brock wrote in those emails , " it seems it would start with Mr. O'Keefe himself .
We believe him .
Therefore there is nothing for us to correct . "
Mr. Hoyt , as the Public Editor , you are the only hope the public has for seeing accountability and accuracy at the world 's most important newspaper in situations like this .
I urge you to re-examine this matter very carefully , to call me anytime --- I work all weekend , all day , all night --- to further discuss any questions you may have here on any of these points or any others .
But I urge you to review all of the above carefully and thoughtfully , along with its copious supporting evidence , and ask yourself if the apparently wholly un-supported marquee claim - to - fame for O'Keefe 's blockbuster videos which had very serious real - world consequences reaching all the way to the desk of the President of the United States , was supported by enough evidence to merit unqualified reporting in the pages of the Times , over and again , as part of " all the news that 's fit to print " .
Unfortunately , the claim does n't seem " fit to print " in the slightest .
Respectfully ,

Subject : RE : CLARK : Following Up on Bizarre emails with Greg Brock Brad Friedman : Saturday , February 13 , 2010 3:50 PM ' Public / NYT / NYTIMES ': RE : CLARK : Following Up on Bizarre emails with Greg Brock Clark - Hopefully you received my detailed response to yours last night .
As promised , I said I 'd follow up on the assertion you offered vis a vis Rutenberg that Ismene Speliotis , a supervisor at the NY office , confirmed the reporting of O'Keefe having worn his pimp costume in that office .
I have now spoken directly to Speliotis , the Executive Dir at NY ACORN Housing Co. , and though says she did n't remembering saying what you have attributed Rutenberg as telling you about their conversation , she fervently noted that she was not in the office that day , and did not see the pair .
She says that what she must have been describing to Rutenberg when they spoke " six months ago " , was what she " was told by my staff [ had ] happened " .
She adds : " The only time I ever saw these folks was from the video . "
Specifically , you wrote : Isemene Speliotis , who supervised the Acorn employees in the New York videos , told Rutenberg that she was especially disappointed that they gave advice to O'Keefe and Hannah Giles because the pair looked so ridiculous they could not possibly have been for real .
All of which both Speliotis , as well as another senior official in the NY office who was there , and who says did see the pair , fervently and directly dispute .
Said Speliotis when I spoke to her today by phone : " I was at a meeting that day .
I did n't hear about this until later .
The only time I ever saw these folks was from the video . " " I spoke to my staff and they said that she was dressed inappropriately , and that he said he was a banker , I do n't think he was wearing a jacket , because it was summer , but that he was in a regular shirt and pants . "
( As to Hoyt 's quote from Rutenberg ) : " I do n't remember saying this .
It 's a strange thing to say .
It was six months ago , but I did n't see these folks , I was told by my staff what happened . "
" When we ( Rutenberg and I ) were talking , it was a lot more to do with the regular employees and how we conduct our business , because I was n't there that day . "
" It 's a large office , and there are a lot of people in that office , and they could tell you what they were wearing .
There are a lot of people , like 50 people there . "
So one of the two reasons for NYTimes standing behind their reporting of O'Keefe dressed as a pimp in ACORN offices seems to be completely false , from my reporting .
( The other point you offered , that " O'Keefe is [ seen ] leaving the DC Acorn office " in the publicly released video , where you suggested " you will see his reflection in a plate glass window [ and ] it appears he is wearing the hat that is part of the outfit , and it appears to me that he is wearing other parts of the outfit .
The brim of the hat appears briefly in the frame just seconds later , as the camera is jostled leaving the premises " is an assertion that I spoke to in detail last night as also appearing to be completely incorrect .
That , based on both the frame - by - frame screen - grab analysis of the moment you mention in that video , as well as the other information and evidence I offered to underscore the great likelihood that O'Keefe was not wearing that " outlandish " and " gaudy " guise in the DC office , as reported by the Times .
The paper , of course , has presented zero evidence that he was dressed that way , to my knowledge .
Yet I 'm forced to report on a negative here . )
Moreover , another senior ACORN official ( who has asked not to be named publicly ) was at the NY office that day , and confirms that Speliotis was not in that office that day , and that O'Keefe was not dressed as the pimp character in the office where Rutenberg suggests Speliotis suggested that he was .
Specifically , this ACORN official writes via email today : " [ Speliotis ] did not see them ; I was in the office and did not see the pimp outfit " " Everyone in the office was more focuses [ sic ] on her clothes and those that more directly paid attentuon [ sic ] said what we all knew to be true ... only one was dressed weirdly " I hope to have still more in the future , for publication soon , to underscore the impossible - to - avoid point that the Times simply blew it here .
But again .
It seems remarkable to me , as a journalist , that what 's been shared so far to support the Times repeated reporting on this matter , versus the mountain of material suggesting the complete opposite ( none of which has ever been even mentioned by the Times to my knowledge ! ) would be enough for the Times to go with .
It would n't be enough for me to use to support a story at a blog , much less the " paper of record " in multiple instances on something as key and important as this .
Again I request that you seriously re-review this matter , beginning with Scott Shane 's inaccurate and direct reporting in mid-September , and I hope that you will recommend not only a correction , but : an examination of where the Times fell down here ;
how the most Senior Editor for Standards , " who oversees corrections " at the paper could fail so wildly and so fervently and be so easily duped as to rely on Fox News ' second hand reporting and an accused felon 's failure to correct them ;
how the paper will avoid these sorts of errors in the future ;
a recommendation that the paper publish a story detailing what REALLY happened with those ACORN tapes , how the Times blew it , and what they intend to do to get it right instead in the future .
Best ,
Brad

Clark -
As others are about to jump in on this issue , concerning the misreports by the Times ( and others ) , I wanted to touch base quickly you .
I 've been waiting to post your initial response to my initial query publicly , along with my two responses to it ( which I 'll assume you 've received by now ? ) until you had time to review them , in case you wished to change your initial assessment that you " would not recommend a correction , based on the available evidence " , given the additional evidence I 've now sent you .
Do you intend to respond to those two responses ?
Do n't wish to sandbag you ( or anybody ) , by posting those until and unless you had the opportunity to respond to them .
Please let me know , as folks have been asking if I 've heard back from you , and I have n't wanted to mention anything until you had time to assess the additional evidence I 'd sent you in return .
Best ,

Thanks , Clark .
Just finishing up with 2 hours w/ Breitbart on the air , in which he's now claimed he never said O'Keefe was dressed as a pimp in those offices .
Rather incredible , actually .
( Happy to share the audio if you want it , feel you can stomach it That , despite his own Sep 21 , 2009 Washington Times column after the first tape came out , in which he said : " When filmmaker and provocateur James O'Keefe came to my office to show me the video of him and his friend , Hannah Giles , going to the Baltimore offices of ACORN - the nation 's foremost " community organizers " - dressed as a pimp and a prostitute and asking for - and getting - help for various illegal activities , he sought my advice . "
Baltimore Sun wrote : " A young man and woman , dressed as caricatures of a pimp and prostitute , walk into the Baltimore office of ACORN " Many others as well .
Obviously , that 's the way the story was sold .
To everyone .
NYTimes was not the only one who bought it , because they were purposely hoodwinked by O'Keefe .
Not trying to suggest Times did anything nefarious , as I previously noted .
Just that they were wrong , got suckered , and owe a correction and explanation to the American people .
I thought that would have happened once the matter was pointed out to Greg Brock , and was taken aback that , instead , he tried to justify it with Fox News & O'Keefe : " We believe him . "
Etc. I will look forward to your thoughts .
And will hold release of any of our emails until after you get that chance to reply .

Today 's column by Eric Boehlert at Media Matters details not only the Times coverage , and their refusal to correct and reasons for that refusal , but also quotes one media outlet after another who took the same bait following O'Keefe 's media appearances as the " pimp " on Fox , and Breitbart 's own Sept 21 , 2009 Washington Times column which made the same , spectactular , though inaccurate claim :
" James O'Keefe and the myth of the ACORN pimp "

Subject : Full Response from Clark Hoyt Public / NYT / NYTIMES [ mailto:public@nytimes.com ]
Thursday , February 18 , 2010 4:32 PMBrad FriedmanFull Response from Clark Hoyt Dear Brad , Sorry to be so long getting back to you with a full response .
As I mentioned , after your detailed reply , I asked my assistant , Michael McElroy , to look at all the available ACORN videos , which he has done .
I looked at them quite a long time ago , before this question of dress arose , and I decided it would be good to get a fresh pair of eyes on the case .
Michael said there is no video that clearly shows James O'Keefe in his pimp garb inside an ACORN office .
In most of them , as you know , you do n't see him in the office at all , presumably because he 's the one with the hidden camera .
Michael found at least one video showing O'Keefe entering an office in a button - down shirt .
He does not think that the reflection in the window that I pointed out to you shows O'Keefe in his pimp costume .
I 'm prepared to accept that judgment , because I found it hard to tell what is in that reflection .
Unless something more surfaces , I do n't see visual evidence to support O'Keefe 's claim to Fox News about what he wore .
At the same time , I do n't find the report commissioned by ACORN to be conclusive in the other direction .
The report acknowledges that it relied on " hearsay " evidence , because the investigators did not interview the employees caught on O'Keefe 's hidden camera .
Under the circumstances , I am recommending to Times editors that they avoid language that says or suggests that O'Keefe was dressed as a pimp when he captured the ACORN employees on camera .
I still do n't see that a correction is in order , because that would require conclusive evidence that The Times was wrong , which I have n't seen .
The Times could seek out all the employees , but I do n't think that 's a realistic prospect worth the investment of effort .
That 's especially true because , at the end of the day , whatever O'Keefe wore , he clearly presented himself to the ACORN employees in a pimp relationship with Hannah Giles .
Unless you are prepared to contend that all of his comments captured on the tapes were dubbed in later , I think you have to acknowledge that he and the employees were talking about hiding money from prostitution , smuggling in under - age girls from abroad and even financing a political campaign with her earnings .
The notion that the ACORN workers were somehow hoodwinked into believing that he was a college student trying to save his girlfriend from a life of prostitution --- and that they were reacting out of sympathy --- strikes me as a literally incredible effort to rewrite the obvious record .
What O'Keefe did was journalistically unethical , in my view , and perhaps even illegal in at least one state .
But what his camera captured caused even ACORN to fire and discipline some of its employees .
I hope this is helpful , Best , Clark

Subject : RE : Full Response from Clark Hoyt Brad FriedmanThursday , February 18 , 2010 11:16 PM ' Public / NYT / NYTIMES'RE : Full Response from Clark Hoyt Clark -
Thank you for the full reply .
I cannot tell from the response whether you actually read all of mine , or your assistant Michael did , but I presented a good deal of additional evidence to show that , in fact , O'Keefe was NOT wearing his pimp outfit in the offices claimed by the New York Times incorrectly on numerous occasions , including in the two different Scott Shane articles I previously quoted to you .
When Shane described O'Keefe as having " visited Acorn offices in Baltimore , Washington , Brooklyn and San Bernardino , Calif . … dressed so outlandishly that he might have been playing in a risque high school play . " ( 9/15/10 ) and then as in " the gaudy guise of pimp and prostitute through various offices of Acorn " ( 9/18/09 ) , the paper was simply , and indisputably wrong .
In a very best case scenario , the paper had absolutely no actual evidence to support those contentions at the time they made them .
And yet , on 9/17/09 , just after Shane 's first article in the New York Times , both the House and Senate began legislation that would be passed and signed by the President of the United State to deprive ACORN of millions of dollars used to help the poorest among us .
The Times has never corrected the error or noted that they had no evidence for the claim , even now , six months later .
Yet , you chided the paper , in your own column , for being " slow off the mark " for having waited " nearly a week after the first video was posted " for not covering the story quickly enough .
A special editor was then even assigned , based on your recommendations , to devote attention to " issues that are dominating Fox News and talk radio " thereafter .
And yet , six months later , and despite all the available evidence showing the Times was simply out - and - out wrong , and the U.S. Congress and President of the United States having acted following the incorrect coverage , and after the Times Senior Editor for Standards ( ! ) could source only Fox News and O'Keefe himself along with other non-existent " evidence " to support their reporting , all of which I directly and specifically refuted to you , with actual reporting , you " still do n't see that a correction is in order " .
You 'll pardon me , but that is extraordinary .
You go on to write that Harshbarger 's report " relied on ' hearsay ' " evidence , which is true because both O'Keefe and Giles refused to be interviewed or to supply the unedited video for some reason ( which O'Keefe and Breitbart still refuse to release today for some reason ) , and because the ACORN employees in question had understandable legal concerns .
Nonetheless , the New York Times failed to even report on the report itself , either when it was released , or even by mentioning it in subsequent reports on the O'Keefe " pimp " story in multiple stories that followed its release .
You write : " I still do n't see that a correction is in order , because that would require conclusive evidence that The Times was wrong , which I have n't seen . "
So if I understand this correctly :
No evidence , none , zero exists to show that the Times was correct in their multiple reports of O'Keefe dressed as a pimp , but " conclusive evidence " is required to show the reports were wrong ?!
That , even though conclusive evidence has been given to you to show that there is NO evidence that he was dressed that way , other than his own agreement with a Fox News anchor on TV ?!
With all due respect , I continue to be gobsmacked here .
You wrote : " The Times could seek out all the employees , but I do n't think that 's a realistic prospect worth the investment of effort . "
Yes , the Times could and the Times should .
We are talking about a total of four offices , since , in the case of Shane 's first inaccurate report , there were only tapes from four offices released ( Baltimore , D.C. , NY and San Bernardino , CA ) before he described O'Keefe as being " dressed so outlandishly that he might have been playing in a risque high school play " and before Congress voted to defund the organization of millions of dollars .
I have already given you the testimony of two such employees from the New York office in my previous email .
That leaves employees from just three offices for the Times reporters seek out , in order to confirm what the video tape evidence says , what the former MA Attorney General says , what ACORN themselves say as based on their interviews with their own employees --- and what you admit in your own responses to be what all indications show .
Given that the Times ' incorrect by - all - assessments reports have undoubtedly helped in the loss of millions of dollars to a community group often serves as the only ones willing to help the least fortunate citizens in this country , with some of the most basic needs , I believe it is well " worth the investment of efforts " to set the story straight , especially for those who have had to pay a serious price following the Times inaccurate reports .
I am happy to make those contacts and report them to you myself , But it would certainly be more credible if your own reporters did so first hand --- since they were the ones who reported the unsubstantiated claims --- and then reported back to the readers on what they found .
I am confident in what they will learn after a few phone calls .
" Conclusive evidence " that their reports were wrong .
But if my making those calls is the only option , I 'd hope that if I give you direct quotes from the other three offices , with names to go with them , that you would THEN recommend a correction , retraction , apologies , investigation and explanation for all of this very serious case of " journalistic malpractice " as James O'Keefe himself likes to describe it .
As to your contentions concerning what you believe the highly - doctored and heavily - overdubbed videos show , it seems clear that you have n't bothered to read any of the actual text transcripts that were released with them .
While we can't know if the text transcripts O'Keefe released were accurate , since he refuses to release the audio tape , what they do show is a starkly different picture than what is on the video tapes .
If you have any doubt , I suggest you actually read them .
Your contentions are clearly ( and understandably ) biased by the videos which offer a very different picture from what actually happened in those offices , according to the transcripts .
I 'll not continue this already long email by detailing specifics of how , except to say that , contrary to what I read as your impressions , in every office the workers advised the pair that they must legally pay their taxes ( not hide the income as you suggest ) , no matter where it comes from .
In every office the workers were told a house was needed to escape an abusive pimp who had been abusing and stalking the girl .
In each and every office , workers , in various ways , advised the girl ( and O'Keefe , her " boyfriend " trying to help her escape ) to rethink what they were doing , and frequently offered her help , women 's shelters etc .
But none of that makes any difference whatsoever here when it comes to the New York Times reporting the story accurately as it is " fit to print " .
I appreciate that you may not care for ACORN , for whatever reason , and you may even be offended by what the doctored - videos appear to show about the low - level employees ( no supervisors nor senior staffers ) who violated ACORN 's written protocols in various instances , and were fired immediately for having done so .
But your paper 's failure to follow appropriate journalistic protocols for vetting information before reporting it , and then failing to correct it when all evidence shows that it was blatantly wrong --- where no evidence , none , exists to show that they were correct --- is a sorry state for the " paper of record " to be in .
Whatever the employees of ACORN did or did n't do , does not exonerate the New York Times for having reported the story inaccurately , time and time again .
It seems as if your view of this matter has been to go about finding ways to not recommend transparent , corrective action for the paper , rather than do what is obviously appropriate here .
That is a tremendous disappointment , to say the least , and one that , again , I hope you will take the time consider carefully .
With all due respect here , Clark , you and Greg Brock are just dead wrong .
I 've shown you as much over and again .
In the bargain , I 'd suggest the damage done , to ACORN --- to the hundreds of thousands of families they serve --- and to the journalistic profession itself are , indeed , well " worth the investment of effort " that would be required to undo .
I believe any honest , sober assessment of the facts --- including the evidence I 've sent you already , and more that I can keep sending --- bears that out .

Clark -
Following up on last night 's note , I hope Hannah Giles comments today at CPAC , as reported by David Weigel finally meet the " conclusive evidence " bar to prove that the NYTimes was repeatedly wrong , even as there seems to be no bar whatsoever , to follow your logic , for evidence needed to prove that they were right .
Weigel at Washington Independent today : I asked Giles about a criticism that 's often been leveled against them - that they hyped up the video by wearing outrageous clothes in promotional materials and the videos ' introductions that they did n't wear in the actual stings .
" We never claimed that he went in with a pimp costume , " said Giles .
" That was b-roll .
It was purely b-roll .
He was a pimp , I was a prostitute , and we were walking in front of government buildings to show how the government was whoring out the American people . "

A sarcastic , but yet another confirm that Breitbart and O'Keefe lied , and the NYTimes was fooled by it .
This time from Breitbart himself now that Giles has given him no choice :
The liberal news watchdog group [ Media Matters ] has been demanding retractions from anyone who reported that James O'Keefe and Hannah Giles wore outlandish outfits inside of ACORN offices .
They dressed more demurely during the sting than in b-roll and publicity shots which , Giles told me , were meant to illustrate how the government was whoring out the American people .
After Giles introduced Breitbart ( " my boss " ) , the founder of Big Government , he aimed and fired at the people who'd been trying to knock down his story with that argument .
" I have to apologize to the nation because the pimp in the pimp and prostitute video apparently was n't dressed like a flamboyant pimp , " said Breitbart , his voice dripping with sarcasm .
" I 'm so sorry to this nation .
I do n't know what to say . "

Do you intend to revisit your previous assessments at this point concerning retractions , corrections and investigations by the Times as to how they got this story so terribly wrong , and at such a costly price to so many ?

Have been holding off posting your emails , still , in hopes that you 'd re-consider your previous positions , particularly in light of the Breitbart --- and now Hannah Giles confirmation ( this time on video ) --- that O'Keefe never wore his pimp costume into ACORN offices , where he instead represented himself as a conservatively dressed college student trying to save her from an evil pimp .
All in direct contradiction to multiple reporting by the NYTimes .

Scientists from Cambridge , London and Melbourne have found the first ever evidence that tyrannosaur dinosaurs existed in the southern continents .
They identified a hip bone found at Dinosaur Cove in Victoria , Australia as belonging to an ancestor of Tyrannosaurus rex .
The find sheds new light on the evolutionary history of this group of dinosaurs .
It also raises the crucial question of why it was only in the north that tyrannosaurs evolved into the giant predators like T. rex .
The 30 cm - long pubis bone from Dinosaur Cove looks like a rod with two expanded ends , one of which is flattened and connects to the hip and the other looks like a ' boot ' .
According to Dr Roger Benson of the Department of Earth Sciences at the University of Cambridge , who identified the find : " The bone is unambiguously identifiable as a tyrannosaur because these dinosaurs have very distinctive hip bones . "
The discovery lays to rest the belief held by some scientists that tyrannosaurs never made it to the southern continents .
" This is an exciting discovery because tyrannosaur fossils had only ever been found in the northern hemisphere before and some scientists thought tyrannosaurs never made it down south .
advertisement
" Although we only have one bone , it shows that 110 million years ago small tyrannosaurs like ours might have been found worldwide .
This find has major significance for our knowledge of how this group of dinosaurs evolved . " says Dr Benson .
Dr Paul Barrett , Palaeontologist at the Natural History Museum , London and member of the research team commented : " The absence of tyrannosauroids from the southern continents was becoming more and more anomalous as representatives of other ' northern ' dinosaur groups started to show up in the south .
This find shows that tyrannosauroids were able to reach these areas early in their evolutionary history and also hints at the possibility that others remain to be discovered in Africa , South America and India . "
The bone would have come from an animal about three metres long and weighing around 80 kg , similar to a human , and would have had the large head and small arms that make tyrannosaurs so distinctive .
The newly identified dinosaur , known as NMV P186069 , was much smaller than T. rex , which was 12 metres long and weighed around four tonnes .
Giant size like this only evolved late in the tyrannosaur lineage .
Compared with T. rex , which lived about 70 million years ago at the end of Cretaceous period , NMV P186069 lived earlier during the Cretaceous , around 110 million years ago .

During the time of the dinosaurs the continents gradually went from a single supercontinent towards something like their present - day arrangement .
This tyrannosaur is from the mid-stages of this continental break - up , when the southern continents of South America , Antarctica , Africa and Australia had separated from the northern continents , but had not separated from each other .
While answering the question of whether or not tyrannosaurs lived in both the southern and northern hemispheres , the new find leaves another , deeper mystery : why did tyrannosaurs evolve into giant predators such as T. rex only in the northern hemisphere ?
According to Dr Benson : " It is difficult to explain why different groups succeeded in the north and the south if they originally existed in both places .
What we need to know now is just how diverse the early radiation of tyrannosaurs was , why they went extinct , leaving only giant - sized , short - armed species like T. rex , and how successful they might have been in the southern hemisphere .
We can only answer these questions with new discoveries . "
About the excavation : Dinosaur Cove is in south - east Australia , where the Otway ranges meet the sea to the west of Cape Otway , along the Great Ocean road .
The fossil - bearing rock layers consist of sand - , silt - and mudstones around 106 million years old .
The site was excavated during the 1980s and 1990s .
Work at the site was challenging : access involved either climbing down dangerous cliffs or landing a boat or helicopter on rock platforms at low tide , and the hardness of the rock meant heavy mining equipment and dynamite was required to uncover the fossil - bearing rock layers .
Swedish mining company Atlas Copco donated some of the equipment used and the excavation was funded by the National Geographic Society .
China 's Ambassador to the United Nations Zhang Yesui declared last week that it is " too early " for new sanctions on Iran .
As China takes over the rotating presidency of the Security Council , the Obama Administration should consider why , exactly , Beijing is so reluctant to punish Tehran 's refusal to make a deal over its nuclear program .
The usual answer is that China has large commercial interests in Iran , particularly in energy , and would be reluctant to impose sanctions that would put them at risk ....

A new study from researchers in the Netherlands demonstrates that wetlands can be constructed in strategic locations to clean up rivers while producing enough biomass to serve as a clean energy source .
In the Netherlands , like much of the world , surface runoff , particularly from agriculture , has polluted rivers with nutrients .
To address this issue , Bastiaan Meerburg and fellow researchers planted a field with the marsh plant common reed , Phragmites australis , and then redirected a near - by nutrient rich stream into the newly constructed wetland .
The water was held in the wetland for a period of time before being released back into the stream .
Common reed is able to grow in the water and absorb nutrients which are removed from the system as the plant is harvested .
The researchers measured water quality at both the intake and outtake of the wetland and found that as much as 47 % of the nitrogen and 45 % of the phosphorus was removed .
They discovered that higher nutrient loads resulted in higher levels of removal .
The constructed wetland was also highly productive .
After only one year of growth post - establishment 221 g/m2 biomass had accumulated and after two years , the amount increased to 903 g/ m2 .
These findings show that constructed wetlands can provide a useful tool to prevent eutrophication in surface waters while generating a potentially valuable crop for farmers .
However , the researchers also caution that “ choosing the moment of harvesting may have important consequences for the soil - plant - microbe system , especially on aspects as nutrient - removal , methane emission , filter regeneration and biomass production , ” although this was not examined in the study .
The researchers were able to determine that the amount of time the water remained in the system ( residence time ) affected the degree of sanitation efficiency .
The study provides additional empirical evidence that multifunctional wetland systems can be constructed to provide multiple benefits to society .
In addition to nutrient retention and biomass production , the constructed wetlands in the study provided flood protection by storing water .
With sea level rise from climate change , flood management is predicted to become increasingly important , particularly in the Netherlands where over half of its land already sits at an elevation below sea level . ﻿

Matthew Bristow spent two years documenting the cocaine industry in Colombia .
In the first of three films , he meets the farmers guardian .
co.uk
Up close , erythroxylum coca looks almost pretty – a plant with curving branches , green leaves and small yellow flowers that mature into red berries .
It has been cultivated on the slopes of the Andes since before the Incas , and invested with divine properties .
When chewed , its leaves act as a mild stimulant and help overcome hunger , thirst and fatigue .
But these virtues do not alter the fact that having an ideal climate and terrain for coca – the raw ingredient of cocaine – has been a catastrophe for Colombia .
The crop has wrought violence , narco - trafficking and corruption .
Divine or otherwise , coca has proved resilient , verging on indestructible , in withstanding the decades - old " war on drugs " declared by Richard Nixon and prosecuted by successive US presidents .
Military helicopters continue to scythe over treetops in the Colombian jungle and hundreds of millions of dollars are still poured into the fight – but there is a growing conviction that it can not be won .
It may evolve and change shape , move from jungles to cities and from bloody battles to discreet bribes , but it will not end with a flag planted in the ground and victory declared .
An individual coca bush is fragile , but the forces behind it are powerful and adaptable : peasant farmers who turn the leaves into paste , clandestine laboratories which turn it into powder , guerrillas and armed gangs who traffic it abroad , middle men and state authorities who launder the revenue .
Each link in the chain has a strong incentive .
A peasant in certain remote parts of Colombia has a choice : grow corn , rice , potatoes and vegetables for prices that fluctuate and sometimes barely make it worthwhile , or grow coca , safe in the knowledge of a handsome return .
Colombia 's US - backed eradication effort includes satellites and fumigation - spraying aircraft , but growers have adapted with more resistant strains and smaller plots hidden under taller plants .
Government inducements to wean peasants off coca with loans and alternative economic activities have faltered .
" Government policies related to zero coca , and strict verification procedures , take a long time and limit the state 's ability to work with communities in transitioning from a coca economy to a legal economy , " a recent US Agency for International Development ( USAID ) report said .
" When security and coca eradication are not synchronised with the arrival of socio- economic projects , the mood of a community can quickly become hostile . "
A new book , Shooting Up : Counter - insurgency and the War on Drugs , by the respected Brookings Institution scholar Vanda Felbab - Brown , says eradication campaigns in Afghanistan and Colombia have left drug production unaffected but alienated locals , gifting political capital to insurgents .
Plan Colombia , the military - heavy US aid programme , has had significant success in helping the country 's security forces push Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia ( Farc ) guerrillas out of cities and deep into the jungle .
A country that once risked collapsing into chaos now has political stability , a growing economy and a popular president , Alvaro Uribe .
But Farc and a smaller leftist rebel group , the ELN , have adapted to their restricted theatre of operations and continued trafficking cocaine , which remains their main income source .
In recent months , Farc has made a military comeback , ambushing troops and kidnapping and killing a provincial governor .
Analysts think the pendulum could be swinging back their way .
" The Farc seem to be bouncing back , " Leon Valencia , the director of the Nuevo Arco Iris ( New Rainbow ) thinktank , said .
" The decline of the democratic security policy has begun . "
Rightwing paramilitary groups also remain in the game .
Originally set up by ranchers in the 1980s to combat leftist guerrillas , the paramilitaries mutated into narco - trafficking private armies .
They controlled swaths of territory and co-opted businesses and politicians until a government scheme from 2005 demobilised 32,000 .
Many leaders were extradited to the US , but many lower - ranking " paras " who failed to find jobs or promised state assistance have returned to what they know best – trafficking drugs .
" According to the government , the [ demobilisation ] process was successful .
However , shortly after the demobilisation process , new successor groups emerged in the entire country that continued the criminal activities , " Jose Miguel Vivanco , the Americas director for Human Rights Watch , said .
A recently - published report by the organisation – Paramilitaries '
Heirs : The New Face of Violence in Colombia – makes grim reading .
The city of Medellin , once the showcase of Colombia 's counter - narcotics fight , illustrates the intractability of the problem .
A steep fall in violence paved the way for an apparent urban renaissance , but murder rates rose again last year as drug gangs battled for control .
Prominent local figures , with government backing , are now trying to negotiate a truce .
That has raised suspicion of a return to the era of discreet pacts , when officials gave cartels free rein to traffick cocaine in return for social peace .
With victory in the so - called drug war ever more elusive , there are growing calls around the world – from thinktanks , law enforcement officials and former presidents – to decriminalise cocaine .
Just as the end of prohibition doomed the bootleggers , the logic goes , decriminalisation could put traffickers out of business .
It is an experiment no government has yet dared to try .
He is in many ways the mirror image of his Democratic counterpart , Mr. Reid .
Both are experts at the inside game who struggle with the burden of trying to control a political caucus at a time when legislative leaders no longer have the brute power they once had and senators are hailed for acting like mavericks .

In meetings with his caucus , Senator Mitch McConnell urged members to continue to play “ team ball ” — with the team being the Republican Party .
Credit ... Stephen Crowley / The New York Times
“ Mitch tends to play things close to the vest , ” said Senator John Cornyn , Republican of Texas .
The extent of Republican unity to date is attributable to some degree to Democratic missteps , as well as to the rise of the Tea Party movement , which has exerted tremendous pressure on Republicans not to do anything that might give comfort to the president and his party .
But it is also testimony to how Mr. McConnell has been able to draw on 25 years of Congressional savvy to display a mastery of legislative maneuvering .
Mr. McConnell rejected the criticism that his approach is all about scoring political points by denying Mr. Obama any victories .
His opposition , he said , is rooted in a principled belief that Mr. Obama is pushing the nation in the wrong direction .
Building a Strategy
“ To the extent that they want to do things that we think are in the political center and would be helpful to the country , we ’ll be helpful , ” Mr. McConnell said of the Democrats .
“ To the extent they are trying to turn us into a Western European country , we are not going to be helpful . ”
He consistently told fellow Republicans they needed to win back independent voters and lapsed Republicans who , he said , have shifted only temporarily to the Democratic camp .
To win them over , he suggested , Republicans should emphasize issues that resonated with them at a time of insecurity , including government spending , debt , government bailouts and terrorism .
The question now is how much of an enduring gain Republicans might get from Mr. McConnell ’s blocking strategy .
For all his efforts , Democrats could very well pass a health care overhaul in the next week .
While he has drawn sharp ideological contrasts that have rallied conservatives after their Congressional defeats in 2006 and 2008 , Mr. McConnell is a long way from capturing control of the Senate in November .

WASHINGTON  A comprehensive new study on foreign militaries that have made transitions to allowing openly gay service members concludes that a speedy implementation of the change is not disruptive .
The finding is in direct opposition to the stated views of Pentagon leaders , who say repealing a ban on openly gay men and women in the United States armed forces should take a year or more .
The study , “ Gays in Foreign Militaries 2010 : A Global Primer , ” is to be released Tuesday by the Palm Center , a research group at the University of California , Santa Barbara .
The Palm Center has no official position on “ do n’t ask , do n’t tell , ” the American law that bans openly gay service members , but the group has become a leading force among advocates for repeal .
The principal author of the study is Nathaniel Frank , who also wrote the book “ Unfriendly Fire : How the Gay Ban Undermines the Military and Weakens America . ”
The 151 - page study , which updates existing studies on gay service members in Britain , Canada , Australia , South Africa and other countries , offers the first broad look at the issue in foreign militaries since Defense Secretary Robert M. Gates and Adm .
Mike Mullen , the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff , called for an end to “ do n’t ask , do n’t tell ” earlier this month .
An adult male German shepherd mix was tied to a car and then dragged 3 miles to its death early Wednesday morning at the Colorado National Monument near Grand Junction .
“ This was an incredible act of cruelty done to a defenseless animal , ” Joan Anzelmo , superintendent of the monument , told The Denver Post .
Anzelmo said Wednesday night that , thanks to tips , authorities have focused on a specific suspect and hoped to have him in custody soon .
She said that , based on information they have received , officials believe the dog had been stolen .
Anzelmo said tracks left in the snow clearly show how the crime was committed :
The dog initially walked , then ran and eventually was dragged when it could n’t keep up with the vehicle .
It was finally dumped after it died from the dragging .
She said the German shepherd mix was forced to run up one of the steepest hills at the monument .
During the 3 miles , the dog had to run on about 2 inches of snow , around multiple switchbacks and sharp curves that gained more than 1,000 feet in elevation before the animal collapsed and died .
The dog was found by the chief of maintenance of the monument about 4:30 a.m. , with a silver and blue synthetic rope around its neck .
Anzelmo said the employee was very upset .
The superintendent said there is quite a bit of evidence , including the tire tracks of the vehicle .
Investigators think the incident occurred between 2 and 4 a.m .
Anzelmo said she was optimistic the culprit would be arrested .
She said there is no chance the dragging was unintentional .
Marylou Randour , a staff psychologist for the Humane Society of the United States , said the person or persons who committed the act is a psychopath .
“ He is someone who has no compassion or empathy for any living creatures , ” Randour said .
Randour added that the individual is extremely dangerous and a threat to human beings as well as animals .
“ He may not have been angry at all , ” she said of the individual .
“ He may have done it for kicks — to torture an animal in an elaborate and detailed way . ”
Randour , who has studied animal abusers for years , said a recent study of 43,000 people found that those with drug problems and mental - health problems are most likely to engage in animal cruelty .
A state appeals court says a 15 - year - old boy whose Web site was flooded with anti-gay slurs and threats can sue a schoolmate who admitted posting a menacing message but described it as a joke .
In a 2 - 1 ruling Monday , the Second District Court of Appeal in Los Angeles said the violent language of the message - threatening to " rip out your ... heart and feed it to you " and to " pound your head in with an ice pick " - conveyed a harmful intent that is not protected by the right of free speech .
The dissenting justice , Frances Rothschild , said no one who read all the messages posted on the Web site - in which youths tried to outdo the others in outrageous insults - would interpret any of them as a serious threat .
The case is one of the first in California to examine the boundaries between free expression and so - called cyber - bullying .
The court majority said a message that threatens physical harm , even if it was n't meant to be serious , loses its First Amendment protection and can be grounds for a lawsuit .
The plaintiff , identified only as D.C. , set up a Web site in 2005 to promote an entertainment career after recording an album and starring in a film .
Believing - wrongly , the court said - that he was gay , some fellow students at a Los Angeles high school posted comments that mocked him , feigned sexual interest or threatened violence .
The boy 's father said he withdrew D.C. from the school , at the suggestion of Los Angeles police , and moved the family to an undisclosed spot in Northern California .
D.C. sued six students and their parents , claiming hate crimes , defamation and intentional infliction of emotional distress .
The ruling involved a claim by one defendant , a 16 - year - old identified as R.R. , that the suit interfered with his freedom of speech .
In a court filing , R.R. said he did n't know D.C. personally but was offended by the Web site 's self - promotional tone and " decided to add my own message to the Internet graffiti contest , " posing as a parent who was so offended by D.C. 's singing that he wanted to kill him .
He later wrote a letter of apology to D.C. and his family .
State law allows a defendant to win early dismissal of a suit that chills free speech on a subject of public interest and has little chance of success .
The court majority said the law did n't apply to D.C. 's suit because R.R. 's message contained threats and was unrelated to any issues of public interest .
Rex Beaber , lawyer for R.R. and his parents , said Tuesday that he would appeal to the state Supreme Court .
No reasonable person could have interpreted the message as a serious threat , he said , and the ruling " undermines the First Amendment protection for unpopular speech . "
OBJECTIVE :
The authors conducted a meta- analysis of published randomized , controlled medication trials in children and adolescents with obsessive - compulsive disorder ( OCD ) to assess evidence for differential efficacy based on type of drug , study design , and outcome measure .
METHOD : A systematic literature search was performed for articles pertaining to the pharmacological treatment of pediatric and / or adolescent OCD .
All baseline , posttreatment , and change scores with standard deviations reported in each study were included in the analyses .
Effect sizes for dependent measures were expressed as standardized mean differences .
The analysis included data on efficacy for four selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors ( SSRIs ) ( paroxetine , fluoxetine , fluvoxamine , and sertraline ) and clomipramine , four study designs , four dependent outcome measures , and two types of outcome scores ( change and posttreatment scores ) .
Multivariate regression was performed to assess the degree to which the effect sizes varied with the methodological features of each study .
RESULTS : Twelve studies with a total of 1,044 participants met all inclusion criteria for the analysis .
The pooled standardized mean difference for the results of all studies was 0.46 and showed a highly significant difference between drug and placebo treatment .
Only one of the four outcome measures evaluated was not sensitive to change with treatment .
A multivariate regression analysis of drug effect with other variables controlled showed that clomipramine was significantly superior to each of the SSRIs but that the SSRIs were comparably effective .
CONCLUSIONS : Although highly significant , the overall effect sizes for medication were modest .
Similarities and differences between the variables studied that emerged in the meta - analysis may have implications for both clinical care and future research .
The past decade has seen rapid advances in our knowledge of the pharmacotherapy of obsessive - compulsive disorder ( OCD ) affecting children and adolescents .
Intramural studies from the National Institute of Mental Health ( NIMH ) demonstrating the efficacy of clomipramine first appeared in the mid-1980s , although clomipramine , the first agent approved for use in pediatric populations with OCD , did not gain the approval of the U.S. Food and Drug Administration ( FDA ) until 1989 .
Subsequent multisite randomized , placebo - controlled trials , many of which were industry sponsored , have also demonstrated significant efficacy in pediatric populations of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors ( SSRIs ) , including sertraline ( 1 ) , fluvoxamine ( 2 ) , fluoxetine ( 3 ) , and paroxetine ( 4 ) .
These studies represented a major advance in the management of pediatric OCD and usefully informed clinicians who treat affected children .
However , to our knowledge , no comparative treatment studies have been performed , and there is little to guide clinicians in their choices between therapeutic agents .
The conventional wisdom that all serotonin reuptake inhibitors ( including clomipramine ) are more or less comparably effective for children with OCD has not been investigated .
Evidence of differential efficacy could , however , have important implications for patient care or for a potential commercial advantage for a drug manufacturer .
In fact , evidence from several meta-analytic reviews of randomized , controlled trials of treatment for OCD in adults has suggested that , in placebo - controlled trials , clomipramine appears to be more effective than drugs with more selective serotonin uptake inhibition ( 5 , 6 ) .
Since children generally have a response to antiobsessional treatments similar to that of adults , it is possible that the findings of the superiority of clomipramine will also hold true in pediatric samples with OCD .
While the randomized , controlled trial has been considered the gold standard for evaluating the effects of medical interventions for decades , its significance relies on numerous factors ( such as power , magnitude of observed differences , reliability of diagnosis and assessment , variability of outcome , study design , and participant inclusion and exclusion criteria , to name a few ) ( 6 , 7 ) .
For example , some , but not all , psychometric measures of OCD severity have shown response to change with treatment in children ( 8–10 ) .
In the literature on OCD in children , both the number of randomized , controlled trials and the number of study participants do not approach those in the adult OCD literature , perhaps due to the special considerations of conducting trials involving minors ( 11 , 12 ) .
Underscoring this difference , the FDA requires evidence of efficacy in at least two double - blind , placebo - controlled studies to consider approval of a novel antidepressant in adults but has required only one well - conducted multisite trial demonstrating efficacy for the three agents with a current FDA indication for pediatric OCD : sertraline ( 1 ) , fluvoxamine ( 2 ) , and fluoxetine ( 3 ) .
Despite this limitation , the cumulative data accrued from randomized , controlled trials of pediatric OCD over the last 10 years , which have involved more than 1,000 youths , are now sufficient to examine the overall effect of medication treatment in this population .
Quantitative meta- analysis provides a method for examining pooled effects of several studies .
In this method , the result of any one randomized , controlled trial is a single data point in a population of study results .
We conducted a meta- analysis to determine the pooled effect size of medication treatment versus placebo , as reported in the extant pediatric OCD literature , while examining for heterogeneity of studies and publication bias .
In addition , we compared study designs , sensitivity of dependent measures , and data for individual drugs for significant differences .
We hypothesized that clomipramine might show superiority over the SSRIs for treatment of pediatric OCD .
To our knowledge , this is the first meta - analysis undertaken for treatment studies of OCD or of SSRIs in pediatric subjects .
Method
A systematic literature review was performed for articles pertaining to the pharmacological treatment of pediatric and / or adolescent OCD .
Eligible studies were identified through a search of journal abstracts in the MEDLINE and PsycINFO databases from the year 1900 to the present .
Search terms included “ obsessive compulsive disorder , ” “ clinical trial , ” and “ randomized controlled trial . ”
The search was limited to English - language articles describing studies with human subjects in child and adolescent age ranges .
In addition , citations from all identified articles were individually searched in iterative fashion for any relevant studies .
Studies were excluded on the basis of being open - label ( three studies of fluoxetine , one study of fluvoxamine , one study of paroxetine , and one study of citalopram ) or retrospective ( one study of fluoxetine ) .
To be included in this meta - analysis , studies had to be 1 ) randomized , 2 ) double - blind , 3 ) placebo - or active - comparator - controlled , and 4 ) limited to pediatric trials ( subjects were age 19 years or younger ) .
The results from one double - blind study ( 13 ) had been previously reported by Riddle et al. ( 10 ) and were excluded .
We also excluded the study by Kurlan et al. ( 14 ) , a randomized , controlled trial of fluoxetine for obsessive - compulsive symptoms in 11 boys with Tourette ’s disorder because the study included an unknown number of subjects who did not meet the full DSM criteria for OCD .
The results of a recent large multisite study of paroxetine for treatment of pediatric OCD , which have been published in abstract form in the proceedings from the 2002 annual meeting of the American Psychiatric Association ( 4 ) ( full manuscript in preparation ) , were included .
For each study all dependent outcome measures reported were treated as a separate data point for entry into the analysis , with several studies providing data on more than one measure , to permit comparison between measures as well as between drugs in this population .
Outcome measures included the Children ’s Yale - Brown Obsessive Compulsive Scale ( 8 ) , the NIMH Global OCD Scale ( 15 ) , the Clinical Global Impression ( CGI ) of severity of illness ( 16 ) , and the Leyton Obsessional Inventory — Child Version ( 17 ) .
All baseline , posttreatment , and change scores with standard deviations reported in each study were included in our analyses .
Scores and standard deviations from the multisite clomipramine study ( 18 ) were supplied by Richard Katz of the neuroscience department at Novartis Pharmaceuticals Corporation .
In some studies , standard deviations for mean change scores were not reported , and in these cases we used posttreatment scores in our analyses after determining that baseline scores were not significantly different between groups .
Statistical Analyses
Effect sizes for each dependent measure in each study were expressed as standardized mean differences and 95 % confidence intervals ( CIs ) , and a pooled standardized mean difference was thus calculated for the results of all studies .
The standardized mean difference is computed by taking the mean of the active drug group minus the mean of the placebo group and dividing the result by the pooled standard deviation of the groups .
Studies were weighted according to the number of participants .
The meta - analysis used the random effects model of DerSimonian and Laird ( 19 ) .
To determine if the results of the meta - analysis were unduly influenced by any one study , we conducted a sensitivity analysis by recomputing the pooled standardized mean difference after deleting each study one at a time .
We also evaluated whether these studies might be nonrepresentative of the universe of possible studies , for example , as a result of failure to publish studies that produce negative results ( “ publication bias ” ) .
To address this possibility , we used the method of Egger et al. ( 20 ) , in which the standard normal deviate of the standardized mean difference is regressed on the “ precision of the standardized mean difference , ” defined as the inverse of the standard error of the standardized mean difference .
Since precision of the standardized mean difference increases with sample size , the regression of the standard normal deviate on the precision of the standardized mean difference should have a positive slope and should run through the origin in the absence of bias ( i.e. , small samples with low precision have large standard errors and small standard normal deviates , whereas large samples with high precision have small standard errors and large standard normal deviates ) .
In the presence of bias , the intercept of the regression ( a ) will be significantly greater than zero , as determined by the t test .
To assess the robustness of our meta - analysis , given the possibility of publication bias , we computed the fail - safe N , which is the number of studies with negative findings that would need to be combined with the studies reviewed to lead to a nonsignificant result .
The larger the fail - safe N , the less likely it is that unpublished studies or future studies would overturn our result ( 21 ) .
Our meta - analysis used multiple regression to assess the degree to which the effect sizes varied with the methodological features of each study .
Four covariates were used in this regression model : 1 ) type of dependent outcome measure , 2 ) type of drug , 3 ) type of study design , and 4 ) type of outcome score ( change or posttreatment score ) .
Where significant differences emerged in the omnibus analysis , pairwise comparisons were undertaken with other significant variables controlled .
Results
Twelve studies that included 1,044 participants met all inclusion criteria and were analyzed ( 1 –4 , 9 , 10 , 18 , 22 –26 ) .
Represented in the studies are four SSRIs ( paroxetine , fluoxetine , fluvoxamine , and sertraline ) and clomipramine ; four study designs ( parallel , withdrawal , substitution , and crossover ) ; four dependent outcome measures ( Children ’s Yale - Brown Obsessive Compulsive Scale , NIMH Global OCD Scale , CGI of severity , and Leyton Obsessional Inventory — Child Version ) ; and two types of outcome scores ( change and posttreatment ) .
Study characteristics are shown in Table 1 .
The findings from the individual studies that constitute the raw data for our analyses are shown in Table 2 .
The pooled standardized mean difference across all observations was 0.46 ( 95 % CI=0.37 to 0.55 ) .
This pooled standardized mean difference indicated a highly significant difference between drug and placebo treatment ( z=9.87 , p<0.001 ) .
We computed the fail - safe N to be 973 .
The test for heterogeneity of the standardized mean difference among the observations was not significant ( χ2=27.4 , df=26 , p=0.39 ) .
A graphic representation of these findings is shown as a Forest plot in Figure 1 .
The sensitivity analysis found that no single study accounted for the statistically significant pooled standardized mean difference ; after deleting one study at a time , the pooled standardized mean difference remained statistically significant and was never less than 0.35 .
Egger ’s test for publication bias had a positive slope and did not show significant bias since the confidence interval of the y axis intercept ( a ) included zero ( t=1.73 , df=26 , p=0.10 , CI= –0.15 to 1.77 ) .
Our meta - analysis regression model found no significant differences between study designs ( χ2=1.89 , df=3 , p=0.60 ) or between posttreatment and change scores ( χ2=0.01 , df=1 , p=0.91 ) .
The regression analyses did find a significant effect of type of outcome measure ( χ2=11.65 , df=3 , p=0.009 ) .
We found significant pooled standardized mean differences for the Children ’s Yale - Brown Obsessive Compulsive Scale ( standardized mean difference=0.47 , 95 % CI=0.33 to 0.60 , z=6.81 , p<0.001 ) , the NIMH Global OCD Scale ( standardized mean difference=0.56 , 95 % CI=0.37 to 0.75 , z=5.77 , p<0.001 ) , and the CGI of severity ( standardized mean difference=0.42 , 95 % CI=0.23 to 0.61 , z=4.38 , p<0.001 ) .
Each of these measures showed robust sensitivity to change with treatment .
However , the Leyton Obsessional Inventory — Child Version was not sensitive to overall change in the pooled outcomes ( standardized mean difference=0.15 , 95 % CI=–0.21 to 0.51 , z=0.80 , p=0.42 ) .
In pairwise comparisons the pooled standardized mean difference for the Leyton Obsessional Inventory — Child Version was significantly different from the pooled standardized mean difference for each of the other dependent measures ( p<0.01 for all comparisons , multivariate regression meta-analysis ) .
The pooled effect of each drug individually against placebo with the dependent measures controlled was highly significant ( each p<0.001 , test of standardized mean difference ) .
The fail - safe Ns were 10 for paroxetine , 73 for fluoxetine , 11 for fluvoxamine , 14 for sertraline , and 120 for clomipramine .
Multivariate regression meta-analysis of the drug effect with other variables controlled showed overall significance ( χ2=16.5 , df=4 , p=0.002 ) , and subsequent pairwise comparisons showed that the pooled standardized mean difference for clomipramine was significantly greater than that of the other drugs ( p=0.002 , chi-square test ) , which did not differ from one another .
The z scores and p values for each drug , pooled for all studies that used that drug , compared with placebo and with each other are shown in Table 3 .
Although we found significant effects for both the drug measure and the outcome measure , we did not find a statistically significant association between type of drug and type of outcome score ( p=0.50 , Fisher ’s exact test ) .
The year of study did not significantly predict the effect size ( z=–1.29 , p=0.20 ) .
Further , the drug effects remained significant when the year of the study was controlled ( χ2=9.63 , df=26 , p<0.05 ) .
We examined whether the apparent superiority of clomipramine was an artifact of increasing placebo response rates over time and found no association between the year of the study and percent improvement in the placebo group ( t=0.45 , df=20 , p=0.67 ) .
For each study we computed an odds ratio to assess the association between treatment group ( drug versus placebo ) and status ( completer versus dropout ) .
In each study , none of the odds ratios were significant , as indicated by their 95 % confidence intervals , which included 1.0 .
By using meta- analysis , the pooled odds ratio across studies was 1.0 , indicating no association ( z=0.3 , p=0.80 ) .
Discussion
To our knowledge , this is the first meta- analysis of randomized , controlled pharmacological trials of serotonin reuptake inhibitors for treatment of OCD in children and adolescents .
We found highly significant pooled effects of medication versus placebo , as well as important similarities and differences between individual drugs and differential sensitivity of quantitative measures of severity to change .
An overall effect size of 0.46 equaling a difference in score of about 4 points on the Children ’s Yale - Brown Obsessive Compulsive Scale between active and placebo treatments was found in the pooled studies , while each drug examined individually was significantly better than placebo or comparator treatments .
Although differing study designs and types of change score all permitted discrimination of drug and placebo effect equally well , not all dependent measures were equally sensitive to change .
Specifically , the Leyton Obsessional Inventory — Child Version alone did not show significant change with treatment , even in studies where the other scales that were used showed significant change .
Finally we found that clomipramine had significantly greater effect than the other more selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors in reducing OCD symptoms .
A finding that is consistent across multiple dependent measures , study designs , and different agents is more convincing than an isolated statistical effect .
Our meta- analytic findings should confirm support for a role for pharmacotherapy with serotonin reuptake inhibitors in pediatric OCD patients , including preadolescent children .
It is reassuring that the various study designs , which included different diagnostic classifications , diagnostic methods , and types of outcome measures , reliably and comparably separated active from placebo conditions .
However , not all of the characteristics of the randomized , controlled trials that we studied fared equally well .
As we have indicated , the sensitivity of the trials to drug - placebo differences was influenced by two factors : type of drug and type of outcome measure .
Our findings suggest that the Leyton Obsessional Inventory — Child Version should not be used as an instrument to measure change in severity of symptoms with treatment , although it may be useful in other ways .
Although not part of our analysis , subject selection criteria may also profoundly influence outcome and are important factors in weighing the results of any study .
Most of the randomized , controlled trials examined here used numerous exclusion criteria to select their samples in order to achieve homogeneous cohorts not confounded by comorbid disorders .
For example , all the studies included in the analysis excluded subjects with a primary diagnosis of major depressive disorder , bipolar disorder , psychosis , Tourette ’s disorder , autism , eating disorders , and substance use disorders .
Most studies also excluded subjects with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder ( ADHD ) , and no studies permitted concurrent cognitive behavior therapy or other medications .
Although these exclusions may be reasonable given the purpose of these studies , whether the results obtained from these randomized , controlled medication trials apply equally to naturalistic clinical samples remains unknown .
For example , several studies have suggested that treatment outcome in OCD patients may be poorer in those with comorbid tic disorders ( 27 , 28 ) .
As such , well - designed treatment trials that take into account the common comorbid disorders that are prevalent in children with OCD are very much needed ( 23 ) .
Although the power of pooled studies allows us to demonstrate that the effects of medication over placebo are highly significant , the magnitude of these observed effects in this analysis is nevertheless modest overall .
These findings can inform researchers in design of prospective studies , including the number of participants required for sufficient power to discriminate between treatments as well as the standard against which to compare efficacy of novel treatments .
From a clinical standpoint , the modest effect of medication suggests a real need for ongoing efforts at finding novel agents or augmenting strategies and evaluating the combined effects of behavioral and pharmacological treatments .
Despite our finding that clomipramine showed superiority over the SSRIs , it does not follow that clomipramine should be recommended as a treatment of first choice in pediatric OCD patients , due to frequent adverse events ( 18 ) and concerns about monitoring potential arrhythmogenic effects ( 29–31 ) .
Clomipramine is less user friendly for children than the SSRIs , for which EKG and monitoring of blood levels are not routinely required , and it is usually not used as a first - line agent in uncomplicated cases .
Despite these findings , our meta - analysis makes clear that clomipramine is an important drug in the armamentarium of antiobsessional medications .
Although our findings are supported by a number of similar meta-analytic studies in adults , the reasons for the observed greater efficacy of clomipramine are unknown .
By virtue of the fact that clomipramine was the first serotonergic agent approved for pediatric OCD , earlier subjects were essentially “ medication - naive ” in relation to such compounds and may have represented a different population of patients than those enrolled in later trials .
Underscoring this possibility , we note that the placebo response rate in the multisite clomipramine study was only 10 % but was considerably higher in subsequent randomized , controlled trials using SSRIs .
However , the effect of the drug remained significant when the year of the study was included as a covariate in the analysis , and there was not a statistically significant association between the year of the study and percent improvement in the placebo groups , nor were there differences in dropout rates between active and placebo conditions in the studies either individually or collectively .
Finally , we note that in adult studies , clomipramine has never shown significant superiority in direct comparison with other agents .
Unfortunately , to our knowledge , there are no such head - to - head studies in the pediatric age group .
Nonetheless , clomipramine has unique pharmacodynamic properties among the serotonergic agents , since it is metabolized to desmethylclomipramine , a secondary amine tricyclic antidepressant that is identical to desipramine with a chloride atom substitution .
This agent has noradrenergic properties that have been reported to be useful in the treatment of both ADHD ( 32 ) and tic disorders ( 33 ) , so clomipramine may offer the potential advantage of targeting symptoms that are often comorbid in these children .
Its wider spectrum of action as a nonselective drug with both serotonergic and noradrenergic action may be associated with its observed superiority .
While the choice of a specific agent is a complex clinical decision based on many factors , these findings suggest that clomipramine should be considered for treatment or augmentation in more severe or treatment - resistant cases of pediatric OCD .
Since the SSRIs were statistically indistinguishable from each other with respect to overall effect , a decision to use any one may depend more on adverse event profiles and individual pharmacokinetic properties than on efficacy .
Relevant factors to consider in the choice of a specific agent include the half - life of the compound , the presence of active metabolites , the linear or nonlinear nature of its clearance , and its capacity to inhibit various cytochrome P - 450 enzymatic pathways in the liver and so produce drug interactions .
Several limitations of this study should be considered .
We did not examine gender - or age - specific responses across studies because only a subset of studies provided this information and no individual studies that looked at predictors of response found differences in these factors .
We were unable to examine the effect of comorbid disorders on treatment response due to the numerous exclusion criteria used .
We relied on two types of outcome scores because standard deviations were not reported in some outcome measures in several studies .
To reduce any possible errors , we first determined statistical equivalence of baseline measures across treatment conditions in those studies .
Studies with more than one outcome measure were treated as multiple data points , potentially increasing the weight of these studies , even as the number of participants was used as the primary weighting method .
However , all but two studies ( N=203 , 9 % weight ; N=193 , 9 % weight ) had at least two outcome measures , and this method permitted an evaluation of measures that would not otherwise have been possible .
Since the study selection criteria may influence the outcome of such an analysis , we included all published studies that met our inclusion criteria , including those with no significant findings , and found no evidence of publication bias .
The studies were not heterogeneous , and no single study influenced our findings .
Nonetheless , we could not include unpublished data that might have shown less drug efficacy ( “ file - drawer effect ” ) .
We were unable to compare differing doses across studies , as there are no standardized weight - based dosing guidelines for these drugs in children .
All but one study used a flexible dosing regimen based on clinical response and tolerance at the investigators ’ discretion .
Nonetheless , the range of doses and mean doses in these studies reflected currently accepted pediatric clinical practice ( 34 ) .
To conclude , this meta - analysis showed that serotonergic medications are highly significantly superior to placebo in treating OCD in pediatric patients , with consistent findings across studies and a modest overall effect .
Clomipramine , a nonselective serotonergic drug , was statistically superior to the more selective agents in reducing OCD symptoms but may not be a first - line treatment due to its pharmacokinetic properties and side effect profile .
The SSRIs examined in this meta - analysis were more or less comparably effective in this population .

01 of 11 10 Best Second Rap Albums of All Time Getty
The greatest sophomore rap albums are the ones that can rival an equally great debut album in quality .
Sometimes , a debut merely offers a glimpse of brilliance , a capacity to blossom into greatness .
For those who manage to avoid the sophomore slump , the second album is a chance to display full potential and establish staying power .
Here are 10 of the best sophomore albums in hip - hop history .
02 of 11 Clipse - Hell Hath No Fury
Third time was the charm for Clipse .
While the duo's very first album , Exclusive Audio Footage , drummed up enough buzz to secure a spot on Elektra 's roster , it was eventually shelved .
They later migrated to Star Trak to go work with The Neptunes .
Their Start Trak debut , Lord Willin ' , gave rise to a handful of bangers ( including " Grindin ' " and " Cot Damn " ) but the rest of the album did n't live up to expectations .
It was 2006's that finally established Pusha T and Malice as a force to reckon with .

It 's easy to forget that GZA launched his solo career prior to Wu - Tang 's collective debut .
His first outing , Words from the Genius , dropped in 1991 and is often credited as the first solo album by a Wu member .
While that album was produced primarily by Easy Mo Bee , RZA took the production reins on Liquid Swords and laced his cousin with a cinematic backdrop for his gritty narratives .
Liquid Swords was rap as literature .

As one - third of the Native Tongues family , A Tribe Called Quest joined De La and Jungle Brothers in leading the charge for hip - hop 's Afrocentrism movement .
In return , the other two gave Q - Tip and co a blueprint that would eventually make Tribe the most accomplished group in the Native Tongues movement .
Low End
Theory best showcased Tribe 's role as a stylistic median between Jungle Brothers and De La Soul by combining the former 's jazz - rap sound with the latter 's bizarre sense of humor .

No one knew exactly what De La would do for their second go - round .
The Long Island crew had already redefined rap with 3 Feet High & Rising -- a groundbreaking debut that challenged hip - hop with its playful and innovative sound .
At a time when rap was a " shoot 'em up " playground , De La peddled rhymes about daisies and body odor .
After being derided as hippies , the group dropped a follow - up album that was notoriously edgiy yet remarkably impressive .
The title ( De La Soul Is Dead ) and album art ( an image of withering daisies ) signified the end of daisy - era De La .
They broke out of the envelope that supposedly limited their art without sacrificing their core sound .
De La Soul was very much alive .

Jobs and Schmidt , whose companies have just ended their love affair , were spotted minutes ago talking business at Calafia in the Town and Country shopping center in Palo Alto .
Update :
That 's not an iPad .
And body language analysis , here .

Our tipster saw em and snapped these shots , and noted that the cafe is owned and operated by former Google chef Charlie Ayers .
Overheard from the conversation were two lines by Jobs .
Enthusiastically , " They 're going to see it all eventually so who cares how they get it . "
Which seemed to be about web content , said the tipster .
And , " Let 's go discuss this somewhere more private , " after they noticed the crowd gathering around .
I think that was probably a wise move .
Schmidt was very quiet , listening , and Jobs was doing a lot of the talking .
What do you make of the body language ?
And what 's that black thing on the table ?
Update : No , it 's not an iPad .
It 's a menu .
Tipster says the first thing he looked for was an iPad , and that is n't it .
The fact they 'd meet in a neutral place like this implies , although does not prove , they chose a public place for its neutrality .
Or they just wanted coffee and inevitably started talking shop , albeit in public .
But since when do billionaires have to step out for coffee ?
The only thing that adds up is that neither felt comfortable meeting at each other 's HQs , and this is the start of talks that will inevitably be tense for both sides .

I 'd assume the coffee was not poisoned .
And that they did not go somewhere to wrestle .
[ Thanks Tipster Z. Kudos on asking Jobs if he wanted to comment for Gizmodo , too , even if his reply was a smile and " No thanks . " ]
Update :
The body language analysis turned out interesting .
Lots of journalists believe the meeting was planned for press reasons .
I think it could go either way .
Monkey populations in threatened forests are far more sensitive to damage to their habitat than previously thought , according to new research .
An analysis of monkeys living in Tanzania 's Udzungwa Mountains suggests that the impact of external factors , such as human activity , on species numbers is felt in forests as large as 40 square kilometres .
Researchers also found that the health of monkey populations is closely related to the type of habitat found between forest fragments , rather than the distance that separates them .
The findings have broader implications for conservationists as the number of monkeys and the variety of species is a visible indicator of the underlying health of their habitat .
The research was conducted by Dr Andrew Marshall , from the Environment Department at the University of York and Director of Conservation at Flamingo Land Theme Park and Zoo , in collaboration with colleagues from the University of York , the University of Copenhagen , the Tremto Museum of Natural History ( Italy ) and the Udzungwa Ecological Monitoring Centre ( Tanzania ) .
Dr Marshall said : " This study suggests that while small forest fragments need protecting we should intervene at an earlier stage to protect larger forest areas that are under threat .
" It also supports the case for working with local communities on practical steps that will help forest species .
These could include reducing dependence on bush meat and encouraging the planting of habitat that can form corridors between forest fragments . "
The research investigated the distribution of seven species living in an area covering 10,000 km2 and has led to a wider conservation and education project in the area led by Dr Marshall , through Flamingo Land Theme Park and Zoo .
The discovery of a new species of chameleon in this area was announced last year .
The latest research is published in the American Journal of Primatology .
A series of patents may detail the user interface of Apple ’s tablet , which could be unveiled in January .
At the heart of ‘ surprising ‘ method for users to interact with the much - awaited device is what the Cupertino , Calif .
company describes as an ‘ articulated frame . ’
“ The articulating frame may provide key edge ridges that define the boundaries of the key regions or may provide tactile feedback mechanisms within the key regions , ” according to an application entitled “ Keystroke Tactility Arrangement on a Smooth Touch Surface ” uncovered earlier this week .
The user interface could be configured “ to cause concave depressions similar to mechanical key caps in the surface , ” adds the patent application .
Reportedly , the depressions would vanish when a keyboard is not required .
To find the best medium for both typing and pointing , the interface would include a screen with key edge ridges that would not hamper multi- touch interaction .
“ The key edge ridges should separate [ d ] to accommodate the routing of the drive electrodes , which may take the form of rows , columns , or other configurations , ” according to the Apple patent application filed Aug. 28 2009 and credited to Wayne Carl Westerman of San Francisco , Calif .
Apple suggests the device determine when typing is required or when pointing is more appropriate .
“ The recognition software commands lowering of the frame when lateral sliding gestures or mouse clicking activity chords are detected on the surface , ” according to Apple .
However , when a user places his fingers on the typing ‘ home row ’ or typing is detected , the software raises the frame .

Colton Morman , 18 , won the election with 29 votes or 53.7 percent .
He defeated Jeffrey Anspaugh , who had 21 votes or 38.8 percent .
There were four write - in votes .
The incumbent mayor decided not to run for reelection .
The newly elected mayor of Dawson , Iowa , is getting attention because of his age .
Voters elected Colton Morman , 18 , to the office on Tuesday .
" I feel an 18 - year - old kid can be mayor , " Morman said .
Until his election , the most exciting thing in the Dallas County town has been the farmers bringing their corn to the elevator , but Morman 's election has given people something new to talk about .
Morman is a high school senior and barely eligible to vote .
" I 've always had an interest in government , " he said .
" That 's my favorite class .
" The population of Dawson is 155 people .
The vote total sounds a lot like a football score .
" I won 29 - 21 , " Morman said .
He said that meant 29 voters like the idea of a new , young mayor .
The rest do n't seem to care too much .
" I had no clue there was an 18 - year - old mayor running .
I heard nothing about it , " said Dawson resident Teresa Gibson .
" I think it 's a good idea . " " There are very good people here .
I like them , whether they like me or not , " Morman said .
" I like them and that 's something I want to express to them .
" Morman 's grandfather is stepping down as Dawson 's mayor .
Morman said he figures that being the next mayor might be good experience for a future career in law .
Mostly , he said , he just wants to help people .
" I just want to do something to give back , " he said .
" I 've been here all my life .
" Morman will be sworn in as Mayor in January .
His grandfather , the former mayor , will now serve as a member of the Dawson City Council .
Dawson is located about 8 miles west of Perry in Dallas County and has a population of
CHICAGO – Hundreds of union members , business owners , sick people denied benefits by their insurance companies , their families and activists braved snow squalls and icy winds blowing in from Lake Michigan last night .
They did it to pull off a rally here on the eve of President Obama ’s White House Health Care Summit and they reinforced a message that even the coldest Republican hearts in the nation ’s capital heard when the Congress voted 406 - 19 to repeal the antitrust exemption enjoyed by the health insurance giants .
Before hundreds of rallies like the one here last night , more than 1,250,000 people from coast to coast sent messages to Congress urging lawmakers to “ finish the job and pass real health care reform . ”
The “ virtual march ” continues today with hundreds of thousands of callers tying up phone lines , fax machines and computers in the nation ’s capital .
Steve Hart , whose partner Melanie Shouse recently lost her battle with breast cancer after her insurance company denied her care , addressed the crowd here via telephone conference line .
In a voice that betrayed his choked back tears the hushed crowd at the Chicago Temple heard him say , “ Melanie would have been alive and well today if we had a health care system that worked .
She would have gone to the doctor at the first sign of a lump in her breast . ”
Hart had just walked 135 miles from Philadelphia to DC with other “ survivors of the U.S. health care system , ” as the group called itself .
The rally here , sponsored by Health Care for America Now , the Illinois Main Street Alliance , Citizen Action Illinois and MoveOn .
Org , was addressed by Rep. Jan Schakowski , D - Ill. , who praised the president ’s bill for curbing insurance rate hikes .
“ Illinois is one of 26 states that allow insurance companies to charge whatever premiums they want without review .
The bill would give us the authority to prevent those rate hikes , ” she said .
Speakers at the rally recognized that the president ’s proposal does not include stronger reforms advocated by many progressives .
“ I am not here tonight to convince you the bill is good , far from it , ” said Andy Kurz , a former official at Blue Cross Wisconsin who switched sides to become a health care reform advocate .
“ I am here to say that this bill is necessary , and in context , as transformational as Medicare was in 1965 .
The opposition bellyached about Medicare then , and is doing the same now .
But would you chuck Medicare ?
Me neither , ” he said , as the audience rose to its feet with chants of “ no . ”
The Rev. Larry Greenfield , a Baptist minister who attributed hundreds of thousands of deaths in the last ten years to a “ terrorist attack on our people by health insurance profiteers and their partners in Congress , ” said the fight to improve the bill must continue , even after it is passed .
He and other speakers said Congress should immediately add a strong public health insurance option and move up the start dates of important provisions to 2010 .
Other speakers called for national , rather than state - based health insurance exchanges .
Sen .
Tom Harkin , D - Iowa , a leading proponent of health care reform , said in Washington yesterday , that he was “ not certain we ’re going to be able to get a public option in this bill but that does n’t mean we stop trying .
I keep reminding people that this bill is not written in stone , like the Ten Commandments , for ever and ever . ”
Popular pressure is having its effect in Washington with Democrats saying openly that they are ready to move on health care reform without Republican support .
They say they are ready to use Senate budget rules to pass a bill with a simple majority .
Sixteen of such 22 “ reconciliation bills ” that have made it through Congress were passed in the Senate when it had Republican majorities .
These included the tax cuts for the rich pushed by President Bush , the 1996 overhaul of welfare , the Children ’s Health Insurance program , Medicare Advantage and the COBRA program .
Another result of the big health care reform campaigns is the shift in public positions taken by some conservative Democrats who are coming out more boldly now in support of the president ’s bill .
Many expressed outrage over a 39 percent rate hike by WellPoint Inc .
WellPoint , in testimony before Congress yesterday , blamed its rate increase on doctors , hospitals , drug companies , suppliers and patients , particularly seniors .
House members , citing internal documents from WellPoint , said the company had sought to inflate individual policyholders ’ premiums to counteract anticipated concessions to state regulators .
Practice Data in Flight
Illustration by Ryan Alexander
Web applications produce data at colossal rates , and those rates compound every year as the Web becomes more central to our lives .
Other data sources such as environmental monitoring and location - based services are a rapidly expanding part of our day - to - day experience .
Even as throughput is increasing , users and business owners expect to see their data with ever - decreasing latency .
Advances in computer hardware ( cheaper memory , cheaper disk , and more processing cores ) are helping somewhat , but not enough to keep pace with the twin demands of rising throughput and decreasing latency .
The technologies for powering Web applications must be fairly straightforward for two reasons : first , because it must be possible to evolve a Web application rapidly and then to deploy it at scale with a minimum of hassle ; second , because the people writing Web applications are generalists and are not prepared to learn the kind of complex , hard - to - tune technologies used by systems programmers .
The streaming query engine is a new technology that excels in processing rapidly flowing data and producing results with low latency .
It arose out of the database research community and therefore shares some of the characteristics that make relational databases popular , but it is most definitely not a database .
In a database , the data arrives first and is stored on disk ; then users apply queries to the stored data .
In a streaming query engine , the queries arrive before the data .
The data flows through a number of continuously executing queries , and the transformed data flows out to applications .
One might say that a relational database processes data at rest , whereas a streaming query engine processes data in flight .
Tables are the key primitive in a relational database .
A table is populated with records , each of which has the same record type , defined by a number of named , strongly typed columns .
Records have no inherent ordering .
Queries , generally expressed in SQL , retrieve records from one or more tables , transforming them using a small set of powerful relational operators .
Streams are the corresponding primitive in a streaming query engine .
A stream has a record type , just like a table , but records flow through a stream rather than being stored .
Records in a streaming system are inherently ordered ; in fact , each record has a time stamp that indicates when it was created .
The relational operations supported by a relational database have analogues in a streaming system and are sufficiently similar that SQL can be used to write streaming queries .
To illustrate how a streaming query engine can solve problems involving data in flight , consider the following example .

Streaming Queries for Click - Stream Processing
Suppose we want to monitor the most popular pages on a Web site .
Each
Web server request generates a line to the Web server 's log file describing the time , the URI of the page , and the IP address of the requester ; and an adapter can continuously parse the log file and populate a stream with records .
This query computes the number of requests for each page each minute , as shown in the accompanying table .
The example here is expressed in SQLstream 's query language , as are others in this article .
The language is standard SQL plus streaming extensions .
4
Other streaming query engines have similar capabilities .
The only SQL extensions used in this particular query are the STREAM keyword and the ROWTIME system column .
If you removed the STREAM keyword and converted PageRequests to a table with a column called ROWTIME , you could execute the query in a conventional database such as Oracle or MySQL .
That query would analyze all requests that have ever occurred up until the current moment .
If PageRequests is a stream , however , the STREAM keyword tells SQLstream to attach to the PageRequests stream and to apply the operation to all future records .
Streaming queries run forever .
Every minute this query emits a set of rows , summarizing the traffic for each page during that minute .
The output rows time - stamped 10:00:00 summarize all requests between 10:00 and 10:01 ( including the 10:00 end point but not including 10:01 ) .
Rows in the PageRequests stream are sorted by their ROWTIME system column , so the 10:00:00 output rows are literally pushed out by the arrival of the first row time - stamped 10:01:00 or later .
A streaming query engine tends to process data and deliver results only when new data arrives , so it is said to use push - based processing .
This is in contrast to a relational database 's pull - based approach where the application must poll repeatedly for new results .
The example in Figure 1 computes URIs for which the number of requests is much higher than normal .
First , the PageRequestsWithCount view computes the number of requests per hour for each URI over the past hour and averaged over the past 24 hours .
Then a query selects URIs for which the rate over the past hour was more than three times the hourly rate over the past 24 hours .
Unlike the previous query that used a GROUP BY clause to aggregate many records into one total per time period , this query uses windowed aggregate expressions ( aggregate - function OVER window ) to add analytic values to each row .
Because each row is annotated with its trailing hour 's and day 's statistics , you need not wait for a batch of rows to be complete .
You can use such a query to continuously populate a " Most popular pages " list on your Web site , or an e-commerce site could use it to detect products selling in higher than normal volumes .

Comparing Databases and Streaming Query Engines
A database and a streaming query engine have similar SQL semantics , but if you use the two systems for problems involving data in flight , they behave very differently .
Why is a streaming query engine more efficient for such problems ?
To answer that question , it helps to look at its pedigree .
Some use the term streaming database , which misleadingly implies that the system is storing data .
That said , streaming query engines have very strong family connections with databases .
Streaming query engines have roots in database research , in particular the Stanford STREAMS project , 1 the Aurora project at MIT / Brown / Brandeis , 2 and the Telegraph project at Berkeley .
3
Streaming query engines are based on the relational model that underlies relational databases and , as we shall see , those underpinnings give them power , flexibility , and industry acceptance .
The relational model , first described by E.F.
Codd in 1970 , is a simple and uniform way of describing the structure of databases .
It consists of relations ( named collections of records ) and a set of simple operators for combining those relations : select , project , join , aggregate , and union .
A relational database naturally enforces data independence , the separation between the logical structure of data and the physical representation .
Because the query writer does not know how data is physically organized , a query optimizer is an essential component of a relational database , to choose among the many possible algorithms for a query .
SQL was first brought to market in the late 1970s .
Some say it is not theoretically pure ( and it has since been extended to encompass nonrelational concepts such as objects and nested tables ) , but SQL nevertheless embodies the key principles of the relational model .
It is declarative , which enables the query to be optimized , so you ( or the system ) can tune an application without rewriting it .
You can therefore defer tuning a new database schema until the application is mostly written , and you can safely refactor an existing database schema .
SQL is simple , reliable , and forgiving , and many developers understand it .
Streams introduce a time dimension into the relational model .
You can still apply the basic operators ( select , project , join , and so forth ) , but you can also ask , " If I executed that join query a second ago , and I execute it again now , what would be the difference in the results ? "
This allows us to approach problems in a very different way .
As an analogy , consider how you would measure the speed of a car traveling along the freeway .
You might look out the window for a mile marker , write down the time , and when you reach the next mile marker , divide the distance between the mile markers by the elapsed time .
Alternatively , you might use a speedometer , a device where a needle is moved based on a generated current that is proportional to the angular velocity of the car 's wheels , which in turn is proportional to the speed of the car .
The mile - marker method converts position and time into speed , whereas the speedometer measures speed directly using a set of quantities proportional to speed .
Position and speed are connected quantities ; in the language of calculus , speed is the differential of position with respect to time .
Similarly , a stream is the time differential of a table .
Just as the speedometer is the more appropriate solution to the problem of measuring a car 's speed , a streaming query engine is often much more efficient than a relational database for data - processing applications involving rapidly arriving time - dependent data .

Streaming Advantage
Why is a streaming query engine more efficient than a relational database for data - in - flight problems ?
First , the systems express the problems in very different ways .
A database stores data and applications fire queries ( and transactions ) at the data .
A streaming query engine stores queries , and the outside world fires data at the queries .
There are no transactions as such , just data flowing through the system .
The database needs to load and index the data , run the query on the whole dataset , and subtract previous results .
A streaming query system processes only new data .
It holds only the data that it needs ( for example , the latest minute ) , and since that usually fits into memory easily , no disk I/O is necessary .
A relational database operates under the assumption that all data is equally important , but in a business application , what happened a minute ago is often more important than what happened yesterday , and much more important than what happened a year ago .
As the database grows , it needs to spread the large dataset across disk and create indexes so that all of the data can be accessed in constant time .
A streaming query engine 's working sets are smaller and can be held in memory ; and because the queries contain window specifications and are created before the data arrives , the streaming query engine does not have to guess which data to store .
A streaming query engine has other inherent advantages for data in flight : reduced concurrency control overhead and efficiencies from processing data asynchronously .
Since a database is writing to data structures that other applications can read and write , it needs mechanisms for concurrency control ; in a streaming query engine there is no contention for locks , because incoming data from all applications is placed on a queue and processed when the streaming query engine is ready for it .
In other words , the streaming query engine processes data asynchronously .
Asynchronous processing is a feature of many high - performance server applications , from transaction processing to email processing , as well as Web crawling and indexing .
It allows a system to vary its unit of workfrom a record at a time when the system is lightly loaded to batches of many rows when the load is heavierto achieve efficiency benefits such as locality - of - reference .
One might think an asynchronous system has a slower response time , because it processes the data " when it feels like it , " but an asynchronous system can achieve a given throughput at much lower system load , and therefore have a better response time than a synchronous system .
Not only is a relational database synchronous , but it also tends to force the rest of the application into a record - at - a - time mode .
It should be clear by now that push - based processing is more efficient for data in flight ; however , a streaming query engine is not the only way to achieve it .
Streaming SQL does not make anything possible that was previously impossible .
For example , you could implement many problems using a message bus , messages encoded in XML , and a procedural language to take messages off the bus , transform them , and put them back onto the bus .
You would , however , encounter problems of performance ( parsing XML is expensive ) , scalability ( how to split a problem into sub- problems that can be handled by separate threads or machines ) , algorithms ( how to combine two streams efficiently , correlate two streams on a common key , or aggregate a stream ) , and configuration ( how to inform all of the components of the system if one of the rules has changed ) .
Most modern applications choose to use a relational database management system to avoid dealing with data files directly , and the reasons to use a streaming query system are very similar .

Other Applications of Streaming Query Systems
Just as relational databases are a horizontal technology , used for everything from serving Web pages to transaction processing and data warehousing , streaming SQL systems are being applied to a variety of problems .
Application areas include complex event processing ( CEP ) , monitoring , population data warehouses , and middleware .
A CEP query looks for sequences of events on a single stream or on multiple streams that , together , match a pattern and create a " complex event " of interest to the business .
Applications of CEP include fraud detection and electronic trading .
CEP has been used within the industry as a blanket term to describe the entire field of streaming query systems .
This is regrettable because it has resulted in a religious war between SQL - based and non-SQL - based vendors and , in overly focusing on financial services applications , has caused other application areas to be neglected .
The click - stream queries here are a simple example of a monitoring application .
Such an application looks for trends in the transactions that represent the running business and alerts the operations staff if things are not running smoothly .
A monitoring query finds insights by aggregating large numbers of records and looking for trends , in contrast to a CEP query that looks for patterns among individual events .
Monitoring applications may also populate real - time dashboards , a business 's equivalent of your car 's speedometer , thermometer , and oil pressure gauge .
Because of their common SQL language , streaming queries have a natural synergy with data warehouses .
The data warehouse holds the large amount of historical data necessary for a " rear - view mirror " analysis of the business , while the streaming query system continuously populates the data warehouse and provides forward - looking insight to " steer the company . "
The streaming query system performs the same function as an ETL ( extract , transform , load ) tool but operates continuously .
A conventional ETL process is a sequence of steps invoked as a batch job .
The cycle time of the ETL process limits how current the data warehouse is , and it is difficult to get that cycle time below a few minutes .
For example , the most data - intensive steps are performed by issuing queries on the data warehouse : looking up existing values in a dimension table , such as customers who have made a previous purchase , and populating summary tables .
A streaming query system can cache the information required to perform these steps , offloading the data warehouse , whereas the ETL process is too short - lived to benefit from caching .
Figure 2 shows the architecture of a real - time business intelligence system .
In addition to performing continuous ETL , the streaming query system populates a dashboard of business metrics , generates alerts if metrics fall outside acceptable bounds , and proactively maintains the cache of an OLAP ( online analytical processing ) server that is based upon the data warehouse .
Today , much " data in flight " is transmitted by message - oriented middleware .
Like middleware , streaming query systems can deliver messages reliably , and with high throughput and low latency ; further , they can apply SQL operations to route , combine , and transform messages in flight .
As streaming query systems mature , we may see them stepping into the role of middleware and blurring the boundaries between messaging , continuous ETL , and database technologies by applying SQL throughout .

Conclusion
Streaming query engines are based on the same technology as relational databases but are designed to process data in flight .
Streaming query engines can solve some common problems much more efficiently than databases because they match the time - based nature of the problems , they retain only the working set of data needed to solve the problem , and they process data asynchronously and continuously .
Because of their shared SQL language , streaming query engines and relational databases can collaborate to solve problems in monitoring and realtime business intelligence .
SQL makes them accessible to a large pool of people with SQL expertise .
Just as databases can be applied to a wide range of problems , from transaction processing to data warehousing , streaming query systems can support patterns such as enterprise messaging , complex event processing , continuous data integration , and new application areas that are still being discovered .

The following letter was published in the Letters to the Editor in the May 2010 CACM ( http://cacm.acm.org/magazines/2010/5/87250).
--CACM Administrator
In its description of streaming queries , Julian Hyde 's article " Data in Flight " ( Jan. 2010 ) included a paragraph on the relationship between streaming queries and complex event processing , saying " CEP has been used within the industry as a blanket term to describe the entire field of streaming query systems .
This is regrettable because it has resulted in a religious war between SQL - based and non-SQL - based vendors and , in overly focusing on financial services applications , has caused other application areas to be neglected . "
Here , I 'd like to offer some perspective on these three assertions :
On the relationship between event processing and streaming SQL .
Event processing is a broad term , like data management and signal processing , dealing with computing that performs activities on events .
A number of related programming styles are employed in the research community , as well as in commercial products , for implementing event - processing applications , including stream - oriented ( based on SQL extensions ( 2 ) and not based on SQL extensions ( 1 ) ) , script languages , and rule - based .
The Event Processing Technical Society Language Analysis Workgroup gave a tutorial on the languages ( http://www.slideshare.net/opher.etzion/debs2009-event-processing-languages-tutorial) at the 2009 ACM International Conference on Distributed Event - Based Systems ( http://www.debs.org/2009).
On vendor competition .
I have seen no religious wars over event - processing languages ( unlike the classic one between Lisp and Prolog ) .
Vendors compete but generally acknowledge the variety of ways to approach event - processing applications .
They also collaborate through the Event Processing Technical society ( http://www.ep-ts.com/), a consortium including most vendors in the area , as well as its leading academic people , to investigate common functions and steps toward a common modeling language .
On the range of applications .
Some have asserted the field is overly focused on financial services to the exclusion all other industries .
This might be true for some of the smaller vendors , but the field 's major vendors report they develop applications across a range of industries , including health care , retail , defense , online games , chemical and petroleum , social computing , airline management , and car - fleet management .
While applications in the financial services industry were early adopters , the claim of an overly narrow focus for the current state of the practice is simply not correct .

AUTHOR'S RESPONSE
Etzion 's point that the Event Processing Technical Society offers a range of approaches to event - processing problems is well taken .
However , in framing the problem as " event processing , " the Society , as well as the complex event processing vendors , fails to address the needs of the data warehousing / business intelligence community .
Consider how such a BI practitioner might see the world : Business events are embodied as rows in a fact table , and events are captured in log files or through database triggers and transformed through an extract transform load tool or in the target database .
SQL is the lingua franca .
This perspective is different from the event - processing view , an important distinction because many large , complex problems are expressed in BI terms and because many people have BI skills .
BI technologies alone do not adequately address the needs of this community .
Streaming query systems ( such as SQL stream ) allow them to solve important new problems .

A comic is here today despite Tony being busy fixing a boxing match and Wes being terrorized by puppies .
Live maker Ableton and DJ and virtual vinyl developer Serato today announced the results of their partnership .
First off , this is n’t what many of us originally speculated : it ’s not a DJ deck inside Live .
Instead , the collaboration seeks to bridge ( ahem ) the gap between the way DJs perform and the way Live users perform .
The result focuses on the way a performance set is assembled in the two paradigms , an attempt to guide the flow of music between the two programs .
Here ’s how it works .
Bring Serato “ mixtapes ” into Ableton Live : Save a DJ mix – called a “ mix tape ” – in a Serato product , and export it to Live , and what you get is all of your edits in a form that can be further manipulated in Live .
Waveforms and automation data from your DJ session , however they ’re manipulated and transcribed by the Serato software , appear in Live .
Put the Ableton Live Session View “ inside ” Serato :
Here ’s where things get in interesting .
Rather than put Serato inside Live , we ’re getting Live inside Serato – after a fashion .
Ableton Live runs in the background .
Integrated into the Serato interface ( as seen at the screenshot at top ) are all your Session View clips from your Live Set.
Serato ’s control – via audio input from vinyl or CDJs , or an ITCH control surface – manipulates the entire transport of the Live set .
Unknown : Turntablists are probably wondering , can they scratch Live ?
How much are those Live clips able to do ?
Do they behave as they do in Live ?
( As far as I know , yes – Live is , after all , running in the background and appears to have its normal capabilities . )
I ’ll work on these questions with Ableton and have an update by tomorrow .
ITCH : Yes , you can use controllers that support Serato ’s ITCH , not just vinyl or CDJs , in order to control the transport of your imported Live set .
Pricing : Free. Own Serato Live / ITCH and Ableton Live ( full version or Suite ) ?
The Bridge costs you nothing .
( Yes , this seems to be a departure from the arrangement from Max for Live . )
Availability : “ No release date has been set yet . ”
Naturally , all of this begs the question : do you really want to do this ?
And I expect that question is about to get turned over and inside out all over comments here on CDM and around the Web .
It ’ll naturally depend a lot on who you are .
Taking Serato sets into Live is clearly great for Serato users .
It means you can get a head start on assembling an arrangement just by DJing , or alternatively , that you have the ability to use Live as a way of editing your Serato set .
( Now , again , this appears to be a proprietary format – but that raises an interesting point .
Ableton now uses an open XML format , meaning you could also presumably deconstruct this new Serato export and enable it to be used somewhere else , whether intended or not .
But I digress . )
It ’s the more ambitious reverse direction that ’s both the most interesting and the most potentially controversial .
After all , if you ’re using Session View inside of Serato , why not just use Session View ?
Will it be more useful to put Live inside the virtual vinyl environment than the virtual vinyl inside Live ?
( If it turns out you favor the latter , you have other options – not least the recent evolution of Max for Live patches for Ms. Pinky .
More on that in coming days . )
Side note : check out the VIDEO - SL integration .
That makes this all even more interesting as an a /v , virtual vinyl environment ; see our ongoing coverage of VIDEO - SL and other vinyl visualism for Create Digital Motion .
I ’m not a turntablist , though , so I think the real question is what their take on this is .
And kudos to Serato and Ableton for taking the gutsy route here as far as combining these products .
We ’ll get a closer look soon , and I ’m curious to hear the reactions – however impassioned they may be .
( On your mark … set … comment .
Oh , boy . )

Home invasions are statistically rare , but if it happens to you the results can be devastating for you and your family .
Whilst the probability of a home invasion happening to you is low , our website helps you reduce the risk of a home invasion and offers advice on how to deal with a home invasion should it happen to your family in your home .
There is no one single correct response to a home invasion scenario .
The choice is personal , based on your own assessment of your physical and mental capabilities and your belief as to the level of imminent danger .
Sometimes fighting and screaming works , especially if there are neighbors who will intervene or call the police .
It makes no sense to risk fighting if you are physically incapable of doing so effectively .
Total compliance may leave you unharmed , but increases the duration of the invasion and the risk of someone getting hurt .
Prevention
Our main aim is to help you prevent a home invasion happening .
We give tips to help you secure your home , whether that be through what you keep in the garden ( patio furniture can be used to break windows ) , suggesting smart home security systems that have perimeter door and window sensors that can be activated even when you ’re home , to dealing with strangers who appear on your doorstep trying to enter your property .
In the event of a home invasion
Our website will help your family decide the risks each member is prepared to take and how all of you can keep as safe as possible .
Suggestions for preparedness actions for the fastest and safest outcome , including a safe room , a pre-arranged duress code with your alarm company and more .
We list the best firearms for home protection for your family as well has helping you draw up an escape plan .
Children are often overlooked as potential rescuers and sometimes not as well guarded as teens and adults .
Is your child capable of dialling 911 , activating an alarm or escaping to the neighbours to get help ?
We advise you what to do , we also advise what not to do .
Never follow an intruder once they leave your home .
Do n’t fight over property loss , it can be replaced , your life cannot .
Captain Phil Harris started working on fishing boats aged seven
Captain Phil Harris , whose fishing adventures off the Alaska coast were captured on Discovery Channel show Deadliest Catch , has died aged 53 .
In January , he had a stroke while his boat was in port at St Paul Island .
In a statement his sons Josh and Jake said : " Dad has always been a fighter and continued to be until the end . "
Elizabeth Hillman from the Discovery Channel said the team would miss his " straightforward honesty , wicked sense of humour and enormous heart " .
She added : " He was more than someone on our television screen .
Phil was a devoted father and loyal friend to all who knew him . "
In a recent posting on his website , Harris ' sons wrote : " No - one ever said Captain Phil Harris was n't tough .
" Today , dad showed some good signs of improvement , squeezing our hands and even summoning his trademark captain 's bluntness .
" We are encouraged but still very cautious . "
Harris started working on fishing boats aged seven .
He first captained a fishing vessel at the age of 21 .

Feedback / suggestions strongly encouraged ( esp. a good formula for a macro rating )
There was a bug with buildorder generation , please download the new version as the bug is fairly serious .
New Features ( Latest update : customizable layout / more worker stats / display ) :
+ Show Spoiler +
A new worker stat is added : Total number of idle worker seconds as well as the total amount of minerals that could 've been harvested by the idle workers .
The idle worker seconds work like this : if there are 4 idling workers idling for 1 second each , that 's 4 worker seconds , it 's the same if there 's one worker idling for 4 seconds .
The number of minerals " missed " from idling is calculated by this :
if the worker is idling for that frame ( 1/24th of a second ) , the number of minerals missed is equaled to the instantaneous mining rate per frame of that player 's workers divided by the number of workers .
E.g .
If the player is on one base with 50 workers mining 8 patches , an idling worker will not increase the " amount of minerals missed " as much if the player is on one base with 4 workers mining 8 patches , simply because one added worker in the oversaturated mineral field is not going to be that big of a deal where as one added worker in an undersaturated mineral field makes a bigger impact .
This is a fairly accurate measurement of the amount of minerals missed from idling workers .
This will help you refine your builds as you can see how much more minerals you could 've gotten if you had better mechanics .
This was fairly late into the game , but you can see that the amount of minerals missed by both players is a pretty big amount .
You can also see that the ratio of minerals : minutes is not the same .
This is because the mining rates of each player is different when their workers are idling .
Units making in production facilities , research / upgrades , unfinished buildings are all labeled as you can't tell what they are unless you click on them .
This just saves a bit of time :
The option to turn them off is in the settings file under the field " showHiddenNames " .
The bug of not reading options correctly is also fixed .
The layout is now customizeable .
As well as 5 new commands :
/ hide < 1 or 2 >
Hide the info from player 1 or 2 .
/unhide < 1 or 2 >
unhide the player info .
/ load < layout scheme filename >
Loads a file containing a set of layout options .
I included 2 basic files ( basicinfo.ini , buildorder.ini )
/ load basicinfo
/ load buildorder
In the beginning of the replay the plugin will automatically load replaypp.ini .
So just edit that file to your liking .
The default file scheme is :
+ Show Spoiler +
showrally : 1
showworkerstats : 1
showmacrostats : 1
showorder : 1
showbuildorder : 1
showhp : 1
supplycount : 50

workerCount : 1
miningMineralCount : 1

idleWorkerCount : 1
****************** buildOrderSettings :

notify : 1
You can decide which info is displayed from changing to 1 or 0 .
Notify is the option to turn off the notification everytime the buildorder list increases .
/ default
loads replaypp.ini ( the default file )
/ notify
Toggles the notification of build orders .
Old :
The timing of RESEARCH / UPGRADES is now tracked throughout the whole game .
Throughout the game ( even after the supply count limit ) , the timing of important tech structures , and the first instance of units is tracked .
E.g .
If you want to practise a build that focuses on a midgame push with guardians , the timing / supply count of the FIRST guardian will be recorded regardless of what your supply is .
Throughout the whole game , the timing of EXPANSIONS will be recorded as well .
This is not equivalent to a cc / hatch / nexus , as ONLY cc / hatch / nexus that serve as a mining base is recorded .
E.g. you build a second hatch next to your first hatch , it 's not counted as an expansion .
A new worker stat is added : Total number of idle worker seconds as well as the total amount of minerals that could 've been harvested by the idle workers .
The idle worker seconds work like this : if there are 4 idling workers idling for 1 second each , that 's 4 worker seconds , it 's the same if there 's one worker idling for 4 seconds .

Bug fixes :
Fixed the bug where you can't follow lurkers .
You can follow lurkers all you want .
Fixed the bug where the game crashes if you type / highlight or / find or / follow with no parameters .
Fixed the bug where it can't recognize when lair / hive tech is .
Does this make you squeal in joy ?
If it does , you may donate to help the hungry college kid writing code here !
To update you just need to change the replaypp.dll , and replaypp.ini with the new one .
No need to replace everything .
Instead of using bwapi to make an AI that does things for you , I made something that makes watching a replay / obsing a game on iccup , or even practising .
This is replay ++ : it makes watching a replay as exciting as watching the TSL .
Features
Detailed Macro stats :
In addition to knowing only the resources / supply of each player , you now know many more useful stats that can help you analyse your own replays to become a better player .
This is taken from the infernal vs mondragon replay found in the replays section .
From the top to bottom :
First row : shows minerals , increase in minerals per minute , gas , increase in gas per minute , and supply .
Second row : # of production facilities built ( in white ) , and currently building ( in grey ) .
If you 're a zerg this shows the number of hatcheries .
Third row : # of units queued and how much minerals / gas is wasted in queueing .
Zergs do n't have this because they laugh at nubs queueing .
Fourth row : Average number of units queueing at any given time , and the corresponding resources .
( Infernal 's being a champ and has a super low queueing average )
Fifth row : Number of units building .
Self explanatory .
Zergs have the number of units morphing .
Sixth row : Number of production facilities not building stuff .
This includes everything so it 's normal to have 3 - 4 from robo bays , scouting raxes , etc .
Zerg 's equivalent to this is the number of idle larva at the time , as well as average .
Seventh row : Overall macro rating is something random formula that incorporates everything that I made up .
It is by no means perfectly accurate or even useful .
I just did it for kicks .
But it 's working here as you can see how mondi's rating 's quite low as he is supply blocked , with 10 idle larvae .
Detailed worker stats :
This is pretty self explanatory .
The number of patches currently being mined means the number of patches that are physically being mined , aka if a worker is returning cargo , the number of patches being mined is 0 .
Real time build order generation :
This list is generated as the game is played .
You can change up to how many supply the build order is being tracked .
The default is 50 , you can change it in the .ini file .
A timestamp is provided here so you can compare your own times for each build order execution as you practise .
It also outputs the build order to a text file with the players names in the bwapi-data folder .
Do not open the text file while the game is going or it will crash .
It 's safer for you to rename the text file to a unique name because the name is based on the 2 players .
It 's possible that it will be overridden by another game with the same players .

Chat commands
/ count < unit name >
Entering this will make the AI count all the units with the specified name .
The entered name has to be contained in the actual name of the unit .
/ follow < unit name >
This will make your screen constantly follow the biggest group of the unit entered .
You lose control of the screen until you type / unfollow .
This is pretty entertaining for watching muta harass .
E.g
Entering / follow muta when there 's a group of 7 mutas will make your screen constantly follow that group until a bigger group of mutas appear somewhere else or / unfollow
/unfollow
explained above .
/ find < unit name >
Moves your screen to the the biggest group of the specified unit in the game currently .
/ highlight < unit name >
Covers all the units with the specified name with a bright retina burning cyan .
The command / hon must be typed before this can be used .

Turns off highlighting , but the next time / hon is called , the previously highlighted unit will still be highlighted , where as /unhighlight does n't remember the previously highlighted unit
/ clear
Turns off everything .
/ all
Turns on everything .
/ macro or / ma
Toggles macro info .

The infamous iphone hacker , GEORGE HOTZ ( geohot ) , has done it again , and he is claiming that he has completely hacked the ps3 .
Correct me if I ’m wrong , as far as I understand he has managed to decrypt all of the PS3 XMB info ( except the keys ) which can give homebrew developers the ability to make apps for ps3 as well as possibly running a custom firmware .
Kudos to geohot for his achievement .

A bitter irony engulfs the Australian Government 's stance on video game classification .
Australia remains one of the only Western nations without an adult ( R18 + ) classification for video games , meaning those games whose content is deemed unsuitable for those over the age of 15 are refused classification and ultimately banned for sale .
Ignoring international criticism and cries of censorship , the Government remains adamant that the introduction of an R18 + classification for video games in Australia will allow extremely violent and sexual material to fall into the hands of children and vulnerable adults .
But this is already happening .
The lack of an R18 + classification is forcing the Classification Board of Australia to leave classification decisions pertaining to video games with contentious material to the discretion of its board members , rather than the guidelines laid out in the National Classification Scheme , resulting in often inconsistent and unpredictable rating decisions .
Video games that should otherwise be rated R18 + are slumped into the MA15 + category , and games that should otherwise be MA15 + are refused classification altogether .
The only way out is to introduce an R18 + classification for video games and fall in step with the rest of the world ; the only thing standing in the way is public ignorance of the issue .
An R 18 + rating will help parents judge what 's appropriate for their children .
An R18 + discussion paper was first proposed in March 2008 by federal , state , and territory attorneys - general , who finally agreed to consult the public on the video game classification issue .
Australia 's gaming community sat up and took notice : finally , a chance to have their say .
But the discussion paper was delayed twice over the course of almost two years .
At the helm of these continual upsets was South Australian Attorney - General Michael Atkinson , a fervent opponent of the R18 + classification whose stance is mirrored by a handful of other attorneys - general who wish to remain anonymous .
Their collective view is that video games differ to films and other forms of media because of their interactivity , which can have more of an impact on those who consume their content .
It 's on this point more than any other that Atkinson and his colleagues have so determinedly fought with the Australian gaming community : the community has repeatedly pointed to the fact that no real scientific proof exists to show that the interactivity of video games has a negative effect on those who consume the medium .
In late December last year the Government finally released the discussion paper and Australians have until February 28 to respond on the federal Attorney - General 's website .

Helping themselves by helping others
THE 107 m Americans who tuned in to watch the Super Bowl on February 7th did not see any advertisements for Pepsi .
Instead of spending $ 20 m on a handful of 30 - second spots , the firm decided to give that amount away .
Under the slogan “ Refresh Everything ” , the Pepsi Refresh campaign asks the public to vote online for charities and community groups to receive grants ranging from $ 5,000 to $ 250,000 .
A few days before the game its arch-rival , Coca - Cola , was also bitten by a charitable bug .
It promised to give $ 1 to the Boys & Girls Clubs of America every time someone watched its Super Bowl ads on its Facebook page , up to a maximum of $ 250,000 .
Pepsi Refresh is probably the most prominent example so far of “ cause marketing ” — trying to win customers by ostentatiously doing good .
Other recent examples include Chase Community Giving , in which small charities competed to win $ 5 m in donations from JPMorgan Chase , and American Express and NBC Universal 's “ Shine A Light ” programme , which awarded a grant of $ 100,000 to a small business chosen through its website .
Marketing people say consumers are increasingly trying to do good as they spend .
Research in 2008 by Cone , a brand consultancy , found that 79 % of consumers would switch to a brand associated with a good cause , up from 66 % in 1993 , and that 38 % have bought a product associated with a cause , compared with 20 % in 1993 .
Rather than try to make products that can be marketed as ethical in their own right , such as “ fair trade ” goods , firms are increasingly trying to take an ordinary product and boost its moral credentials with what one marketing guru calls “ embedded generosity ” .
The fad for online competitions to award the handouts also appeals to another trend , so - called “ slacktivism ” , whereby people are turning to the internet to give their consciences a boost without doing anything more onerous than clicking a mouse a few times .
The strategy seems to be working , judging by the proliferation of articles ( such as this one ) noting Pepsi 's campaign .
JPMorgan
Chase claims its campaign was not marketing , but simply an attempt to manage its existing corporate philanthropy more imaginatively .
If so , its marketing staff are missing a trick , given that around 2 m people signed up to vote on Facebook , many of whom were not existing Chase customers .
Moreover , the favourable headlines generated by Chase 's $ 5 m outlay contrasted strikingly with the grudging reaction to Goldman Sachs 's launch around the same time of a $ 500 m campaign to support small businesses .
Although the public likes online popularity contests , they can have unintended consequences .
Chase , for example , caused a fuss by excluding a pro-life group and an outfit that wants to legalise cannabis from its competition .
Moreover , many firms see virtue in tying themselves to a particular cause .
Ten firms , including Gap , Apple and most recently Nike , have deals with ( RED ) , a scheme fronted by Bono , a rock star , to raise money to fight AIDS .
It has raised $ 140 m so far , despite fears that , as Susan Smith Ellis , its boss , puts it , “ it would be just a big launch on Oprah then never heard of again . ”
Equally , Pepsi's efforts to promote healthy lifestyles while selling healthier products and Coca - Cola 's various initiatives to protect water supplies in developing countries are critical to the pair 's future .
Refreshing everything , in contrast , is a more nebulous goal .

If your home has a lot of interior doors that lock , sooner or later you ’re bound to lose the key , lock it inside the room , or discover your toddler has locked himself in and can not get out .
Calling a locksmith each time is inconvenient ( and expensive ) ; instead , you can learn to pick your own locks .

If the doorknob in question is a simple push - button affair , you ’re in luck .
Most of the time , all you need to do is jab a paperclip in the hole and push on the locking mechanism .
If the doorknob has a slit on the outside handle , a butter knife should do the trick .
Keyed locks are a bit trickier to open .
But it can be done .
The paperclip and tension wrench method
The easiest approach is to grab a paperclip and tension wrench .
If you do n’t have a tension wrench handy , a very small hex key ( or even the opposite end of the paperclip ) will do in a pinch .
The wrench maintains the tension on the lock while the paperclip does the picking .

WikiHow tells us what to do next :
First insert the tension wrench into the bottom part of the lock , and rotate it in the direction you would turn the key to unlock it to place tension on the lock .
Maintain this tension throughout the process .
Then slowly wiggle the pick into the top part of the lock using a gentle up - and - down motion .
You should hear a series of clicks as the various pins in the lock are raised .
When you have successfully raised all of the pins , the tension wrench will suddenly rotate freely and unlock the door .

The credit card method
Some lever - type doorknobs respond nicely to the credit card treatment .
The trick , though , is to pick the right card .
Do not use your credit or debit card ; it could get damaged in the process .
Instead , wikiHow recommends choosing a card that is less important and is stiff but somewhat flexible , such as a grocery store loyalty card or a laminated library card .

Then , start pickin’ :
Take the card , and slide it into the gap between the door and the doorjamb .
Begin just above the door handle , and slide the card downwards and in .
You may have to wiggle it a bit , but if you are lucky , the card will press against the latch assembly and allow you to open the door

Lean against the door while you do this ; putting a little weight on it can help it pop open .
The “ I ’m out of options ” methods
If you want to go all MacGyver on the locked door — and who does n’t ? — grab a vacuum cleaner , some dental floss , and a piece of paper .
Use this step - by - step guide over at Instructables to show that locked door who ’s boss .

The guide ’s writer , Hackzorz , does give us a helpful disclaimer for this method , which is worth noting : “ Please do n’t use this to break into people ’s rooms .
You ’re just going to get caught ; it takes several minutes and is very obvious . ”
Sometimes , no matter what you do , the lock just wo n’t budge .
In that event , it ’s time to remove the entire assembly .
Slide a butter knife under the collar where the doorknob meets the door and pop the collar loose so you can get at the screws holding the doorknob together .
Once the screws are removed , the doorknob will come apart and you ’ll be able to easily slide back the mechanism holding the door closed .
Advertisement
And if all else fails , there ’s nothing a hammer wo n’t fix .
First , give the doorknob itself several good poundings until it ’s good and dented .
( This does absolutely nothing to help unlock the door , but it feels good . )

“ Please do n’t use this to break into people ’s rooms .
You ’re just going to get caught ; it takes several minutes and is very obvious . ”
Next , insert the claw end of the hammer underneath the top of the doorknob ’s collar .
Put a stiff piece of cardboard where the hammer meets the door to protect the paint .
Cover the knob with a thick towel in case metal parts go flying , then yank the hammer down hard .
Do this a couple of times until the screws holding the doorknob together snap .
It ’s very possible to damage your door with this method , so let ’s consider this a last resort .

When you go to the hardware store to buy a new locking doorknob , be sure to have some spare keys made while you ’re there .
This story was originally published on 2/5/10 and was updated on 7/26/19 to provide more thorough and current information .
The human brain is adept at anticipating upcoming events , but in a rapidly changing world , it is essential to detect and encode events that violate these expectancies .
Unexpected events are more likely to be remembered than predictable events , but the underlying neural mechanisms for these effects remain unclear .
We report intracranial EEG recordings from the hippocampus of epilepsy patients , and from the nucleus accumbens of depression patients .
We found that unexpected stimuli enhance an early ( 187 ms ) and a late ( 482 ms ) hippocampal potential , and that the late potential is associated with successful memory encoding for these stimuli .
Recordings from the nucleus accumbens revealed a late potential ( peak at 475 ms ) , which increases in magnitude during unexpected items , but no subsequent memory effect and no early component .
These results are consistent with the hypothesis that activity in a loop involving the hippocampus and the nucleus accumbens promotes encoding of unexpected events .
We examined the effect of unpredicted events on memory by using a version of the “ Von Restorff ” paradigm ( ) in which participants studied pictures of faces and houses shown in grayscale against a red or green background ( Figure 1 ) .
While the majority of items came from one category ( “ expected items ; ” e.g. , faces on a red background ) , a small proportion of interleaved stimuli came from the other category ( “ unexpected items ; ” e.g. , houses on a green background ) in a balanced design ( see Supplemental Information ) .
Participants were subsequently tested on memory for the expected and unexpected items from each list , allowing us to examine encoding activity as a function of subsequent memory performance .
The paradigm included a Study Phase ( encoding of items , top ) and a Test Phase ( retrieval , bottom ) .
In both phases , a majority of items belonged to one category with respect to background color and content ( expected items ; e.g. , red faces ) , while a minority of items were deviant ( unexpected items ; e.g. , green houses ) .
See also Table S1 for behavioral data .
Here , we report results of intracranial electroencephalography ( EEG ) studies aimed at clarifying the relationship between novelty processing and memory formation in the hippocampus and nucleus accumbens .
Two groups of patients participated in this study : one group of eight patients with medication - resistant epilepsy had electrodes implanted in the hippocampus in order to localize the seizure foci .
Another group of six patients had electrodes implanted in the nucleus accumbens for an experimental trial of deep brain stimulation for medically intractable depression ( ) .
More details about the participants are provided in the Supplemental Information , available online .
A critical function of the human brain is to extract patterns from recent events in order to generate predictions about the future ( ) .
Violations of such predictions activate a distributed network involved in orienting to and encoding novel events , thereby resulting in enhanced memory formation ( ) .
According to one model based on animal studies , the hippocampus may initially compute a novelty signal ( as the difference between a predicted stimulus and an actual stimulus ) , which is propagated to the nucleus accumbens ( ) .
The nucleus accumbens — in close interaction with the dopaminergic midbrain ( e.g. , ) — is thought to relay information about expectancy , salience , and goal information , thereby influencing dopaminergic modulation of hippocampal long - term potentiation and encoding of unexpected stimuli or events ( ) .
This model predicts two neural signatures of expectancy in the hippocampus , an earlier and a later one ; the later one should be associated with enhanced memory for unexpected items .
Furthermore , it predicts that an expectancy signal is computed in the hippocampus first and then transferred to the nucleus accumbens .
These predictions on the temporal order in which novelty and memory are computed in different brain structures remain to be tested , however .
Second , we calculated single - trial amplitude covariance between activity in epilepsy and depression patients .
Our reasoning for this relatively unusual measure of between - subject amplitude correlation was that the specific temporal pattern of expected and unexpected items would induce systematic fluctuations of EEG amplitudes — e.g. , related to primacy , recency , and temporal variations of expectations ( ) .
These fluctuations should be visible both in the hippocampus and in the nucleus accumbens , because in each patient , identical sequences of items were presented in corresponding blocks .
We thus calculated correlations across trials for all pairs of hippocampal and nucleus accumbens patients .
Only corresponding trials which were free of artifacts in both patients of each pair were analyzed .
Again , we predicted that hippocampal activity between 150 and 250 ms should be maximally correlated with nucleus accumbens activity around 300 ms later .
Figure 4
C shows that we observed a peak correlation at a latency of around 300 – 400 ms .
In all but one pair , correlation values ( calculated as for the within - subject analysis ) were significant ( mean R : 0.206 ; range : 0.169–0.303 ; range of p values : 0.0001 –0.047 ) .
The data presented thus far only provide indirect evidence for hippocampal - accumbens information transfer , because the nucleus accumbens and hippocampal ERPs were recorded in separate patient groups .
However , two additional analyses were conducted to assess functional connectivity in our data .
First , we used data from two epilepsy patients who were implanted not only with hippocampal depth electrodes , but also with extensive subdural strip and grid electrodes ( >100 electrode contacts ; see Figure S2 ) , to conduct a source analysis of activity within the nucleus accumbens ( ; see Supplemental Experimental Procedures ) .
In this analysis , nucleus accumbens activity was estimated using activity from subdural grid and strip electrodes ( not from hippocampal depth electrodes ) as input .
In both patients , the reconstructed time courses of activity within the nucleus accumbens were qualitatively very similar to the time courses of nucleus accumbens activity measured in the depression patients ( Figure 4 A ) .
Unexpected items elicited larger components in the same time window as for the measured data .
In these two patients , we calculated functional connectivity between the ( measured ) hippocampal activity and the ( reconstructed ) nucleus accumbens activity .
The hypothesis that unexpected information is detected in the hippocampus and transferred to the nucleus accumbens predicts that activity around the early hippocampal component ( peaking at 187 ms ) is correlated with the later component in the nucleus accumbens ( with a peak at 475 ms ) .
Thus , hippocampal activity at around 150 – 250 ms should correlate with activity around 300 ms later in the nucleus accumbens .
We thus calculated cross-correlations across trials ( i.e. , single - trial amplitude covariance ; e.g. , ) for hippocampal activity around the early component ( between 150 and 250 ms ) with all time points in the nucleus accumbens .
Next , for each of these hippocampal time points , we searched for the nucleus accumbens time point with the maximal correlation value .
Figure 4
B depicts the latency between hippocampal and nucleus accumbens time points with maximal correlation .
In both patients , we found that hippocampal activity in this time window correlated highest with nucleus accumbens activity 200 –400 ms later , consistent with the predicted lag of 300 ms .
Notably , latencies were relatively constant across several tens of milliseconds in this time interval ( see the plateaus of latency values ) , indicating that contiguous amplitude values in the hippocampus are maximally correlated with contiguous amplitude values in the nucleus accumbens .
To assess the significance of this correlation , we calculated average correlation values during this plateau — i.e. , averaged across all points in time between 150 and 250 ms when latencies were between 200 and 400 ms .
Indeed , we found a significant correlation in this range in both patients ( patient 1 : R = 0.183 ; t= 3.05 ; p < 0.005 ; patient 2 : R = 0.1251 ; t= 2.106 ; p < 0.05 ) .
See also Figure S2 for implantation schemes of the two patients with reconstructed nucleus accumbens activity .
( B) Latency of ( estimated ) nucleus accumbens activity with maximal cross-correlation to ( recorded ) hippocampal activity around the peak of the early novelty response in the hippocampus .
To further explore the neural signature underlying processing of unexpected items , we conducted time - frequency analyses of activity within the hippocampus and nucleus accumbens .
As shown in Figure 3 A , the most pronounced difference between processing of unexpected and expected items in the hippocampus was an early ( 200 –400 ms ) increase and later ( 500 – 1400 ms ) decrease of theta band activity , and an increase between 500 –700 ms and 1000 – 1100 ms in the high gamma ( 70–90 Hz ) frequency range ( statistical analyses are described in the Supplemental Results ) .
( A) Theta ( 3–8 Hz ) power is first ( 200 –400 ms ) increased and later ( 500 –1400 ms ) decreased during processing of unexpected as compared with expected items in the hippocampus .
Higher ( 70–90 Hz ) gamma power is selectively increased in the hippocampus during processing of unexpected items between 500 –700 and 1000 – 1100 ms .
The color bar applies to all power plots .
As noted above , some models suggest that the late - onset expectancy effects in the hippocampus might be modulated by a saliency signal conveyed by the nucleus accumbens ( ) .
We therefore investigated electrophysiological correlates of expectancy processing in the patients with electrodes in this region .
Visual inspection of the EEG traces recorded within the nucleus accumbens revealed a negative deflection with a latency of 475.2 ± 177.2 ms ( mean ± SEM ; Figure 2 B ) .
This ERP component was significantly larger for unexpected compared with expected items ( t= 3.82 ; p < 0.05 ) .
A two - way ANOVA on this component revealed no main effect of memory ( F= 0.171 ; p > 0.6 ) and no interaction ( F= 0.274 ; p > 0.6 ) .
Furthermore , no early potential as in the hippocampus became apparent , and statistical comparison of expected and unexpected trials in the same window as in the hippocampus did not reveal a difference ( t= 0.52 ; p > 0.5 ) .
Event - related potentials ( ERPs ) recorded from the hippocampus revealed an early positive peak at 186.9 ± 16.7 ms ( mean ± SEM ) and a later negative peak at 481.5 ± 63.3 ms , which resembled the hippocampal P300 potential ( ) .
Both components were significantly larger during processing of unexpected as compared with expected stimuli ( early component : t= 2.64 ; p < 0.05 ; late component : t= 3.91 ; p < 0.01 ; Figure 2 A ) .
Effects of repeat items are shown in Figure S1 .
Moreover , a two - way ANOVA for the late component with “ expectancy ” and “ memory ” as repeated - measures revealed a significant main effect of expectancy ( F= 9.64 ; p < 0.05 ) and a highly significant expectancy × memory interaction ( F= 12.92 ; p < 0.01 ) , but no main effect of memory ( F= 3.31 ; p > 0.1 ) .
Subsequent two - tailed t tests revealed an increased late potential during encoding of subsequently remembered as compared with forgotten unexpected items ( t= 2.72 ; p < 0.05 ) , but no subsequent memory effect for expected items ( t= 0.07 ; p > 0.9 ) .
A similar analysis on the early component revealed no significant effect of memory ( F= 3.45 , p > 0.1 ) and no expectancy × memory interaction ( F= 1.07 , p > 0.1 ) .

( Aii and Aiii ) The late ERP component in the hippocampus reflects the interaction of expectancy and subsequent memory .
Corrected recognition scores ( confident hits minus false alarms ) in epilepsy patients were significantly better for unexpected than for expected items ( 29.9 ± 6.7 versus 20.5 % ± 4.3 % ; t= 2.49 ; p < 0.05 ) .
This difference was in the same direction in the group of depression patients , although it was not statistically significant ( 25.9 % ± 5.4 % versus 22.2 % ± 4.6 % ; t= 0.54 ; p = 0.66 ) .
The nonsignificant Von Restorff effect in depression patients is probably due to the relatively low sample size ( see Supplemental Information for further information ) .
Moreover , a two - way ANOVA revealed that performance in the two groups was not significantly different ( F= 0.03 ; p = 0.87 ) , and that there was no interaction between group and unexpected versus expected items ( F= 0.475 ; p = 0.5 ) ( for details , see Table S1 , available online ) .
In both groups , reaction times during encoding ( i.e. , related to the pleasant / unpleasant rating of items ) were significantly slower for unexpected than expected items ( epilepsy patients : t= 3.88 ; p < 0.01 ; depression patients : t= 2.98 ; p < 0.05 ) , suggesting that expectancy was processed similarly .

The hippocampal - VTA loop : controlling the entry of information into long - term memory .
Our findings show that it is possible to estimate the relative sequence of processes in the human hippocampus and nucleus accumbens : whereas the early hippocampal and the ( later ) nucleus accumbens components were modulated only by expectancy , the late hippocampal component was correlated with both expectancy and subsequent memory , and likely reflects the interaction of these processes .
Thus , our data are in close agreement with the model by .
They are consistent with the idea that hippocampal activity may initially signal the occurrence of an unexpected event , and that the nucleus accumbens may influence subsequent hippocampal processing , which serves to promote memory encoding .

In a previous study using a word - list learning paradigm , found subsequent memory effects on late positive potentials in the hippocampus .
These effects were not observed in the current study , possibly due to differences in task characteristics and material : first , no manipulation of expectancy was conducted in the Fernández study ; second , words instead of pictorial stimuli were used ; finally , free recall was tested in the study by Fernández and colleagues , which depends on conscious access to a memory trace , whereas we measured recognition memory .
The latter difference might be particularly important because recognition memory in our study may rely on both stimulus familiarity and conscious recollection ( ) .

Buzsáki , 2002 Buzsáki G. Theta oscillations in the hippocampus .
Supplementary time - frequency analyses demonstrated a role for hippocampal theta and high gamma oscillations in processing of unexpected information .
The initial increase and subsequent decrease in hippocampal theta for unexpected events are possibly related to the late hippocampal component , which has a frequency composition in the delta / theta band .
Indeed , a previous intracranial EEG study using an oddball paradigm showed that the hippocampal P300 component was associated with an early ( 200 –500 ms ) increase and a later ( 500 –1000 ms ) decrease in theta power ( ) , very similar to the results from our current study .
Hippocampal theta activity in rats depends on at least two different generators ( reviewed in ) .
Inputs from the entorhinal cortex induce theta oscillations that persist after antagonism to muscarinergic acetylcholine .
In contrast , projections from the medial band of broca and septum cause a tonic cholinergic excitation and phasic GABAergic inhibition of hippocampal basket cells , which induce rhythmic inhibitory postsynaptic potentials in the theta frequency range on their target pyramidal cells in the CA1 region .

One limitation of our study is that nucleus accumbens and hippocampal activity were recorded in two different groups of subjects , and therefore the data only provide an indirect measure of functional connectivity between these brain regions .
This is a necessity , however , because the location of electrode placements in human patients must be dictated solely by clinical considerations , and to our knowledge , there are no conditions that would require electrode placement in both hippocampus and nucleus accumbens .
To indirectly address the idea that novelty information is transferred from the hippocampus to the nucleus accumbens , we calculated cross-correlations between hippocampal amplitudes around the time of the early potential with estimated nucleus accumbens time courses ( in the same patients ) and measured activity in the depression patients .
Results from both analyses are consistent with the proposed information transfer from the hippocampus to the nucleus accumbens , but correlations between the nucleus accumbens component and the late hippocampal potential were less clear ( see Supplemental Information ) .
However , it should be noted that both measures have their limitations .
Time courses in the nucleus accumbens were estimated using anatomically defined regions of interest in patients with extensive implantation schemes .
Although source analyses based on intracranial EEG data are most likely more accurate than source reconstruction based on surface EEG because they avoid the spatial low - pass filter properties of the skin and bone ( e.g. , ) , reconstruction of activity from deep brain structures is notoriously difficult .
The estimated time courses in the nucleus accumbens resembled those that were recorded in depression patients ; however , a validation of this analysis in animals with both subdural and nucleus accumbens electrodes would be useful .
Our second analysis — correlation of amplitudes between subjects relying on joint intertrial variability across the experiment — is complicated by the variability of single - trial responses between subjects .
Again , it would be necessary to test this approach in animals with electrodes in both regions .
In summary , whereas the early hippocampal and the later nucleus accumbens components were modulated only by expectancy , the late hippocampal component was modulated by both expectancy and subsequent memory .
We suggest that this later process reflects the interaction of novelty signaling and memory encoding .
Taken together , these results speak to the relative timing of expectation effects in different regions of the human brain , and they support models of accumbens - hippocampus interactions during encoding of unexpected events .
If you are like the majority of Americans , you are expecting to receive a tax refund when you file your taxes .
So what exactly is a tax refund ?
It is NOT winning some sort of income tax lottery , nor is your Uncle Sam sending you some special “ government money ” .
It is simply a refund .
Because you overpaid your taxes , the government , after keeping your money all year long , is giving it back to you .
What should you do with Your Tax Refund ?
It depends , but answering the following questions will establish your priorities :
Are you behind on any payments ?
If so , get caught up with any and all creditors .
One caveat : if your debt has been turned over to a collection agency , you should try to settle the debt .
Many will agree to accept a fraction of the original debt .
Just make sure you do n’t send them any money until you have a letter from them stating that the agreed to payment will “ settle the debt in full ” .
And make sure you understand the best ways to send money when you do make that payment .
Do you have any insurance payments or property taxes that will need to be paid ?
If you do n’t have the money already set aside , then put your refund where you wo n’t touch it and obligate it for those payments .
Do you have debt ?
Using the refund to pay off debt ( other than mortgage debt ) is a great thing to do with your refund .
Paying off a 20 % interest rate credit card is the same as earning a 20 % return on your money .
Using all of your refund on debt reduction might not be exciting , but will give you a great feeling of knowing you are closer to being debt free .
How big is your emergency fund ?
If you have no debt other than your house , you should consider adding to your emergency fund until you have at least six months of expenses saved up .
If you were to get injured or lose your job unexpectedly , that emergency fund will serve you well .
Are you investing enough for retirement ?
Assuming you have no debt except your house , and that you have six months of expenses set aside for emergencies , you might want to use your refund to boost your retirement investments .
However , because you are doing so well with your finances , you might want to use some of the refund to have fun with .
Enjoy !
Why should you lose it ?
I am not talking about literally losing the money , but I do think you should lose the practice of getting that big refund .
Think about it : the government has been using your money all year for free .
If you get an average refund ( $ 2831 in 2018 ) , you could be taking home an extra $ 235 + a month instead .
This is money you could be using to stay current on debt , pay extra on debt , build your emergency fund or invest more for retirement .
If you have been getting close to the same refund year after year , you need to adjust your W - 4 to start getting less refund and more take home pay .
But …a warning :

The European Digital Rights Initiative has put together an extensive FAQ on last night 's leaked text from the Anti-Counterfeiting Trade Agreement ( ACTA , the secret copyright treaty whose seventh round of negotiations just concluded in Mexico ) .
It 's an excellent analysis from the point of view of EU law and standards , and discusses the way that this draft shows that the European Parliament has been misled on the substance of the negotiations .
Additionally , the European Data Protection Supervisor ( EU 's highest authority on
privacy ) has declared against ACTA and has criticized the Commission for undertaking to negotiate it .
Paoli Brini adds , " This is very important because tomorrow there will
probably be a confrontation / hearing with a series of oral questions from
the Parliament to the Commission , some of those questions should put the
Commission in an awkward position ( the Commission delegates of the DG
Trade are the leader negotiators for ACTA in Europe ) . "

Is it money laundering to take donations from your political action committee and convert them into a royalties check through your publisher ?
Not if you are Alaska ’s favorite half - term governor .
Sarah Palin , the former politician turned Fox News contributor , spent $ 63,000 of SarahPAC ’s money on copies of her book , “ Going Rogue , ” an ABC News report revealed on Monday .

“ Is that money laundering ? ” MSNBC host Keith Olbermann asked liberal blog publisher Arianna Huffington during a Monday night broadcast .
“ It certainly is , ” she replied .
However , because she no longer holds public office and is not currently seeking election , Palin ’s SarahPAC is not subject to the rules applied to PACs supporting most politicians .
Because of this , “ her PAC is free to purchase the book under current law , according to Jan Baran , a campaign legal expert , ” ABC News noted .
A Palin spokeswoman told the network that the books were autographed and sent to SarahPAC donors who gave more than $ 100 .
“ The payments went to Harper Collins , her publisher , and in some instances to HSP Direct , a Virginia - based direct mail fundraising firm that serves a number of well - known conservative politicians and pundits , ” ABC News added .

The network also noted another $ 20,000 was sent from SarahPAC to Harper Collins to pay Palin ’s personal photographer and another aide to accompany her on the book tour .
An additional $ 8,000 in SarahPAC donations was spent producing bookmarks , ABC News reported .
“ Going Rogue , ” prepared by a ghostwriter , was delivered to eager readers on Nov. 17 , 2009 , after she and Sen. John McCain ( R - AZ ) failed in their bid to win the U.S. presidency .
It was ranked as a New York Times best seller even before it was available for purchase .
Right - wing groups such as the Conservative Book Club and Newsmax helped , in part , to fuel the meteoric rise in sales by placing large bulk orders , then essentially giving copies away to new members or subscribers .

The Associated Press lashed Palin ’s book for “ ignoring substantial parts of her record ” and “ Going Rogue ” on many facts , from obscuring truth in how she portrayed herself to fudging facts on contemporary political issues .
A CBS News poll released in January found that a whopping 71 percent of Republican voters do not want her to run for the party ’s 2012 presidential nomination to face President Barack Obama in the general election .
Overall , just 26 percent of respondents said they have a “ positive ” view of the one - time elected official .

SarahPAC claimed over $ 2 million in donations at the end of 2009 .
Approximately $ 65,000 went to Palin - friendly candidates , while over $ 1 million paid for her travel and related expenses .
Approximately $ 1.4 million was raised in the second half of the year , according to the Associated Press .
PoliticsUSA has a complete breakdown of the claimed expenditures .
Palin has said if “ God ” tells her to run for president in 2012 , she will .
This version corrects a typographical error that placed the next presidential election in 2010 .
One of the new features we are preparing for the next version of IDA is the ability to write processor modules using your favorite scripting language .
After realizing how handy it is to write file loaders using scripting languages , we set out to making the same thing for processor modules .
As an exercise for this new feature , we implemented a processor module for the EFI bytecode .
Background
In IDA Pro , a processor module implementation is usually split into four parts :
Processor , assembler , instructions and registers definitions ( ins.cpp/.hpp , reg.cpp ) Decoder ( ana.cpp ) : decodes an instruction into an insn_t structure ( the ‘ cmd ’ global variable ) Emulation ( emu.cpp ) : emulates instructions , creates appropriate cross references , traces the stack , recognizes code patterns , etc… Output ( out.cpp ) : outputs the result to the screen
The processor module is described using the processor_t structure .
It holds pointers to registers , instructions , processor module name and other callbacks ( ana , emu , out , notify , … ) .
The assembler is described using the asm_t structure .
It holds pointers to the assembler syntax and other callbacks .
Writing a processor module in Python
To write a processor module in Python , we follow similar logic .
Write the get_idp_desc ( ) function .
It simply tells IDA what processors the module can handle .
def get_idp_desc( ) : return " EFI Byte code:ebc "
The return value means that this processor is named “ EFI Byte code ” and its shortname is “ ebc ” .
Thus a subsequent call to set_processor_type( ‘ebc ’ ) from the part of a file loader will succeed .
In case of the pc processor module , which can handle many variations of x86 architecture , the string looks like this : Intel 80x86 processors : 8086:80286r:80286p:80386r:80386 p :...
Define the registers and instructions : # Registers definition proc_Registers = [ # General purpose registers " R0 " , " R1 " , ... , " R10 " , ... ] # Instructions definition proc_Instructions = [ {' name ' : ' INSN1 ' , ' feature ' : CF_USE1} , {' name ' : ' INSN2 ' , ' feature ' : CF_USE1 | CF_CHG1} ... ]
Write the get_idp_def ( ) function .
It should return a dictionary similar to the processor_t structure with the processor , assembler , instructions and registers definitions .
#
This function returns the processor module definition def get_idp_def ( ) : return { ' version ' : IDP_INTERFACE_VERSION , # IDP id ' id ' : 0x8000 + 1 , # Processor features ' flag ' : PR_USE32 | PRN_HEX | PR_RNAMESOK , # short processor names #
Each name should be shorter than 9 characters ' psnames ' : [ 'ebc ' ] , # long processor names #
No restriction on name lengthes .
' plnames ' : [ ' EFI Byte code ' ] , # number of registers ' regsNum ' : len( proc_Registers ) , # register names ' regNames ' : proc_Registers , # Array of instructions ' instruc ' : proc_Instructions , .... ' assembler ' : \ { # flag ' flag ' : ASH_HEXF3 | AS_UNEQU | AS_COLON | ASB_BINF4 | AS_N2CHR , # Assembler name ( displayed in menus ) ' name ' : " EFI bytecode assembler " , ... # byte directive ' a_byte ' : " db " , # word directive ' a_word ' : " dw " , # remove if not allowed ' a_dword ' : " dd " , ... } # Assembler }
Now that we finished all the declarations , we can implement the decoder ( or analyzer ) , emulator and the output callbacks .
The analyzer looks like this : def ph_ana ( ) : " " " Decodes an instruction into the global variable ' cmd '
Current address is pre-filled in cmd.ea " " " cmd = idaapi.cmd # take opcode byte b = ua_next_byte ( ) # decode and fill cmd .
Operands etc ... # ... # Return decoded instruction size or zero return cmd.size
And decoding one instruction / filling the ‘ cmd ’ variable may look like this : def decode_JMP8 ( opbyte , cmd ) : conditional = ( opbyte & 0x80 ) != 0 cs = ( opbyte & 0x40 ) != 0 cmd.Op1.type = o_near cmd.Op1.dtyp = dt_byte addr = ua_next_byte ( ) cmd.Op1.addr = ( as_signed ( addr , 8 ) * 2 ) + cmd.size + cmd.ea if conditional : cmd.auxpref = FL_CS if cs else FL_NCS return True
The emulator : # Emulate instruction , create cross-references , plan to analyze # subsequent instructions , modify flags etc .
Upon entrance to this function # all information about the instruction is in ' cmd ' structure .
#
If zero is returned , the kernel will delete the instruction .
def ph_emu ( ) : aux = cmd.auxpref Feature = cmd.get_canon_feature( ) if Feature & CF_USE1 : handle_operand(cmd.Op1 , 1 ) if Feature & CF_CHG1 : handle_operand(cmd.Op1 , 0 ) if Feature & CF_USE2 : handle_operand(cmd.Op2 , 1 ) if Feature & CF_CHG2 : handle_operand(cmd.Op2 , 0 ) if Feature & CF_JUMP : QueueMark ( Q_jumps , cmd.ea ) # add flow xref if Feature & CF_STOP == 0 : ua_add_cref( 0 , cmd.ea + cmd.size , fl_F ) return 1
The output callback : # Generate text representation of an instruction in ' cmd ' structure .
#
This function should n't change the database , flags or anything else .
#
All these actions should be performed only by ph_emu( ) function . def ph_out ( ) : cmd = idaapi.cmd #
Init output buffer buf = idaapi.init_output_buffer( 1024 ) # First , output the instruction mnemonic OutMnem ( ) #
Output the first operand if present ( this invokes the ph_outop callback ) out_one_operand ( 0 ) #
Output the rest of the operands for i in xrange ( 1 , 3 ) : op = cmd [ i ] if op. type == o_void : break out_symbol ( ' , ') OutChar ( ' ') out_one_operand ( i ) # Terminate the output buffer term_output_buffer ( ) # Emit the line cvar.gl_comm = 1 MakeLine ( buf )
Note that the previous callbacks are very similar to their C language counterparts .
Although this feature will not work with the current version of IDA Pro , you can download the EBC script sample for a preview of how a module would look .

" Israeli Arabs will not lose anything by joining the Palestinian state .
Instead of giving the Palestinians empty land in the Negev , we are offering them land full of residents , who will not have to leave their homes , " said Deputy Foreign Minister Daniel Ayalon in an interview to London - based al - Sharq al - Awsat newspaper published on Saturday .
The deputy FM also stated that " demanding Israel stop building in settlements is like demanding the Palestinians give up the right of return for refugees . "
Index Poll : 77 % of ' Soviet ' olim support Arab transfer Ynet Survey conducted by Israel Democracy Institute focuses on integration of immigrants from former Soviet Union into Israeli society after 20 years of aliyah .
2009 Democracy
Index finds immigrants tend to be more hawkish , believe less in Israeli democracy , and are much more pessimistic .
Poll : 77 % of ' Soviet ' olim support Arab transfer
" We say we expect national solidarity as Israelis , both from Jews and non-Jews …
We respect the Arabs just as we wish they respect us .
We have nothing against them .
We are talking about a land exchange , " Ayalon said , commenting on the platform of the Yisrael Beiteinu party of which he is a member .
" We say , ' Why give the Arabs ( the Palestinians ) empty land in the Negev , why not give them land full of residents ? '
These residents will not have to leave their homes . "
When asked if he was referring to the concentration of Arab towns and villages known as the Triangle region , he said : " Yes .
Why not ?
If the Arabs in Israel say they are proud of being Palestinian , why should n't they be proud of being part of the Palestinian state ?
" They will lose nothing by joining it , and in addition , this will be in the interest of the Palestinian state , since they are economically and socially developed and will be able to use their experience to help build the state . "
The interviewer , Ali a - Saleh went one step further and asked Ayalon why Israel does n't include Nazareth in the land exchange if it already plans to trade off the Triangle and Umm al - Fahm .
" If you want to get rid of the Arabs in Israel , why not include all the Arabs ? " he asked .
In response Ayalon said , " I am talking about areas where there is geographical continuity ( to the Palestinian state ) .
Any area close to the border can be included in this plan . "
The interviewer pointed out that Nazareth is located close to the Palestinian city of Jenin .
In response Ayalon said , " We do not want to get into surgical procedures .
The important thing is to accept the idea that the majority of Jews live in Israel and the majority of Arabs live in Palestine . "
' Settlements not obstacle to peace '
On attempts to renew peace talks , Ayalon said he does not believes settlements will pose an obstacle to peace .
" I believe the notion that settlements are an obstacle to peace is an exaggeration .
We have proven in the past that the settlements have no impact on the results .
An example of this is the retreat from Sinai and the dismantlement of the settlement of Yamit , which was carried out by Ariel Sharon himself , as well as the decision of the Likud government headed by Sharon to withdraw from the Gaza Strip and dismantle the settlements in 2005 .
" The settlements will not be a problem if there is a good agreement .
A good agreement is an agreement in which the two countries enjoy security and stability and will live side by side in cooperation , coordination and security . "
When asked why Israel does not freeze construction in settlements as proof of its good intentions , he said , " These are unfair words since demanding Israel stop construction is like demanding the Palestinians give up the right of return for refugees .
This is not right and not realistic . "
Turkish envoy incident a ' technical mishap '
Ayalon was also asked if he feels his behavior towards Turkish Ambassador to Israel Ahmet Oguz Celikkol in a reprimand meeting last month was arrogant or condescending .
The deputy foreign minister said : " It was not so .
I did not mean to behave arrogantly and I did not mean to humiliate the ambassador .
When I felt it caused pain and harm , I personally sent an apology .
The apology was in writing . "
The interviewer in response said the pictures were clear : " You sat on a chair higher than that of the Turkish ambassador , you did not serve any refreshments and you did not place the Turkish flag as is customary in the rules of diplomacy .
Furthermore , you invited journalists to witness the humiliation themselves . "
Ayalon responded saying , " What happened with the Turkish ambassador was a technical mishap , I did not mean to humiliate him .
I can invite you to my office in the Knesset and you will see that it has two chairs , with one higher than the other which is meant for guest .
" We wanted to express our protest but we did not mean to humiliate him , and this was not supposed to be published . "
The interviewer said that it was Ayalon who summoned the media , and Ayalon retorted saying " This is not true .
We allowed cameras in just to take a few pictures .
We presumed that the recorders were off , but this was n't the case .
I personally made a mistake and I take full responsibility for it and I apologize .
I am not afraid to admit a mistake . "

( PhysOrg.com ) --
The biggest window ever launched to space has been installed in its final position on the Earth - facing port of Node - 3 .
The latches and 16 electrically driven bolts were engaged today at 07:31 CET ( 06:31 GMT ) .
Opening of the window shutters is foreseen for Wednesday .
During the launch of Endeavour the Cupola was attached to Node - 3’s end cone docking port , After installing Node - 3 on Friday and preparing Cupola for relocation , Cupola was this morning released and manoeuvred to the Node - 3’s Earth - facing port where it was reberthed .
Electrical and water lines are now being connected between Node - 3 and Cupola , and the Cupola ’s window heaters are being activated .
Activities related to making Node - 3 fully functional also continue .
Meanwhile other outfitting tasks inside Node - 3 are being carried out , including removal of all panel launch bolts and the installation of two sampling tools over the thermal lines that will be used to extract water sample for analysis .
NASA astronaut Robert Behnken , STS - 130 mission specialist , participates in the mission 's second session of extravehicular activity ( EVA ) as construction and maintenance continue on the International Space Station .
During the five - hour , 54 - minute spacewalk , Behnken and astronaut Nicholas Patrick ( out of frame ) , mission specialist , connected two ammonia coolant loops , installed thermal covers around the ammonia hoses , outfitted the Earth - facing port on the Node - 3 for the relocation of its Cupola , and installed handrails and a vent valve on the new module .
( NASA image S130 - E- 007858 , 14 February 2010 ) Credits : NASA
During tomorrow ’s spacewalk astronauts Behnken and Patrick will open the second ammonia loop for Node - 3’s External Thermal Control System and disconnect the power line for the temporary heaters .
The astronauts will also remove the insulating blankets covering the Cupola , which were needed during transfer to the ISS .
The thermal shroud will be jettisoned on removal .
Once the thermal blankets have gone the launch bolts that secure the Cupola ’s window shutters in place ( three bolts per shutter ) can be removed .
After installation of handrails and fixtures that will help astronauts on future EVAs , the Cupola will be ready for operation .
Sarah Palin told supporters at a Saturday rally in the Nevada hometown of Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid that they should ignore the media ’s depiction of tea partiers as violent or abusive after many Democrats received threats and abusive language over the week , often from Tea Party activists .
Ã¢â‚ ¬Å“ When we talk about fighting for our country , letÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢s clear the air right now about what it is that weÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢re talking about , Ã¢â‚ ¬Â  she told a crowd of about 20,000 .
Ã¢â‚ ¬Å“ WeÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢re not inciting violence .
DonÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢t get sucked into the lame - stream media lies . ”

Palin is one of many GOP leaders fighting to paint the media and Democrats as the problem after the controversy over health care was amplified to a new level as reports of harassment aimed at Democrats continue to emerge .
Ã¢â‚ ¬Å“ Violence isnÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢t the answer , Ã¢â‚¬Â Palin told her supporters .
She said Ã¢â‚ ¬Å “ our vote is our armsÃ¢â‚ ¬Â and said tea partiers should not be discouraged because Congress passed health care last week .
Instead , Palin wants her supporters to channel their energies into defeating congressional Democrats who supported the legislation come November elections .
She addressed criticism that she had helped to stoke the abuse with a Facebook post that told conservatives not to retreat from fighting health care , but to “ reload ” and “ aim ” for Democrats .
Ã¢â‚ ¬Å“ If we stick to our principles , weÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢re going to be just fine , ” she said .
“ Now when I talk about itÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢s not a time to retreat but a time to reload , what IÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢m talking about Ã¢â‚¬â€  now media , try to get this right Ã¢â‚¬â€ that Ã¢â‚¬â „ ¢s not inciting violence .
ThatÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢s trying to inspire people to get involved in their local elections and these upcoming federal elections . ”

Reid responded to a Tea Party in his hometown with this statement .
“ I ’m happy so many people came to see my hometown of Searchlight and spend their out - of - state money especially in these tough economic times , ” he said .
“ Ultimately , though , this election will be decided by Nevadans , not people from other states who parachute in for one day to have a tea party . ”
The numbers do n’t make Reid ’s chances of reelection very likely .
The most recent poll shows 33 percent of those polled have a favorable view of Reid , while 52 percent said they have an unfavorable view , amounting to the worst predicament he has faced in years .

Even as yet another Democratic congressman said he received a death threat , this one while in the company of his children , Palin downplayed the media ’s attention to the issue .
“ It ’s a bunch of bunk that the media is trying to feed you .
Do n’t let them try to divert attention from the issue , ” she said .

A Chicago man charged in two international terror plots , including the 2008 Mumbai , India , attacks , pleaded guilty Thursday to a dozen counts against him , and now will not face a trial .
David Headley , 49 , pleaded guilty in a federal court in Chicago to a dozen federal terrorism charges .
Authorities said he scouted out targets for the terrorist attacks in Mumbai in November 2008 that killed more than 160 people , and planned an attack on a Danish newspaper that published cartoons depicting the Prophet Mohammed .
Headley has agreed to cooperate with the government and testify before a grand jury .
He could have faced the death penalty if convicted , but in exchange for his guilty plea and cooperation , the government has taken execution off the table .
However , he will not be sentenced until after the conclusion of his cooperation , the Justice Department said .
Authorities said Headley attended training camps in Pakistan operated by Lashkar - e - Tayyiba and received instructions in 2005 from three members of the group to travel to India to conduct surveillance .
The Justice Department said he traveled to India five times leading up to the Mumbai attacks .
Six Americans were killed in the attacks .
The United States considers Lashkar - e- Tayyiba a foreign terrorist organization .
Headley also admitted that in early November 2008 , a Lashkar - e - Tayyiba member in Karachi , Pakistan , instructed him to scout the Copenhagen and Aarhus offices in Denmark of the Morgenavisen Jyllands - Posten newspaper in preparation for an attack .
The newspaper had published controversial cartoons depicting the Prophet Mohammad .
The alleged plan against the Danish newspaper was never carried out .

gnuplot 's internal programming capabilities are used to plot the continuous and segmented versions of the spirograph equations .
The segmented version , in particular , stretches the program model and requires the emulation of internal loops and conditional sentences .
As a final exercise , we will develop an extensible mini-language , mixing gawk and gnuplot programming , that lets the user combine any number of generalized spirographic patterns in a design .
A PDF version of this article is available for archiving and printing .
Imagine the movement of a small circle that rolls , without slipping , on the inside of a rigid circle .
Imagine now that the small circle has an arm , rigidly attached , with a plotting pen fixed at some point .
That is a recipe for drawing the hypotrochoid , a member of a large family of curves including epitrochoids ( the moving circle rolls on the outside of the fixed one ) , cycloids ( the pen is on the edge of the rolling circle ) , and roulettes ( several forms rolling on many different types of curves ) in general .
The concept of wheels rolling on wheels can , in fact , be generalized to any number of embedded elements .
Complex lathe engines , known as Guilloché machines , have been used since the 17th or 18th century for engraving beautiful designs onto watches , jewels , and other items of fine craftsmanship .
Many sources attribute the first use of Gilloché engravings on a watch to Abraham - Louis Breguet in 1786 , but the technique was already in use on jewelry .
Ancient machines are still being used , and can be seen at the RGM Watch Company Web pages .
Intricate Guilloché patterns are usually incorporated on bank notes and official documents to prevent forgery .
The name " Spirograph " comes , actually , from the trade name of a toy invented in 1962 by Denys Fisher , a British electronic engineer , and licensed to several toy companies over the years .
Our purpose , however , is not to explore the history or even the mathematical aspects of the Spirograph decorations : our interest is centered on the techniques needed to use gnuplot as the drawing engine of the cycloid - related curves .
Section II presents a simple derivation for the hypotrochoid equations and discusses a generalization to any number of rolling wheels described by F. Farris .
Section III describes the techniques required to draw the cycloid - related curves with gnuplot .
From the use of complex arithmetic to the simulation of an implicit do loop and the recursive definition of user functions , gnuplot offers a large capability for the creation of algorithmic designs .
The techniques discussed in Section III are embedded within a simple gawk filter that reads a formal description of a cycloid pattern and uses gnuplot to produce the final plot .
The design of this filter is the subject of Section IV .
Figure 1 shows the formation of a hypotrochoid and will help us in determining the parametric equations for the curve .
Three lengths determine the shape of the curve : R , the radius of the fixed circle ; r , the radius of the moving circle ; and p , the distance from the pen to the moving circle center .
The center of the fixed circle , point O , will serve as the origin of the coordinate system .
Points O ' and P designate the current position of the rolling circle center and of the pen , respectively .
Figure 1 Geometry for the hypotrochoid equations .
The grayed figure corresponds to R=9 , r=2 , and p=3 .
The current position for O ' is easily described in circular coordinates : fixed length and variable angle .
This is easily translated into Cartesian coordinates :
Similarly , the position of the pen relative to O ' is also simple to describe in circular coordinates : fixed length and variable angle .
In Cartesian coordinates :
The angles and are not independent , however .
The circles roll without slipping .
Hence , the arc on the fixed circle must be identical to the arc on the rolling circle .
The relationship follows immediately .
This equation is easy to interpret in terms of a gearing mechanism .
The fixed and rolling wheels must have teeth of equal size to be able to engage together .
Therefore , the number of teeth must be proportional to the wheel perimeter and , equivalently , to the wheel radius .
Putting all this together , the current position of the pen relative to the fixed center O is given by , or , equivalently :
The equations admit r and p being either positive or negative .
A negative r would represent a moving wheel rolling on the outside , rather than the inside , of the fixed circumference .
I.e. , it will be a epitrochoid curve .
Choosing p=r with r positive or negative will produce hypo or epicycloid curves , respectively .
It is easy to see that multiplying the three parameters R , r , and p by a common factor produces a global scaling of the curve dimensions but does not change its shape .
On the other hand , the figure traced by this parametric equation closes only if R/r is a rational number .
Let us assume that n and m are the smallest integers such that | R /r| = n/m , and let g be the greatest common divisor of n and m ( gcd(n , m ) ) .
The curve will then close after a total rotation of m/g times ( ) and it will show n/g lobes or spikes .
The equations can be generalized for three or more wheels rolling one inside the other , and Frank Farris did so in a celebrated article in Mathematics Magazine .
At this level , it is better to give up a direct simulation of the physical engine gears and examine the equations directly .
A very compact and powerful notation is obtained by using complex variables , with the convention that the real and imaginary parts represent the x and y Cartesian coordinates , i.e. , z=x +iy where i is the imaginary number .
The general Farris equations are :
where n is the number of engaged wheels : wheel k has its center fixed on a point of the circumference of wheel ( k - 1 ) .
On each wheel , is related to the radius , to the rotation speed , and is an initial phase angle .
Farris demonstrated that the z(t ) curve has g- fold rotational symmetry if all the pairwise differences have g as their greatest common divisor .
The two wheel parametric equations can be readily translated into the following gnuplot drawing code :
set terminal png size 600,600 \ x000000 xffffff x404040 xff0000 set output " fig-spiro02.png " set size ratio - 1 set nokey set noxtics set noytics set noborder set parametric # x ( t ) = ( R- r ) * cos ( t ) + p*cos ( ( R - r ) * t/r ) y( t ) =( R-r ) * sin( t ) - p*sin(( R - r ) * t/r ) # R=100.0 ; r=2.0 ; p=80.0 set samples 2001 # plot [ t=0:2* pi ] x ( t ) , y( t )
The code saves the image as a PNG file , useful for insertion on a Web page , but any gnuplot terminal could be used .
An EPS / PDF vector file with white background is better for a printed version of the document , whereas an unscaled PNG raster file with black background may look better and render faster in a Web browser .
The use of the PNG terminal is a little tricky , as there appear to be two versions that differ in the recognized syntax .
If gnuplot chokes on the png size 600,600 part , try using png picsize 600 600 instead .
Notice that we have removed the default axes , labels , and tics .
Identical scaling of the axes has also been enforced , to avoid distortion of the image .
The result can be seen in Fig. 2 .
Figure 2 Hypotrochoid curve for : R=100 , r=2 and p=80 .
A little exploration will reveal that : ( a ) p=0 produces a circle ; ( b ) an ellipse results if R=2r and p≠r , its axes being ( r+p ) and |r- p| ; ( c ) the hypocycloids are obtained by choosing p=r ; ( c ) R=2r=2 p gives rise to a line of length 2a ; ( d ) negative values for p and / or r results in some extraordinary specimens .
The beauty and diversity of the trochoid curves call for a journey of exploration and discovery .
This is much easier if the gnuplot code is embedded in a text or graphical user interface ( TUI vs. GUI ) .
A simple csh script can serve as a rudimentary but effective wrapper :
#! / bin/csh set code = $ 0:t if ( $ #argv < 3 ) goto help set n1 = $ 1 ; set n2 = $ 2 ; set n3 = $ 3 set a 1 = 1.0 ; set a2 = 1.0 ; set a 3 = 1.0 set s1 = 0.0 ; set s2 = 0.0 ; set s3 = 0.0 if ( $ #argv >= 4 ) set a 1 = $ 4 if ( $ #argv >= 5 ) set a 2 = $ 5 if ( $ #argv >= 6 ) set a 3 = $ 6 if ( $ #argv >= 7 ) set s1 = $ 7 if ( $ #argv >= 8 ) set s2 = $ 8 if ( $ #argv >= 9 ) set s3 = $ 9 cat << EOF | gnuplot set size ratio - 1 set nokey set noxtics set noytics set noborder set parametric # n 1 p = { 0,1}*2*pi*${n1} n 2 p = { 0,1}*2*pi*${n2} n3 p = { 0,1}*2*pi*$ {n3 } s1 p = { 0,1}*2*pi*${s1} s2 p = { 0,1}*2*pi*${s2} s3 p = { 0,1}*2*pi*${s3} z(t ) = $ { a1}*exp( n1p*t+s1p ) \ + $ { a2}*exp(n2p*t+s2p ) \ + $ { a3}*exp(n3p*t+s3 p ) # set terminal png size 600,600 x000000 \ xffffff x404040 xff0000 xffa500 x66cdaa \ xcdb5cd xadd8e6 x0000 ff xdda0dd x9500d3 set output " fig-spiro03.png " # set samples 2001 plot [ t=0:1 ] real ( z ( t ) ) , imag ( z ( t ) ) EOF xv fig - spiro03.png exit(0 ) help : cat << EOF USE : $ code n1 n2 n3 [ a1 a 2 a3 [ s1 s2 s3 ] ]
PURPOSE : Plot Farris wheels on wheels on wheels curve for ( n1,n2,n3, a1, a2, a3,s1,s2,s3 ) .
Default value for a1 , a2 , a3 : 1.0 .

In this example , we have used Farris equations for three wheels .
Complex numbers ( notice the { 0,1} constant , equivalent to the imaginary number , i , in gnuplot syntax ) are used to evaluate the z(t ) function , but their real and imaginary parts must be explicitly extracted and passed to the plot instruction .
Therefore , z( t ) , is actually called twice for each point .
Perhaps future gnuplot versions will recognize a single complex expression as a complete argument of the parametric plot .
In any case , the complex arithmetic provides a very compact notation .
Figure 3 Typical patterns shown by three rolling wheels of equal size .
From left to right and top to bottom : ( a ) [ 7 , - 5,2 ] palm leaf , ( b ) [ 19 , - 13,3 ] daisy flower ; ( c ) [ 13 , - 7 , - 3 ] cross ; ( d ) [ 19,17 , -2 ] nephroid ; ( e ) [ 13 , - 11 , -3 ] 8 - point star ; ( f ) [ 11, -7, - 3 ] Maasai shield .
The script , on the other hand , can be called with anything from 3 to 9 parameters .
The three obligatory parameters are n1 , n2 , and n3 , that adjust the relative speed of the three wheels .
The next group of three are a1 , a2 , and a3 , related to the relative size of the wheels , and a default value of 1.0 is assumed for any parameter not given in the input .
The last group corresponds to the initial phase angles , s1 , s2 , and s3 , with a default value of 0.0 .
The script parameters are used only within gnuplot assignments .
This means that the user can enter expressions rather than single integer or real values .
Some care must be taken , however , when entering fractions : use 1.0/3 and not 1/3 , that would be interpreted by gnuplot as an integer division and would produce an unexpected 0 .
Figure 3 represents some of the most characteristic patterns exhibited by three rolling wheels of identical size .
These patterns occur when the wheel speeds , [ n1, n2,n3 ] , their differences , , and the greatest common divisor of the differences , , satisfy appropriate conditions .
Large values for g produce highly symmetric and generally nice motifs .
Some of the most pleasant designs , however , show only a moderate symmetry and a more subtle interplay between regularity and uniqueness .
Some trends , found by the observation of a large number of cases , can help in the design of a particular motif .
Assuming that the three wheels are of equal size , differences like ( - g,2g,3g ) can produce g-points stars , whereas g-petal daisies tend to happen for ( [+/-] 2g , [+/-]g , [+/-]g ) differences .
Palm leaves and nephroids occur when two of the differences coincide , in absolute value , with two of the wheel speeds .
Crosses and Maasai shields are rara avis that require a large number of conditions to be met : the sum of all wheel speeds must be odd ( positive or negative ) , g must be a power of 2 , and the sum of two of the differences must be equal to the third .
Changing the wheel sizes will also produce significant variations in the drawings .
Adding small phase angles to one or more wheels can be used to introduce some irregularity into an otherwise too symmetric and uninteresting motif .
The two previous examples have used the spirographic equations with a large number of sample points , large enough to show the true nature of the curves : both continuous and derivable , as they are the sums of exponential functions .
The Web has plenty of simplistic Java applets that poorly render the equations by using a small number of points per roll .
This method , albeit a wrong representation of the true curves , can produce quite pleasant images .
In a declarative language , this type of plot would be produced using a simple loop :
nturns = abs ( rsmall ) / gcd( Rbig , abs ( rsmall ) )
M = nturns * resolution inumber = { 0,1} for ( k=0 ; k< =M ; k++ ) { ang1 = inumber * k * 2*pi/M ang2 = ang1 * ( rsmall - Rbig ) / rsmall z[k ] = ( Rbig-rsmall ) * exp ( ang1 ) + p*exp ( ang2 ) if ( k >0 ) { PLOT LINE from z [ k - 1 ] to z[k ] } }
where resolution holds the number of sample points used for each roll around the main ( fixed ) wheel and nturns is the number of times this wheel must be rolled around .
The above pseudocode assumes the use of complex arithmetic and the availability of a gcd ( ) function .
Loops and conditional expressions are not part of the gnuplot language , but there are ways around this limitation .
First , an implicit loop is automatically performed on each plot instruction .
We just have to be careful to fix an appropriate samples value and a correct range for the independent variable ( the parametric variable , in our case ) .
The ternary operator ( a?b : c , evaluate and return b if a is true , and c otherwise ) can be used as a restricted conditional test .
gnuplot 's user - defined functions can be recursive , on the other hand , and this can also be used as a restricted form of loop .
The next example uses all of the above ideas .
Notice , in particular , the recursive definition of the gcd ( ) function , that implements Euclid 's algorithm for the greatest common divisor .
The calculation of the number of turns and sample points is simplified by assuming that R and r are integers .

Figure 4
Curve stitching patterns from the hypotrochoid curve with : R=100 , r=2 and p=70 .
The three patterns correspond to a resolution of 75 , 125 and 175 sample points , respectively .
The last example works well for drawing a single curve with a given resolution , but the most interesting patterns are obtained by mixing several renderings of one or more curves with well chosen resolutions .
To do this within a single gnuplot run , we have to take explicit control of the angles used for each equation .
For instance :
set terminal png size 600,600 x000000 \ xffffff x404040 xff0000 xffa500 x66cdaa \ xcdb5cd xadd8e6 x0000 ff xdda0dd x9500d3 set output " fig-spiro05.png " set size ratio - 1 set nokey set noxtics set noytics set noborder set parametric # # General parametric equations : x( t , R , r , p ) = ( R - r ) * cos ( t ) + p*cos ( ( R - r ) * t/r ) y( t , R , r , p ) = ( R - r ) * sin ( t ) - p*sin(( R - r ) * t/r ) # # Values for the dummy parameter : t( i,n ) = i*2*pi/n # # Greatest common divisor : gcd( x , y ) = ( x %y==0 ? y : gcd(y , x%y ) ) # #
The different curves : R1 = 100 ; r1 = 2 ; p1 = 70 ; res1 = 75 R2 = 100 ; r2 = 2 ; p2 = 70 ; res2 = 125 R3 = 100 ; r3 = 2 ; p3 = 70 ; res3 = 175 # nseg1 = res1 * abs ( r1 ) / gcd( R1, abs ( r1 ) ) nseg2 = res2 * abs ( r2 ) / gcd( R2,abs ( r2 ) ) nseg3 = res3 * abs ( r3 ) / gcd( R3,abs ( r3 ) ) n 12 = ( nseg1 * nseg2 ) / gcd(nseg1,nseg2 ) nsamp = ( n12 * nseg3 ) / gcd(n12,nseg3 ) nsamp1 = nsamp + 1 set samples nsamp1 # plot [ i=0 :nsamp ] \ x ( t ( i,res1 ) , R1,r1,p1 ) , y( t( i,res1 ) , R1,r1 , p1 ) \ , x ( t( i,res2 ) , R2,r2, p2 ) , y( t( i,res2 ) , R2,r2 , p2 ) \ , x ( t ( i,res3 ) , R3,r3, p3 ) , y( t( i,res3 ) , R3,r3 , p3 )
The result of this code is represented in figure 4 .
The intricate embroidery of the three curve representations , only recognizable by their different colors , show an appealing and delicate beauty that deserves further exploration .
However , using the same plot order for the three is far from being effective and poses many problems for its generalization to an arbitrary number and class of representations .
In particular , the number of sample points has to be a minimum common multiple of the best number of sample points for each independent figure .
In the case of figure 4 , the three curves would need 75 , 125 and 175 sample points , respectively , but plotting the three simultaneously requires 2625 samples , instead .
So , the first component is repeated 35 times , 21 times the second , and 15 times the third .
This repetition will add substantially to the plotting time but , if the final result is written to a raster format like PNG , there will be no increase on the size of the final file .
If we use a vector format like EPS or SVG , however , the file size will also increase substantially .
We can avoid the unnecessary repetition by turning to a two - pass method .
In the first pass , each curve is created independently in gnuplot , and its points are saved in a file using a set terminal table output mode .
The second pass combines the points from all the previous files into a single design , that is saved in whatever raster or vector format seems appropriate .
Instead of providing an example of this technique , we will use the idea for our final and most ambitious project .
All the techniques developed in the previous section can be made more accessible if we design a simple way of describing a plot and we create the tool for translating the description to the appropriate gnuplot instructions .
The perfect translation tool would hide the details of the gnuplot syntax from the user while maintaining an appropriate degree of flexibility .
We have written an experimental translator ( See / download the translator ) in awk for rapid prototyping and easy experimentation .
We are going to describe the language currently recognized .
The following notation will be used .
Fixed names are written in boldface .
Variable data appears in italica , enclosed within square brackets , [ ] , if the data is optional .
The data type is indicated by the suffix of the variable name : var.s ( a string sequence ) ; var .i ( an integer ) ; var.r ( a real value ) ; var .c ( a complex value in gnuplot notation , i.e. , { real_part , imaginary_part} ) ; var.re and var.ce ( a real or complex expression , like pi*{0,1} / 12 ) .
Missing values are forbidden within the integer , real and complex data and expressions .
The instructions currently implemented in our translation script are :
PROJECT projectname.s
The project name serves as root for the names of all the files , temporary or final , that the drawing process requires .
Default projectname : tmp .
TERMINAL parameters .s
Select a gnuplot terminal type .
Typical selections would be PNG or EPS , but any type accepted by gnuplot will serve .
Default : png size 600,600 x000000 xffffff x404040 ... CURVE samples .i
Start a new curve .
A plot is formed by using one or more curves .
Each curve is made by one or more functions .
Each curve is computed independently and written to a temporary file .
All curves are plotted together at the end to form the final image .
The default number of sample points ( 2001 ) can be changed independently for each curve .
Some special function types ( like TROCHOID ) may take control of this and ignore the samples value .
The general form of a curve is : where t is the independent parameter and is a complex term contribution to the curve .
ADDTERM LINE z0.ce z 1.ce
Add a linear term contribution to the current curve :
The line passes through z0 and z1 , two arbitrary points in the complex plane .
Remember than complex values are entered using the gnuplot notation : {x , y} means .
Missing variables must be avoided within each number .
ADDTERM SPIRAL1 a.re n.i
Add a generalized Archimedes spiral : Default : n=1. ADDTERM SPIRAL2 a.re b.re Add an equiangular spiral : Maximize the number of spiral rolls by choosing b close to (+/-) π.
ADDTERM TROCHOID R.re r.re p.re [ samples .i ]
Add a trochoid term :
If samples is given , the number of sampling points and the number of curve rollings is internally computed .
ADDTERM WHEEL a.re n.re s.re Add a Farris rolling wheel term : where a is the wheel radius , n the rolling frequency , i.e. the number of rolls when t goes from 0 to 1 , and s determines the initial phase angle .
An arbitrary number of Farris wheels can be added in a curve .
STYLE style .s
This order takes control of the gnuplot style used on the current curve and its copies ( see the LOOP order below ) .
The style .s must follow the gnuplot syntax .
For example : style lt 1 ( line type 1 for all copies of the curve ) , style with points pt - 1 ( use points instead of lines ) .
The default style is to use lines for the curves , increasing the line number style for each successive curve , including copies .
LOOP var.s var_ini.r var_end.r var_inc.r
Repeat the current curve according to the next implicit loop : var = var_ini while ( var does not reach var_end ) do # compute and draw a new installment # of the current curve var = var_ini + ( var_inc ) end
The var .s string can be used as a variable in the definition of the curve ( see the examples below ) .
The var_inc.r value can be negative .
There is currently a limit of 1000 times for the number of copies produced by this loop .
TRANGE t0.r t1.r
Change the default range for the t parametric variable .
Notice that the presence of a trochoid term may take control for t and ignore this input .
Default : t in [ 0,1 ] .
GFACTORS freal .re fimag .re Multiplicative factors for the real and imaginary parts of the drawn functions .
In other words , the image finally drawn is plot freal * real ( z ( t ) ) , fimag * imag ( z ( t ) ) .
Default : freal = fimag = 1.0 .
LABEL x.r y.r text .s
Add a gnuplot label at the indicated position .
The plot center has the coordinates ( 0,0 ) .
The label is centered on the ( x , y ) point .
The plot can contain any number of labels , but the program makes no attempt to avoid collisions between them .

Figure 5 Example images created with the help of the SpiroLang mini-language .
See the text for a description of the patterns and the actual instructions used to create them .
The ( d ) image has been created using an EPS terminal to employ enhanced text capabilities , but it has been converted to PNG for display here .
Some examples of the above rules in action may help to understand the possibilities .
The first example , represented in Fig. 5 ( a ) , shows the use of a simple trochoid curve with a small sampling :
project example01 terminal png size 600,600 x000000 curve 10 addterm trochoid 100 - 49 76
The second example shows the use of a loop instruction to create copies of a curve , applying a little phase rotation and size change to each new copy .
See the resulting image in Fig. 5 ( b ) :
project example02 terminal png size 600,600 x000000 curve # style lt 1 loop kkk 0 20 1 addterm wheel 4*0.98** kkk - 3 kkk/200. addterm wheel 5*1.02**kkk 2 kkk/200 .
The third image , Fig. 5 ( c ) , corresponds to a multiple copy version of three Farris wheels :
project example03 terminal png size 600,600 x000000 curve style lt 1 loop kkk 0 20 1 addterm wheel 4 - 5 - kkk / 60 .
addterm wheel 3 2 kkk /60 .
addterm wheel 2 9 0 .
Our last example shows a decoration around some text .
The decoration was designed by starting with a large Farris wheel and adding two other much smaller wheels , always maintaining an 8 - fold symmetry .
The use of gfactors provides an easy way to stretch an otherwise round motif .
project example04 terminal postscript eps enhanced color " Helvetica " 48 gfactors 1.4 0.7 curve style lt 1 loop kkk 0 10 1 addterm wheel 200*0.96**kkk 1 0. addterm wheel 10*0.96**kkk 9 0. addterm wheel 9*0.96**kkk 23 0. label 0 0 G_nuplot rules !
We should not end this report without mentioning , at least , some of the excellent Java applets that can be found on the Internet ( Paramo2004 , Little2001 , Little1997 , Garg , Ziring2000 ) .
A well conceived GUI can be of great help in the interactive exploration of a designated subset of the vast Spirograph parametric space .
It is not the only approach , however .
A custom mini-language can give access to an arbitrarily large parametric space and hide the dirty details of code generation .
The gnuplot engine has been used for years to produce professional quality plots .
Some of its drawbacks , like the lack of true loop mechanisms , can be eliminated with some ingenuity or by embedding the engine within a more general programming tool .

The woman who launched a political career on an anti-immigration platform is set to become an immigrant herself .
Only days after declaring she was finished with politics , the former One Nation leader Pauline Hanson has revealed plans to sell her Queensland property and resettle in Britain , potentially for good .
''I 'm going to be away indefinitely .
It 's pretty much goodbye forever , '' she told Woman 's Day magazine in an interview , published today .
New horizons ... Pauline Hanson says Australia is no longer the land of opportunity .
She is planning to move to Britain after selling her Queensland property .

'' I 've really had enough .
I want peace in my life .
I want contentment , and that 's what I 'm aiming for . "
The former federal MP 's hard - line views on race sparked a national debate over immigration policy and Aboriginal disadvantage from the time she entered Parliament in 1996 at the same election which made John Howard prime minister .
In a 1200 - word interview , parts of which have been released to the Herald , Ms Hanson told the magazine she was disappointed by the way Australia has changed .
'' Sadly , the land of opportunity is no more applicable , " she said .
This article presents how to lead the transition to an Agile process .
This article is based on Chapter 1 of Becoming Agile , to be published in May 2009 .

Many companies try to “ shotgun ” agile into their organization .
They think , “ Let ’s get through the migration pain quickly and start obtaining the benefits as soon as possi­ble . ”
We ’ve seen a few cases where this approach makes sense : for example , a project team that has become so dysfunctional that they ’re delivering practically no function­ality or business value .
This approach also works well for a start - up company that has n’t yet established its development process .
But for most companies , you should allow time for the process to “ bake . ”
This is why we suggest an iterative approach for bringing agile into an organiza­tion .
An iterative approach allows you to see how well your employees are adapting to the change .
It also lets you learn what works and what does n’t in your environment .
In effect , it allows you to reach the right level of agility for your organization .
Part of your iterative approach will include a process for maintaining the methodology .
We suggest establishing a core team to support this maintenance .
A core team is composed of employees from all aspects of the development process .
They play a huge part in establishing your custom methodology and then settle into a mainte­nance mode with the goal of constantly adapting to your environment .
The core team is covered in detail in chapter 6 .
Next , you need to choose the best way to iteratively create a methodology at your company .
Should you select a packaged method , such as Scrum or XP ?
Or should you create a custom or hybrid process ?
Custom Provess or Packaged Method ?
In order to be successful , you should customize your agile process .
For many years , consultants and others have said that you must embrace agile completely or not at all .
In 2006 , we witnessed a shift in this attitude .
Highly respected folks such as Kent Beck ( the founder of XP ) and Steve McConnell ( the writer of Code Complete ) now endorse customization .
Kent Beck noted the following in an interview with InfoQ ( InfoQ.com is an independent online community focused on change and innovation in enterprise software development ) in 2006 :
Failure at an organizational level seems to come from the inability to customize processes and make them their own .
Trying to apply someone else ’s template to your organization directly does n’t work well .
It leaves out too many important details of the previous successes and ignores your company ’s specific situation .
Rubber - stamping agile processes is n’t agile .
The value of having a principle - based process is that you can apply the principles for an individualized process for your situation and , as an extra bonus , one that has been designed to adapt from your learning as you adopt changes into your organization .
It ’s always “ custom . ”
Kent ’s quote is comforting to us because it supports our personal experiences .
Custom means picking and choosing the agile practices that best support your environment .
Custom means you should n’t use a pure packaged methodology off the shelf , such as Scrum or XP .
You can start with one of these methods as a basis for your process , but you should modify it to obtain the best results for your company .
If we revisit VersionOne ’s 2008 survey , we see that 14 percent of the people who responded are using a hybrid process based on Scrum and XP .
The hybrid model is closer to what we ’ll suggest for you .
To be specific , here are the steps we ’ll walk you through as the book continues :
1. Assess your organization to determine where you should begin adding agility .
2. Obtain executive support for the move to a more agile process .
You can use the readiness assessment in chapter 4 to quantify the value of bringing in agile and identify the risks you must manage during migration .
3 . Get the development team involved in the migration process to ensure buy - in .
You do this by establishing a core team .
4. Identify a coach or consultant to help you with your migration .
They will train the core team on agile and help you with other adoption aspects .
5 . Develop a clear understanding of your current processes by documenting them .
6 . Review your current process , and look for areas that can be shifted to more agile methods .
Focus on areas with the most potential for improvement and the most value to the customer and your organization .
The readiness assessment will also help with this task .
7 . Outline a custom process based on the findings in step 6 .
8 . Try the new process on a pilot project .
9 . Review the findings after the pilot , make changes , and continue to scale outyour new methodology .
Banking is based on trust .
The banks get our paychecks and hold our savings ; they know where we spend our money and they keep it private .
If we do n't trust them , the whole system breaks down .
Yet for years , Wall Street CEOs have thrown away customer trust like so much worthless trash .
Banks and brokers have sold deceptive mortgages for more than a decade .
Financial wizards made billions by packaging and repackaging those loans into securities .
And federal regulators played the role of lookout at a ...
The earliest known surviving film to be shot in Australia , featuring a rollerskater performing on a street in Melbourne , has been found and restored .
In true Australian style , it is irreverent and unapologetic .
In fact , it was seen as too risque for Australian audiences although it proved popular in European cinemas .
It was produced in 1896 by French filmmaker Marius Sestier , who was dispatched to Australia by a French film company in a bid to introduce cinema to the colony .
A pharmacist by trade , Sestier took well to his adventurous new career , setting up Australia 's first public cinema in Sydney 's Pitt Street .
Special message
The comic sequence , Patineur Grotesque ( Humorous Rollerskater ) , follows a rollerskater performing in a Melbourne street .
The newly - restored film contains the 19th century equivalent of a well - known gesture of contempt , as the rollerskater lifts up his coat to show the camera the imprint of a white palm on his posterior .
It 's a cinematic ' up yours ' , turn - of - the - century style .
Sally Jackson from the National Film and Sound Archive ( NFSA ) in Canberra says the rude message was probably aimed at the filmmaker 's business rival .
" The rollerskater when he skates around he turns around flips up his coat tails on several occasions , " she said .
" On the back you can see a big white hand and there 's one particular finger that 's a little bit higher than all the rest .
" Really what he was doing was he was giving his competitor the finger . "
Film heritage
The film was shown for the first time on Australian soil at a special ceremony at the NFSA in Canberra , where it 's been painstakingly restored using special equipment .
Sestier 's great granddaughter Marie - Dominique Petitbois flew from France to attend the screening .
" It has been a big surprise for us , " she said .
" We did n't realise he did so much in Australia . "
She was able to provide the NFSA with notebooks and press clippings Marius Sestier kept from his trip to the Antipodes .
Sestier 's short movies are forerunners to the 1906 film , The Story of the Kelly Gang , which is regarded as the world 's first feature film .
Australia embraced the filmmaking revolution early on .
All this at a time when Hollywood was nothing more than a paddock .
The National Film and Sound Archive wants to hear from anyone who may have information about the man in the film , or the location .
M4 in Wales to be ' hydrogen highway , ' say ministers
Please turn on JavaScript .
Media requires JavaScript to play .
Advertisement The M4 in south Wales is to become a " hydrogen highway " , with alternative energy refuelling points , Welsh Secretary , Peter Hain , has announced .
The scheme , to extend into south west England , is aimed at making hydrogen and electric - powered vehicles a viable alternative to petrol - driven machines .
Under the plan , Wales will lead in developing alternative fuels , including hydrogen from renewable sources .
The aim is to create an extensive renewable refuelling infrastructure .
It shows that Wales is prepared to take the lead in this area , which is something we can proud of
Gordon James , Friends of the Earth Cymru Hydrogen has long been touted as an alternative energy source to carbon - rich fossil fuels .
One of the biggest obstacles to wider adoption of fuel - cell vehicles is the lack of hydrogen fuelling stations .
To be used as a fuel , hydrogen must first be produced using another energy source .
While some scientists are hopeful of the fuel uses of hydrogen , many others are sceptical because it is inefficient to produce and expensive to transport and to convert into electricity .
Ministers Peter Hain and Jane Davidson with a hydrogen van at the launch Wales has been designated a Low Carbon Economic Area ( LCEA ) for hydrogen and low carbon fuel technologies such as natural gas and bio-methane .
In collaboration with south west England and other regions , the M4 is set to become the UK 's longest " hydrogen highway , " with a range of alternative refuelling points at strategic sites .
The aim is for refuelling points in Wales to link with similar filling points proposed for Swindon and London , extending to the Midlands .
Plug - in facilities
The assembly government also hopes making the M4 into a hydrogen highway by as early as 2015 will attract investment from all sectors of the motoring industry .
Supporters see the provision of electric plug - in facilities , hydrogen , compressed natural gas and bio-methane - filling points as an essential first stage in stimulating the alternative fuels market in transport .
The aim is that with the filling points catering for existing low - carbon vehicles , Wales will be in a prime location as they provide a springboard for alternative vehicle development and enable vehicle manufacturers to demonstrate and validate the technology in the UK .
Wales already has two multi- fuel filling facilities in south Wales , at Baglan and Treforest .
Gordon James , director of Friends of the Earth Cymru , welcomed the scheme but said it was key that renewable energy was used to make the hydrogen and provide the electricity of the electric vehicle charging points .
He said : " This is excellent news .
It will help reduce the greenhouse gas emissions for the transport sector which is responsible for about 12 % of carbon dioxide emissions in Wales .
" It will also help develop the green economy in Wales .
It shows that Wales is prepared to take the lead in this area , which is something we can proud of .
" Following last year 's scrapping of plans to build the Gwent Levels motorway , this shows that we are moving in the right direction . "
Environment Minister Jane Davidson and Welsh Secretary Peter Hain launched the hydrogen highway scheme .
Linked to the announcement , the University of Glamorgan is to invest more than £ 6 m to develop new low - carbon technologies including a hydrogen engine test facility at Baglan , Port Talbot , just off the M4 .

WASHINGTON ( Reuters ) - Wind energy could generate 20 percent of the electricity needed by households and businesses in the eastern half of the United States by 2024 , but it would require up to $ 90 billion in investment , according to a government report released on Wednesday .
For the 20 percent wind scenario to work , billions must be spent on installing wind towers on land and sea and about 22,000 miles of new high - tech power lines to carry the electricity to cities , according to the study from the Energy Department ’s National Renewable Energy Laboratory .
“ Twenty percent wind is an ambitious goal , ” said David Corbus , the project manager for the study .
“ We can bring more wind power online , but if we do n’t have the proper infrastructure to move that power around , it ’s like buying a hybrid car and leaving it in the garage , ”
The private sector cannot fund all the needed spending , so a big chunk would have to come from the federal government through programs such as loan guarantees , Corbus said .
The Obama administration is already dedicating billions of dollars to double the amount of electricity produced by wind and other renewables energy sources by January 2012 .
The Interior Department will decide this spring whether to approve the Cape Wind project off Cape Cod , Massachusetts .
That project , long delayed because of local opposition , would provide electricity to about 400,000 homes .
The amount of U.S. electricity generated by wind was up 29 percent during January - October of last year compared to the same period is 2008 , according to the Energy Department .
Reaching the 20 percent threshold for wind by 2024 in the eastern electric grid would require 225,000 megawatts of wind generation capacity in the region , about a 10 - fold increase from current levels , the study said .
One megawatt of electricity can provide power to about 1,000 homes .
Wind turbines would be scattered throughout the eastern grid , which extends from the Plains states to the Atlantic Coast and south to the Gulf of Mexico .
Most of the big wind farms would be concentrated off the Atlantic Coast in federal waters from Massachusetts to North Carolina and on land in Midwest states from North Dakota to Nebraska and into Kansas .
Many states already require utilities to produce a portion of their electricity from renewable energy sources , but a federal mandate covering all utilities nationwide would help create the 20 percent wind scenario , Corbus said .
Sen .
Byron Dorgan said on Tuesday he thought the Senate would forgo dealing with climate change legislation this year after going through the contentious health care debate and instead focus on passing an energy bill that , in part , requires U.S. utilities to generate 15 percent of their electricity from renewables by 2021 .
From the Smithsonian Environmental Research Center blog :
“ The chief culprit appears to be climate change , more specifically , the rising levels of atmospheric CO 2 , higher temperatures and longer growing seasons . ”
This jibes well with what NASA has been seeing globally via satellite measurements :
Surprise : Earths ’ Biosphere is Booming , Satellite Data Suggests CO2 the Cause
And what has been found by the University of Wisconsin in Madison :
Greenhouse gas carbon dioxide ramps up aspen growth
Here ’s the full report from the Smithsonian :
Forests are growing faster , climate change appears to driving accelerated growth
Speed is not a word typically associated with trees ; they can take centuries to grow .
However , a new study to be published the week of Feb. 1 in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences has found evidence that forests in the Eastern United States are growing faster than they have in the past 225 years .
The study offers a rare look at how an ecosystem is responding to climate change .

For more than 20 years forest ecologist Geoffrey Parker has tracked the growth of 55 stands of mixed hardwood forest plots in Maryland .
The plots range in size , and some are as large as 2 acres .
Parker ’s research is based at the Smithsonian Environmental Research Center , 26 miles east of the nation ’s capital .
Parker ’s tree censuses have revealed that the forest is packing on weight at a much faster rate than expected .
He and Smithsonian Tropical Research Institute postdoctoral fellow Sean McMahon discovered that , on average , the forest is growing an additional 2 tons per acre annually .
That is the equivalent of a tree with a diameter of 2 feet sprouting up over a year .
Forest ecologist Jess Parker began his tree censuses his first day on the job : September 8 , 1987 .

Forests and their soils store the majority of the Earth ’s terrestrial carbon stock .
Small changes in their growth rate can have significant ramifications in weather patterns , nutrient cycles , climate change and biodiversity .
Exactly how these systems will be affected remains to be studied .
Parker and McMahon ’s paper focuses on the drivers of the accelerated tree growth .
The chief culprit appears to be climate change , more specifically , the rising levels of atmospheric CO 2 , higher temperatures and longer growing seasons .
Assessing how a forest is changing is no easy task .
Forest ecologists know that the trees they study will most likely outlive them .
One way they compensate for this is by creating a “ chronosequence ” — a series of forests plots of the same type that are at different developmental stages .
At SERC , Parker meticulously tracks the growth of trees in stands that range from 5 to 225 years old .
This allowed Parker and McMahon to verify that there was accelerated growth in forest stands young and old .
More than 90 % of the stands grew two to four times faster than predicted from the baseline chronosequence .
Parker , his colleagues and a team of citizen scientists have tagged more than 20,000 trees at the Smithsonian Environmental Research Center .

By grouping the forest stands by age , McMahon and Parker were also able to determine that the faster growth is a recent phenomenon .
If the forest stands had been growing this quickly their entire lives , they would be much larger than they are .
Parker estimates that among himself , his colleague Dawn Miller and a cadre of citizen scientists , they have taken a quarter of a million measurements over the years .
Parker began his tree census work Sept. 8 , 1987 — his first day on the job .
He measures all trees that are 2 centimeters or more in diameter .
He also identifies the species , marks the tree ’s coordinates and notes if it is dead or alive .
By knowing the species and diameter , McMahon is able to calculate the biomass of a tree .
He specializes in the data - analysis side of forest ecology .
“ Walking in the woods helps , but so does looking at the numbers , ” said McMahon .
He analyzed Parker ’s tree censuses but was hungry for more data .
Parker uses diameter tape or ‘ d - tape ’ to measure the trees .
The tape is calibrated to convert the tree ’s circumference , the measurement used to determine a tree ’s biomass .

It was not enough to document the faster growth rate ; Parker and McMahon wanted to know why it might be happening .
“ We made a list of reasons these forests could be growing faster and then ruled half of them out , ” said Parker .
The ones that remained included increased temperature , a longer growing season and increased levels of atmospheric CO 2 .
During the past 22 years CO 2 levels at SERC have risen 12 % , the mean temperature has increased by nearly three - tenths of a degree and the growing season has lengthened by 7.8 days .
The trees now have more CO 2 and an extra week to put on weight .
Parker and McMahon suggest that a combination of these three factors has caused the forest ’s accelerated biomass gain .
Ecosystem responses are one of the major uncertainties in predicting the effects of climate change .
Parker thinks there is every reason to believe his study sites are representative of the Eastern deciduous forest , the regional ecosystem that surrounds many of the population centers on the East Coast .
He and McMahon hope other forest ecologists will examine data from their own tree censuses to help determine how widespread the phenomenon is .
These findings are also important for policymakers trying to address climate change .
Future carbon cap - and - trade rules will need to quantify the amount of carbon forests hold .
If faster growth rates prove the norm , this could affect the formulas and the dollar value assigned to forests that are cut or conserved .
Parker and McMahon do n’t expect SERC ’s forest to continue growing at this accelerated rate forever .
Some day the growth rate will level off .
When that happens , they wonder how that will affect CO 2 levels .
If trees are sponges that absorb CO 2 , what will happen to CO 2 levels in the atmosphere when the trees become saturated ?
It ’s a question for further exploration .
In the meantime , Parker will continue walking through the SERC woods , tape measure in hand carefully tracking the growth of the trees .
PNAS will make the study available online sometime this week at this link :

Image hosting is the kind of service many people use for sharing their images .
There are several great options that cost money — like SmugMug , for instance — but unless you 're a major shutterbug , a free service might fit your modest needs and usage pattern better .
Here we round up three of the top options for free image hosting around the Web — Flickr , Picasa , and Photobucket .
Flickr
Flickr has been around for many years , and is now owned by Yahoo .
Most of us in Orbiting HQ have used Flickr for some time , and by virtue of its longevity , popularity , and well - documented API , many desktop and mobile imaging apps feature some kind of Flickr integration .
Like many image hosting solutions , Flickr has a free basic account which you 'll only need a verifiable e-mail address to activate .
If you already have a Yahoo ID , you 're good to go ; otherwise , you 'll have to go through the registration process at Yahoo to get started .
Once that 's out of the way , you 'll have plenty of options for uploading images to Flickr .
You can use Flickr 's Web 2.0 - ified uploading interface by clicking on the prominent " Upload photos & videos " link on the home page , or by clicking " Upload Photos " from the drop - down navigation menu labelled " You . "
You can select multiple images from your machine using a native file picker .
Once you have your list , you can select to make the images public or private , and click upload .
Once all the images are uploaded , you can add titles , tags , and descriptions .
A Flash - based Organizr tool helps you arrange photos into " sets " ( commonly called " albums " on other sites ) .
You can also arrange sets of sets called " collections . "
In addition to the online uploader , Flickr has a number of Flickr - made and third - party apps that you can use to get images into your photostream .
Flickr makes an Uploadr app for both Mac OS X and Windows .
i Photo '09 includes native Flickr support , but plugins exist for iPhoto , Aperture , and Adobe Lightroom for exporting images directly from those apps to your Flickr account .
Other apps for desktop and mobile platforms are available as well .
From any individual image page , you can edit tags , title , and a description ; you can view shooting data ; and logged - in users can add comments .
Two easy sharing options include " Blog this , " which will publish a post on a configured blog with the image and a link to its Flickr page .
Clicking " All sizes " will let you choose from a range of automatically generated images sizes , and give you the option to copy HTML code to insert the image into a blog or webpage .
Flickr 's terms of service require a link back to an image 's Flickr page when embedded in another site , so keep that in mind if you have to use custom code to insert images into forums .
Flickr has a number of ways to share images directly through the site .
One way is by joining various topical groups .
For instance , I 'm a member of a Band Photography group for images of live bands , and a member of a group that 's just for users of Tamron 's 28 - 75 mm f/2.8 zoom lens .
You can also add Flickr members as a contact , and view that contact 's images .
Flickr provides an RSS feed with all new uploads from your contacts , so you can easily keep up with what your friends are posting .
Other options for doing things with your images are available as well .
Flickr includes integrated image editing via Picnik .
Flickr also has integrated support for making prints , photo books , calendars , and more via SnapFish .
And if you like , you can simply browse using Flickr 's " Explore " options , which will show you images based on certain tags , locations , or " interestingness . "
A standard free account comes with a number of limitations .
You can only upload 100 MB of images per month , and images are limited to 10 MB each .
Flickr now allows short video uploads ( 90s max , 150 MB per video ) , and free accounts are limited to two per month .
Other limits : you can only post an image to 10 groups , browsing your photostream will only show the last 200 uploads , and you 'll only have access to resized versions of your images .
Upgrading to a Pro account costs $ 24.95 per year .
Doing so allows you to upload unlimited photos and videos , though images are limited to 20 MB max .
You get unlimited storage , unlimited bandwidth , archiving of and access to full resolution images , and the ability to share videos in HD .
You 'll be able to choose a custom URL name , replace uploaded photos with edited versions , post images to up to 60 different groups , and access detailed viewing and referrer stats .
You 'll also have the benefit of ad - free browsing and sharing , so not only will you not see ads while viewing the site , visitors to your images wo n't see them , either .
Picasa Web Albums
Of course , Yahoo is n't the only search company with an image hosting service .
Some time ago , Google bought the Picasa image cataloguing and editing application , and added a Picasa Web Albums service to Google 's stable of cloud services .
You 'll need a Google ID to get access to Picasa Web Albums .
Once you have an account , you can start uploading images directly via the Web .
Unlike Flickr , which has the concept of a photostream of continuous , not necessarily related images in chronological order ( by upload date ) , uploads in Picasa Web Albums are always assigned to an album .
The online upload tool allows you to select up to five images for uploading at one time .
To get the best uploading experience , Google encourages you to use the Picasa application .
It has been available for Windows for some time , but Google has released a beta for version for Mac OS X .
Picasa itself is quite comparable to iPhoto for Mac OS X , only it uploads images to Google instead of MobileMe , and it has a Windows version .
It keeps track of your images , allows you to edit them , and collects images into virtual albums .
Using Picasa , you can upload as many photos at a time as you want , up to your 1 GB free storage limit .
Google does n't limit features for free users , just storage space .
Additional storage starts at just $ 5 per year for 20GB , which is shared across Picasa , Gmail , and Google Docs .
Options go all the way up to 1TB , which costs $ 256 per year , and also includes a free Eye - Fi WiFi- enabled memory card for direct Picasa uploads .
Like Flickr , individual image pages allow you to add and edit tags , titles , and captions .
You have options to edit using Picasa ( if it 's installed ) , order prints online , and download the image .
You can also click " Share " to send the image via e-mail using your Gmail account , or you can click " Link to this Photo " in the sidebar to get either a link to the Picasa page or HTML code to embed in another webpage .
One nice feature that Google recently added to Picasa is facial recognition .
i Photo added this feature January of last year , buy Google takes it one step further — the facial recognition works via Picasa Web Albums , even if you do n't use the Picasa application itself .
You can link faces to your Gmail contacts , and sort all your images by who is in them .
Photobucket
Photobucket is another great sharing option if neither Flickr nor Picasa float your boat .
Photobucket uses a Java - based uploader that lets you browse your file system for images to upload .
It will also pull in images from any accessible URL , and offers options to upload via MMS or e-mail ( Flickr offers these latter two options ) .
Like Flickr , the free option includes ads and a number of limits to uploads , resolution , and bandwidth .
For registering , you 'll get 500 MB of storage space , in which you can store images limited to 1024x768 pixels and 1 MB total file size .
You 'll have a 10 GB per month bandwidth limit , with limited statistics reports about how your images are viewed .
Moving up to a Pro account will cost $ 2.99 per month if you pay monthly , or $ 24.95 per year .
Photobucket also offers a 20 % discount if you pay for two years up front .
Pro accounts have unlimited storage space and bandwidth , can upload images as high as 4000 x 3000 pixels , and can also access images via FTP .
This last feature is especially nice if you need to replace images lost on a local drive or move images somewhere else at a later date .
Pro users get ad - free albums , custom URLs for each album , support for Flash files in addition to photos and videos , " premium " tech support , and Photobucket promises to keep links to your images active .
One area that sets Photobucket apart from other services are the extensive sharing options .
You can link your Facebook , MySpace , or Twitter accounts to share directly with those services .
You can also grab a link to the Photobucket page , a direct link to the image file itself , HTML embedding code , and IMG code compatible with most popular bulletin boards and forums .
You can send an image directly to a cell phone as an MMS , but it 'll cost you $ 1.99 for the privilege each time .
Also similar to Flickr , you can edit images directly via built - in support for FotoFlexer.com , which offers a number of options similar to Picnik .
Photobucket partners with Kodak to offer traditional prints as well as photo - adorned gifts like mugs , cards , puzzles , and t- shirts via Kodak .
You can also have prints sent to a local Target store for printing and pickup .
Now get uploading and sharing
These are just a few of the many options available .
There are several sharing sites , such as TwitPic and yfrog that are specifically for sharing with Twitter .
There are other services , such as Skitch , which interface for sharing directly from a screen grabbing app .
But these three options are the most popular among
Ars staff for free , general purpose image hosting .
If you have a favorite free or low - cost service , let us know in the comments .

There comes a right of passage of every New Yorker when eventually they come across the one room mate they will never forget in a long time .
Mine came 3 years ago when it turned out my friendly coy new room mate Joey was also Joey the friendly coy heroin dealer of the block .
Of course I could n’t resist the temptation to watch in disarray and in complete amazement as the next 3 months spawned a lot of writing material and the tell tale signs of when your new room mate is a junkie .
In my case I got the bonus addition of Joey not only being a dealer but a premium junkie too .
That said let ’s re-live some of the fond memories I personally hope you will never ever come up against .
Give away sign number 1 :
1/ Junkies prefer the evening .
If you room mate is quiet during the day it ’s because he is catching up on sleep .
Not to fear , you will soon be seeing them get up circa 4 pm in the afternoon where they then proceed to make a lot of hushed phone calls .
2/ Junkies prefer eating your food .
Why ?
Because they need every dollar they can get to tend to their fix .
3/ Junkies are perpetually walking around in dark sun glasses even at night time .
4 / Your table spoons are always missing .
Trust me you do n’t want to use them after they have been used in the way you least imagined them .
5/ Junkies like to hang around with other junkies .
If you continuously notice a weird motley congregating in your room mates room , trust me – they are not playing video games .
6 / Your room mate does n’t have a job or was recently fired from a job .
This allows them more time to concentrate on their real passion .
7 / Your room mate breaking down for no apparent reason .
It ’s best to ignore these ‘ temper tantrums , ’ nod your head convincingly before shaking it in despair once they have returned to their room for a re fill .
8 / Your room mate is always asking you to lend them money .
9 / Your room mate never ever eats .
10 / The empty syringes accidentally left in the bathroom .
A history of the world ’s worst room mates .

More than 50 villagers suffering from lead poisoning were detained after the bus taking them for health checks was stopped by police
This article is more than 10 years old
This article is more than 10 years old
Chinese authorities have defended the six - month detention of lead poisoning victims who were seeking medical care , saying the punishment was necessary for " public education " .
Police in Jiahe , Hunan province , blocked a bus carrying 53 villagers who were on their way to get health checks last September , according to Chinese media .
Mistakenly believing the villagers were planning to protest , the police have detained two of them for the six months since on the charge of " disrupting traffic " .
Though it has since been proved that they and their children were contaminated by illegal emissions of heavy metals from a smelting factory , the local government was unapologetic .
" We may have blocked the wrong visit , but they should not have been on that road , " Li Ying , deputy secretary of Jiahe county political and legislative committee told the Beijing News , which today published an investigation into the incident .
Ou Shudong , the chairman of the local People 's Congress , told the newspaper the police roadblock and detentions were justified .
" The villagers ' intentions were unclear .
Even if they were going for a medical examination , they should have informed the government . "
The story highlights the feudal control that local officials exercise in much of rural China .
It also exemplifies the widespread strategy of stifling dissent by making an example of suspected ringleaders , a tactic known as " killing a chicken to scare the monkeys " .
A Jiahe county report cited by the newspaper says the punishment of a few people " served the purpose of public education for the majority " .
The Guardian 's calls to the county government , police bureau and communist party went unanswered .
The journalistic exposure of police tactics came amid a widening wave of heavy metal scandals .
Since the first cases last summer , more than 3,000 children nationwide have been found to have unsafe levels of lead in their blood , forcing the closure of dozens of factories .
According to the environment ministry , 12 heavy metal pollutions incident were reported last year , prompting 32 public disturbances .
Amid widespread unease that the full scale of the problem has yet to emerge , the authorities face a growing environmental and public security challenge .
The factory in Jiahe was operated by Tenda Corporation , a company that had been ejected from other , wealthier areas because of its dire pollution record .
Jiahe – one of China 's poorest counties – allowed it to operate despite warnings from the local environmental department that the plant was breaking toxic emission regulations .
A gradual build - up of lead in the bloodstream can damage the nervous system and lead to anaemia , muscle weakness , arrested development and brain damage .
Local people complained of health problems and unusually belligerent behaviour and poor school grades among their children , but their petitions to the authorities were ignored for more than three years .
However , medical tests have proved their claims .
The latest results , received on 24 February , revealed that 250 of the 397 children in the village had excess levels of lead in their blood .
The victims included four of the five children of Liao Mingxiu , one of those still in police detention .
More lead poisoning cases are emerging elsewhere .
This week , 88 children and six adults tested positive for lead poisoning in Longchang county , Sichuan province .
Seven children have been hospitalised for a week and more than 700 people are awaiting medical test results .
The source of the contamination , the Zhongyi Alloy factory , has since been closed .
" We have sent 10 doctors to the villages to explain the situation to residents , " said Zheng Shili , propaganda director of Longchang government .
" Public sentiment is basically calm . "

On Friday , 29 January 2010 , Israel submitted to the UN an update on the investigations opened following Operation Cast Lead in the Gaza Strip .
The 46 - page document offers almost no new information , except for updated figures on the investigations .
The report states that , to date , the military has begun to examine 150 cases , most of which are still under review .
In 36 cases , a Military Police investigation was initiated ; the others were examined in the framework of military debriefings .
This report , like previous information that official sources have published , does not specify which cases are being examined or the stage each investigation has reached .
A significant part of the report is devoted to proving the military justice system 's ability to handle complaints about the military 's conduct during the operation on its own .
As a result of this emphasis , only part of the story is presented , while the way in which the system operates in reality is largely ignored .
Several examples follow .
The report extols the establishment of the Judge Advocate 's Office for Operational Affairs in 2007 , which handles , among other things , complaints against soldiers who mistreated Palestinians .
The report does not mention that the unit lacks sufficient personnel and is highly overloaded by the massive number of files it has received , nor that it takes months and even years for decisions to be made on many of the files .
As a result , even if a decision is ultimately made to open a Military Police investigation , the investigation is ineffective and is unlikely to expose the truth .
The report states that the Military Police Investigation Unit is staffed by hundreds of skilled investigators , including reservists , who have undergone special training .
However , MPIU investigations regarding Palestinian complaints have many structural problems : the MPIU has no base in the Occupied Territories , the investigators do not visit the scene of the incident , and they do not have a criminal forensics lab at their disposal .
In addition , in most cases , investigators cannot access the Palestinian victims without the assistance of human rights organization , and most investigators do not speak Arabic .
The report also refrains from pointing out that , once the investigation is completed , files wait for long periods , sometimes years , for the chief military prosecutor to decide how to proceed .
In this case , too , the delayed decisions diminish the effectiveness of the process .
The report also provides only part of the picture regarding civilian supervision of the military justice system , creating the impression that there is tight supervision .
Whether this is the proper degree of supervision or not , it is important that the facts be presented precisely .
For example , the report states that the attorney general is empowered to examine all the decisions of the Judge Advocate General ( JAG ) , but does not mention that this intervention is rare and occurs only in extremely exceptional cases .
The report also states that the Supreme Court is empowered to cancel decisions of the JAG , giving three cases as illustrations .
However , in one of these cases , the Supreme Court did not interfere , as the JAG changed his decision before the judgment was given .
The other two cases are the highly unusual exceptions to the rule and certainly do not attest to a policy .
The report does not mention that Supreme Court justices have time and again reiterated their hesitance to interfere in the JAG 's discretion .
No system can investigate itself .
The report emphasizes the independence of the military justice system in interpreting the law .
However in all other matters , it is an integral part of the military .
As such , it depends on the military system for budgets , personnel complements , and promotions .
For example , the last two JAGs were personally given the rank of major general by the Chief of General Staff .
All the decision - makers involved in the handling of complaints are subject to this system .
Furthermore , regarding the investigation of complaints that were filed against the army 's conduct during the operation , the independence of the JAG 's Office is even more in doubt .
The Office was involved , for example , in drafting the open - fire regulations for Operation Cast Lead , in deciding what constituted a legitimate target , and in approving the use of certain weapons .
Therefore , if it is found that these determinations contravene international humanitarian law , members of the JAG's Office are liable to be investigated and prosecuted themselves .
Clearly , then , they can not be put in charge of these investigations .
Military debriefings are the major tool used by the JAG's Office to investigate the army 's conduct during the operation .
These debriefings are conducted by senior officers inside the military , who have no professional training in conducting such investigations , and are not independent of the persons whose acts they are supposed to investigate .
In addition , as the debriefings remain confidential even after they are completed , there is no way to examine the questions raised in them , and the degree of the seriousness in which they were conducted .
The military debriefings and MPIU investigations focus on specific cases .
The assumption underlying them is that the soldiers acted within a legal framework , and that the only thing left to examine is whether they deviated from the orders given them .
However , this assumption is fundamentally wrong .
Many suspicions of breaches of international humanitarian law during the operation relate specifically to the policy that was dictated to the soldiers .
For example , decisions regarding the legitimacy of targets and the weapons permitted for use were made prior to the operation .
The military investigations currently under way do not question the legality of these decisions .
This method of investigation , in which policy is not at all examined , leads to most of the responsibility for violations being placed only on the soldiers in the field , while the senior officers and the political echelon , who were responsible for giving the orders , go free .
To date , more than one year after the operation ended , all the investigations conducted by Israel have led to the prosecution of a single soldier , who was convicted and sentenced to seven months ' imprisonment for stealing a Palestinian 's credit card .
This result is hardly surprising , given that Israeli officials , among them the Minister of Defense and the Chief of General Staff , declared almost from the beginning of the operation that the IDF “ is the most moral army in the world ” .
B'Tselem again urges Israel to immediately establish an independent investigative apparatus composed of persons from outside the military .
The investigation must examine not only the conduct of the soldiers in the field but also the orders given them and the policy that was set by the senior military echelon and the political echelon .
New Delhi , India ( CNN ) --
In an event considered rare , one of India 's low - caste communities has declared its own distinct religion .
Followers of a 14 - century spiritual figure , Guru Ravidass , will now have their own holy scriptures , a flag and a greeting , sect officials said .
The new holy book compiles Guru Ravidass ' writings , which until now were predominantly found in sacred Sikh scriptures that the sect placed in its houses of worship .
The declaration was made by a key Ravidass monastery whose priest 's killing in May last year in Vienna , Austria sparked furious protests in the Sikh heartland of Punjab .
Thousands of protesters from the low - caste communities -- called the Dalits , meaning the suppressed -- attacked road and rail transportation in the wake of the murder blamed on Sikh hardliners .
C.R. Suman , the manager of the Sachkhand Ballan monastery in Punjab state , told CNN that the announcement of a new Ravidassia faith was made on Saturday to a large congregation at the birthplace of the revered leader in Uttar Pradesh state .
Experts say the move was a response to social discrimination against low castes in Punjab , where close to 30 percent of the population is Dalit , the highest in any Indian state .
" The Ravidassias and other Dalits remain marginalized in Punjab , politically , religiously and economically , " said author Balbir Madhopuri , who has written several books on the Hindu caste system .
Analysts say the declaration of a new faith is likely to be a psychological boost for Dalits in India .
" They appear to have asserted themselves in a strategy that will give them a greater bargaining strength in their home state where power has centered around specific castes , " said columnist Jaspal Singh Sidhu .
" Outside of Punjab , it is likely to give a big psychological boost to other Dalit communities . "
There are estimated about five million Ravidassias from Punjab now spread across the world , said Madhopuri .
Madhopuri , however , believes the new sacred text may not attract other Dalit communities because it only contains Ravidass verses .
" Yet , this announcement of a distinct religion is a symbol of Dalit assertion , " he said .
According to Madhopuri , the last time the Dalits came together as a faith was in 1925 when the British ruled India .
In the 1931 census , more than 450,000 registered themselves as members of the new Dalit faith called Ad Dharam , or Original Religion .
But the faith vanished after India 's independence mainly because of what Madhopuri explained were lures of government jobs reserved for low - caste Hindus and Sikhs .
In India , Hindus make up more than 80 percent of its billion - plus population .
Muslims constitute the second - largest religious group .
Sikhs , Buddhists , Jains and other faiths together form about 6 percent of remaining Indians .
After independence from the British in 1947 , India outlawed what was an age - old practice of untouchability of low - caste Hindus by those seen as superior by birth .
Still , the communities are believed to be facing bias despite having being given quotas for government jobs .
India 's crime statistics show that police registered more than 133,000 cases from 2004 to 2008 under the country 's stringent laws to protect Dalits against atrocities .
The birth of a new religion in Punjab has had Sikhs worried the most , as it emerged in their state where the monotheistic faith was founded in the 15th century to break caste and religious distinctions .
The Shiromani Gurdwara Parbandhak Committee ( SGPC ) , the top Sikh religious administration , termed the Ravidassia declaration unfortunate .
It disagrees that the practical Sikh response to the downtrodden did not match the Sikh faith 's core beliefs of equality .
" It 's unfortunate that this has happened .
Sikh thought is against any kind of prejudice , " said SGPC general secretary Sukhdev Singh Bhaur .
" I would appeal to them ( the Ravidassias ) to revisit their decision . "
Look , we get the whole drive behind this 3D thing .
For some , there 's no better way to experience sports , films , or console game play and consumer electronics companies are desperate for a source of new revenue .
But creating a 280 - inch 3D LED display meant for public areas does n't make a lot of sense long - term unless we 're expected to carry those swank , polarized glasses everywhere we go .
Nevertheless , Sony was demonstrating the 6.4 x 3.4 - meter behemoth at the International Broadcast Equipment Exhibition 2009 in Japan .
The panel combines 70 LED displays into a single monstrosity of overlapping images .
If nothing else this " 3D LED Wall " demonstrates Sony 's rabid commitment to 3D for 2010 and an ominous future for our friends working in Times Square .
See it in action after the break if you care .
I ’ve worked on phc since 2005 , and been its maintainer since 2007 .
I wrote the optimizer , and nearly everything performance related .
I had mixed reactions upon hearing about the release of HPHP [ 1 ] , the new PHP compiler from Facebook .
There are a few aspects to this so I ’ll start with the technical stuff .
I always love the social aspect , so skip to the bottom if you like whining and tears .
How does it work ?
I do n’t know the answer to this .
I have n’t seen anyone even mention PHP ’s references , which are incredibly gnarly for a static analyzer [ 2 ] .
HPHP might just ignore it , which is n’t necessarily a bad idea .
I ’m wary of ignoring edge cases , as they tend to interact in horrible ways , but I guess Facebook already run all their code off it , so it ca n’t be that bad .
In general , I ’ve found that ignoring the edge cases is bad when compiling PHP .
There are a million of them , and they all interact .
They interact worst of all in static analysis , because you have to consider all possible paths .
Its the sort of thing where if you nail it 100 % , then you have something amazing and widely applicable , so that ’s what I was aiming for with my PhD .
I suspect HPHP does n’t consider all paths , and makes all sorts of hacky assumptions [ 3 ] .
This is probably a really good idea .
I did the opposite in the optimizer , and the result is instead immature and slow .
Speed
Facebook said HPHP reduces by half their number of servers .
PHP ’s libraries are already written in C , which gives it the appearance of being fast , even though the interpreter is dog -slow .
This implies that HPHP - compiled PHP code is much more than twice as fast as the PHP interpreter .
This probably means HPHP is way faster than phc ’s compiled code as well .
They could have built a JIT !!
I saw some criticism for not building a JIT on LLVM .
But :
LLVM is n’t mature enough for a proper dynamic JIT yet , as the Unladen Swallow team found out .
JITs are very hard to build .
They ratchet up the complexity of building a compiler by about 10 times , so its probably best to avoid them if you can [ 4 ] .
PHP does n’t really need a JIT .
Server side programs in PHP do n’t do a great deal of dynamic stuff , and it would be incredibly rare to load some random code at run-time , so a JIT would n’t be all that useful .
PHP is not like other dynamic languages .
Duck - typing is possible , but most of the community best practices come from Java ( along with the class system ) , and so its not used that much .
Monkey - patching — switching out classes and methods from objects at run-time — is n’t possible , except with the hackiest of hacky unsupported extensions .
Dynamicism in PHP tends to involve templates instead , like with Smarty .
If you want to analyze it , then you just need to run it a few times , get all the templates to be instantiated , and compile all the generated PHP code .
I ’ve started calling this “ deployment - time analysis ” , since in server - side , you probably know all the code you ’re going to compile at deployment - time .
So a compiler is a perfectly reasonable approach for PHP , and a JIT is probably not needed .
Will it be useful for me ?
People seem to want to know if HPHP is widely useful outside of Facebook , and some people are saying “ no ” .
I disagree strongly .
In order for HPHP to be useful , you need to have a PHP application which is suffering due to PHP interpreter performance .
That matches Facebook perfectly , and they ’ve always been the canonical example I use to explain why PHP compilers are interesting .
But you do n’t have to be Facebook size or scale to have performance problems .
Do you really need more speed ? [ 5 ]
I ’ve heard the argument “ you do n’t need a compiler , since PHP is rarely the bottleneck ” for many years .
I think its complete bollox .
But I wrote a compiler for PHP , so I would say that .
Unless your PHP server is sitting there idling ( which is probably the case for many PHP servers out there ) , then you could make use of a PHP compiler .
For small timers , all components of your application are going to be sitting on the same box , contending for the same resources .
Even if you assume the DB is the bottleneck , the resources the interpreter consumes could be more profitably spent on the DB .
The PHP interpreter is also quite memory hungry , as interpreters go .
Any PHP value in your program uses 68 bytes of overhead [ 6 ] .
An array of a million values takes over 68 MB .
If HPHP is able to convert your million value array to native C types , it will only take 4MB .
I ’m sure your caches could make good use of that savings .
However , optimization is n’t only about speed .
The main value is that they give you freedom in how you code .
There is a meme in the scripting language communities that { PHP , Ruby , Python , Perl , etc} are “ fast - enough ” .
If you need it to go faster , then you should take your hot - loop and rewrite it in C. HPHP will free you from such concerns .
You should consider also that PHP is considered relatively fast .
Its not — the interpreter is dog- slow — but programs written in PHP are typically not that slow .
This is because most of PHP ’s huge standard library is written in C , with a thin layer of PHP over it .
Anytime you call a string function , your PHP C string is passed into the C library , the pointers are manipulated and the bits are twiddled , and then it ’s handed back to your code .
Its a bit like driving in America : it takes a few minutes to get on the freeway , but once you ’re on it you ’re there in no time .
This is not necessarily a good thing :
if you want to write a library , and it needs to be fast , then it needs to be written in C , if there is a PHP function that does almost what you need , and you write your own version instead , it will be slow .
Believe me , if your entire application just ran PHP interpreted code , it would not be fast at all .
But people who write PHP functions and libraries do n’t want to write C .
They like PHP , are productive in it , and any time spent arsing around in C is wasted when there ’s a website falling apart and a long list of features due yesterday .
HPHP will free you from such concerns .
Compilers also provide other niceties .
You do n’t have to unroll your own loops , or move constant expressions out of loop headers .
I do n’t know if HPHP supports these , but I ’m sure it could .
Allowing your existing code to go faster is hardly the point though .
Really , the point is that you can do more in less time .
Suppose you ’ve decided that your application needs to response to the user in 500 ms .
The DB takes 200 ms , the request takes 200 ms , the framework takes 50ms and your code only has 50 ms to run [ 7 ] .
That ’s quite a constraint .
This leads to people using PHP as a simple templating layer , instead of as the Turing - complete language it is .
I expect we ’ll hear a lot more about HPHP , simply because of how freeing it is to the user .
So even if you only have a small VPS , instead of massive server farms like Facebook , you ’re likely to find a use for HPHP .
I ’m sure shared hosts will set it all up soon for their users , and everyone will be happy .
Dynamic constructs
A better question is , how widely applicable is a compiler which does n’t support all of PHP ’s dynamic constructs ?
Funnily enough I did a bit of research on this .
We chose the opposite tactic for phc : trying to stay 100 % compatible with Zend , all the extensions ( even the 3rd - party , unpublished , top - secret , proprietary ones ) , etc .
You would expect we would first research whether this was useful ?
Well no .
We built it , and then I did some analysis to check whether it was useful .
You can read it in depth [ 8 ] .
Basically , I downloaded 700 packages off Sourceforge , and wrote some phc plugins to check for evals and dynamic includes ( a dynamic include uses a variable as its parameter , instead of a constant or literal ) .
Result : 40 % of PHP packages use dynamic constructs .
Now this is n’t quite as scientific as it should be .
Lots of those programs were old , and styles have changed .
eval is discouraged these days , but it ’s probably still used , if only to get around the weaknesses of the PHP parser .
In particular , this does n’t imply that HPHP is somehow fatally flawed for not supporting dynamic constructs .
It just means it might not be so useful to you , the common PHP programmer .
An easy way to get round dynamic includes is to just consider the PHP files in the directory structure .
There was a good research paper by Wassermann on supporting that , but I find it very hard going , so you probably will too .
Still , a naive approach is to just stick a switch statement in , and compile everything that makes sense .
This is how you would deal with things like WordPress plugins .
It does mean that if you change your plugins , you ’re just going to have to recompile .
If you ’re using a compiler , I doubt you would find that a problem .
Social stuff
But not everyone is happy with this new compiler , such as , well , me .
Lets start with a quick whine .
I contacted Facebook two years ago to test and demo phc ,
I went and gave a talk at Facebook , and met a number of engineers ,
I know they ’ve used phc internally in the past ,
They ’re releasing a PHP compiler .
You would think they could at least invite me to the party .
Those bastards .
More seriously , I actually was annoyed at all the news reports about HPHP , principally because they were largely bullshit .
And I knew it , and I could n’t say more because I told Facebook I would n’t .
There is very little more irritating than idiots being wrong on the internet , and the news stories brought out thousands of them !
Reddit and Hacker News were literally covered with stories about HPHP .
Hundreds of trolls emerged from under their bridges , not knowing the difference between a bytecode - based interpreter , a caching PHP accelerator , and a native compiler ( which is fine , until they start saying they ’re all the same ) .
Think about it now still makes me angry .
I ’m also slightly annoyed that people all of a sudden care about PHP compilers .
I worked on one for 4 years and I could not convince anyone to give a shit .
But now that its got the Facebook logo on it , all of a sudden PHP compilers are the greatest thing ever .
Bah .
One saving grace is that they did n’t patent it .
I have an email in my inbox from one of the HPHP developers saying he could n’t talk to me about the compiler because they might patent it .
That ’s pretty shitty .
Thank god they open - sourced it instead [ 9 ] .
It sounds like it was a bit touch and go for a while .
The most important question !
Which bring us to the question of whether they should have used phc ?
Obviously it would be great if they had used phc , and I ’m not privy to the reasons they did n’t [ 10 ] .
The design decisions we made in phc were aimed at maximum compatibility , and the performance suffered [ 11 ] as a result .
The optimizer was designed to solve these problems , and I believe it would have , but it is not mature enough now , and was still a twinkle in my eye when HPHP started two years ago .
Facebook was solving their performance problems , not building a PHP compiler for general use .
If they were doing the latter , it would be much easier to criticize their approach , but for now I ca n’t say I would have advised them otherwise .
On the other hand , they probably did n’t need to build their own parser — its a tricky problem and phc ‘s parser and front - end are excellent .
Had they gone another way , then they could probably have started to use phc ‘s optimizer [ 12 ] , which while immature and slow to compile , is pretty state - of - the - art and has great potential ( if I do say so myself ) .
A better approach would probably have been to hire all the programmers who worked on PHP compilers , to get that expertise in house .
They did try to hire me , but only recently .
I ’m honestly surprised that they have n’t tried to hire the Shannon Weyrick , who is currently working on rphp , his second PHP compiler [ 13 ] .
What does this mean for phc ?
When they announced HPHP , I would have said it was phc ’s death toll .
The original phc authors , Edsko and John , have moved on to other projects , and I ’ve run it mostly solo for about two years .
But I have n’t worked on phc in about 6 months , and my hatred of PHP makes it unlikely I will again .
My requests for new contributors to step up has fallen on deaf ears , and my summer intern has n’t decided to take over either .
Since no - one wants to take on the compiler , the new competition from Facebook should probably kill it , right ?
Maybe not .
Over the last week , traffic to the phc website has increased by five times [ 14 ] .
Facebook has unleashed some sort of latent interest in PHP compilers that I have n’t been able to extract from people .
So perhaps this might be the rebirth of phc , not its death .
And phc is better than HPHP in some ways .
HPHP is almost certainly faster because they did n’t have to deal with eval , dynamic stuff , and because they do n’t use the Zend libraries .
But phc was specifically designed to work with the Zend libraries , with eval , with everything .
So it ’s probably a better fit for most projects than HPHP .
If you want to take over phc , then join the mailing lists , download the source code , read the death notice and contribution page , and email me for commit access .
phc will likely live on anyway .
The front - end is pretty slick : Facebook ran it over their million lines of code and only had one or two problems .
It gives a lovely AST to allow all sorts of code transformation tools , has a nice plugin interface ( for C++ lovers ) and an XML interface ( for the rest of you ) , and will spit your code out largely as you put it into it .
Its certainly the most mature and well tested part of the whole project .
The optimizer is pretty slick as well , but in a different way .
I ’m pretty sure its the most advanced static analyzer for PHP , and it ’s waiting to be put to good use .
That said , it ’s damn slow , and not mature ( read : pretty buggy ) , and itself does n’t support eval and dynamic includes ( surprise ! ! ) .
The optimizer is waiting for some love — I could imagine it making a pretty nice “ automatically find out what types your function may be passed ” kind of linter .
Otherwise , phc will only live on as part of the Roadsend Raven compiler .
I understand that they ’re going to take the optimizer and the parser from phc , and that will be really interesting .
Finally , what does it mean for me ?
Well , I ’ve left that ship already .
I ’ve hated PHP for a long time , and have no desire to go back to it .
I ’m doing a startup now , but when I go back to regular employment I will be looking for another scripting language run-time .
There are plenty to choose from , in particular Unladen swallow and TraceMonkey .
Mozilla looks like an amazing place to work , so I think I ’ve worked out my backup plan .
[ 1 ] I ca n’t bring myself to call it Hiphop .
Worst name ever .
Rumor has it that the ‘ H ’ in HPHP stands for “ Haiping ” , the author of HPHP , so I like that name better .
[ 2 ]
See chapter 6 of my PhD thesis .
[ 3 ]
This is just a hunch .
Obviously I have no way of verifying this , and I do n’t really want to read the source when it comes out to check .
So as accusations go , this one is obviously pretty baseless .
[ 4 ]
Says a guy who wrote a PHP compiler .
I may be biased .
[ 5 ]
I ’m trying to imply you do n’t , but everyone loves more speed .
Plus , compilers are cool toys , even if you do n’t need them .
So 99 % of the people who start using HPHP will use it cause its cool and they love to go fast , not because they ’ve carefully considered the design of their project and determined that a compiler would solve something .
[ 6 ] 68 bytes is on 32 - bit systems .
I think its 96 bytes on 64 bit .
[ 7 ]
I pulled these numbers out of my arse .
[ 8 ]
You can read the paper ( see Section 7.5 ) for my method , results , etc .
[ 9 ]
Open - sourcing and patenting are n’t strictly mutually exclusive , but presumably they wo n’t patent it now .
A firm word on the topic from Facebook would be nice .
And yes , I ’m aware of the patent climate in America , and how you have to patent everything you can get your hands on , and it does n’t make you evil .
It still fucks with people who write compilers though .
[ 10 ]
If you know why , let me know .
This is open source , I can take it .
[ 11 ] I went into a bit of detail in my Google Tech Talk , if you ’re interested .
[ 12 ]
Interested parties can find more information in chapter 6 of my PhD thesis .
[ 13 ]
This is pronounced RoadsEnd , apparently .
I ’ve been mispronouncing it for years .

Feb. 10 , 2010 - The first draft of the new psychiatric manual -- the DSM-V , to be finalized in 2013 -- makes major changes in how a wide range of mental illnesses will be diagnosed .
Nothing is set in stone , says the American Psychiatric Association ( APA ) task force that is writing the new diagnostic " bible " -- the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders Version V , which will replace the DSM - IV written in 1994 .
But some of the changes would be radical :
Say good - bye to Asperger 's syndrome -- it would now be at the mild end of the " autism spectrum disorder . "
" autism spectrum disorder . "
Say hello to " temper dysregulation with dysphoria " or TDD , a new category of mood disorder for some children now lumped together with those suffering the more severe bipolar disorder .
Say good - bye to " substance abuse " and " substance dependence . "
Addiction disorders would be named after the addictive substance , such as " cannabis-use disorder " and " alcohol - use disorder . "
A new category of " risk syndromes " would diagnose troubled teens with symptoms such as disordered thinking as having " psychosis risk syndrome . "
Public comments are welcome until April 20 , and the new diagnoses will be tested in three sets of field trials before the DSM - V becomes final .
The process has been anything but smooth .
Two of the leaders of the task force that wrote the current manual have strongly criticized the way the new task force is doing its job .
Back - and - forth commentaries between them and the leaders of the new task force and the APA leadership , published in the Psychiatric Times , have degenerated into personal attacks .
One expert with a foot in both worlds -- he is the editor of several DSM - IV publications and directed the DSM - V prelude project -- is Michael B. First , MD , professor of psychiatry at Columbia University and a researcher at New York State Psychiatric Institute .
" This is what always happens when something is new , " First tells WebMD .
" But overall , this is definitely not a paradigm shift .
...
If this were the final draft , it would be time to call out the fire department .
But now that these things are on the table , I 'm hopeful that ideas that are possibly not the best will be taken away . "
* Dodge warns on housing price levels
* Says housing agency should look at insurance rules
OTTAWA , Feb 10 ( Reuters ) - Canadian house prices are close to unsustainable levels and while rapid interest rate hikes may not be appropriate , the country ’s housing agency should look carefully at which mortgages it insures , a former Bank of Canada governor said on Wednesday .
“ One would have to say that the relation of house prices to Canadians ’ income is right at the high end of what one would think would likely be sustainable over time , ” David Dodge , central bank chief from 2001 - 2008 , told Canada ’s Business News Network channel in an interview .
“ That does n’t say the ( central ) bank ought to somehow raise interest rates really quickly , but it does say that central mortgage and housing should be very careful about the terms and conditions on which they are giving mortgage insurance , ” he said .
BNN aired one segment of its interview with Dodge and will broadcast the rest later on Wednesday .
Dodge was referring to the obligatory mortgage insurance for higher - risk home purchases .
The law requires home buyers who can afford less than a 20 percent down payment to obtain insurance from the state - run Canadian Mortgage and Housing Corp ( CMHC ) .
Dodge reprimanded the CMHC during his tenure at the central bank for loosening mortgage insurance rules .
Finance Minister Jim Flaherty subsequently tightened standards .
Flaherty said on the weekend there was no compelling evidence of a housing bubble in Canada , but that if necessary CMHC could toughen its down payment and amortization rules for riskier mortgages .
The Bank of Canada has also said it is premature to talk of a bubble in the housing market , but has warned that overall household debt in Canada is historically high in relation to income .

The whole reason of FOURCC codes is to prevent this mess
I really hate it when people overload four - character ( FOURCC ) codes for video formats they were n't intended to handle .
Why ?
Because it creates a mess that the user has to clean up manually .
The whole point of FOURCC codes and format structures is to unambiguously identify the format and color space of image data .
When you overload an existing FOURCC with a new meaning , it creates ambiguity that causes conversion errors throughout a video processing pipeline that can be hard to track down .
One common transgression is writing full range YCbCr data into the YUY2 FOURCC instead of 16-235 luma range .
This creates all sorts of situations where video ends up either 14 % higher or lower in contrast because two modules disagree on what range is being used , and they can't autonegotiate because the same code has been overloaded .
Ditto for Rec. 601 vs. Rec. 709 coefficients , or interlaced vs. noninterlaced .
One solution that is often suggested is to make it a user choice .
Well , that 's one way to " solve " the problem , but it propagates the mess , and it also assumes that the user knows the answer to the question .
Do your users whether the video codec you are using uses full - range luma or not ?
Does the vendor who makes the video codec document that ?
Probably not .
It gets worse , though , when you consider that there may be hidden conversions in the pipeline .
You can argue that hidden conversions are bad , and in general it 's better to avoid them for performance and quality reasons .
However , they 're sometimes unavoidable , particularly for display .
What would you do if you saw this dialog :
... followed by more for the video compressor and for the video driver .
Heck , at this point , why bother having FOURCCs at all ?
Just make the user enter in the color space and chroma subsampling information too .
I 've also heard the suggestion to make the determination based on whether the frame size is SD or HD .
That 's not really any better .
So now you can't resize video temporarily across the SD / HD boundary without incurring a color conversion ... yuck .
An additional reason I 've heard to put in options is to recover blacker than black ( BTB ) and whiter than white ( WTW ) areas .
Well , yes , you can do that via changing the color space , but that 's not really what you 're trying to do -- you need some sort of conversion to map those values in range , but the full range YCbCr color space is unlikely to be the one you want , and by changing the color space you 're also whacking chroma as well as luma .
What you really need is a custom color conversion matrix or at least to remap the luma range .
Otherwise , you 're likely reducing contrast more than necessary or introducing slight color shifts into your video .
At this point , I 've resigned myself to having to eventually add some of these options to VirtualDub , because I see far too many cases where people have broken color conversions in their pipeline and they need to be able to compensate for codecs and players that use the wrong conversion formula .
However , I fully intend to put a big " THIS IS NON - STANDARD " flag on the options , because I do not want to further the idea that this is the way that FOURCCs are supposed to work .
Doing this is a big change to the blitter and display libraries , too , so I have no idea when this would be implemented .

Earlier this morning , I stood on top of the rubble of the Supreme Court , the Foreign Ministry , the Interior Ministry and the Senate - where a few senators had been killed when the quake hit .
Their bodies have been dragged out and put in body bags .
The representatives of state are literally lying on the pavement slowly rotting away .
This is a citizenry left to its own extremely meagre resources .
You 've got ordinary people trying to administer IV drips to their family members who are slowly dying , but not a single doctor or nurse at the general hospital .
In a statement at the White House , he said the US would " do what it takes to save lives and help people get back on their feet " .
Correspondents say survivors seem increasingly desperate and angry as bottlenecks and infrastructure damage delay relief efforts .
Many are spending another day without food and shelter in the ruined capital .
Mr Holmes earlier told reporters that 30 % of buildings throughout Port - au - Prince had been damaged , with the figure at 50 % in some areas .
The Pan American Health Organization has estimated that the death toll could be as high as 100,000 .
The US has already sent an aircraft carrier , the USS Carl Vinson , to Haiti and the USS Bataan , carrying a marine expeditionary unit , is on its way .

The chairman of the US Joint Chiefs of Staff , Adm Mike Mullen , said a hospital ship and more helicopters would be sent in the coming days , carrying more troops and marines .
He said the total number of US troops would rise to between 9,000 and 10,000 .
" Right now , I mean , literally as we speak , the Vinson ( aircraft carrier ) and the company from the 82nd Airborne who got there last night are focusing on delivering water from the helicopters offshore to the people of Haiti . "
They want us to provide them with help , which is , of course , what we want to do

UN spokesman
Haiti children at risk of disease How survivors are found Haiti desperate for help Survivors ' stories LIVE : Haiti earthquake US defence secretary Robert Gates said the relief effort was the " highest priority for US military assets in this hemisphere " , and all necessary resources would be made available .
He described infrastructure problems which have led to delays in aid distribution as " facts of life " .
" I do n't know how ... [ the US ] government could have responded faster or more comprehensively than it has , " he said .
The announcements came after Mr Obama pledged full American support in a phone call to his Haitian counterpart Rene Preval .
The US president also said he would meet former Presidents George W Bush and Bill Clinton on Saturday to discuss Haiti .
US Secretary of State Hillary Clinton will meanwhile travel to Haiti to see for herself the scale of the damage .
Relief problems
The UN said a total of about $ 310 m ( £ 190 m ) in international aid had been pledged so far for the relief effort .

UN Secretary General Ban Ki-moon said that distribution of food and medicine was under way , but correspondents say there is little immediate sign of a co-ordinated relief effort on the ground .
The UN's World Food Programme says two million people will need food aid , but it has so far managed to feed just a few thousand .
Meanwhile , the head of the charity Medecins Sans Frontieres ( Doctors Without Borders ) said thousands of people were waiting for surgery in Haiti 's hospitals , AFP news agency reported .
Port - au - Prince 's small airport is filled to capacity and US air traffic controllers have taken charge to help manage the influx of planes .
Mr Holmes said everyone was " working desperately " to resolve the problems and the capacity to deal with flights was rising .
The port is too damaged to use and roads are blocked by debris , although the main route from the Dominican Republic is now clear .
Satellite and close - up images of Port - au - Prince devastation The BBC's Nick Davis in Port - au - Prince says the only convoys he has seen are people leaving the city , in search of food , water and medicine .
" We hear on the radio that rescue teams are coming from the outside , but nothing is coming , " said one man , Jean - Baptiste Lafontin Wilfried .
David Wimhurst , a spokesman for the Brazilian - led UN peacekeeping mission in Haiti , said : " Unfortunately , they 're slowly getting more angry and impatient . "
The UN headquarters has collapsed and correspondents say there is little official presence in Port - au - Prince despite incidents of looting .

About 45,000 - 50,000 people have died since Tuesday 's 7.0 magnitude earthquake and 300,000 have been made homeless , the UN estimates .
Aid groups say it is a race against time to find trapped survivors .
Plane - loads of rescuers and relief supplies are arriving from the UK , China , the EU , Canada , Russia and Latin American nations .
Gen Douglas Fraser , the commander of US Southcom , says around 90 aid flights a day are landing .

Some of the common words we use are frozen mistakes .
The term influenza comes from the Italian word meaning “ influence ” — an allusion to the influence the stars were once believed to have on our health .
European explorers searching for an alternate route to India ended up in the New World and uncomprehendingly dubbed its inhabitants indios , or Indians .
Neuroscientists have a frozen mistake of their own , and it is a spectacular blunder .
In the mid-1800s researchers discovered cells in the brain that are not like neurons ( the presumed active players of the brain ) and called them glia , the Greek word for “ glue . ”
Even though the brain contains about a trillion glia — 10 times as many as there are neurons — the assumption was that those cells were nothing more than a passive support system .
Today we know the name could not be more wrong .
Glia , in fact , are busy multitaskers , guiding the brain ’s development and sustaining it throughout our lives .
Glia also listen carefully to their neighbors , and they speak in a chemical language of their own .
Scientists do not yet understand that language , but experiments suggest that it is part of the neurological conversation that takes place as we learn and form new memories .
If you had to blame one thing for the mistaken impression about glia , it would have to be electricity .
The 18th - century physiologist Luigi Galvani discovered that if he touched a piece of electrified metal to an exposed nerve in a frog ’s leg , the leg twitched .
He and others went on to show that a slight pulse of electricity moving through the metal to the nerve was responsible .
For two millennia physicians and philosophers had tried to find the “ animal spirits ” that moved the body , and Galvani discovered that impetus :
It was the stuff of lightning .
Over the next two centuries scientists got a clearer understanding of how those signals work .
When a branch at one end of a nerve cell , or neuron , is stimulated , an electric pulse races toward the main body of the cell .
Other branches might send separate pulses at the same time .
The main body of the neuron conveys those pulses to an outgoing arm , or axon , which splits into numerous branches , each of which nearly touches other neurons .
The slight gap between two nerve cells is called a synaptic cleft .
The signal - sending neuron pumps chemicals into the space , and the signal - receiving neuron takes up some of them , triggering a new electric pulse .
All neurons have certain characteristic attributes : axons , synapses , and the ability to produce electric signals .
As scientists peered at bits of brain under their microscopes , though , they encountered other cells that did not fit the profile .
When impaled with electrodes , these cells did not produce a crackle of electric pulses .
If electricity was the language of thought , then these cells were mute .
German pathologist Rudolf Virchow coined the name glia in 1856 , and for well over a century the cells were treated as passive inhabitants of the brain .
At least a few scientists realized that this might be a hasty assumption .
The pioneering neuroscientist Santiago Ramón y Cajal earned a Nobel Prize in 1906 for what came to be known as the neuron doctrine — the theory that neurons are the fundamental units of the brain .
Ramón y Cajal did n’t think glia were necessarily just glue , however .
Instead , he thought they were a mystery — a mystery , he wrote , that “ may remain unsolved for many years to come until physiologists find direct methods to attack it . ”
Today the mystery of glia is partially solved .
Biologists know they come in several forms .
One kind , called radial glia , serve as a scaffolding in the embryonic brain .
Neurons climb along these polelike cells to reach their final location .
Another kind of glia , called microglia , are the brain ’s immune system .
They clamber through the neurological forest in search of debris from dead or injured cells .
A third class of glia , known as Schwann cells and oligodendrocytes , form insulating sleeves around neurons to keep their electric signals from diffusing .
But the more neuroscientists examine glia , the more versatile these cells turn out to be .
Microglia do not just keep the brain clean ; they also prune away extra branches on neurons to help fine - tune their developing connections .
Oligodendrocytes and Schwann cells do n’t just insulate cells ; they also foster new synapses between neurons .
And once radial glia are finished helping neurons move around the developing brain , they do n’t die .
They turn into another kind of glia , called astrocytes .
Astrocytes — named for their starlike rays , which reach out in all directions — are the most abundant of all glial cells and therefore the most abundant of all the cells in the brain .
They are also the most mysterious .
A single astrocyte can wrap its rays around more than a million synapses .
Astrocytes also fuse to each other , building channels through which molecules can shuttle from cell to cell .
All those connections put astrocytes in a great position to influence the goings - on in the brain .
They also have receptors that can snag a variety of neurotransmitters , which means that they may be able to eavesdrop on the biochemical chatter going on around them .
Yet for a long time , neuroscientists could not find any sign that astrocytes actually responded to signals from the outside .
Finally , in 1990 , neuroscientist Ann Cornell - Bell at Yale discovered what seemed to be a solution to the mystery .
It turned out that astrocytes , like neurons , can react to neurotransmitters — but instead of electricity , the cells produce waves of charged calcium atoms .
The calcium comes from sealed packets scattered through the astrocytes .
When stimulated , the cells rip open the calcium packets in the ray that first senses the neurotransmitters , triggering the opening of other packets elsewhere in the cell .
The astrocytes then stash the calcium atoms back in their packets , only to unleash them again when next stimulated .
Cornell - Bell noticed that a wave of such activity that started in one astrocyte could spread to other astrocytes .
Several research teams also discovered that astrocytes themselves release powerful neurotransmitters .
They can produce glutamate ( which excites neurons so that they are more likely to respond to a signal from another neuron ) and adenosine ( which can blunt a neuron ’s sensitivity ) .
For some brain scientists , these discoveries are puzzle pieces that are slowly fitting together into an exciting new picture of the brain .
Piece one : Astrocytes can sense incoming signals .
Piece two :
They can respond with calcium waves .
Piece three :
They can produce outputs — neurotransmitters and perhaps even calcium waves that spread to other astrocytes .
In other words , they have at least some of the requirements for processing information the way neurons do .
Alfonso Araque , a neuroscientist at the Cajal Institute in Spain , and his colleagues make a case for a fourth piece .
They find that two different stimulus signals can produce two different patterns of calcium waves ( that is , two different responses ) in an astrocyte .
When they gave astrocytes both signals at once , the waves they produced in the cells was not just the sum of the two patterns .
Instead , the astrocytes produced an entirely new pattern in response .
That ’s what neurons — and computers , for that matter — do .
If astrocytes really do process information , that would be a major addition to the brain ’s computing power .
After all , there are many more astrocytes in the brain than there are neurons .
Perhaps , some scientists have speculated , astrocytes carry out their own computing .
Instead of the digital code of voltage spikes that neurons use , astrocytes may act more like an analog network , encoding information in slowly rising and falling waves of calcium .
In his new book , The Root of Thought , neuroscientist Andrew Koob suggests that conversations among astrocytes may be responsible for “ our creative and imaginative existence as human beings . ”
Until recently , studies of astrocytes examined only a few cells sitting in a petri dish .
Now scientists are figuring out how to observe astrocytes in living animals and learning even more about the cells ’ abilities .
Axel Nimmerjahn of Stanford University and his colleagues , for instance , developed a way to mount microscopes on the skulls of mice .
To watch the astrocytes , they inject molecules into the mice that glow when they bind to free calcium .
Whenever a mouse moves one of its legs , Nimmerjahn and his colleagues can see a little burst of calcium waves .
In some cases , hundreds of astrocytes may flare up at once , and the flares can last as long as several seconds .
Astrocytes are also vital for synapses .
Stanford University neuroscientist Ben Barres and his colleagues found that neurons that grew with astrocytes formed nearly 10 times as many synapses as neurons growing without them , and the activity in those synapses was nearly 100 times greater .
Since synapses change as we learn and form new memories , Marie E. Gibbs of Monash University in Australia suspected that astrocytes might be important to our ability to learn .
To test that idea , she and her colleagues gave chicks colored beads to peck at .
The red beads were coated in a bitter chemical ; usually a single peck was enough to make the chicks learn never to peck a red bead again .
But when they were injected with a drug that prevented astrocytes from synthesizing glutamate , the birds were unable to remember the bad taste and would peck at the beads again .
But these sorts of experiments have not swayed some skeptics .
If the calcium waves really are so important , for instance , you would expect that a genetically engineered mouse that could n’t make calcium waves would be one sorry rodent .
Ken McCarthy , a neuroscientist at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill , and his colleagues engineered mice to grow astrocytes that lack a key protein required to pry open their calcium packets .
These mice grew up to be indistinguishable from ordinary ones , for reasons still unclear .
There is something marvelous in the fact that we barely understand what most of the cells in our brains are doing .
Beginning in the 1930s , astronomers realized that all the things they could see through their telescopes — the stars , the galaxies , the nebulas — make up just a small fraction of the total mass of the universe .
The rest , known as dark matter , still defies their best attempts at explanation .
Between our ears , it turns out , each of us carries a personal supply of dark matter as well .

On a Saturday morning in July of 1945 , Army Air Corps bomber pilot Lt. Colonel William Smith was trying to fly his B - 25 bomber through a steadily increasing fog .
He was on his way to Newark airport to pick up his commanding officer when he appeared above New York Municipal airport ( now La Guardia airport ) about 25 miles to the east of his destination .
He was requesting a weather report .
Municipal tower reported extremely poor visibility over New York , and urged him to land , but Lt. Colonel Smith requested and received clearance from the military to continue his flight .
“ From where I ’m sitting , ” the tower operator warned , “ I ca n’t see the top of the Empire State Building . ”
Despite the advice from the Municipal tower , Smith plunged into the soupy fog with his two crewmen , bound for Manhattan .
Partway through their flight , the pilot quickly became disoriented because he was unable to see the ground below , and he lost his way .
Despite Manhattan regulations that forbade aircraft from flying below 2,000 feet , Smith made the decision to drop below 1,000 feet in an attempt to untangle his bomber from the densest part of the fog .
When his plane emerged from the thick , his visibility indeed improved .
All around his aircraft , silhouettes of skyscrapers towered above Smith and his crew … and the New York Central Building was directly ahead .
Smith reacted quickly and banked hard , pushing the lumbering bomber to its stress limits to try to avoid the collision .
His plane just missed the New York Central Building , flying past its west side with little room to spare .
Dozens of skyscrapers lay beyond the first one , leaving a forest of fog - shrouded towers in the plane ’s path .
Smith tried to gain altitude as he weaved between the ghostly shadows of buildings , forcing the bomber to maneuver at its operational extremes .
When the Empire State Building emerged from the fog right ahead of his craft , Smith banked his plane and pulled back as hard as he was able , but the bomber lacked the maneuverability to dodge the large tower looming over it .
At 9:49 a.m , in the middle of a desperate , climbing turn , the ten - ton B - 25 slammed into the 79th floor of the Empire State Building .
Inside , workers for the War Relief Services of the National Catholic Welfare Conference had already started work when their offices were suddenly engulfed an an explosion of flaming , high - octane fuel .
The burning gasoline traveled through hallways , stairwells , and elevator shafts , reaching as far as four floors below the point of impact as the building shook .
A publicist working in the offices was propelled out of a window from the explosion , and ten others were caught in the inferno .
Fire and debris rained upon the surrounding area , mostly onto nearby structures .
One of the bomber ’s engines completely penetrated the Empire State Building , and fell from the opposite side .
The other engine flew into an elevator shaft and severed the cable of an elevator car carrying two women , sending it into free fall .
Catherine O’Connor , who was working in the offices at the time of the crash , later recounted her experience :
“ The plane exploded within the building .
There were five or six seconds ⁠ —
I was tottering on my feet trying to keep my balance⁠ — and three - quarters of the office was instantaneously consumed in this sheet of flame .
One man was standing inside the flame .
I could see him .
It was a co-worker , Joe Fountain .
His whole body was on fire .
I kept calling to him , ‘ Come on , Joe ; come on , Joe . ’ ”
He walked out of it .
Doris Pope , also in the building at the time , initially suspected that World War 2 had been brought to American soil :
“ That day , as we were getting ready to take our coffee break , we heard this terrible noise , and the building started to shake .
…
As we looked out our third - floor window , we saw debris fall on to the street .
We immediately thought New York was being bombed . ”
Helen J. Hurwitt , who had been working in an office across the street , recounted :
“ My husband and I were in a building directly opposite the Empire State Building . …
Large plate - glass windows looked out onto 34th Street .
The floor we were on was pretty high .
At some point , we heard a horrendous noise and rushed to the windows .
We were horrified to see a B - 25 half in and half out of the Empire State Building . ”
The 4 - alarm fire brought every available piece of fire - fighting apparatus to the scene .
As the building was evacuated , firemen spent about an hour extinguishing the flames .
The two women who had been in the free falling elevator were found alive , owing to the elevator ’s hydraulic emergency braking system which had slowed the car down slightly , and to the cushion of broken , coiled cables which had piled up at the shaft ’s bottom .
Sadly , one of the women was fatally wounded , and died shortly after she was found .
The surviving woman , Betty Lou Oliver , currently holds a world record for surviving the 75 - story free fall .
All told , fourteen men and women were killed in the accident , including Lt. Colonel William Smith and his two crewmen , nine office workers killed from the fire , and the woman who died in the elevator .
Joe Fountain , the man who had been caught in the fire but managed to walk out of it , died of his wounds several days later .
In addition , twenty - six people were injured .
The impact left a hole in the north face of the Empire State Building eighteen feet wide by twenty feet high .
Photographer Ernie Sisto captured this incredible image from the 90th floor , where he had two other newsmen dangle him out the window by his legs so he could get the shot past the ledge .
Later in the day , a news broadcast by Mutual Broadcasting Company included interviews with eyewitnesses , as well as an audio recording of the crash which had been accidentally captured by a nearby recording studio .
Investigation showed that the structural integrity of the Empire State Building was not compromised by this accident , but the cost to repair the damage was on the order of a million dollars .
The unemployment rate unexpectedly dipped to 9.7 percent in January , from 10 percent in December , the government reported Friday , buoying hopes that the worst job market in at least a quarter - century is finally improving .
But a different survey in the Labor Department ’s report found that the economy lost 20,000 net jobs during the month , muddying the picture and underscoring the formidable struggles still confronting millions of Americans .
Yet with the pace of decline slowing , most experts focused on signs that the economy was recovering after the longest recession since the Great Depression .
Manufacturing added 11,000 jobs in January , the first monthly increase since November 2007 , while the length of the average workweek rose slightly at factories .
The economy added 52,000 temporary workers , and average wages increased modestly , amplifying the view that commercial activity is reawakening after two years of hibernation .
“ The economy is continuing to improve , ” said John E. Silvia , chief economist at Wells Fargo in Charlotte , N.C. “ You do n’t have a boom , but you have an economic recovery .
It ’s a positive sign . ”
The 300 men and women divided into groups and deployed like commandos , moving quickly and efficiently into each cell at the Harris County Jail .
But these were n't soldiers or even police officers .
Armed only with Bibles , Gospel tracts and a joyful spirit , the operatives at the jail on Friday were there to spread a message of God and hope to the inmates .
Organized by Mike Barber Ministries , a Christian ministry run by a former Houston Oiler , there 's an elite prison evangelism event brewing at the jail this weekend .
Something like the Olympics of jail evangelism events , it 's called the Weekend of Excitement .
Until the end of today , hundreds of volunteer ministers and lay people will be leading worship services and doing personal counseling to spread the good news to the roughly 11,000 inmates housed at the jail .
“ Whatever is meant for evil , God will change for good , ” said Brandon Barber , Mike Barber 's 28 - year - old son who is helping to organize the weekend .
“ We 've got brothers and we create friendships in here . ”
The jail has a small staff of chaplains and a group of more than 100 religious volunteers from a variety of faiths who help minister to prisoners on a regular basis .
And there are other similar evangelistic weekends the jail plays host to from time to time .
But the Barber event , which his ministry puts on at jails and prisons around the country each year , is among the biggest and grandest in Texas prison evangelism .
Spreading the Gospel in jail is n't for everyone .
It often takes deep biblical knowledge , steely nerves and a strong stomach — a cell is far from a pleasant place .
But most of all , a good minister just needs to be able to listen .
Hands - on help
In the A - Pod on the jail 's fifth floor , that 's what Spring chiropractor Bill DeLoache Jr. , a volunteer in Barber 's ministry for the last seven years , was doing Friday as Donald Odom told his story .
“ It 's not easy , it 's not easy , ” Odom said .
“ I got caught up with the wrong person , got caught up in a mistake . ”
Odom , who is in jail for a felony conviction of delivery of a controlled substance , said he 's survived by reaching out to God .
He 's fashioned a small cross out of cloth and used a piece of string to create a Christian necklace .
He 's filled a plastic bag with religious books and says he tries to tell younger inmates to turn to Jesus for help .
As Odom finished talking , DeLoache grabbed his arm and began to pray for him .
DeLoache later sat on one of the pod 's steel benches and began speaking to 40 - year - old Earl Landry .
The two prayed for salvation and DeLoache handed the prisoner a Gospel tract .
On it he wrote “ February 19 , 2010 . ”
“ That 's freedom right there , ” DeLoache said .
“ Today is the day you 've been set free , today 's the day you 've been saved , brother . ”
Landry said later that he hoped the prayer would be a catalyst to change his life .
“ I 've used drugs and broke the law , ” Landry said later .
“ I hope this can make me do things different . ”
In the jail 's women 's unit , 18 - year - old Cheyeane Perez said she just wanted to be with her one - month - old baby .
Perez , in trouble for violating her parole , has been on the run from the law for years .
Bonnie Klein , a secretary in Barber 's ministry , teased out the teenager 's worries : How Perez was bound for the Texas Youth Commission .
How she was worried she would n't able to see her child .
“ Pray with me and write to me , ” Klein told her .
“ Get your life right with the Lord and your chances of making it are good . ”
An ‘ amazing ' place
The ultimate aim of prison ministry is to reduce recidivism , but it also serves as a point of peace for the volunteers .
It 's that way for Roy Gage , an 81 - year - old who has spread the word in jail for the last three years and was helping to show Barber 's volunteer preachers around .
“ If you have a spirit of evangelism , it wo n't be difficult for you to evangelize here , ” Gage said .
“ There are some amazing things in here and , despite what they 've done , some amazing men too . ”

Some say they died out from general stupidity , others argue that they drowned in their own dung or suffered slipped discs and chronically bad backs .
But the real reason why the dinosaurs became extinct 65 million years ago has now been identified – a collision with a gigantic asteroid that blocked out the sun and caused an extended global winter .
Arguments about the sudden demise of the dinosaurs – the largest - ever land creatures – have raged for decades with no conclusion .
Now , an extensive investigation by 41 leading experts from around the world has found that the asteroid explanation is the only one that stands up to rigorous scientific scrutiny .
The scientists reviewed more than 20 years of evidence from various scientific disciplines and found that the only serious contender to the asteroid theory – a series of massive volcanic eruptions – could still not account for the sudden disappearance of not only the dinosaurs but about half of all species that lived at the same time in prehistory .
Eruptions of ancient supervolcanoes called the Deccan Traps in what is now India would have produced enough lava to fill the Black Sea twice over , but still not enough poisonous gases over a long - enough period of time to kill off the dinosaurs and the other marine and terrestrial species that became extinct with them , the scientists concluded .
" If you combine all the evidence together it 's pretty strongly in favour of a giant asteroid collision , " said Jo Morgan , an earth scientist at Imperial College London , one of the experts who carried out the study published in the journal Science .
" We now have great confidence that an asteroid was the cause of the extinction .
This triggered large - scale fires , earthquakes measuring more than 10 on the Richter scale , and continental landslides , which created tsunamis . "
She added : " The final nail in the coffin of the dinosaurs happened when blasted material was ejected at high velocity into the atmosphere .
This shrouded the planet in darkness and caused a global winter , killing off many species that could n't adapt to this hellish environment , " she said .
Photosynthesis would have stopped in the dusty atmosphere and the dinosaurs would have starved .
The theory that the dinosaurs died out because of an asteroid collision goes back to the early 1980s when Walter and Luis Alvarez , a father - and - son team of geologists , discovered a layer of iridium , a rare mineral , in a sedimentary layer formed 65 million years ago .
The same iridium layer – known as the K - T boundary – was found at more than 100 sites around the world and because asteroids are rich in iridium this suggested a collision that had spread debris around the globe .
Furthermore , fossils older than the iridium layer suggested an abundance of species , yet fossils after the K - T boundary suggested a mass extinction .
A few years later , geologists on the Yucatan Peninsula in Mexico discovered gravitational and magnetic anomalies suggesting a huge , submerged crater on the Mexican coast that had been filled in with sediment .
Subsequent studies suggested this was the giant , 200 km - wide crater resulting from the impact with an asteroid estimated to be 15 km wide .
Scientists also found nodules of glass - like rock in the crater that could only have been formed by the immense temperatures and pressures resulting from the shock of an impact .
It is estimated the asteroid released a force equivalent to one billion Hiroshima bombs and ejected a few thousand cubic kilometres of debris into the atmosphere where it would have formed a thick blanket cutting out sunshine for months .
" The asteroid was about the size of the Isle of Wight and hit Earth 20 times faster than a speeding bullet .
The explosion of hot rock and gas would have looked like a huge ball of fire on the horizon , grilling any living creature in the immediate vicinity that could n't find shelter , " said Gareth Collins , a Natural Environment Research Council fellow at Imperial College .
Some scientists had suggested the asteroid impact in Chicxulub had occurred 300,000 years prior to the mass extinction and so could not have killed off the dinosaurs .
However , the latest study found that this was based on flawed evidence and the timing of the collision was indeed perfect to explain the extinction .
" Combining all available data from different science disciplines led us to conclude that a large asteroid impact 65 million years ago in modern - day Mexico was the major cause of the mass extinction , " said Peter Schulte of the University of Erlangen in Germany , and lead author of the study .
Once the dinosaurs had been wiped out , it left room for small , shrew - like creatures to replace them .
Mammals – particularly a primate with a large brain – have since dominated the terrestrial biosphere .
The great extinction : Rival theories
There are perhaps as many theories about the extinction of the dinosaurs as there are scientists working on the problem .
Many experts believe that these massive land creatures , which dominated the terrestrial ecosystem for 160 million years , were in decline for several million years before the asteroid collision 65 million years ago .
God bless South West Trains .
Not a phrase you 'll often hear in London 's leafier southern suburbs – but without one of their seasonal delays in service last week , I would n't have stumbled into the waiting room at Wimbledon Station and discovered , joy of joys , the Station Bookswap .
It was the poster pinned to the door that pulled me in .
" Never be bored on a train journey again ! "
And there , propped up on the window sills , a smattering of books , their covers tantalisingly open to view .
The selection ranged from a mint copy of Nick Hornby 's A Long Way Down , through some battered Jodi Picoult and James Patterson hardbacks to a decent Penguin Classic edition of Dostoevsky 's The Brothers Karamazov , all bearing the fingerprints of Wimbledon readers .
And it 's true what they say .
Books really do furnish a ( waiting ) room .
The formerly dank and draughty surroundings of Platform Five seemed instantly less prosaic .
Most colourful of all were the children 's picture books , not just Spot at Christmas but bilingual texts in Hindi , Tamil and Chinese .
Some reading around reveals the man behind the scheme : twenty - nine - year - old Anthony Fairclough , legal researcher and chair of Merton Liberal Democrats , who does the Wimbledon to Waterloo commute every morning at 7 am .
Finding the cut - and - paste PR of the Metro newspaper barely lasted him two stops to Clapham Junction , Fairclough set up the book - swap last November .
The rules are simple .
Take away a book , any book , to read at your leisure and return it once you 're done for another .
The idea actually originated further down the line at Raynes Park , where a swap has been running since the local library refurbished and wanted to offload some stock in 2005 .
To date , commuters have picked up 22,000 titles and rumour has it they 're swapping at Morden Tube now , too , making Merton London 's most borrower - friendly borough .
Anything goes , says Fairclough , from cookery books to out - of - date legal textbooks .
His last find was an old 80s anthology entitled Sixty Tales of the Supernatural – like a book club , the swap gets you reading things you might not pick out in a shop .
It certainly brings new meaning to the term " travelling library " , a bit like those dog-eared copies of Alex Garland 's The Beach that do the rounds of the South East Asian backpacking circuit .
Except these books are on a return ticket .
At least , that 's the idea .
As yet , they rarely make it back to base .
The book - swap is getting through 100 volumes a week , and while local libraries and Wimbledon 's Freecycle network help Fairclough keep up with supply , he is exploring other ways to encourage returns , from printing up stickers to tapping into BookCrossing , which allows you to register titles and track them from person to person across the world .
Buoyed by his community spirit , I drop off a bag o' books on my way into London , including one of the four One Hundred Years of Solitudes our house has somehow accumulated .
Hanging around for as long as I can without risking arrest under the Prevention of Terrorism Act , I keep watch on the waiting room .
No one goes in or out .
And yet , returning the same evening , Gabriel García Márquez has gone .
It 's a thrill , imagining his onward journey .
( As blogger Cover Girl has discovered , reading on public transport can be quite the ticket to romance . )
Is it too much to hope that one day there could be a swap in every waiting room of every station of every town in the country ?

JAILED : Drunk driver Alison Downer in the dock of a Palmerston North courtroom where she was given a jail sentence for the death of cyclist Frank van Kampen .
Supporters of Alison Downer , jailed yesterday for more than two years for the drink - drive death of a cyclist , say the 71 - year - old will struggle to cope in prison .
Downer , an alcoholic from Te Horo , was yesterday banned from driving for eight years for what was her fourth drink - driving conviction since 1991 .
She had twice blown almost three times the legal breath - alcohol limit .
Frank van Kampen , 46 , a teacher who had just become a father , died when he was struck from behind by Downer as he cycled on State Highway 1 in Te Horo on September 18 .
The van Kampen family said Downer 's previous convictions proved a lack of remorse .
However , her friends said she was " distraught " and " hurting " .
She was battling alcohol addiction and was getting her life back on track before it all went wrong , one neighbour said .
" I know she did not choose to go out there and cause this accident . "
Although she was strong , jail would test her .
Mr van Kampen 's partner , Jude Pouwels , wept through yesterday 's hearing at Palmerston North District Court and said last night that she was disgusted by the sentence .
" They say that with age , comes wisdom , but with this defendant , only comes more alcohol .
She thinks she is above the law but is actually a danger to the public . "
Although Judge Les Atkins ordered Downer to pay $ 30,000 reparation to Mr van Kampen 's family , Ms Pouwels said she did not want the money and it would go into a trust for her children .
She believed the Downer family should pay for her children 's upbringing .
Mr van Kampen 's stepson , Dante , is 13 , and the couple had a daughter , Alexandra , now six months old .
Ms Pouwel 's former partner , Dante 's father , died five years ago from cancer .
" It is appalling .
Two and half years is not justice for Frank 's life .
It is not sending a clear message to drink - drivers , it is not a deterrent to anybody .
" I have lost everything .
I feel the Downer family should do the right thing by my children . "
Judge Atkins said Downer had left her Te Horo home at 4.30 pm after consuming " a quantity of wine " throughout the day .
Downer 's problems with alcohol , coupled with an unhappy marriage after the death of her two - year - old daughter had isolated her from her family , Judge Atkins said .
" You have been the victim of violence in the past ... you were diagnosed with depression 30 years ago , you have been a binge - drinker since you were 48 . "
Downer has been treated for alcoholism at several institutions around the country , including Ashburn Hall and Hanmer Springs .
Crown prosecutor Paul Murray said Downer was nearly twice the legal breath - alcohol limit .
Downer 's lawyer , Sandy Baigent , said her client had offered $ 30,000 emotional harm reparation and there was a lack of multiple victims meaning a more lenient jail sentence was appropriate .
She did not know if Downer would seek rehabilitation for her alcohol abuse while behind bars .
Mr van Kampen 's close friend and cycling buddy Ron Chatters believed Downer should have faced a manslaughter charge .
" How can you go out and kill someone and it not be manslaughter ?
As the law stands she can reapply for her licence , it is bloody ridiculous . "
Using one another as pillows , like a family huddled together for warmth in a house without heat , most of the Marines were catching a little sleep before their mission was to begin .
But one sat wide awake at the edge of their huddle .
Tyler Hicks caught this quiet moment .
Another Marine gazed at a snapshot of himself and his wife .
The picture ’s tattered edge conveyed how well traveled it was .
And how often it was so lovingly examined .
Mr. Hicks was there .
Along with members of Company K , Third Battalion , Sixth Marines , Mr. Hicks , a staff photographer for The Times , was preparing to go into battle .
I have to carry cameras , lenses , a laptop , satellite transmitter , chargers , batteries and cables .
I bring duplicates of some chargers in case one shorts out because if I can’t charge , then I can’t file my pictures .
A sleeping bag , enough clothes to stay relatively warm , three days of food and water .
I also wear body armor , a helmet , protective goggles and some first aid gear — pressure bandages and tourniquets , mostly .
Things begin to get heavy .
The Marja offensive , aimed at retaking a Taliban stronghold , involved the third major air assault Mr. Hicks has covered as an embedded photojournalist since he began working in Afghanistan nearly 10 years ago .
Troops had been massing in Helmand Province for days and there had been numerous news reports detailing the impending assault .
The Taliban had time to prepare .
“ In some ways this weighed on our minds as bad weather delayed our helicopters , ” Mr. Hicks said , “ but thinking about what lays ahead can be more stressful than the event itself , so I did n’t concentrate on it . ”

I reminded myself that I only have to take pictures and , unlike the Marines around me , I have the freedom to get low and maneuver however I want , if needed .
There had been particular anxiety among Marines about I.E.D. ’s that would be easy to plant prior to our arrival but those did not become a major threat until later — at least not for a company landing by helicopter .
The I.E.D. ’s were mostly on the roads and the region ’s outer belt .
It turned out that they were not in the fields , which is where we landed .
I worried more about snipers .
We had a briefing before we joined the company that flew in .
The officer told us that a few Special Forces units had operated briefly near where we were going , but they never managed to get up the place .
They always ended up getting fired at by the Taliban , including single - shot sniper fire — a pretty rare occurence in my Afghanistan experience .
So I thought a little about that , since we would be there a while .
Sniper fire is nastier than random Kalashnikov fire .
Early on Feb. 13 , Mr. Hicks and C. J. Chivers , a Times reporter , landed along with Kilo Company in absolute darkness .
“ The helicopters quickly departed , showering us with dirt and heat from the engines , and it was quiet again , ” Mr. Hicks said .
“ We had arrived in Marja . ”
Chris used his satellite phone in the landing zone to call the paper and tell them where we were .
He gave them the latitude - longitude coordinates for the landing zone .
And then the Marines got up and started to move toward some buildings .
We followed them inside and I took pictures as they swept it .
They had flashlights on their rifles and they turned them on as they entered rooms ; this was the only illumination beside starlight .
Once the first sweep was over , it was black again .
I turned on my laptop and satellite antenna and sent a few frames to New York , so the paper would have some opening images of the offensive .
An Afghan man was surrounded , arms outstretched , lit by flashlight and framed by shadows of Marines pointing their weapons .
The image made it to Page 1 of The New York Times later that day , next to a two - column headline : “ Allies Attacking Big Taliban Haven in Afghan South . ” Operation Moshtarak ( Together ) had begun .

At first light , I was able to start taking pictures .
The Marines were on the move , crossing fields of young poppy and bounding over irrigation canals .
I would try to get into position to take some pictures and then catch back up to where I had been in the line .
But carrying the gear , with the added weight of a Kevlar vest and helmet , made working difficult .
Hours later we reached our pause , a bleak outcrop of mud-walled homes and compounds surrounded by flat deserted land .
It seemed empty , until the shooting began .
Sometimes the most serene - looking war photographs speak volumes of the danger afoot : body language or the subtlest of expressions will betray it .
Then , Marines scurry across a field , in a hail of bullets , and the picture making continues .
A Marine ’s brief glance towards the camera shows the fear in his eyes .
Scenes of warriors seeking cover in a barren landscape feel timeless , reminiscent of other wars .
Or perhaps every war .
Despite the amount of action going on during a fight , I find combat the most difficult to translate photographically .
You can be in the most compromising situation , surrounded by gunfire , but the pictures may only translate to someone firing a weapon .
If possible , I try to get movement in my pictures .
The less static , the more experience is captured .
Facial expressions and emotion are just as important as the tactical part of a fight .
I try to capture the experience of battle , while at the same time protecting myself .
There are times you have to break away from the action , focus and gather yourself .
Chris and I check on each other constantly .
Working with someone you can rely on is one of the most important aspects of embedding in a place like Afghanistan .
You can be protected militarily , but having a buddy system with someone you trust is invaluable in the field .
Chris and I have been working together for years embedded in Afghanistan and have relied on each other under the most extreme circumstances .
We look after each other always , and keep each other up .
He knows I have his back .
I know he has mine .
Not having to wonder about who you ’re with frees you up to work .
Tyler Hicks / The New York Times
The Marines used an airstrike to hit a compound .
The order came to go search the building ’s rubble , and so Chris and I ran over and joined the squad that was going out there .
It meant crossing back across the canal and the open fields , and then going by some high reeds .
There were about 15 of us .
The Taliban ambushed the patrol .
It was brief , but a lot of fire .
I was walking along a dirt road , just before dark , when bursts of automatic fire erupted from a patch of tall grass ahead of us .
Chris was out in the field , in the open .
The Marines returned fire and pushed the Taliban away .
Chris could n’t see me and was calling my name to make sure I was not shot .
And I could n’t hear him because my attention was on the bullets going by and I had tuned out everything else .
The Marine squad leader , a corporal , told Chris he could see me and everyone was O.K. , so far .
Then he ordered the squad to get up and run right toward the Taliban , as soon as there was a lull in Taliban firing .
We ran with them .
For the next three days after that , we were under pretty much constant fire .
Nights were quiet , though .
The Taliban backed away at night .
In a dim blue light , Marines stood near a pocked wall , stunned after the loss of one of their men .
Their expressions ranged from sadness to shock to mystification .
As their squads filtered into our compound just before dark , I could see the emotion of the loss on the Marines ’ faces .
These situations are delicate , and you have to approach them with respect for what they ’re going through .
I was able to shoot just a few frames before it was dark , but in this case was able to tell part of their story through that scene .
Tyler Hicks / The New York Times
During an intense firefight on Feb. 14 , Mr. Hicks ’s view of the war in Afghanistan grew terrifyingly close up .
A Marine was hit by gunfire as he crouched behind a wall .
Bullets were piercing the air as Mr. Hicks photographed the wounded Marine being treated by the medic .
Minutes later , a rocket barrage hit a house nearby , killing 12 civilians .
It was far too dangerous to move .
Mr. Hicks was stuck .
These would have been important pictures , but I could n’t move alone across an open battlefield to reach them in time .
It was several hundred yards of open ground .
A sniper had just shot a Marine near Chris , and I had taken pictures of the corpsman treating the injury .
I knew how dangerous it was , and it would have put Marines at risk to ask them to accompany me out there .
We never do that .
Our ethical position is that we will take every step we can alongside the people we cover in combat , but never ask them to take a step for us , or to take us somewhere they would not go on their own .
If they were to get hurt doing something we asked them to do , it would weigh on us personally forever .
Chris and I follow this code .
We believe in it and do not deviate from it .
But even though I was on ethically firm ground , this was a personally frustrating moment for me , a thought that continues to harass me , because that would have been important to document .
I remind myself of the reality of conflict that I ’ve learned over the years .
Time and distance become something completely different in battle , when a moment can make all the difference , and a few feet can feel like a mile , and where we have a responsibility not to get anyone else hurt , and to allow the events to flow naturally around us .
Tyler Hicks / The New York Times
In addition to the danger of making pictures in a war zone , something as mundane as lack of electricity can be agonizing and debilitating .
In the age of minute - by - minute news , speed of transmission becomes nearly as important as the pictures themselves .
To prepare for this , Mr. Hicks and Mr. Chivers brought a car battery .
“ It was like running with 100 pounds on your back and a big dumbbell in one hand and a camera in the other , ” Mr. Hicks said .
“ I carried the battery on the first night .
Once the sun came up , Chris took it so I could shoot pictures and have both hands free . ”
However , the car battery failed .
Then , after two days , the computer battery died .
“ For the first time in 10 years , ” Mr. Hicks said , “ I was sitting on pictures that I was unable to send . ”
Military vehicles eventually arrived and the pictures began flowing again to New York .
On his last day with Company K , Mr. Hicks focused on the Marines ’ exhaustion .
Under the threshhold of an ancient doorway , in a shallow indentation in the ground , a young man reclined in a cocoonlike blanket .
Once again — however briefly , however furtively — it was time for sleep .
And Mr. Hicks was there .
PANAJI : A traffic constable has been suspended by the Goa police after he was caught on hidden camera for allegedly accepting bribe of Rs 300 .
" Constable Sagar Salgaoncar was suspended yesterday after a local TV channel aired the footage which showed him accepting money without issuing challan , " Superintendent of Police Arvind Gauns said .
Salgaoncar was suspended after a two - wheeler rider was caught talking on cellphone while riding on Mandovi bridge here , police said .
The channel claimed that the fine for the offence is Rs 600 but the constable demanded Rs 300 from the rider , police added .

The airborne laser test - bed ( ALTB ) uses more than one laser to bring down a missile .
When infrared sensors on the plane detect a missile 's exhaust plume , the first laser is used to track its trajectory .
A second laser is then used to measure atmospheric effects between the plane and the missile .
These are fed into a computer that adjusts the optics of the main laser .
The giant 18 tonne infra­red laser then fires a single shot from the nose ­turret on the plane , lasting three to five seconds , which is targeted at the ­pressurised part of the missile .
The intense concentration of heat on the missile 's skin weakens it enough for aerodynamic stresses to tear the missile apart .
The whole process takes less than 12 seconds .
The main laser , a powerful $ 4bn ( £ 2.55 bn ) chemical oxygen iodine laser , can fire 20 shots before the plane needs to land and fill up on fuel for the weapon .
If it is used at lower power , it could muster 40 shots in one flight .
Although the airborne laser was designed to destroy short - range tactical missiles , defence analysts believe it may be effective against intercontinental ballistic missiles , hostile aircraft and even satellites .
The lasers and missile detection sensors are built into a modified ­Boeing 747 freighter plane that cruises at an altitude of 40,000 feet and has a kill range of around 190 miles .
The plane would be deployed over war zones or missile silos and fly in a figure of eight overhead to act as a deterrent .
The airborne laser is a big part of the US missile defence agency 's reincarnation of the strategic defence initiative , a constellation of laser - toting satellites proposed by the Reagan administration in the 1980s .
That project hit insurmountable technical difficulties with putting powerful lasers in orbit and being able to track missiles quickly and accurately .
A SUMO wrestler ripped a cash machine out of a Moscow store , walking off with the bulky 90kg machine on his shoulders , police say .
The man and an accomplice walked into a Moscow shopping mall on Friday and detached a cash machine containing 25,000 roubles ( $ 926 ) , Moscow city police said in a statement .
A shop assistant who witnessed the crime called police and the two men were arrested as they tried to escape in a getaway car .
The strongman later told police he was a professional sumo wrestler .

As each time zone across the globe reaches the appointed hour , skylines are going dark and landmarks are dimming for Earth Hour , a global switch - off aimed at revitalising efforts against climate change .
At 8:30 pm AEDT yesterday , Sydney 's iconic Opera House and Harbour Bridge plunged into darkness , along with millions of homes .
Landmarks across Australia went dark , including Parliament House in Canberra and Melbourne 's Luna Park and Federation Square .
Sydney Harbour ferry horns blared to signal the energy saving event , which is supported by 4,000 cities in a record 125 countries and includes 1,200 famous landmarks from the Forbidden City to the pyramids to the Las Vegas Strip .
And other iconic landmarks across the world are also dimming , from a Manila shopping centre to the Eiffel Tower in Paris .
Russian officials say they hope to beat last year 's participation figure of six million people in 20 cities .
" From Brazil to America , to Canada , all the way down to Australia , Japan and India - it 's a really diverse set of countries taking part this year , " Earth Hour executive director Andy Ridley said .
Sydney 's office buildings plunged into gloom at 8:30 pm ( AEDT ) yesterday , setting off a rolling wave of darkness which swept the globe in a boost for the environmental movement after December 's disappointing Copenhagen UN talks .
Greg Bourne from the environment group WWF says it is a symbolic event that boosts the awareness of how energy can be saved and greenhouse gases reduced .
" It might be a small symbol but by the time you get more than a billion people take part , it 's a pretty big one , " he said .
" But in the end we would obviously like Earth Hour to be every hour .
We 'd like people to be conscious of their impact on the planet .
" This is n't about reducing lifestyles , this is about changing the way we deliver those lifestyles . "
The event had officially begun nearly three hours earlier when New Zealand 's Chatham Islands switched off their diesel generators , leaving just 12 street lamps burning .
It will eventually end in Samoa after nearly 24 hours .
Participation down
Electricity usage reports are indicating that fewer people and businesses took part in last night 's Earth Hour in the Sydney CBD than in previous years .
Energy Australia recorded a 6.3 per cent reduction in energy use in the city during the event , equivalent to 15.9 tonnes of carbon emissions .
Paul Myors from Energy Australia says that is one of the smallest reductions in the event 's history .
" This is the fourth Earth Hour event for Sydney and we 've seen reductions vary between about 6 and 10 per cent over those four years , " he said .
" So there 's been no particular trend over that time , but this year 's reduction was n't as strong as last year's .
" We really just measure the impact on the electricity grid .
But nonetheless I think it 's a very good result , and I think the message of using energy efficiently to not only reduce greenhouse but our energy bills is still an important one . "
In Europe , London 's Big Ben and Manchester United 's Old Trafford football ground were set to take part .
In America , some 30 states were on board , with Mount Rushmore , San Francisco 's Golden Gate Bridge and Chicago 's 110 - storey Sears Tower all due to go dark .
But in Bangkok , city authorities were ordered to halt their Earth Hour campaign for security reasons as anti-government protesters held a major rally .
This year , users of Twitter and Facebook can show their support with special applications that turn their displays dark .
In December , two weeks of UN talks in Copenhagen failed to produce a binding commitment to limit global warming or set out concrete plans for doing so , in a setback for the environmental movement .

Ladies , it ’s time to stop limiting yourselves sexually – no matter what time of the month it is .
I think it ’s just plain unfair that during a woman ’s period , it ’s expected that she either transform into her partner ’s oral sex slave or behave as if she belongs to a convent .
Sexual intercourse during menstruation can be even more fun and rewarding than sex during other times of the month .
According to health information Web site WebMd , orgasms and exercise ( both of which are achieved through intercourse ) can help relieve menstrual cramps .
Also , while those fluctuating hormone levels that come along with having your period can turn you into a raging you - know - what , they can also increase your libido , making your sexual experience that much more enjoyable .
Even though I ’m in a long - term relationship and do find my desire for sex to be greater during my period , I ’m rarely able to get my boyfriend to cooperate with me .
The conversation always goes something like this :
Boyfriend : “ Babe , if I had blood coming out of my business down there , you would n’t want anything to do with it . ”
Me : “ That ’s because if you had blood coming out of you down there I ’d be busy driving you to the hospital . ”
As much as I ’d like to , I ca n’t place all of the blame on my beau for maintaining such an attitude .
For thousands of years , cultures across the globe have viewed menstruation as evil , dirty and even a sickness .
Throughout history , certain Islamic , Christian and Jewish beliefs suggested women should be segregated from men during their periods , that they should refrain from handling food and performing certain chores , and that children conceived by women on their periods would be physically and mentally diseased .
Even present - day American society attaches an irrational stigma to menstruation .
Feminine hygiene products advertised as having “ quiet ” wrappers ( heaven forbid another woman in the ladies room hears you unwrapping a pad or tampon ) and super - discrete packaging sends women the message that their period is something they should be ashamed of .
If you ’ve never tried “ period sex ” before and would like to , talk to your partner to find out if he or she is on the same page .
If you ’re both ready but still afraid of a mess , here are some tips to ensure your love den does n’t end up resembling a scene from “ The Shining : ”
- Try to stick to one sex position ( missionary is probably best ) .
The more you ’re moving around , the more potential there is for blood to get everywhere , which could very well put a damper on the mood .
- Protect your sheets .
Put a dark - colored , inexpensive towel down on the bed first .
- Have sex in the shower .
With the water running , chances are you ’ll hardly notice the blood .
Not to mention you ’ll both be hot , wet and slippery .
Need I say more ?
While sex during menstruation is perfectly healthy , it is still entirely possible for a woman to get pregnant while she is on her period .
There is also evidence to suggest it is the most likely time for a woman to contract an STI due to changes in acidity levels in her vagina .

Hit[our ] youth : Dr. Janice Shaw Crouse should , wo n't apologize !
by Jeremy Hooper
So I 've been thinking more and more about the Dr. Janice Shaw Crouse 's comment suggesting that progressives are trying to create a new kind of " Hitler Youth " ...
... and honestly , I just can't shake the f**ed - upiness of it all .
Nor should any of us shake it , as Crouse 's code word - laden rant is the exact kind of eye - opening coffin-nail that we who are being shunned behind the far - right 's " moral absolutes " should unapologetically drive into this overheated movement 's sarcophagus of incivility !
The " anti-family " kids who Crouse ( a Concerned Women For America top dog ) puts in the " Hitler Youth " camp are exactly like the ones in this writer 's life .
The kind of children who are brought up , from birth , to accept all people .
Children who refuse to believe that intolerance is a " moral value . "
Those who are open and embracing of all faiths , without the desire to convert anyone to their way of thinking .
Tykes who place value in diversity .
The kind of kids who are encouraged to follow their natural intellectual curiosity , rather than one - sided talking points .
Little ones who understand that families come in all different shapes and sizes , and that it 's not " relativism " to place value in the shared love rather than the number of penises or vaginas in house .
These are the exact children that Ms. Crouse considers brainwashed , even though it is her side that is unabashedly trying to indoctrinate them into believing that discrimination is a conservative principle with cherishing .
How dare she attack these children and / or their parents ?!
And then there 's the Jewish factor .
The kids who are most fully in my life are of that particular faith , the one that is obviously most directly bothered by Godwin 's Law .
Not only is Ms. Crouse 's negligent label offensive in terms of its implications of indoctrination , it 's also insanely offensive to those children who are only two or three generations removed from one of this world 's most unfathomable genocides !
Ms Crouse is telling the world that I , as an LGBT activist and embracer of the kids of progressive values that she has decides are " immoral , " am in some ways related to those who led impressionable youth into hate for their ancestors .
She 's telling the kids in my life that my work ( and that of many prominent , respected figures ) is leading both them and me down a cruel path of self - destruction -- a path that 's fit to be compared to the stepping stones that paved the Holocaust ( The " Hitler Youth " movement was considered a stepping stone to the SS ) .
And considering that she herself is motivated by aggressive evangelical Christianity which she 's been wearing on her sleeve for years ?
Well , the dangerous implications there should not be lost on anyone who 's paying attention !
Your thoughts
I 'm Jewish .
She can go fuck herself .
I can't keep track of who we are these days .
Hitler ?
Stalin ? Mao ? Pol Pot ?
I 'm surprised they have n't called us Pope Sixtus IV yet .
They 're running out of villains .

It 's apalling how much the words associated with Nazi crimes are tossed out to instill fear in today 's society .
Nothing compares to this - and God willing , nothing will ever again .

Was n't Hitler a Christianite ?
He certainly spoke fondly of them in Mein Kampf .
And , if he had merely been ragingly anti-religion , one would think that the christians would have been gassed along side the Jews and the gays .
But , as it turns out , his vile hatred was aimed in exactly the same direction that modern day Catholics aim theirs - at the Jews and the gays .
Just look at the king of the catholic fiefdom , Mel Gibson .
And , all the while , claiming that they are the victims .
And more egregiously , attempting to paint us , the collective " us " who simply want peaceful coexistence , the " us " who are the true victims of their rabid anti-gay sentiment , painting us as the aggressors .

I 'm just tired .
I read this blog every day .
I listen to this shit every day .
I 'm just tired .
At what point is it morally permissible to just go up to someone like that and slap her .
I have read the great moral philosophers .
I have a law degree .
I have worked in the United States and around the world .
I have made politicked my may though the most difficult of international confusion on an admittedly micro scale .
I have published on international human rights and corporate America , and made friends with people of every religion imaginable .
And I 'm a bit drunk .
And all I want to do is just walk up and slap her across the face .
Part of me wants to engage in a rational debate , but she does n't use rational terms .
I just want to slap her .
Does that make me bad ?
It 's sick , it 's wrong , it 's base , but I just want to slap her .
Not hard enough to break a tooth .
Just slap her .
Guilty as charged .

She talks about a lack of having absolute morals will lead to a " Hitler youth " but as we know , Hitler had absolute morals .
Hitler youth promoted - strict gender roles : boys become soldiers and women become mothers ; mindless patriotism toward their country ; and finally hatred towards gays and Jews , ( and black people and anyone not ' perfect ' ) ...
Maybe people in glass houses should n't through stones .
Just saying .

BELLEVILLE , Ont. - Friends and family of a 27 - year - old Belleville woman who has been missing since Thursday are appealing to the public for help in what they call a " suspicious " disappearance .
Police say Jessica Elizabeth Lloyd was last heard from at 10:30 p.m. on Thursday night after sending a text message , and never showed up for work the next day .
Terra Dafoe , a friend of the missing woman , says it 's out of character for the young woman to ignore calls from family and friends .
Almost 2 , 000 members have joined a Facebook group dedicated to finding Lloyd .
" I can sit across the room from a barista and tell exactly what texture will appear just by the sound of the aerating milk . "
After last week 's post , " What Is Your Idea of the Perfect Cappuccino ? , " I was happy to see a bulk of readers interested in learning more on creating beautiful milk texture .
Creating this steamed milk known as microfoam — a liquid foam with invisible air bubbles called grain — starts with one important and powerful ingredient : pressure .
A commercial espresso machine , such as the multiple boiler La Marzocco GB5 , which I find myself working on in the wee hours of the morning , allows me the ability to activate the necessary amount of pressure to achieve my texture goals .
Most home espresso machines ( under about $ 8,000 ) are n't equipped with this feature , which makes it extremely difficult ( to nearly impossible ) to produce the optimal texture .
This is one of the many reasons small artisan cafes are so popular :
We leave it to the professionals .
When it comes to milk aeration you must rely on your senses .
Sight , sound , and touch are all key players when steaming milk .
I can sit across the room from a barista and tell exactly what texture will appear just by the sound of the aerating milk .
A low , calm , rumbling noise is best for texturizing .
I imagine it to sound like being underwater in a whirlpool hot tub .
So let 's begin !
Here are a few steps to steaming milk , accompanied by a short video of the process , after the jump .
Step One : Start with Cold Milk
Make sure you have cold milk and an even colder pitcher .
This low starting temperature allows a longer steaming window , which provides optimal texture .
When pouring this cold milk into the pitcher it should come right to the bottom of the pour spout ; too much milk gives you no room to move , and too little milk leaves you with no window at all .
Remember , even if you only need two ounces of microfoam , you 'll need at least four ounces of milk to get it .
Step Two : Watch , Listen , and Feel
Submerge the wand and active steam pressure .
Then instantly and with control , gently pull down on the pitcher , watch the wand appear slightly , listen for a slight crackle noise ( this is aeration ) , and feel the temperature increase with the palm of your hand .
Step Three : The Rolling Effect
Tilt the pitcher and look for a swirling motion known at the rolling effect .
This appears almost like water being pulled forcefully down a drain .
The lowest point of this swirling motion is called the vortex .
You should hear the low rumbling noise described earlier — this is what makes texture .
After you feel the pitcher reach 150 to 160 degrees , or when you can't hold your palm to the pitcher for more than a fraction of a second , turn off the steam pressure .
If you heat the milk much beyond this point you run the risk of ruining your beautiful texture or burning the contents .
As you swirl your final product in your pitcher , it should appear smooth with a glossy shine — a chiffon of microfoam to fold beautifully into the espresso , utilizing the crema as the background for your latte art .

I ’ve been pondering this subject for a while , and I think I ’m finally ready to write about it .
Tcl was , for many years , my go - to language of choice .
It ’s still near and dear to me in many ways , and I even worked on a portion of a book about it ( https://journal.dedasys.com/2009/09/15/tcl-and-the-tk-toolkit-2nd-edition ) .
However , examining what “ went wrong ” is quite interesting , if one attempts , as much as possible , a dispassionate , analytical approach that aims to gain knowledge , rather than assign blame or paper over real defects with a rose - colored vision of things .
It has made me consider , and learn , about a variety of aspects of the software industry , such as economics and marketing , that I had not previously been interested in .
Indeed , my thesis is that Tcl and Tk ’s problems primarily stem from economic and marketing ( human ) factors , rather than any serious defects with the technology itself .
Before we go further , I want to say that Tcl is not “ dying ” .
It is still a very widely used language , with a lot of code in production , and , importantly , a healthy , diverse , and highly talented core team that is dedicated to maintaining and improving the code .
That said , since its “ heyday ” in the late 90ies , it has not … “ thrived ” , I guess we can say .
I would also like to state that “ hindsight is 20 - 20 ” – it ’s easy to criticize after the fact , and not nearly so easy to do the right thing in the right moment .
This was one reason why I was reticent to write this article .
Let me repeat that I am writing it not out of malice or frustration ( I went through a “ frustrated ” phase , but that ’s in the past ) , but because at this point I think it ’s a genuinely interesting “ case history ” of a the rise and gentle decline of a widely used software system , and that there is a lot to be learned .
At the height of its popularity , Tcl was up there with Perl , which was the scripting language in those days .
Perl , Tcl , and Python were often mentioned together .
Ruby existed , but was virtually unknown outside of Japan .
PHP was on the rise , but still had n’t really come into its own .
Lua had n’t really carved out a niche for itself yet , either .
Tcl is no longer one of the popular languages , these days , so to say it has n’t had problems is to bury one ’s head in the sand : it has fallen in terms of popularity .
To examine what went wrong , we should probably start off with what went right :
Tk .
This was probably the biggest draw .
Easy , cross platform GUI ’s were , and are , a huge reason for the interest in Tcl .
Tk is actually a separate bit of code , but since many of the widgets are scripted in Tcl , the two are joined at the hip .
Still , though , Tk is compelling enough that it ’s utilized as the default GUI library for half a dozen other languages .
A simple , powerful language .
Tcl is easy to understand and get started with .
It borrows from many languages , but is not an esoteric creation from the CS department that is inaccessible to average programmers .
Easily embeddable / extendable .
Remember that Tcl was created in the late 80ies , when computers were orders of magnitude less powerful than today .
This meant that fewer tasks could be accomplished via scripting languages , but a scripting language that let you write routines in C , or , conversely , let the main C program execute bits of script code from time to time was a very sensible idea .
Tcl still has one of the best , and most extensive C API ’s in the game .
An event loop .
Lately , systems like Python ’s “ twisted ” , and node.js have made event - driven programming popular again , but Tcl has had it for years .
BSD license .
This meant that you could integrate
Tcl in your proprietary code without worrying about the GPL or any other legal issues .
These features led to Tcl being widely used , from Cisco routers to advanced television graphics generation programs to the AOLserver web server , which was busy serving out large quantities of dynamic web pages when many of us were still fiddling around with comparatively slow and clunky CGI programs in Perl .
Note also that there have been a lot of cool things to have gone into Tcl in the mean time .
It has a lot of impressive features ; many more than most people realize , and has had a lot of them for a while .
Check out http://www.tcl.tk to learn more about the “ good stuff ” .
But that ’s not the point of this article …
There was a healthy , active community of developers producing lots of interesting add - ons for the language , and working on the language itself .
This culminated in its adoption by Sun Microsystems , which hired the language ’s creator , Dr. John Ousterhout , and a team of people , who added a lot of great features to the language .
Quoting from Ousterhout ’s history of Tcl page :
The additional resources provided by Sun allowed us to make major improvements to Tcl and Tk. Scott Stanton and Ray Johnson ported Tcl and Tk to Windows and the Macintosh , so that Tcl became an outstanding cross-platform development environment ;
Windows quickly came to be the most common platform .
Jacob Levy and Scott Stanton overhauled the I/O system and added socket support , so that Tcl could easily be used for a variety of network applications .
Brian Lewis built a bytecode compiler for Tcl scripts , which provided speedups of as much as a factor of 10x .
Jacob Levy implemented Safe - Tcl , a powerful security model that allows untrusted scripts to be evaluated safely .
Jacob Levy and Laurent Demailly built a Tcl plugin , so that Tcl scripts can be evaluated in a Web browser , and we created Jacl and TclBlend , which allow Tcl and Java to work closely together .
We added many other smaller improvements , such as dynamic loading , namespaces , time and date support , binary I/O , additional file manipulation commands , and an improved font mechanism .
Unfortunately , after several years ,
Sun decided that they wanted to promote one and only one language .
And that language was Java .
So Ousterhout and many people from his team decamped to a startup that Ousterhout founded , called Scriptics , where the Tcl and Tk innovations continued :
In 1998 , Scriptics made several patch releases for Tcl 8.0 to fix bugs and add small new features , such as a better support for the [ incr Tcl ] extension .
In April 1999 , Scriptics made its first major open source release , Tcl / Tk 8.1 .
This release added Unicode support ( for internationalization ) , thread safety ( for multi - threaded server applications ) , and an all - new regular expression package by Henry Spencer that included many new features as well as Unicode support .
However , as many a company based around open source was to find later , it ’s a tough space to be in .
Scriptics changed its name to Ajuba , and was eventually sold ( at a healthy profit , apparently , making it a relative dot com success story , all in all ) to Interwoven , for the “ B2B ” technology that Ajuba had developed .
Interwoven was not interested in Tcl , particularly , so , to create a system for the ongoing development and governance of the language , the “ Tcl Core Team ” was created .
This was something of a blow to Tcl , but certainly not fatal : Perl , Python , Ruby , PHP , Lua have all had some paid corporate support , but it has by no means been constant , or included large teams .
At the same time in the late 90ies , open source was really starting to take off in general .
Programmers were making all kinds of progress , and had begun to make Linux into what is today the world ’s most widely used server platform , and laying the groundwork for the KDE and Gnome desktops .
While these may still not be widely used , they are for the most part very polished systems , and leaps and bounds better than what passed for the ‘ Unix desktop ’ experience in the 90ies .
One of the key bits of work that was added to Tk was to make it look pretty good on Microsoft Windows systems .
This was in an time when the “ enterprisey ” folks were turning away from Unix in the form of AIX , Solaris , HPUX , et al . and taking up NT as the platform of choice , so it was in some ways sensible to make
Tk work well there , and in any case as a cross platform GUI toolkit , it ought to work well there in any case .
And , on the Unix side , Tk emulated the expensive , professional Motif look and feel that serious Unix programmers used .
What could go wrong ?
As Gnome and KDE continued to mature , though , what would become one of Tk ’s major ( in my opinion ) marketing blunders took root .
I have it on good authority , from someone who was there in the office , that the Scriptics guys working on Tcl and Tk viewed Gnome and KDE ( and the Gtk and Qt toolkits ) as not really worth their while .
To be fair , since Tk has always been under a liberal BSD style license , the Qt toolkit has always been “ off limits ” .
Still , though , the attitude was that Tk was a standalone system , and since it ran on pretty much any Unix system , it did n’t need to bother with Gnome or KDE .
Gradually , though , as more and more people used Gnome and KDE exclusively on Linux , the Tk look and feel began to look more and more antiquated , a relic from the 1990ies when Motif ( which has since pretty much disappeared ) was king .
Tk applications started to really stand out by not looking at all like the rest of the operating system .
And , while Linux may not be responsible for a vast portion of the world ’s desktops , it is widely used by developers , who were turned off by the increasingly creaky look of the Tk applications they saw .
Tk is and was actually a fairly flexible system , and it would have been possible to tweak the look and feel to make it look a bit better on Linux , without even doing any major work .
Maybe not perfect , but certainly better looking .
Nothing happened , though .
Another problem was that Tk and Tcl made it so easy to create GUIs that anyone could , and did , despite , in many cases , a complete lack of design skills .
You ca n’t particularly blame the tools for how they ’re used , but there was certainly a cultural problem : if you read most of the early Tcl and Tk books , and even many of the modern ones , there are hundreds of pages dedicated to exactly how to use
Tk , but few to none explaining even basic user interface concepts , or even admonitions to the user to seek out that knowledge prior to attempting a serious GUI program .
The end result is that a lot of Tk programs , besides just looking “ old fashioned ” had fairly poor user interfaces because they were made by programmers who did not have a UI / design culture .
Contrast that with Gnome and KDE , which have made a point of focusing on how to make a good GUI for their systems , complete with guidelines about how applications should behave .
It may have taken them some time to get things right , but they have done a lot to try and instill a culture of creating high quality , well - integrated GUI ’s that are consistent with the system where they run .
Lately , there has been a lot of work to update the Tk look and feel , and it has finally started to bear fruit .
However , in terms of marketing , the damage has already been done : the image of “ old , crufty Tk ” has been firmly planted in countless developers ’ minds , and no amount of facts are going to displace it in the near future .
Another problem
Tcl faced , as it grew , was the tug - of - war between those wishing to see it small , light , and easy to distribute embedded within some other program , and those wishing it to become a “ full - fledged ” programming language , with lots of tools for solving every day programs .
Unfortunately , that tug of war seems to have left it somewhere in the middle .
Lua is probably more popular these days as an embedded language , because it is very small , and very fast , and does n’t have as much “ baggage ” as Tcl .
Meaning , of course , that it does n’t do as much as Tcl either , but for a system where one merely wishes to embed a scripting language , without much ‘ extra stuff ’ ,
Tcl ’s extra functionality is perhaps a burden rather than a bonus .
On the other hand , while Perl was happily chugging along with their CPAN system for distributing code , giving users easy access to a huge array of add - on functionality , and Python was building up a “ batteries included ” distribution , that included a lot of very useful software straight out of the box .
Tcl , on the other hand , chose to keep the core distribution smallish , and only lately has got some semblance of a packaging and distribution system , that is , however , run by ActiveState , and is ( at least according to a cursory glance at the Tcl ’ers wiki ) , not even fully open source .
The lack of a good distribution mechanism , and , in the meantime , eschewing a larger , batteries - included main distribution left Tcl users with a language that , out of the box , did significantly less than the competition .
Technically , a Python style “ big ” distribution would not have been all that difficult , so once again , I think this is a marketing problem : a failure of the Tcl Core Team to observe the “ market ” , assess what users needed , and act on it in a timely manner .
Somewhat related to the large Tcl vs small Tcl issue was one particular extension , or extensions to the language that was noticeably absent : a system for writing “ object oriented ” code .
Tcl , at heart , will never be an OO language through and through , like Ruby or Smalltalk , but that does n’t mean that an OO system for it is not a useful way of organizing larger Tcl systems .
Indeed ,
Tcl ’s syntax is flexible enough that it ’s possible to write an OO system in Tcl itself , or , optimizing for speed , utilizing the extensive C API in order to create new commands .
Over the years , a number of such systems have arisen , the most well - known being “ Incr Tcl ” ( a play on the incr command , which is akin to += 1 in languages like C ) .
However , none of these extensions was ever included with the standard Tcl distribution or somehow “ blessed ” as the official OO system for Tcl .
This meant that a newcomer to Tcl wishing to organize their code according to OO principles had to pick a system to use from several competing options .
And of course , newcomers are the least able to judge a complex feature like that in a language , making it a doubly stressful choice .
Furthermore , even experienced
Tcl programmers who wanted to share their code could not utilize an OO system if they wanted their code to work with just standard Tcl .
Also , if their code had a dependancy on some OO system , it would require the user to download not only the extension in question , but the OO system it was built on , which , naturally , might conflict with whatever OO system the user had already selected !
As of Tcl 8.6 , thanks to the work of Donal Fellows , Tcl is finally integrating the building blocks of an OO system in the core itself , but this effort is probably something like 10 years too late .
Some other more or less minor things that have taken too long to get integrated in the Tcl or Tk distributions include the PNG format ( still not there in a production release of Tcl ) , a readline - based command line ( Tkcon is nice , but not a replacement for simply being able to type “ tclsh ” and get a nice , functional shell like Python , Ruby and most other languages have .
This could easily lead to a bad first experience for someone trying out Tcl ) .
Tcl also took too long to integrate a first - class hash type ( accessed with the ‘ dict ’ command ) , which only appeared in 8.5 .
Its “ arrays ” are n’t bad , but do n’t quite have the full power of a hash table as dict implements them .
Once again , the code to do these things was / is out there , it has just been a matter of integrating it into Tcl and Tk , which has been a slow process .
One actual technical problem that Tcl faces is the concept that all values must be representable as a string .
This is more or less ok for things like lists , hash tables or numbers , but is problematic when the user wishes to represent a value that simply is n’t a string .
A basic example is a file handle , which at the C API level is a FILE *.
How does
Tcl get around this ?
It keeps an internal hash table with a Tcl - script accessible string , such as “ file5 ” that points to a FILE * value that is used internally by file commands .
This works pretty well , but there is a big “ but ” : since you can compose a string like “ file5 ” at any time , that must be able to access the actual file pointer , you ca n’t do any sort of “ garbage collection ” to determine when to clean things up automatically .
Other languages have explicit references to resources , so the program “ knows ” when a resource is no longer referenced by the rest of the program , and can clean it up .
Therefore , the programmer must explicity free any resources referenced this way .
This explanation is simplifying things somewhat , but it is something I view as a technical problem with Tcl .
If you ’ve been following along , you ’ve noticed a lot of “ these days ” and “ recently ” .
That ’s because
Tcl is still very actively developed , with a lot of new ideas going into it .
However , if you look at the release dates , it seems that after Ajuba was sold off , and Ousterhout pretty much abandoned an active role in the language for good , placing it in the hands of the Tcl Core Team , there was a lull in the momentum , with Tcl 8.5 taking 5 years to be released .
This is actually , in my opinion , an interesting phenomenon in languages : you risk hitting some kind of local maximum when your language is popular enough to have a lot of users who will be angry if things are changed or accidentally broken in the course of big upheavals .
So you have to slow down , go carefully , and not rock the boat too much .
On the other hand , there is an opportunity cost in that newer languages with less to lose can race ahead of you , adding all kinds of cool and handy new things , or simply fix and remove “ broken ” features .
Erlang is another system that has , in my opinion , suffered from this problem to some degree , but this article is long enough already !
Once again , though , not really a technical issue , but a problem with how the code was managed ( and not an easy one to solve , at that ) .
A Tcl failure that I was personally involved with was the web infrastructure .
What went on to become Apache Rivet was one of the first open source Apache / Tcl projects , and was actually quite a nice system : it was significantly faster than PHP , and of course made use of Tcl , which at the time had a large library of existing code , and could be easily repurposed for projects outside the web ( or the other way around : non -web code could be brought in to a web - based project ) .
One thing I ought to have done differently with the Apache Rivet project was listen to the wise advice of Damon Courtney , my “ partner in crime ” on the project , who wanted to see Apache Rivet have a fairly “ fat ” distribution with lots of useful goodies .
Rails and Django , these days , have shown that that ’s a sensible approach , rather than relying on lots of little extensions that the user has to go around and collect .
The code was out there , I should have helped make Rivet do more “ out of the box ” .
A problem that is and it is n’t : the syntax .
Tcl ’s syntax is amazingly flexible .
Since everything is a command , you can write new commands in Tcl itself – and that goes for control structures , too !
For instance , Tcl has a “ while ” command , but no “ do … while ” .
It ’s very easy to implement that in Tcl itself .
You simply ca n’t do that in most “ everyday ” languages .
However , this comes at something of a “ cost ” .
The syntax , for your average programmer who does n’t want to go too far out of their comfort zone , is perhaps a little bit further afield from the C family of languages than they would prefer .
Still though , a “ human ” problem , rather than a technical one .
Perhaps , sadly , the message is that you ’d better not “ scare ” people when introducing a new language , by showing people something that does n’t look at least a little bit familiar .
Conclusions ?
First and foremost , that , gradually , Tcl and Tk continue to be improved .
However , if one visits developer forums , there are also a lot of negatives associated with the Tcl and Tk “ brands ” , and I am not sure if it will be possible to rectify that .
So what can we learn from the rise and subsequent “ stagnation ” of Tcl ?
Success in the first place came from doing one particular thing very well , and making it a lot easier than other existing systems at the time .
That ’s a good strategy .
Not staying up to date can be deadly .
Of course it can be tricky to know what ’s a genuine trend , and what ’s just a fad , in this industry , and picking the right things to stay up to date with can be tricky .
That said , there are a number of areas where Tcl and Tk failed to follow what became very clear directions until way too late .
Do your best not to get trapped between existing users who do n’t want to rock the boat , and do n’t lose your agility and ability to iterate with the system you ’re developing .
Long delays between releases can be deadly .
Do n’t lose touch with your “ roots ” .
In this case , the open source community that is a “ breeding ground ” for new developers and projects .
Tcl and Tk became passe` in that environment , which has led to its lack of adoption for new projects not only in the world of open source , but in businesses as well .
Do n’t isolate yourself : Tcl and Tk stopped appearing at a lot of the open source conferences and events and in magazines / books / articles online , either because with no figurehead / leader to invite there was less interest in speakers and authors , or because the rest of the Tcl Core Team was n’t particularly engaged , or for whatever other reason .
This created something of a negative feedback loop where Tcl and Tk were things associated with the past , rather than something currently talked about and discussed .
The Wisconsin documents tie Benedict , who as cardinal led the Vatican 's Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith , to the decision in the mid-1990s not to defrock the Rev. Lawrence Murphy despite allegations that the Milwaukee priest molested some 200 deaf boys from 1950 to 1975 .
" I came to the stark realization that the problems were really endemic to the clerical culture , and all the problems we are having in the U.S. led back to Rome , " Anderson said .
" And I realized nothing was going to fundamentally change until they did . "
Anderson , 62 , said the pain of that revelation " brought another dimension to the experience . "
But he said he concluded years earlier that the responsibility for shuffling around problem priests and covering up their indiscretions would extend to the Vatican .
More than a decade after his legal battles with church officials began , Anderson 's adult daughter revealed that as an 8 - year - old she was molested by a therapist she was seeing as Anderson and his first wife were going through a divorce .
The therapist , Anderson said , was a former Catholic priest .
The self - described " former atheist " who rediscovered faith in God through his recovery from alcoholism professes a deep empathy with abuse victims -- he calls them " survivors . "
" It 's not about the money , " Anderson told The Associated Press .
Since 1983 , Anderson and the five other attorneys at his downtown St. Paul firm have sued thousands of Catholic priests , bishops , and dioceses over allegations of sexual abuse by priests and other church leaders .
He claims to have no idea how much he has won in settlements ; in 2002 he estimated that it was around $ 60 million .
" This is a tipping point , " Anderson said .
He found the documents in handling one of the dozens of lawsuits he has pending against various church officials , and hopes to use them to bolster a separate federal lawsuit against the Vatican itself .
The documents , which became publicly known in the past week after Anderson shared them with The New York Times , show that a Vatican office led by the pope , then Cardinal Joseph Ratzinger , halted a church trial against a Wisconsin priest accused of molesting some 200 boys at a school for the deaf .
He would love to question Pope Benedict XVI himself under oath .
Though that is extremely unlikely given that the pope is a head of state , documents Anderson has unearthed have the potential to take a scandal that has plagued dozens of dioceses around the world and place it at the doorstep of Vatican leadership .
ST . PAUL , Minn .
— Jeff Anderson has filed thousands of lawsuits alleging sex abuse by priests and won tens of millions of dollars for his clients , but he has had a bigger goal in mind for nearly two decades .
He wants to bring his career - long legal crusade against misconduct in the Roman Catholic Church right to the top .
The Vatican is defending that decision , saying the case reached the Vatican only in 1996 , two years before Murphy died .
Church officials also say Murphy had repented in a letter to Ratzinger , and that the case 's statute of limitations had run out .
They decry criticism over the case as an effort to smear the pope .
The Milwaukee lawsuit does not name Pope Benedict or other Vatican leaders as defendants , but Anderson hopes to use it to bolster a separate lawsuit filed eight years ago in U.S. District Court in Oregon .
In that case , an unidentified plaintiff claims he was sexually abused as a teenager in 1965 or 1966 by the Rev. Andrew Ronan at St. Albert 's Church in Portland , Ore . According to court documents , Ronan was accused of abusing boys in the mid-1950s as a priest in the Archdiocese of Armagh , Ireland .
He was transferred to Chicago , where he admitted abusing three boys at St. Philip 's High School , and after that was sent to Oregon .
The church removed Ronan from the priesthood in 1966 .
He died in 1982 .
The lawsuit says the Vatican had to approve the international transfer .
The Holy See claims it is protected by the Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act , which prohibits U.S. lawsuits against foreign countries .
Several lower courts have produced differing rulings on the suit , and the Holy See has appealed to the U.S. Supreme Court to settle the question .
The high court has not decided whether it will hear the case .
Anderson said his legal team will attempt to use documents from the Milwaukee lawsuit to show the Vatican was heavily involved in decisions about how to deal with problem priests .
Legal scholars have long been skeptical of Anderson 's chances of penetrating the Vatican 's foreign sovereignty .
He said it may be difficult to persuade judges to consider documents from another lawsuit , but added that he feels " closer than we 've ever been before . "
" If there 's anyone to press this case , it 's Jeff , " said David Clohessy , national director for Survivors Network of those Abused by Priests , a longtime ally of Anderson .
" Jeff does n't get sole credit , and he would n't claim it , but he was among the very first to see the magnitude of this cover - up and is still among the most dedicated to its undoing . "
Jeffrey Lena , the Berkeley , Calif . - based attorney for the Holy See in the Oregon case , declined to comment for this story .
Andrew Eisenzimmer , a lawyer for the Archdiocese of St. Paul and Minneapolis , has sparred frequently with Anderson and declined to be interviewed .
In earlier interviews with the AP , he described Anderson as " prone to exaggeration " but also said he 's been undeniably successful .
Anderson has always had a flair for the public relations aspect of his work , and a visit to his office the day after the Milwaukee story broke found him fielding interview requests from numerous media outlets as lawyers and researchers combed through documents on the large , dark wood table in his office .
Anderson was raised Lutheran and his first wedding was in the Catholic Church , though he said his spiritual journey no longer involves church attendance .
His office , however , is full of religiously symbolic art and sculpture , as well as items salvaged from churches -- including a kneeler and confessional booths .
Anderson downplays the significance of the Christian objects , pointing out he also displays Buddhist and Native American religious relics .
" I like religious iconography , " he said .

Rediscovering Giovanni Boldini
Posted Friday , February 12 , 2010 9:46 am
WILLIAMSTOWN
Society portrait painter :
Not the most flattering of labels to wear as an artistic legacy , but it suited Giovanni Boldini just fine .
It was , after all , how he chose to define himself at the height of his career in late 19th - century Paris .
And by catering to the rich and fashionable , he not only made money , but an international reputation as well .
Technically adept , a prolific draftsman and a canny self - promoter , Boldini worked his way to the top of the art market within two decades of his arrival in Paris in 1871 from his native Italy .
The work that he did in those 20 years -- much of it surprisingly wide - ranging given his later reputation -- is the subject of a new exhibition : " Giovanni Boldini in Impressionist Paris , " opening at the Clark Art Institute this weekend .
Curated by Sarah Lees , the Clark 's associate curator of European art , it will be on view until April 25 .
This is the first major show Lees has undertaken on her own at the Clark , a decision that led her to a five - year research commitment .
She wanted to do it , she said , partly to shed light on the early years of Boldini 's career -- years about which not much is known in the United States -- but also to illustrate how an outsider made his way in the heady Paris art scene at that time .
" Thinking about the choices an artist makes in that period , " she said , " raises questions that still have contemporary relevance . "
Lee said she also wanted viewers familiar with the Clark 's collection of Boldinis ( said to be the largest in the United States ) to see aspects of his work that might be new to them .
" The sheer variety of his output suggests a true talent worth being recognized , " she said .
" I think there is more substance there than if you only knew his late work . '
The art institute 's founder , Robert Sterling Clark , was living in Paris in the early 1900s while Boldini was still active .
Although a portrait may have been beyond even Clark 's ample means , Lees said he did manage to buy a number of the artist 's smaller earlier works .
Trendy , not far out

In that , Clark was not unlike other of Boldini's American clients -- looking for something trendy , but not too far out .
" If you were compiling a collection and wanted to go to Paris to get the latest thing , " she said , " Boldini , in a way , would be a perfect choice .
He acknowledged the more modern / contemporary ideas , but he packaged them in a way you could understand . "
Those " modern / contemporary " ideas , as the show 's title suggests , centered on Impres - sionism , which was beginning to roil the Paris art scene as Boldini arrived in 1871 .
A native of Ferrara , Italy , he had moved to Florence in 1864 , after inheriting money from an uncle , and became part of a group of young artists there who called themselves the Macchi-aioli .
Like the Impressionists , they were reacting against past academic traditions and painting in bright colors and broken brushstrokes , or macchia in Italian .
In Florence , as the 232 - page exhibition catalog relates , Boldi - ni did informal portraits and painted landscapes outdoors .
Encouraged by clients , he used his connections to spend five months working in London , before finally settling in Paris , where he spent the rest of his life .
Renting a studio in the artists ' quarter , Montmartre , Boldini showed his work to Adolphe Goupil , a big art dealer at the time , who agreed to take him on .

Not an Impressionist
Although he knew Impression - ist artists like Degas , whose work he admired , and his paintings had the loose , sunlit look of Impressionist art , Boldini never really allied himself with that group , Lees said .
He preferred to show his art in commercial galleries , where it had a better chance of being sold , than at salons , where the Impressionists found criticism was plentiful and buyers were few .
Also , while his paintings had the sketchy brushwork normally associated with Impressionism , they were actually very detailed and precisely drawn , Lees said .
And the experimentation with optical effects that absorbed an Impressionist like Monet , for example , was not part of Boldini 's agenda .
" He was open to experimentation , but he was not an avant - garde artist , " Lee said .
" He was n't trying to challenge accepted traditions in the same way that we find in the Impressionist artists .
He could incorporate those ideas , but my sense is he was always compelled to have something that would appeal to a more conservative collector or critic . "
The exhibition examines the phases of Boldini 's artistic development over the next decades in Paris , from his early focus on genre scenes with figures in period costume , to the streetscapes around his studio , to the countryside surrounding Paris , to surprising experiments at capturing movement in frenzied brushstrokes and nocturnes in the darkest colors .

He took to painting objects in his studio , singling out a chair or a gilded frame for detailed rendering , then allowing the rest to dissolve in loose , quick brushstrokes .
At times , he would reproduce his own paintings within paintings .
He was dedicated and prolific draftsman , a sketchbook always at hand , dashing off images of people at the theater , at a concert or in a cafe .
Loved music
A music lover , Boldini drew and painted musicians , singers and orchestras , often from unusual perspectives and in cropped compositions similar to those Degas took with his dancers .
In the early 1880s , his portraiture took a turn stylistically , away from traditional static poses to more active ones , with torsos twisted , heads turned , hands held in elegant gestures .
That and his ability to capture a sense of character in deft , fluid brushstrokes gave his potraits a stylish look , as one critic put it , " dreamed of by all our beautiful society ladies . "
Boldini loved beautiful things , Lees said , although he , himself , " was very short and not terribly attractive . "
And he had an outgoing personality that helped him make his mark .
" On a technical level he was certainly a remarkable painter , " she said .
" He really knew how to move paint around . "
Yet compared to a master portraitist like John Singer Sargent , whose Paris studio he eventually occupied , Lees said Boldini was much more an artist of his time , catering to Belle Epoque tastes in fashion .
Sargent , on the other hand , was more " universal , " less obviously of a particulasr place and time in the way he pictured his sitters .
Boldini 's artistic legacy , she concluded , " is an interesting question . "
Even after five year of researching him , she said " there 's something that remains inexplicable .
" The combination of looseness and finish is always frustrating , " she said , " yet you can't help but like his pictures . "

Video and photo evidence Monday morning confirmed that Sarah Palin used crib notes written on her hand for a Q&A after her speech at the conservative Tea Party convention on the weekend .
As the crowd cheered , the former Republican vice - presidential candidate was asked in a post - speech Q&A , what the top three things were that would have to be done when Republicans regain control of the U.S. House and Senate .
“ Rein in spending , obviously , ” Palin replies , then glances down at her palm for a memory jog .
A close - up showed the words “ energy , ” “ budget ( cut ? ) , ” “ tax ” and “ lift American spirits ” scrawled on her left hand .
Palin was paid $ 100,000 for her speech Saturday night at the convention in Nashville , during which she lambasted U.S. President Barack Obama as that “ charismatic guy with a teleprompter . ”
On Sunday , she admitted that she was considering a run for the U.S. presidency in 2012 , saying , “ It would be absurd not to consider it . ”
The former Alaska governor told Fox News during the convention that she ’s better prepared than she was in 2008 .
“ My focus has been enlarged , ” she said .
“ I sure as heck better be more astute on these current events than I was two years ago . ”
Although news photographs of Palin during the speech show the writing as she gestures , it was only during the post - speech interview that she actually paused to consult her handwritten list .
Reviving redsn0w
It sure has been a while since we last saw a firmware update from Apple .
( And by the way , which will come first … the iPad wifi , FW version 3.1.¾.0 for iPhones , or the new iPhone itself ? )
Anyway , while we ’re waiting , we updated redsn0w to be compatible with FW 3.1.2 .
We also added a few new features !
It ’s actually been in “ open beta ” for a while now , and those of you who already follow @MuscleNerd on twitter may already have tried the new redsn0w .
You can read all about it and download it from our our wikee .
Compared to our last release , we ’ve given you the ability to quickly change your boot or recovery logos and enable “ verbose ” booting .
And for those of you who want to experiment with your internet tethering options over cellular , try version 0.9.3 in the extra links at the bottom of that wikee page .
After reading the brief Q&A on our wikee , feel free to ask any questions below in the comments .
Briefly though , if you ’re already happy with your current jailbroken system ( whether it ’s via PwnageTool or blackra1n ) , and if you do n’t want boot logos , then you can safely ignore this post and we ’ll continue the wait for Apple ’s next release together :)
Otherwise go ahead and try some new boot logos using redsn0w , or use it for fresh jailbreaks .
If you use it on an already jailbroken phone , be sure to checkmark “ Already pwned ” and do n’t reinstall Cydia again ( doing so will probably make Cydia lose track of what it has installed ) .
Caution : if you ’re using the ultrasn0w or yellowsn0w unlocks then do n’t be tempted to update to official 3.1.2 just to use redsn0w ( and remember , redsn0w still works at 3.0 anyway ) .
If you update to official 3.1.2 , redsn0w will still work but you ’ll lose ultrasn0w and yellowsn0w .
There is geohot ’s blacksn0w for those who updated to official 3.1.2 but there are still wifi problems with the unlock at that firmware in a small number of cases .
i Phone 2G unlockers do n’t need to worry about any of this , since BootNeuter handles all that regardless of firmware version ( BootNeuter is installed for you by redsn0w if you have an iPhone 2G and choose “ unlock ” ) .
This version of redsn0w does not provide an untethered jailbreak for those of you with brand new iPhone 3GS , iPod touch 2G , or any iPod touch 3G .
redsn0w will jailbreak those but it will still be a tethered jailbreak until some new exploit is found and released .
As always , redsn0w does not update your firmware version .
You use it with whatever firmware is already running on your device ( and you point redsn0w to the IPSW corresponding to that firmware already running on your device ) .
Despite all the wild stories you have already heard about China , expect the nation to keep blowing your mind .
That 's because not only is China enormous and highly diverse , but most importantly , it 's rapidly changing .
Thus China 's future already looks far different today than even five years ago .
It 's surely not your father 's ' Red China ' , or even your older brother 's ' Made in China ' ...
The Texas Board of Education ’s ongoing battle over rewriting its social studies curriculum has gotten its fair share of attention from the national media .
But the religious right has been fairly quiet on the subject outside of the Lone Star State .
This weekend , Mike Huckabee will step into the fray , delivering national exposure to a conservative market .
Mathew Staver of Liberty Counsel and dean of Jerry Falwell ’s Liberty University law school , will be a guest on Fox News ’
Huckabee show to discuss the curriculum revisions .
But Dan Quinn of the religious right watchdog Texas Freedom Network said if a Liberty Counsel news release about Staver ’s appearance is any indication , the show will no doubt misrepresent the efforts of the curriculum writing committee and unfairly portray its members as a “ bunch of anti-Christian bigots . ”
That ’s because right - wing fundamentalist members of the Board of Education want to ignore the committee ’s curriculum standards in an attempt to insert dubious stories and language that promotes the idea that America was founded as a “ Christian nation .
Liberty Counsel is an evangelical Christian advocacy organization that champions issues that break down the barrier of separation of church and state .
Accusing “ people of trying to rewrite the past , “ the news release says Staver and Huckabee will be discussing academic attempts to “ remove references to Daniel Boone , General George Patton , Nathan Hale , Columbus Day , and Christmas . ”
It also said the committee was trying to include “ the cultural impact of hip hop music , ACLU lawyer Clarence Darrow , and the Hindu holiday of Diwali . ”
Quinn called the news release a “ blatant distortion of the truth . ”
Last month , members of the Board of Education proposed a litany of amendments to the draft history curriculum that the writing committee of teachers , scholars and community members had spent almost a year writing .
( The board of education will continue its review of the proposed standards in March .
It ’s scheduled to make a final vote in May . )
As an example of the news releases ’ distortion , the committee suggested moving discussion of Hale , an American Patriot hanged by the British , from the 1st grade curriculum to 4th grade because it thought the gruesome topic was more appropriate for older students .
“ The right began to scream , but in most cases they were just putting them in a different spot , ” Quinn said .
The topic of Christmas had already been part of a 6th grade geography class on world religions that included two Christian holidays ( Easter and Christmas ) , two Jewish ones ( Yom Kippur and Rosh Hashanah ) and the Muslim observance of Ramadan .
In an effort to streamline the curriculum guidelines , the committee proposed listing only one tradition from each religion .
Rosh Hashanah and Christmas were dropped .
But Staver and Huckabee may have a short discussion on this subject seeing as Christmas was put back in after conservatives on the board objected .
What seems to have been forgotten in all the discussions is that curriculum guidelines are not comprehensive laundry lists of every topic and person who should be taught in class .
Rather , they are descriptions of broad concepts that the students are supposed to master .
And there are no doubt hundreds of men and women who helped define this nation who students should learn about .
Religious conservatives have called for removal of plenty of names and topics too , but their motivations appear to be more for ideological reasons .
As for the issue of hip hop , well , Quinn said , it was pretty clear at a discussion in January that board members did n’t even have a clue to what hip hop was , confusing it with “ gangsta rap . ”
In the end , board members left in hip hop , but they also included country western music .
( I ’m thinking of sending board member Don McElroy a copy of Johnny Cash ’s Folsom Prison Blues for the lyrics , “ I shot a man in Reno , just to watch him die . ” )
Regarding Clarence Darrow , board members objected to his work as an ACLU attorney in the Scopes Monkey Trial .
Conservatives also proposed removing César Chavez ( labor organizer and civil rights leader ) because of his leftist ties .
And Thurgood Marshall ( the nation ’s first black US Supreme Court justice who , as a young attorney , successfully argued the public school desegregation case of Brown v. Board of Education ) should be removed from textbooks because his contribution to this nation ‘s history was insignificant .
“ There is a big difference for removing a name for structural reasons , rather than political perspectives , ” Quinn said .
Huckabee , who has said he does n’t believe in evolution – or more specifically , that his family did n’t come from apes – is n’t likely to give this a thoughtful analysis .
Rather , he ’ll probably jump on all the right buzz words – Christmas , ACLU , liberals and socialists – to motivate his conservative viewers .
And since Texas is the second biggest purchaser of textbooks in the country , the battle has national significance , influencing the textbook purchases in other states .
“ It ’s not like Vegas , ” Quinn said .
“ What happens in Texas does n’t stay in Texas . ”
Huckabees ’ show airs at Fox News at 8 p.m. Saturday and 2 a.m. and 8 p.m. Sunday ( EST ) .
LANCASTER , Pa. —
A newspaper is reporting that a Lancaster County couple believes an underwater snapshot they took off the coast of Aruba reveals human remains on the ocean floor .
The Intelligencer Journal / Lancaster New Era reported Thursday that the photo taken by John and Patti Muldowney of Manheim last fall has been turned over to the FBI .
Patti Muldowney took the shot while snorkeling near the Caribbean island .
Only later did the couple notice one photo shows what could be a human corpse or skeleton .
John Muldowney says he has a gut feeling it may be Natalee Holloway , the Alabama honors student who disappeared in Aruba nearly five years ago .
The FBI has declined to say what , if anything , it ’s doing with the picture .
In Lovecraft 's Cthulhu Mythos a recurring motif is angles that are somehow wrong .
As part of my project to transport an alarm clock to R'lyeh I have been investigating the trignometric formula cos²θ + sin² θ=1 but using complex angles instead of real ones .
In bothandthe protagonist is frightened by eldritch angles where other dimensions have sinister protrusions into our realm .
The geometry is wrong in ways that terrify the human mind and hint of portals to places that one does not want to go and from which unimaginable evils may erupt .
But how can an angle be wrong ?
If it were so wrong why would we still call it an angle ?
I caught a glimpse of these stygian depths pondering how to prove that cos²x + sin²x =1 .
If x is a real number , as any holy and pure angle ought to be , then we can factorise
cos²x + sin²x =( cosx+isinx ) ( cos x - isin x ) = eix e-ix = 1
People seem to find this insufficiently macho and want to prove how manly they are by multiplying out the power series .
I tried to warn against doing that , but lydianrain insisted on doing it regardless .
These manipulations are valid in any nicely normed field .
So the result is proved for complex angles .
For example cos 1/2+i/3 = 0.9268-0.1628 i and sin 1/2+i/3 = 0.5063+0.298i , from which you can soon verify that cos² 1/2+i/3 + sin² 1/2+i/3 = 1 .
Complex angles are obviously wrong .
They are incomprehensible .
What could turning through 1 /2+i/3 radians possibly mean ?
On the other hand , one might just shrug and comment sarcastically " Mathematics is incomprehensible , who knew ? " .
Perhaps this is merely ordinary incomprehensibility and not the excrescence of evil .
Notice though that proving the theorem by multiplying out power series in a single variable has darker implications , far worse than I have adumbrated .
Any nicely normed power associative algebra will do and the Cayley - Dickson construction spawns an infinite tower of 2n dimensional hypercomplex numbers that serve as increasingly wrong angles growing exponentially more disturbing as they voyage further and further beyond human comprehension .
We could start with the quaterions .
For example cos(1/2+2i/3-j/4+3k/5 ) = 1.286 - 0.368i + 0.138 j - 0.331 k and sin(1/2+2i/3-j/4+3k/5 ) = 0.703 + 0.673i - 0.252 j + 0.606 k .
You can check for yourself that the squares add up to one .
The octonians works just as well .
With x = 0.1-0.25i+0.3j-0.7k+0.2l+0.5il+0.4jl+0.6kl we get cos x = 1.809+0.031i-0.038j+0.088k-0.025l-0.063il-0.050 jl-0.075kl and also sin x =
0.182-0.313i+0.376j-0.878k+0.251l+0.627il+0.502jl+0.752kl leading to the sum of squares being one as before .
The darkness just keeps on deepening for the sedenions expand the horror into 16 dimensions .
For example if x = 0.1+0.2e 1 +0.3e 2 +0.4e 3 - 0.25e 4 +0.5e 5 - 0.7e 6 +0.6e 7 - 0.3e 8 +0.3e 9 - 0.1e 10 - 0.6e 11 +0.23e 12 +0.85e 13 +0.12e 14 +0.11e 15 it remains possible to compute the cosine , which turns about to be 2.748-0.031e 1 - 0.046e 2 - 0.061e 3 +0.038e 4 - 0.077e 5 +0.107e 6 - 0.092e 7 +0.046e 8 - 0.046e 9 +0.015e 10 +0.092e 11 - 0.035e 12 - 0.130e 13 - 0.018e 14 - 0.017e 15 .
Torturing myself with another computation just as foul yields the sine which is 0.276+0.306e 1 +0.459e 2 +0.612e 3 - 0.382e 4 +0.765e 5 - 1.071e 6 +0.918e 7 - 0.459e 8 +0.459e 9 - 0.153e 10 - 0.918e 11 +0.352e 12 +1.300e 13 +0.184e 14 +0.168e 15 .
Yet again the sum of squares is 1 .
Is their no escape ?
No , it is an infinite tower , power associative at every step and offering a climb that ends only in insanity , fall , and death .
Respect Lovecraft 's insights and flee from angles that are wrong .
( Newser ) – Florida police burned an alleged marijuana grower twice , or perhaps thrice , when they confiscated his crop , left a ransom note , and then arrested him when he answered it .
A citizen tipped cops to the six large plants growing on a vacant lot .
They grabbed them , and hoping for a bit more , left the note , which read “ Thanks for the grow !
You want them back ?
Call for the price . ”
And then …
Detectives “ were laughing to see if somebody was dumb enough to call back , ” a sheriff ’s office official tells CNN .
But that he did , about 20 minutes after the note was left .
“ They were shocked this guy called .
They negotiated back and forth over a price , and finally settled at $ 200 , ” the official continues .
Needless to say , the grower met with the “ kidnappers , ” forked over the money — and got a pair of cuffs in return .

Michael Schumacher sought clarification from FIA race director Charlie Whiting about driving standards after qualifying in Melbourne - having been left angry that he had been blocked by other drivers .
The Mercedes GP driver was unhappy that his efforts were hit by both Fernando Alonso and Lewis Hamilton getting in his way during various stages of the qualifying .
And he was so upset with the way that Alonso had driven while on a slow down lap at the end of Q3 , that he confronted the Spaniard in parc ferme after the session - before seeking out Whiting to discuss the matter further .
" Basically on my last try , I was slowed down by him , " explained Schumacher about Alonso .
" I asked him whether the team had told him [ I was on a quick lap ] and he said no .
" In a way it is difficult because he was on his in - lap , and he was worrying about other things than maybe watching the mirror .
But saying that , we had this chat yesterday in the drivers ' briefing that this should be taken care of , and actually he was one of the main guys asking about it .
" I wanted to know if the team had told him or not , and then I had a conversation with Charlie about it because I wanted to know what are the guidelines here - and whether the rules have changed a little bit to what they used to be .
I [ told Whiting I ] need to know what would you be okay with , and what not . "
When asked about Hamilton in Q2 , Schumacher added : " I had a similar issue with Lewis , that he was adapting his lap and preparing his lap and blocking me in a way - which is not very nice .
" If you sit behind , you are trying your best , which I am doing at the moment , and then somebody slows you down , it is not very comfortable . "
The incident between Alonso and Schumacher comes after several problems over the Australian Grand Prix weekend - where slow cars have got in the way of faster approaching rivals .
BMW Sauber 's Pedro de la Rosa was reprimanded after the final free practice session for impeding another driver .
Robots born with the sole purpose of solving the Rubik 's Cube are nothing new , but we 're pretty sure we have n't seen one crack the code in under a dozen seconds before .
The Cubestormer , which is built from a myriad Lego Mindstorm kits , recently took hold of the famous block and lined up every color without breaking a sweat .
Oh , and did we mention that it took less than 12 seconds ?
It 's worth noting again , either way .
Hop on past the break and mash play to have your mind blown , not to mention your own intelligence insulted .
A collective groan went up as Russians awoke Thursday morning to discover that , while they slept , their Olympic hockey team – the legendary Big Red Machine – had gone down to ignominious defeat at the hands of the oft - trounced Canadians .
But the disappointment actually started to set in at least a week ago , as the first fully post - Soviet generation of Russian Olympic athletes hit the Vancouver Games , stumbled , picked themselves up , but have yet to deliver the showers of golden medals that their USSR - era predecessors took for granted .
" All Russia is in shock over the [ Vancouver ] results , " says Irina Rodnina , a former Soviet figure - skating champion turned prominent Russian politician .
Ms. Rodnina blames complacent sports officials and money - obsessed athletes for the slump .
" How can we be successful if there is no proper Olympic spirit among the sports bosses , coaches and athletes ? " she says .
As of Thursday , Russia stood in fifth place overall , with 13 medals , three of them gold .
That puts it far behind the front - running US , which has garnered 28 medals , including seven golds .
Politics to blame ?
Some sports fans say they 're devastated .
" The USSR was a sports superpower , and there was a responsibility that athletes felt toward the people and their country , " says Sergei Kalashnikov , a Moscow hockey fan .
" Things are different now .
It 's a shame . "
Igor Larin , a sports writer for the Moscow daily Sport - Express , blames capitalism .
" The attitude of society has changed [ since the demise of the USSR ] , and athletes have become victims of the cult of cash that came from the West , " he says .
This sour mood contrasts sharply with the optimism going in .
Just before the Vancouver Olympics opened , the Moscow daily Izvestia leaked an internal memo prepared for the Kremlin by Russia 's top sports officials , which confidently predicted that Team Russia would pick up as many as 31 medals in Vancouver , including between seven and 11 golds .
The Kremlin had attached high expectations to the national team 's performance in Vancouver , hoping that a strong showing would put Russia front and center in advance of the next Winter Games , which are slated to be held in Sochi , Russia , in 2014 .
" Political meaning is seen in the Olympics , and now it looks like we are failing in the world arena , " says Mikhail Delyagin , an expert with the independent Institute of Globalization in Moscow .
" It seems like , in Russia , they shout from every rooftop that [ prime minister Vladimir ]
Putin 's plan is a plan for victory .
But what do we see ?
All the boasts about our team proved to be empty words . "
Mr. Putin , who as president went to great lengths to secure the 2014 Winter Olympics for Sochi , has staked more than $ 12 billion of the state 's money and his own personal prestige on the Games ' success .
Back in the USSR
Others say the blame runs much deeper than current politics , beginning with the 1990's collapse of the USSR 's vaunted system of special schools and programs that selected , groomed , and raised children to be Olympic athletes .
" I am deeply disillusioned over the very unsuccessful performance of our Olympic team , but I can't say that I 'm surprised , " says Anna Dmitriyeva , a former Soviet tennis champion who 's now deputy director of Russian television 's NTV sports channel .
" These poor results show that , even in areas where we thought we were the best , like ski sports , the training of our athletes lags behind that of many countries . "
She says the problem is systemic , beginning with the government 's failure to preserve any of the Soviet - era programs to promote mass sports and to build athletic excellence .
" They thought that we 're such a huge country , we 'd always have enough great athletes .
But it turns out that talent has to be cultivated , " says Ms. Dmitriyeva , who was a member of the first Soviet delegation to the Wimbledon tennis championships in 1958 .
" We lost our system of sports schools , and now our children have nowhere to go to practice , " she says .
" And we lost our coaches .
Many fine professionals had to go abroad to survive .
No one made an effort to keep them at home , and now we see the cumulative results . "
With the Sochi Games just four years away , some experts say Russia is going to have to pull out all the stops to get its athletes back in shape .
" We are catastrophically short of time , " former NHL hockey legend and current Russian parliamentarian Vyacheslav Fetisov told the Moscow daily Komsomolskaya Pravda this week .
" We 're going to have to make some really tough decisions to ensure that we do not fail in the next Olympic cycle , " he said .
" Russia has invested too much money , and too much hope and expectation in the coming Sochi Olympics .
We have no right to lose on our home turf . "

The general public seems to be kind of shallow when it comes to user interfaces .
They think " prettier = better . "
A couple of gradients here , some fancy translucent buttons and there you go : an interface that 's just overflowing with awesomeness .
Fact is though , fancier graphics do not equal a better interface .
Most UI / UX professionals agree that graphics should be kept firmly in check or they 'll take over the entire application , sacrificing usability over eye candy .
Should we then abandon eye candy altogether ?
Ban all gradients and icons and go with a bare - bones version of the application ?
Going bare - bones would focus the user purely on the task or goal the application is designed to do .
Sounds like exactly the thing we want to achieve .
Either approach , when designed without care , will yield the same result : decreased usability .
Eye candy distracts , whereas bare - bones fails to attract .
So which one is the lesser of two evils ?
What are the pros and cons of both ?
Are graphics even important ?
That last one is easy : we 're ( usually ) designing graphical user interfaces .
The very presence of the word " graphical " indicates graphics are a big aspect of the interface .
But graphics are n't important simply because the term GUI mentions it ; graphics largely define the application 's appeal for the user .
If the application does n't have some kind of aesthetic value , it will not only fail to attract the user 's attention , it will also fail to hold the user 's attention .
Attracting attention by having a pretty front - end is important , as it makes the user want to use the product .
They are attracted to it just as they are attracted to a beautiful person .
The first glance establishes a relationship with the user .
Pretty graphics seem to say , " Hi , I appeal to your senses ; do n't you want to interact with me ? "
They make the first experience with the application a pleasant one .
Note : by " first experience " I do n't mean the very first time you ever laid eyes on the application .
By first experience I mean the first few seconds after starting the application , when you are only looking at it , prior to actually doing stuff with it .
The saying goes : " Do n't judge a book by its cover " .
We all know this to be true , as the cover 's quality is no indication of the quality of the book 's content .
But even though we know to judge a book by its cover , we do anyway .
We are attracted by pretty covers , so we are more likely to pick a book with a fancy cover from the shelf for further investigation .
Books with " humble " ( or downright ugly ) covers have a larger chance of remaining unnoticed or even knowingly ignored .
So once we 've got the user 's attention , we need to hold it .
Keeping him distraction - free will allow him to reach a state of flow : a state in which he is immersed into his work with the application and in which he feels happy just by doing the task .
When in a state of flow , you leave self - consciousness for what it is and no longer think of your individual self but are fully focused on your task .
A sense of joy takes over , your mind is entirely devoted to the task , time seems to go slower and everything around you fades into the background .
So where do graphics fit into this story ?
Do they help in facilitating a state of flow ?
Why yes , they do !
One example of this is the rounded rectangle .
Often considered as " mere decoration " when used in a UI , they apparently also have a lower cognitive impact than regular rectangles .
Credit for uncovering this to the greater public goes to Keith Lang in this article on rounded rectangles .
Windows 3.1 style graphics , which are still used in some applications to this day , are harsh , full of visual obstacles and hard to scan .
The obstacles , like big borders with sharp edges , constantly interrupt the eyes ' movement across the screen , making it hard to navigate the application .
Subtle gradients and " soft edges " ( created by subtle drop shadows or embossing ) lighten the visual impact of the screen on the user , making it actually easier to use .
But that 's just one small part of the whole .
Bare - bones GUIs prioritize the task at hand and all variables that it has to deal with .
They say : " Users use me because they have some task to accomplish , and I want to help them reach that goal ASAP " .
A commendable approach .
Unfortunately , by focusing on handling the task , they neglect to spend some tender love and care on handling the GUI itself .
They may succeed in facilitating fast task - completion times ; they fail at being pleasurable to use .
And because they fail at being pleasurable , the user has a hard time entering a state of flow .
Emotion plays a big role here .
If the user has a negative state of mind , he or she will also have a harder time using the application .
This state of mind might not have been induced by the bare - bones UI , but it wo n't be alleviated by it either .
As Donald Norman pointed out in his book Emotional Design , prettier things are actually easier to use , or are at least are perceived to be .
This book is all about the relationship between aesthetics and experience , and is a mandatory read for those interested in any kind of design .
So , a level of aesthetic appeal ( i.e. , eye candy ) is definitely recommended for usable interfaces .
But it 's easy to get carried away when implementing awesomeness into your UI .
Most code libraries feature some effects like " Fade , " " Move , " or " Glow " that only need an argument to use , and it 's all too tempting to add them to spice things up quickly .
But these features are exactly the things that distract when not implemented properly ( or implemented when they should n't be implemented at all ) .
Remember the < blink > tag ?
Another example is using photographs or other fancy imagery as the backdrop for a graph .
I 've actually seen this being done : a picture of a coral reef with a line - graph ( with a 1 px yellow line ) superimposed .
It might be fancy , it might be exactly what the customer wanted ; it is not usable .
With the advent of the iPhone and ever - increasing processing power , graphically rich UIs are far more prevalent than they have ever been .
Gradients in applications used to be a rare thing , now it 's rare to see an application without one .
The gradient is just an example of how eye - candy is quickly becoming standard practice in UI design .
But there 's a fine line between helpful and harmful eye candy .
Analyzing whether the eye candy is either helpful or harmful requires constant vigilance but also , every once in a while , some time off .
Looking at your awesome - looking UI after a good night 's sleep allows you to look at it objectively , and determine whether the eye candy additions are truly awesome and helpful , or quite the opposite .

A century ago , anyone with a bathtub and some chemicals could mix and sell drugs — and claim fantastic cures .
These “ innovators ” raked in profits by skillfully marketing lousy products because customers were poorly equipped to tell the difference between effective and ineffective treatments .
In the decades following , the Food and Drug Administration developed some basic rules about safety and disclosure , and everything changed .
Companies had greater incentives to invest in research and to develop safer , more effective drugs .
Eliminating bad remedies made room for creating good ones .
Nearly every product sold in America today has passed basic safety regulations well in advance of being put on store shelves .
A focused and adaptable regulatory structure for drugs , food , cars , appliances and other physical products has created a vibrant market in which cutting edge innovations are aimed toward attracting new consumers .
By contrast , credit products are regulated by a bloated , ineffective concoction of federal and state laws that have failed to adapt to changing markets .
Costs have risen , and innovation has produced incomprehensible terms and sharp practices that have left families at the mercy of those who write the contracts .
- Elizabeth Warren , 3 Mar 2010
After Elizabeth Warren had her chance to speak , the thought on my mind was ‘ complexity is the handmaiden of deception . ’
That was n’t the only point of her presentation on consumer protection , but that was the takeaway for me .
Her point was simply that contracts are the bedrock of the U.S. legal system in promoting law and order .
The purpose of contracts is to support the ‘ invisible hand ’ by allowing both sides of the contract to walk away happy .
This purpose is thwarted when contracts are designed to promote an information asymmetry which enshrines into law the advantage of one party over the other .
The expert understands but the layman does not – and the expert uses this fact to insert terms favorable to him and his associates to the layman ’s disadvantage .
Ultimately , the system breaks down because of widespread distrust .
Opaque and asymmetric contracts diminish from the free market and undermine the invisible hand .
Warren started out by detailing the rise in complexity of credit card agreements .
She showed a Bank of America agreement circa 1980 .
It was one - page in large print and plain English with no hidden language buried within .
Today , including riders , a Bank of America credit card agreement is 30 pages of dense legalese with all manner of disclaimers and hidden surprises .
She says :
Study after study shows that credit products are deliberately designed to obscure the real costs and to trick consumers .
The average credit - card contract is dizzying — and 30 pages long , up from a page and a half in the early 1980s .
Lenders advertise a single interest rate on the front of their direct - mail envelopes while burying costly details deep in the contract .
Creditors try to explain away their long contracts with the claim that they need to protect themselves from litigation .
This ignores the fact that creditors have found many other effective ways to insulate themselves from liability .
Arbitration clauses , for example , may look benign to the customer , but their point is often to permit the lender to escape the reach of class - action lawsuits .
The result is that the lenders can break and , if the amounts at stake are small , few customers would ever sue .
Legal protection is only a small part of the proliferating verbiage .
This is deception , pure and simple .
And you will notice the close relationship between deception and fraud in the definition below .
Etymology : Middle English decepcioun , from Anglo - French deception , from Late Latindeception - , deceptio , from Latin decipere to deceive Date : 15th century 1 a : the act of deceiving b : the fact or condition of being deceived 2 : something that deceives : trick < a clever deception > — de·cep·tion·al \- shə - nəl\ adjective synonyms deception , fraud , double - dealing , subterfuge , trickery mean the acts or practices of one who deliberately deceives .
deception may or may not imply blameworthiness , since it may suggest cheating or merely tactical resource < magicians are masters of deception >.
fraud always implies guilt and often criminality in act or practice < indicted for fraud >.
double - dealing suggests treachery or at least action contrary to a professed attitude < a go - between suspected of double - dealing >. subterfuge suggests the adoption of a stratagem or the telling of a lie in order to escape guilt or to gain an end < obtained the papers by subterfuge >.
trickery implies ingenious acts intended to dupe or cheat < resorted to trickery to gain their ends >.

The Credit CARD
Act of 2009 was passed in part to crack down on this type of deception .
But it is clear that the deception is still ongoing , even in credit cards ( see here and here ) .
The reason for the deception is clear : money .
Banks increasingly rely on fees as a profit center , in part because of the rise of securitization .
But , the complexity and reliance on fees is not just about credit cards .
Felix Salmon pointed out an interesting case today where a bank asked for and received authorization to post account debits largest - to - smallest , which allows them to collect overdraft fees for more transactions .
Felix says :
On another post , RogerNegotiator finds an astonishing OCC letter , authorizing a bank ’s request to adopt largest - to - smallest check posting , thereby maximizing overdraft revenue .
( If you have $ 100 in your account , and put a $ 1 candy bar on your debit card , followed by a $ 15 t- shirt , both transactions will end up generating a $ 34 overdraft fee if a $ 90 check comes in later in the day : the bank will end up making over $ 100 in fees that day alone . )
The key section in the letter is the last one , entitled “ The Bank ’s Consideration of the Section 7.4002 ( b ) Factors ” .
That section lays out four reasons to adopt the practice , and concludes that “ the Bank ’s process for deciding the order of check posting is consistent with the safety and soundness considerations set forth in section 7.4002 ( b ) and that the Bank may therefore post checks in the order it desires ” .
What are those four reasons for ripping off consumers so blatantly ?
The very first one is “ projections showing that revenue is likely to increase as a result of adopting a high - to - low order of check posting ” .
That ’s considered a reason to adopt the practice , in the eyes of the OCC .
As for the rest of the reasons , they ’re mostly ridiculous on their face .
I love this one , for instance :
The Bank concludes that it needs to adopt the high - to - low order of posting so that customers who frequently write checks against insufficient funds do not do business with the Bank primarily because the Bank ’s fee for checks presented against insufficient funds is lower than its competitors ’ .
Essentially , the bank is saying that its competitors have high overdraft fees , and that it does n’t want to compete against its competitors , so it needs high overdraft fees too .
And then there ’s this beaut :
The Bank states its belief that a high - to - low order of posting is consistent with the majority of its customers ’ preferences .
The Bank surmises that the intended order , which will result in a customer ’s largest bills being paid first , will have the consequence of the customer ’s most important bills ( such as mortgage payments ) being paid first .
The Bank thus concludes that a high - to - low order is aligned with the majority of its customers ’ priorities and preferences .
This is accepted at face value by the OCC , instead of simply being laughed at .
Of course , no one bothered to ask the customers , because they knew full well that customers would never say that they preferred this way of doing things .
But so long as the bank simply says that customers prefer it , no problem .
This is predatory behavior , but it has been sanctioned by regulators .
Warren mentioned these overdraft fees specifically when she discussed complexity in financial contracts .
The average overdraft in America is $ 17 , while the average overdraft fee is $ 34 .
Do n’t like it ?
It ’s all there in the fine print – take personal responsibility !
She also mentioned the kickbacks hidden in car loan contracts that used car dealers often receive ( $ 1000 - $ 3800 per contract ) for steering consumers to a particular lender .
As for mortgages , the same goals of opacity were in effect .
A recent post on Baseline Scenario tells us :
First , lenders made loans that virtually invited default .
Thus , Countrywide ’s manual approved the making of loans that left consumers as little as $ 550 a month to live on , or $ 1,000 for a family of four .
And lenders qualified borrowers for loans based on a temporary low teaser rate even though they knew that borrowers would not be able to make the higher payments required when the teaser rate expired .
Of course , when loans became unaffordable , lenders could anticipate that borrowers would refinance , triggering a new round of fees for lenders - but they gave too little attention to the possibility that the loans could not be refinanced .
Consumer protection laws failed to prevent this disaster - in - the - making .
Second , the Federal Reserve ’s disclosure rules made it impossible for adjustable rate mortgage borrowers - and 80 % of the subprime loans were adjustable –to understand the risks they faced .
Since the eighties , the Fed has mandated that the disclosures for such loans state figures for monthly payments that are simply wrong .
That may have led consumers to believe their loans would be more affordable than they were .
One of us recently presided over a survey of mortgage brokers that revealed that many borrowers spent little time reviewing those disclosures and never changed what they did because of them - something that ironically makes sense when the disclosures are misleading .
Again , the borrower is told to take personal responsibility .
But , of course , had regulators cracked down on these deceptive practices , the loans could not have been made .
Warren ’s desire is for a “ cop on the beat ” to enforce the rules and regulations that our laws have enshrined , rather than relying on personal responsibility and industry self - regulation , even in matters of fraud , as Alan Greenspan wanted to do .
The problem , of course , is bureaucracy .
Below is a picture of the present regulatory infrastructure for consumer protection .
There are multiple regulators trying to accomplish a lot of different tasks .
Warren ’s suggestion is that we need to streamline this , eliminating all the duplication and regulatory overlap , combining all of these mandates in one agency , the Consumer Financial Protection Agency .
According to the combined wisdom of the online pundits , Rich Hickey , the creator of Clojure , is set to become one of the most influential figures in technology within the next few years .
“ I think programmers have become
inured to incidental complexity …
when they encounter complexity ,
they consider it a challenge to overcome ,
rather than an obstacle to remove .
Overcoming complexity is n’t work , it ’s waste . ”
Could he really become as well known as John McCarthy who created the Stanford Artificial Intelligence Project in 1964 ?
Even before then , John had already made several towering contributions to the world of computing , including the LISP language , which became the standard for the AI researcher forty years ago .
The connection of course is that Clojure , ( a pun on the closure programming construct ) is an off - shoot or more correctly a dialect , of McCarthy ’s creation .
In Hickey ’s case , it was a language designed for anyone wanting to write robust programs that are simple and fast .
So what was he trying to solve ?
‘ We suffer from so much incidental complexity in traditional OO languages , both syntactic and semantic , that I do n’t think we even realise it anymore .
I wanted to make ‘ doing the right thing ’ not a matter of convention and discipline , but the default .
I wanted a solid concurrency story and great interoperability with existing Java libraries , ’ says Hickey .
He originally targeted both the Java Virtual Machine and the Common Language Runtime ( CLR ) but eventually decided he wanted to do twice as much , rather than everything twice , so chose the JVM because of the much larger open source ecosystem surrounding it .
It has proved to be a good choice .
One of the biggest challenges in developing Clojure Rich adds was getting the persistent data structures right , with sufficient performance such that Clojure could be a viable alternative to Java and C# .
Without that , the project would have stalled .
Hickey remains an independent software designer , consultant and application architect with over two decades of experience in all areas of software development and has worked on scheduling systems , broadcast automation , audio analysis and fingerprinting , database design , yield management , exit poll systems , and machine listening , in a variety of languages .
He lives in New York City .
Looking at footage from the team 's deepest dive , which was taken at 10,000 m in the Tonga Trench , off the coast of New Zealand , Dr Alan Jamieson says that there is still much to learn about this part of the ocean .
At 9,000 m in the Tonga Trench , off the coast of New Zealand , small creatures called amphipods swarm .
These efficient scavengers can strip a dead dolphin to the bone in weeks .
At 7,700 m in the Japan Trench , in the Pacific Ocean , the Oceanlab team recorded a large shoal of snail fish  the deepest fish ever to be filmed alive .
Dr Alan Jamieson explains how the team has been able to film the creatures that live thousands of metres below sea level .
A creature called an isopod , filmed at 7,100 m in the Japan Trench , in the Pacific Ocean , surprised the team with its strange swimming technique .
At 7,000 m in the Kermadec Trench , the team filmed vividly coloured animals swimming around the bait .
At a depth of 6,000 m in the Kermadec Trench , off the coast of New Zealand , creatures like this red crustacean do not linger for long in one place - as Dr Alan Jamieson explains .
Dr Alan Jamieson from the University of Aberdeens Oceanlab explains how a rat-tail , which was filmed at a depth of 5,500 m on the edge of the Marianas Trench in the Pacific Ocean , finds food in the dark .
It is pitch black , icy cold and the pressure is phenomenal .
The deepest parts of the ocean are some of the least hospitable places on Earth - yet footage from recent expeditions reveals that life in the oceanic trenches is thriving .

Kepler uses 42 CCDs ( rectangles ) , paired into square - shaped modules , to search for dips in starlight due to alien planets ( Image : NASA / Ames / JPL - Caltech )
OUR best eye on alien worlds has developed a blind spot .
NASA ’s planet - hunting telescope Kepler has developed a fault that means it sees the equivalent of static in some parts of its view .
Kepler launched in 2009 to hunt for planets orbiting other stars .
Many giant planets on tight orbits have already been found , but the telescope ’s main aim is to find Earth - sized planets orbiting their stars at distances that can support the presence of liquid water and potentially life .
A total of 42 light - detecting chips called CCDs are used to look for periodic dips in starlight when planets pass in front of their host stars .
But one of the 21 modules – containing two CCDs – is now malfunctioning , rendering the stars in its view invisible .
Since the craft rotates its field of view by 90 degrees every three months , the fault means that four regions of the sky are only observable 75 per cent of the time .
The good news is that the problem is not expected to spread , and it might be possible to repair it .
It was just a year back when Bill Gates tried to prove a point about malaria with unleashing a swarm of mosquitoes at the TED Conference .
This year , the American business magnate is back to the conference , but this time he takes on CO2 .
Fireflies became his example of a living “ energy miracle , ” which could solve the ever - growing energy problems we are facing .
Here is an excerpt from his speech …
Even if we were to maximize energy efficiency and limit the impact of population size , we ’d still be emitting 13 billion tons of carbon annually from energy production .
He further said …
If I only had only one wish for the next 50 years , it ’d be to invent the thing that halves the cost of CO2 .
What we ’re going to have to do at a global scale is create a new system .
So we need energy miracles .
He urged the world to find innovative ways to turn spent nuclear fuel into clean energy .
He said that the year 2050 is the deadline for the world to stop all the carbon emissions .
He said that the researchers should spend the next 20 years inventing clean - energy technologies and then , the next 20 years implementing them .

Reason # 2 : Truth matters March 26 , 2010
This is part of a series of posts highlighting reasons why I am converting to the Orthodox Church .
These reasons are posted in no particular order .
Some are big , important reasons ; others may be small , wonderful but non-essential reasons .
I hope they offer food for thought .
As I learned about the early church and the ecumenical councils that helped shape Christian doctrine and drive out false teachings , I realized that the church had long ago addressed the issues that Christians today still grapple with .
Arianism , gnosticism , and other heresies had already been addressed and a determination made .
It was of imperative importance to determine which beliefs were true and which were heretical because Christ founded one Church , and it was important to keep true , right beliefs within that Church .
Without the right belief – what really is the point ?
One must understand who Christ is and what He taught .
If our goal is to know God and to be like Him , then we must know who He is .
Fr. Andrew Stephen Damick put it like this in his excellent podcast on Orthodoxy and Heterodoxy :
If there really is a God , then who He is and what He wants from us is more important than anything else .
If we adopt a consumer - style understanding of faith , where various options are offered as a sort of religious buffet where the choice is left up to the consumer , then the logical conclusion is that beliefs about God are not very important – we can pick and choose as we like .
As I began learning about Orthodoxy , I realized that within Protestantism there is a high degree of accepted relativism .
One could be a Presbyterian , another a Baptist , another a Pentecostal .
They all have very different beliefs .
They all see God in a different light .
We can even go so far as to say that they are all worshiping a different version of God , which causes one to wonder if these groups are even talking about the same God .
Some of them have beliefs or influences that were condemned as heretical by the early church .
And yet we are supposed to accept the idea that they are all still part of the same “ church ? ”
The Church that Jesus founded ?
If the Church is the body of Christ , how can you have one part of the body doing one thing , and another part doing a completely different thing ?
We ca n’t all be part of one body when we are clearly disjointed in our beliefs .
I will remain in the world no longer , but they are still in the world , and I am coming to you .
Holy Father , protect them by the power of your name — the name you gave me — so that they may be one as we are one .
John 17:11
Many evangelicals will say “ all that matters is that you believe in Jesus and that He died for you . ”
This is extremely simplistic and one who makes this kind of statement will quickly run into problems .
Who is Jesus ?
Was He God ?
Was
He man ?
Who is God ?
What is His character ?
How can we know Him ?
How does Jesus relate to God the Father and the Holy Spirit ?
How does one understand the Trinity ?
What does it mean to be a Christian ?
And on .
And on .
And on .
There is so much more than just “ believe in Jesus . ”
I am only interested in right belief , true belief – why would I accept anything less ?
Jesus said that the Truth would set us free , and I want the whole Truth .
We left Protestantism because it represents only a piece of the puzzle , and not the fullness of faith that we were looking for .
Single mother - of - six finds £ 2 m mansion on the net ... and then gets YOU to pay £ 7,000 a month rent
A single mother - of - six is getting more than £ 80,000 a year from the taxpayer to live in a £ 2 million mansion in an exclusive London suburb .
Essma Marjam , 34 , is given almost £ 7,000 a month in housing benefits to pay the rent on the five - bedroom villa just yards from Sir Paul McCartney 's house and Lord 's cricket ground .
She also receives an estimated £ 15,000 a year in other payouts , such as child benefit , to help look after her children , aged from five months to 14 .
Essma Marjam with one of her six children pictured outside the house in Maida Vale , central London , which costs taxpayers almost £ 7,000 a month
The four - storey house in Maida Vale has five bedrooms , two bathrooms , a double living room , large fitted kitchen - diner with French doors on to the landscaped garden and a state - of - the art buzzer entry system .
Astonishingly , it is understood Miss Marjam found the house on the internet through a private letting agency , rather than waiting for Westminster council to give her a vacant property on their books .
She then applied to the council for the £ 1,600 - a- week benefit - the maximum amount the council allows .
Miss Marjam said : ' I moved here at the beginning of the month as I 'm entitled to a five - bedroom house .
' I was in a three - bedroom council house but I needed a bigger place once my new baby came along .
So the council agreed to pay the £ 1,600 a week to a private landlord as they did n't have any houses big enough .
' I 'm separated from my husband .
He 's a solicitor in Derby , but I do n't know if he 's working at the moment .
He does n't pay anything towards the kids .
Things are quite difficult between us .
' The house is lovely and very big , but I do n't have enough furniture to fill it . '
Mrs Marjam 's new home is yards from Sir Paul McCartney 's house
She does , however , have two large flat - screen televisions and several leather sofas , plus a large amount of children 's toys scattered over the wooden floorboards .
During the week , vans from Argos and other home stores dropped off large purchases .
Miss Marjam does not work , as she spends all day looking after her children - Zekia , 14 , Abdulhakim , 13 , Jihad , 11 , Hamza , ten , Ayman , two , and five - month - old Nasir .
The four eldest have the surname Benjamin , while the two youngest have the surname Khan .
Labour 's controversial Local Housing Allowance enables council tenants to receive such high benefits to pay private landlords .
The maximum that can be claimed is set by central government and the allowances can be huge , leaving the taxpayer to foot the bill .
The Daily Mail has highlighted other outrageous examples , such as the single mother of eight receiving £ 90,000 a year to live in a £ 2.6 million Notting Hill mansion .
Taxpayers are also picking up the £ 6,400 - a- month bill to house Nasra Warsame , her seven children and her elderly mother in central London , with Westminster council also providing Mrs Warsame 's husband and their eighth child with a two - bedroom flat nearby .
In total , 16 families are living in million - pound - plus London properties funded by the Local Housing Allowance .
Phillipa Roe , a Westminster councillor , said : ' We would like to see the entire system changed as the current rules are wrong and do not offer taxpayers value for money .
' We want to have more control to limit the amount of money which is paid out .
Local councils are far better placed to determine benefit levels than ministers in Whitehall who wo n't know the facts on the ground .
' The Government has repeatedly pledged to reform housing benefit but failed to do so .
The whole system needs a radical review and ministers should stop dragging their heels and get on and do it . '
A Department for Work and Pensions spokesman said : ' It is not right that in London high rents have been able to distort the system , resulting in a small number of people getting excessively high payments .
' We took immediate action and capped the Local Housing Allowance in April .
The plans we published in December go even further and will exclude high rents from LHA rate calculations .
' Only a very small minority of people receive such high rates of housing benefit .
The average payment is £ 81 a week . '
On the Surly Long Haul Trucker message boards , a fellow brought up that the internally geared Alfine group from Shimano is coming out with an 11 - speed version .
From the fellow , Vik’s , blog :
Shimano has shaken up their internal geared hub lineup with a new 11 speed Alfine hub .
I ’m super stoked to see the gear range gap close with the Rohloff .
I ’ve really enjoyed the Alfine in my Pugsley and the Nexus 8 hubs in my Bike Fridays .
They shift great , are reasonably priced and offer a really low maintenance drivetrain for your bike .
The one downside is their gear range was too narrow for some riders .
With the new 11 speed
Alfine many more riders will be able to use one of these IGHs .
11 Speed Alfine IGH Specs :
gear range 409 % vs. 307 % for the 8 speed Alfine and 526 % for the Rohloff
jumps : 2 x 17 % and 8 x 13 %
weight 1.6kg
oil bath lubrication
trigger shifter
only available in silver initially
$ 419USD
So far I have n’t seen a firm release date for this IGH , but it is supposed to be a 2010 product so let ’s keep our fingers crossed that we see them in North America in the not too distant future .

LCA : How to destroy your community
This article brought to you by LWN subscribers Subscribers to LWN .
net made this article — and everything that surrounds it — possible .
If you appreciate our content , please buy a subscription and make the next set of articles possible .
Josh Berkus is well known as a PostgreSQL hacker , but , as it happens , he also picked up some valuable experience during his stint at " The Laboratory for the Destruction of Communities , " otherwise known as Sun Microsystems .
That experience has been distilled into a " patented ten - step method " on how to free a project of unwelcome community involvement .
Josh 's energetic linux.conf.au presentation on this topic was the first talk in the " business of open source " miniconf ; it was well received by an enthusiastic crowd .
If you are a corporate developer , you 're likely to realize early on that free software development communities are a pain .
They 'll mess up your marketing schemes by , for example , taking the software into countries where you have no presence and no plans .
They 'll interfere with product roadmaps with unexpected innovation , adding features which you had not planned for the next few years - or , worse , features which were planned for a proprietary version .
Free software communities are never satisfied ; they are always trying to improve things .
They tend to redefine partner and customer relationships , confusing your sales people beyond any help .
And they bug you all the time : sending email , expecting you to attend conferences , and so on .
Fortunately , there are ways to get rid of this community menace .
All that 's needed are the following ten steps .
# 1 is to make the project depend as much as possible on difficult tools .
He noted that most companies have no real trouble employing this technique , since it makes good use of the tools they have around anyway .
Community - resistant projects should , for example , use weird build systems not found anywhere else .
A proprietary version control system is mandatory .
Even better are issue trackers with limited numbers of licenses , forcing everybody to use the same account .
It 's also important to set up an official web site which is down as often as it's up .
It 's not enough to have no web site at all ; in such situations , the community has an irritating habit of creating sites of its own .
But a flaky site can forestall the creation of those sites , ensuring that information is hard to find .
2 : Encourage the presence of poisonous people and maximize the damage that they can create .
There is a special technique to the management of these people which goes something like this :
Take pains to argue with these people at length and to denounce them on the project lists .
Eventually , they should be banned from the community by fiat ; it 's important to avoid any sort of community process here .
The banned people will take their flames elsewhere .
Follow them and continue to argue with them in those external sites .
Eventually the community will complain about this behavior ; respond by letting the poisonous people back in .
Then go back to step 1 and do it all over again .
Properly managed , one effective poisonous person , according to Josh , can wipe out a community of hundreds .
3 : Provide no documentation .
There should be no useful information about the code , build methods , the patch submission process , the release process , or anything else .
Then , when people ask for help , tell them to RTFM .
4 : Project decisions should be made in closed - door meetings .
An OK start is to have online meetings with very short notice , though , for best effect , they should be at a time which is inconvenient in the time zones where most community members are to be found .
Better is to have meetings via conference call : that excludes about a third of the planet due to sleep requirements , and , for extra value , also excludes a number of people who are at work who might have been able to participate in an online meeting .
Best , though , is to hold meetings in person at the corporate headquarters .
5 : Employ large amounts of legalese .
Working with the project should involve complex contributor agreements , web site content licensing , non-disclosure agreements , trademark licenses , and so on .
For full effect , these documents should all be changed without notice every couple of months or so .
6 : The community liaison must be chosen carefully .
The optimal choice is somebody reclusive - somebody who has no friends and really does n't like people at all .
Failing that , go with the busiest person on the staff - somebody with both development and management responsibilities , and who is already working at least 70 hours per week .
It 's important , in this case , to not remove any of this person 's other responsibilities when adding the liaison duty .
It can also be effective to go with somebody who is unfamiliar with the technology ; get a Java person to be the liaison for a Perl - based project .
Or , if all else fails , just leave the position vacant for months at a time .
7 : Governance obfuscation .
Community - averse corporations , Josh says , should learn from the United Nations and create lengthy , complicated processes .
Keep the decision - making powers unclear ; this is an effective way to turn contributors into poisonous people .
Needless to say , the rules should be difficult or impossible to change .
8 : Screw around with licensing .
Community members tend to care a lot about licenses , so changing the licensing can be a good way to make them go elsewhere .
Even better is to talk a lot about license changes without actually changing anything ; that will drive away contributors who like the current license without attracting anybody who might like the alleged new license .
9 : Do not allow anybody outside the company to have commit access , ever .
There should be a rule ( undocumented , of course ) that only employees can have commit rights .
Respond evasively to queries - " legal issues , we 're working on it " is a good one .
For especially strong effect , pick an employee who writes no code and make them a committer on the project .
10 : Silence .
Do n't answer queries , do n't say anything .
A company which masters this technique may not need any of the others ; it is the most effective community destroyer of them all .
Josh concluded by noting that he saw all of these techniques employed to great effect by Sun .
But Sun is far from alone in this regard .
Josh has been told by a veteran of the X Consortium that they , too , had made good use of all ten methods at one point or another .
Community - destroying skills are widespread in the industry .
But what if you have a different kind of company , one which wants to encourage and build communities ?
Doing the opposite of all of the above clearly makes a lot of sense .
But , Josh said , it all really comes down to trust .
A relationship with a development community can be seen like a marriage : one can spend years building it up , but one affair will kill the trust it is based on .
Similarly , a company can lose half of its community in a weekend .
Those who would avoid that fate must trust their communities and act in a way which will cause that trust to be returned .

Porsche Design has sent out details about a new edition of the mobile phone the firm released on the open market last year .
The P’9522 Black Edition will be available by the end of the month , and was created in - house at the design firm ’s R&D facility in Austria .
The Black Edition has a combination of matt , black anodized aluminum and black mineral glass that particularly emphasizes the straight lines and purist form of the second Porsche Design cell phone .
The casing is milled from a block of solid aluminum .
Black has characterized us from the start , said Porsche Design Group CEO Dr. Juergen Gessler .
He notes that the company ’s first release was a purpose - built all - black wristwatch .
As is typical for Porsche Design , the black has a functional background : the Chronograph I is derived from the appearance of the non-reflective instruments used in racing cars , in which everything right down to the instruments is matte black .
This avoids unwanted reflections and guarantees easy readability .

Around the country , twenty - two states are currently considering a bill known as the “ Firearms Freedom Act . ”
This bill declares that guns , accessories , and ammunition made within a state , sold within that state and kept in that state are not subject to federal laws or regulations under the “ Interstate Commerce Clause ” of the Constitution .
Montana and Tennessee passed a Firearms Freedom
Act into law in 2009 , and a number of states are moving that direction in the 2010 legislative session .
In South Carolina , where a Firearms Freedom Act was also introduced in 2009 , some representatives have taken things a step further .
NULLIFYING GUN REGISTRATIONS
Introduced in the South Carolina General Assembly this week is House Bill 4509 ( H4509 ) , which if passed , would make law that “ no public official of any jurisdiction may require registration of purchasers of firearms or ammunition within the boundaries of this State . ”
[ efoods ]
No caveat for regulations under the commerce clause .
No caveat for types of firearms either .
This bill says NO to all gun registrations – period .
The principle behind such legislation is nullification , which has a long history in the American tradition .
In the Kentucky Resolutions of 1798 , Thomas Jefferson wrote in response to the hated Alien and Sedition Acts :
“ The several states composing the United States of America are not united on the principle of unlimited submission to their general government ”
and
“ where powers are assumed [ by the federal government ] which have not been delegated , a nullification of the act is the rightful remedy : that every State has a natural right in cases not within the compact , to nullify of their own authority all assumptions of power by others within their limits : that without this right , they would be under the dominion , absolute and unlimited , of whosoever might exercise this right of judgment for them ”
In short , nullification means this :
The state is taking a position that a particular federal law is unconstitutional , and thus , the law in question is void and inoperative , or “ non-effective , ” within the boundaries of that state ; or , in other words , not a law as far as that state is concerned .
But nullification is much more than just mere rhetoric .
To nullify a federal law in practice requires active resistance to it by the people and the state government .

WASHINGTON ( Reuters ) -
The cost to U.S. taxpayers of wars in Iraq and Afghanistan since 2001 has topped $ 1 trillion , and President Barack Obama is expected to request another $ 33 billion to fund more troops this year .
Over two - thirds of the money has been spent on the conflict in Iraq since 2003 .
This year is the first in which more funds are being spent in Afghanistan than Iraq , as the pace of U.S. military operations slows in Iraq and quickens in Afghanistan .
HOW MUCH HAS BEEN SPENT ALREADY ?
Congress has approved $ 1.05 trillion dollars for the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan , according to the National Priorities Project , a nonpartisan budget research group that has a continuously running war cost counter on its website .
The tally topped $ 1 trillion last month , when U.S. lawmakers approved the fiscal 2010 defense spending bill that included $ 128 billion to be spent on the two conflicts through September 30 .
The trillion - dollar total includes war - related costs incurred by the State Department , like embassy security .
HOW MUCH WENT FOR IRAQ AND HOW MUCH FOR AFGHANISTAN ?
The lion ’s share of the spending -- $ 747.3 billion -- has been allocated to the war in Iraq since the U.S. - led invasion there in 2003 .
The other $ 299 billion has been for Afghanistan , where the United States invaded to fight al Qaeda and topple the Taliban after the September 11 attacks in 2001 .
War funding for fiscal 2010 , which ends September 30 , included $ 72.3 billion for Afghanistan and $ 64.5 billion for Iraq , making this the first year that Afghanistan was more expensive , the National Priorities Project said .
HOW MUCH MORE WILL THESE OPERATIONS COST ?
Obama announced in December he was adding 30,000 more U.S. troops to the Afghan war effort to join 68,000 already there fighting a resurgent Taliban .
Defense officials say he will shortly ask Congress for $ 33 billion to pay for the surge , when he sends lawmakers his budget request .
That would take care of 2010 .
Future expenses are a question mark , partly because troop levels are uncertain .
Obama says he wants to start withdrawing forces from Afghanistan in mid-2011 , but this will depend in part on conditions on the ground .
No deadline for leaving has been set .
Estimates of the cost per troop per year in Afghanistan vary from $ 500,000 to $ 1 million depending on whether expenditures on troop housing and equipment are included along with pay , food and fuel .
Medical costs for the injured and veterans ’ compensation balloon as time goes on .
In Iraq , the U.S. force is supposed to fall to 50,000 by the end of August , from some 115,000 last month .
The 50,000 can remain until the end of 2011 , under an agreement with Baghdad .
A year ago the Congressional Budget Office projected that additional costs for the Iraq and Afghanistan conflicts could be $ 867 billion over the next decade , if combined troop levels fall to 75,000 by about 2013 .
WHAT ARE THE POLITICAL RISKS ?
Obama ’s Democratic Party has the majority in Congress but is divided over the wisdom of continuing the Afghan war .
This means he needs Republicans to get congressional approval of the next tranche of funds sometime this spring .
He is expected to get that approval , in part because many lawmakers who do n’t approve of sending more combat troops are loath to cut off funds to soldiers in the field .
“ I think that in general the American people , while obviously this is very difficult financially for us , will continue to support the troops that are there and the Congress will reflect that , ” Senate Armed Services Committee Chairman Carl Levin said this week .
But with Americans tiring of war and getting more concerned about U.S. indebtedness , political pressures are expected to grow for winding down U.S. military operations and their costs in Iraq and Afghanistan .
Fighting and Entertainment Group today announced some solid additions to the card for their " DREAM.13 " show in Yokohama , Japan .
Two intriguing lightweight matchups , an old guard vs. new school welterweight clash , and a quintessentially J- MMA openweight bout join a previously announced featherweight scrap between Joachim Hansen and Bibiano Fernandes on the March 22nd slate .
In the 70kg ( 154 lbs. ) division , former EliteXC lightweight champ and recent Strikeforce signee K.J. Noons ( 7 - 2 ) will see his first MMA action since 2008 when he meets Brazilian Muay Thai specialist Andre " Dida " Amado ( 6 - 3 - 1 ) .
Noons has spent the two years since his split with EliteXC in the boxing ring , amassing a respectable 4 - 1 record in that time ( 11 - 2 overall ) , though he dropped his most high profile match - a unanimous decision loss to James Countryman last March .
Meanwhile , the last man to beat " Dida , " Deep ace Katsunori Kikuno ( 12 - 2 - 2 ) , faces Cage Force champion Kuniyoshi Hironaka ( 16 - 6 ) in a battle of two of Japan 's best lightweights .
Kikuno was last seen in Dream's " white cage " last October , where he was submitted in the second round by Eddie Alvarez despite a strong start .
Hironaka has reeled off four straight wins since dropping from welterweight , including one on that same October card against highly - touted Korean prospect Won-Sik Park .
In the second fight of his post - UFC campaign , Pride veteran Ryo Chonan ( 16 - 10 ) will take on Kyokushin practicioner Andrews Nakahara ( 2 - 1 ) at welterweight .
In his homecoming match last August in Deep , Chonan came out on top with a decision win over fellow ex-UFC'er Jutaro Nakao .
The still - green karate convert Nakahara was scheduled to fight Zelg Galesic in a " DREAM.12 " bout which never materialized ; the same fight had been rumored for this show .
Finally , Dream 's very own " Super Hulk " champion , Ikushisa Minowa ( 44 - 30 - 8 ) looks to extend his three - fight win streak against oversized opponents when he meets heavyweight also - ran Jimmy " The Titan " Ambriz ( 14 - 12 - 1 ) .

Most relevant to the day at hand , the post notes that Guinness — the draught version , not so much the stout — has fewer calories than regular beer in similar amounts , and only slightly more than light beer .
If mixers and liquor are more your thing , there are a few other suggestions on hand :
For starters , to chop your caloric intake , avoid these ( drinks ) :
( Note : all serving sizes standard ) Regular Beer ( 140 –180 calories )
Malt beverages ( Mike 's Hard , Bacardi , etc. ) ( 190 - 240 calories )
Rum and regular Coke ( ~350 calories )
Mudslide ( ~ 400 calories )
White Russian ( ~400 calories ) ....
And drink these instead : ... Light Beer ( 95 - 110 calories )
Guinness ( 12 oz = 125 calories )
Scotch , vodka , gin , or bourbon ( ~100 calories )
Rum and Diet Coke ( ~115 calories )
Tom Collins ( ~120 calories )
Sloe Gin Fizz ( ~120 calories )

IF REPUBLICANS are displeased with their image as the party of “ No ” , few of them have done much about it .
One notable exception is Paul Ryan , a congressman from Wisconsin whose “ Roadmap for America 's Future ” offers an ambitious alternative to the Democratic agenda .
Mr Ryan 's roadmap takes as its starting point the CBO 's long - term budget forecast .
By 2080 federal deficits are projected , if current policies continue , to grow to nearly 50 % of GDP , while debt held by the public would rise to over 700 % of the country 's annual output ( in reality , of course , America would face bankruptcy long before the debt hit such levels ) .
The red ink is driven by growth in entitlement spending , most of it on Medicare , the government 's health scheme for the elderly .
Mr Ryan 's plan seeks to tackle the deficits produced by the growing health and pension costs of an ageing population , while limiting government spending as a share of the economy .
He accomplishes the task by dint of a broad simplification of America 's tax code and health - care system .
The plan replaces the current tax exemptions for employer - provided health insurance with a refundable tax credit , while Medicare benefits would ultimately be set aside in favour of a system of vouchers for private insurance .
The aim is to invigorate the health - insurance market by drawing more people into it and by removing hidden subsidies .
Social Security ( pensions ) benefits would be cut back for today 's younger workers , who would then be allowed to divert a share of their payroll - tax contributions ( which go to finance Social Security ) into private retirement accounts .
In general , the CBO concludes , total benefit levels should be higher under the plan , but also somewhat less certain .
The income - tax code is cut down to two brackets , and corporate income taxes are replaced with a corporate consumption tax of 8.5 % .
Capital - gains taxes are eliminated entirely .
And Mr Ryan places a ten - year nominal freeze on non-defence discretionary spending ( meaning that the real value of spending declines over time , assuming there is inflation ) .
He caps federal government outlays at 19 % of GDP ; this year , they are running at around 25 % .
As promised , the plan ultimately moves the government budget into surplus and reduces the federal debt ( see chart ) .
And during the first ten years , according to the CBO 's analysis , the number of people enjoying health - care coverage should increase , thanks to the refundable health - care tax credit .
Mr Ryan 's scheme , which is committed to reducing the growth of government and increasing the role of markets in the social safety net , is the apotheosis of a conservative approach to fiscal sustainability .
It also has significant problems .
It achieves its huge health - care savings by indexing the tax credits and vouchers to a measure of inflation smaller than the estimated growth in health costs over recent decades .
Over time , this will mean that an increasing share of medical expenses is paid out of individuals ' pockets .
The CBO thinks this will probably lead to reduced consumption of health - care services and reduced access to advanced technology .
The balancing of the budget removes the crippling macroeconomic burden of debt , but in the meantime federal investments in transport , education and energy would have to be squeezed .
Not even a perfunctory attempt is made to cut America 's defence spending .
Mr Ryan is a Republican , after all .
He deserves credit for an honest and daring proposal .
Tellingly , his plan has faced criticism from both parties .
Republican leaders have been careful to distance themselves from the slashing of programmes dear to one of their core constituencies .
If nothing else , Mr Ryan has reminded everyone of the hard choices that will soon have to be made .

What ’s going at the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change ?
After a rash of stories about inaccurate data in the reports produced by the world ’s preeminent climate science research organization , Kevin Drum wonders what impact the recent scandals have had on public opinion .
The controversies over the IPCC ’s data have n’t challenged the fundamental agreement among the vast majority of scientific bodies that climate change is happening and caused in large part by human activity .
But they ’re feeding public distrust of climate science and science in general , largely because they ’ve provided plentiful ammunition for skeptics and climate change deniers .
And it ’s getting worse by the day .
The trouble for the IPCC started in November , with the so - called ClimateGate saga — the release of excerpts from emails between IPCC scientists that were used as evidence of insularity and secretiveness in the scientific community .
The vast majority of those emails were innocuous ; a thorough investigation found that while they showed scientists behaving badly , they did n’t discount the underlying science .
And Michael Mann , a Pennsylvania State University climatologist at the center of the email dispute , has been largely cleared of charges of scientific misconduct .
But the email incident has fueled skeptics , who are now picking apart the IPCC reports for any other evidence of misconduct .
While the fundamental conclusions about warming temperatures are well - vetted , it seems the IPCC has been less than thorough in verifying some of the subsidiary findings .
Indeed , specific regional impacts are among some of the most hotly contested questions for climate scientists .
And there seem to be a fair number of questionable claims , including :
The inclusion of inaccurate information about the decline of Himalayan glaciers .
The glaciers are still receding , but not as fast as the IPCC report stated .
More on that here .
There also appears to be inaccurate information on African crop failure — the report claims that global warming will reduce crop production by up to 50 percent by 2020 .
The claim was drawn from an 2003 policy paper that was not peer - reviewed .
This one is particularly troubling , as it was referenced in the influential Synthesis Report and has been cited in public statements by IPCC head Rajendra Pachauri and UN Secretary General Ban Ki-Moon .
Questions have also been raised over claims about sea - level rise in Holland .
The journal Nature reported last week that the IPCC has been flooded by criticism .
Following the deluge of bad PR , Robert Watson , chief scientist at the British environment ministry and the chair of the IPCC from 1997 to 2002 , warned last week that the IPCC needs to address these problems or risk losing all credibility .
It ’s clear that the IPCC needs to take significant action or face a collapse of public confidence in not just the IPCC as a scientific body , but climate science in general .
As atmospheric scientist Ralph J. Cicerone , president of the National Academy of Sciences , writes in this week ’s issue of the journal Science , “ My reading of the vast scientific literature on climate change is that our understanding is undiminished by this incident ; but it has raised concern about the standards of science and has damaged public trust in what scientists do . ”
Ciccerone notes that “ public opinion has moved toward the view that scientists often try to suppress alternative hypotheses and ideas and that scientists will withhold data and try to manipulate some aspects of peer review to prevent dissent . ”
He concludes , “ This view reflects the fragile nature of trust between science and society , demonstrating that the perceived misbehavior of even a few scientists can diminish the credibility of science as a whole . ”
As for what to do , he writes , “ It is essential that the scientific community work urgently to make standards for analyzing , reporting , providing access to , and stewardship of research data operational , while also establishing when requests for data amount to harassment or are otherwise unreasonable …
Failure to make research data and related information accessible not only impedes science , it also breeds conflicts . ”
Whether the IPCC will be receptive to such proposed changes is n’t yet clear .
As Andrew Revkin reported on his New York Times blog , Dot Earth , recently , the panel is facing pressure from the inside and outside to change some of its practices .
It may have to if it is to regain its position as the trusted scientific source on the science of climate change .

Joerg Resch at Kuppinger Cole points us to new research showing how social networks can be used in conjunction with browser leakage to provide accurate identification of users who think they are browsing anonymously .
Joerg writes :
Thorsten Holz , Gilbert Wondracek , Engin Kirda and Christopher Kruegel from Isec Laboratory for IT Security found a simple and very effective way to identify a person behind a website visitor without asking for any kind of authentication .
Identify in this case means : full name , adress , phone numbers and so on .
What they do , is just exploiting the browser history to find out , which social networks the user is a member of and to which groups he or she has subscribed within that social network .
The Practical Attack to De- Anonymize Social Network Users begins with what is known as “ history stealing ” .
Browsers do n’t allow web sites to access the user ’s “ history ” of visited sites .
But we all know that browsers render sites we have visited in a different color than sites we have not .
This is available programmatically through javascript by examining the a :visited style .
So malicious sites can play a list of URLs and examine the a :visited style to determine if they have been visited , and can do this without the user being aware of it .
This attack has been known for some time , but what is novel is its use .
The authors claim the groups in all major social networks are represented through URLs , so history stealing can be translated into “ group membership stealing ” .
This brings us to the core of this new work .
The authors have developed a model for the identification characteristics of group memberships – a model that will outlast this particular attack , as dramatic as it is .
The researchers have created a demonstration site that works with the European social network Xing .
Joerg tried it out and , as you can see from the table at left , it identified him uniquely – although he had done nothing to authenticate himself .
He says ,
“ Here is a screenshot from the self - test I did with the de-anonymizer described in my last post .
I´m a member in 5 groups at Xing , but only active in just 2 of them .
This is already enough to successfully de-anonymize me , at least if I use the Google Chrome Browser .
Using Microsoft Internet Explorer did not lead to a result , as the default security settings ( I use them in both browsers ) seem to be stronger .
That ´s weird ! ”
Since I ’m not a user of Xing I ca n’t explore this first hand .
Joerg goes on to ask if history - stealing is a crime ?
If it ’s not , how mainstream is this kind of analysis going to become ?
What is the right legal framework for considering these issues ?
One thing for sure : this kind of demonstration , as it becomes widely understood , risks profoundly changing the way people look at the Internet .
To return to the idea of minimal disclosure for the browser , why do sites we visit need to be able to read the a :visited attribute ?
This should again be thought of as “ fingerprinting ” , and before a site is able to retrieve the fingerprint , the user must be made aware that it opens the possibility of being uniquely identified without authentication .

For the second time this year an investigation has been started into why a Prince George 's County Fire / EMS Department crew pronounced a person dead who was still alive .
This afternoon PGFD Chief Spokesman Mark Brady released a statement confirming that two career paramedics assigned to Medic 846 ( Largo ) have been placed on limited public contact status after the crew 's actions at a home in the 8600 block of Glenarden Parkway in Glenarden " resulted in a delay of care " .
Related feature Dead Wrong Practically every few months , a tale of someone wrongly presumed dead by paramedics or EMTs appears in the news .
According to Brady , the call came in around noon today from the Glenarden Police Department indicating there was a possible dead man inside the home .
Brady said the medic crew arrived on the scene within four minutes and concurred with police the elderly man was dead .
According to the press release , " At about 1:30 PM , an official from the County Police Department 's Forensic Services summoned the Fire / EMS Department to return to the scene as the adult male was displaying signs that he was alive .
A different EMS unit arrived shortly thereafter and transported the patient to an area hospital . "
At last word the man was still alive .
Sources not authorized to speak publicly about the investigation say it is being investigated why the crew spent what appeared to be little time in their initial assessment of the patient , and possibly did n’t follow state protocols for determining if a person is dead .
Other sources indicate there is a question whether the medics just took the word of the police officers and possibly never went into the room with the patient .
One of the paramedics is described as “ seasoned ” while the other more recently became a medic .
The medical protocol issues will be covered in what the department calls a quality assurance review .
According to Brady , the medics have already been interviewed by PGFD ’s medical director .
The press release indicates there is a also a review by the Office of Professional Standards .
That review will cover whether general orders and standard operating procedures were followed .
Brady says , " Actions of personnel are taken very seriously by the Fire / EMS Department .
We will ensure a complete and through review and if warranted take whatever corrective action is called for to avoid any reoccurrence . "
This is the second such incident for PGFD in a little more than two months .
STATter911.com reported that on January 24 a man whose vehicle crashed and burned on I - 95 in Laurel was initially pronounced dead on the scene .
As crews helped police remove the body a short time later , it was determined the man was alive .
A quality review was also initiated in that case .
While Mark Brady says that state law requires those reviews to be confidential , he can confirm a volunteer from Station 849 ( Laurel Rescue Squad ) received remedial training following the I - 95 incident .
Brady tells STATter911.com that there were no inquiries from reporters about today 's incident .
Prince George 's County officials say they released the information in an effort to be transparent about issues involving the service the department provides .

Contrary to popular belief and utter media ignorance , Perl does n't just offer several powerful web frameworks ( I 'm totally in love with Sebastian Riedel 's Mojo ) , it also has extremely powerful and underestimated GUI and graphic 's bindings .
Recently I toyed a little with the java - based " Processing " and while I was cursing several Java classes I was somehow too stupid to get up and running , I realized that I could have all the shiny and pretty shapes and animations in Perl the easy way .
( What 's missing is the overall well - rounded integration of Pretty Perl , sugarcoated with a nice GUI . )
Here 's a little round - up of Perl all being pretty :
A reminder to everyone who forgot :
The extremely powerful and flexible Image Magick still comes with the Perl API Perl Magick .
Use it .
If you need inspiration what to do with all the bitmap goodness , check out Mac - based " Pixelmator " which is a showcase of adding a GUI to Image Magick and make it an extremely impressive bitmap editor .
( Why did n't the Open Source world do it with Gtk ? )
Which leads us to the most impressive work the GtkPerl team has done over the years .
Gtk2 Perl is a must - install .
Another family member of GtkPerl is Cairo , the SVG library which also can produce PDF output and draw pretty things . ;)
Everyone wanting a basic browser written in Perl to get a look on Webkit - based rendering , can install Gtk2 :: WebKit which is a fully fledged Webkit view .
If you have Flash installed correctly , it even does Flash out of the box .
( I put a little example in my pretty Perl github )
If you 're more of a KDE - kind - of - person : Yes , there is someone working on a new QtPerl version to support Qt / KDE 4.x .
Another really impressive library is " Clutter " .
Based on OpenGL and Cairo and that way bringing together the best of all worlds , Clutter can act as a canvas to be used in canvas - lacking Gtk .
The Clutter module awaits your download .
While we 're at it :
Yes , there are Perl bindings to OpenGL - a project named POGL .
If you 're interested in the usal speed competitions between programming languages , read the POGL benchmark carefully .
POGL is also available on CPAN
Another interesting library is libaosd which essentially allows no -fuss drawing directly on the screen .
Of course , there 's a X11 : : Aosd module on CPAN .
If you need the average run -of - the - mill canvas to use with Gtk , today 's choice ( besides Clutter ) is the Goo : : Canvas module on CPAN .
Last , but not least - if you 're planning to re-write OLPC's " Sugar " desktop in Perl , you 'll have to get the X11 modules on CPAN There 's the traditional X11:: Protocol and I just found a new X11:: Xlib module
If you are more into classics : Yes , TkPerl still exists .
And I totally forgot the Wx bindings for Perl which many people prefer over native widget sets .

With influential proponents recently calling for a newly regulated world wide web , we got a preview of how that might look this past weekend after both Infowars.com and Prison Planet.com were completely blocked to many Internet users in New Zealand .
The block was only removed early this morning following a raft of complaints after both websites were unavailable on many ISP ’s since Friday .
As the New Zealand based InfoNews website reported yesterday , both of Alex Jones ’ flagship websites were blocked by ISPs using Asia Netcom for their international internet traffic .
It is important to stress that we receive emails on a weekly basis informing us that our websites have been blocked as “ hate speech ” or “ offensive material ” at Internet cafes , libraries , transport hubs , workplaces , and numerous other buildings not only in the United States but across the world .
The censorship is being done at the ISP level , so whereas some people in a particular country will still have access , others will be blocked .
As we reported in 2008 , London ’s St. Pancras International , which millions of people traveling across mainland Europe pass through every year , completely blocks Prison Planet , Infowars and even more mainstream political websites as a matter of course .
In 2007 , MySpace admitted their policy to censor and filter out posts containing links to the Prison Planet.com website , adding that the MySpace server automatically blocks such information .
The social networking giant , as well as others such as Facebook , periodically block links to Alex Jones material and only revoke such filters when people complain .
In 2005 , Time Warner subscribers from New York to California reported that their access to Infowars and Prison Planet had been blocked due to “ hate speech , ” before their access was restored .
UK ISP Tiscali also blocked the websites following the 7/7 London bombings in 2005 .
Infowars ’ social network was also blocked by libraries in the U.S. in 2008 using Safesquid and Google filtering software .
We receive numerous reports every single week of Alex Jones ’ websites being blocked by ISPs and by filtering software in public buildings .
“ An avid fan of Infowars.com and a 9/11 truth activist , Jeff Mitchell , reported on Saturday that he contacted his ISP , Orcon , to establish what was causing the block , and was advised by a computer technician who did a trace route , that the break in traffic to the two websites was found to be occurring at Asia Netcom ’s router in Sydney , ” stated the report .
The websites were blocked on every ISP that relied on Asia Netcom as its upstream provider , including Woosh , Telecom , Slingshot and Orcon .
According to Duncan Blair , Head of Brand and Communications at Orcon , access to content hosted on the Limelight content distribution network , including Infowars.com and Prison Planet.com , was blocked as a result of a “ technical issue ” .
[ efoods ]
“ I ’m the person who half - made this story possible by calling my ISP , ” wrote Jeff Mitchell in a comment on Prison Planet .
“ Just want to report that infowars.com is now working for me , even though it was down all weekend !
We complained to ISPs and they were “ very concerned ” about censorship ; that , combined with this article on prisonplanet could very well have been the reason for us regaining access . ”
Whether the problem was down to technical issues or deliberate censorship , the fact that ISP ’s can selectively block certain websites at the flick of a switch gives us a frightening preview of what a Chinese - style government regulated Internet would look like , which is exactly what influential insiders are calling for .
The move to impose centralized government control and regulation of the free Internet has accelerated over the past 12 months .
Last week , Time Magazine enthusiastically jumped on the bandwagon to back Microsoft executive Craig Mundie ’s call for Internet licensing , as authorities push for a system even more stifling than in Communist China , where only people with government permission would be allowed to express free speech .
During a recent conference at the Davos Economic Forum , Mundie , chief research and strategy officer for Microsoft , told fellow globalists at the summit that the Internet needed to be policed by means of introducing licenses similar to drivers licenses – in other words government permission to use the web .
Internet censorship bills currently working their way into law in the UK , Australia and the U.S. legislate for government powers to restrict and filter any website that it deems to be undesirable for public consumption .
In Italy , new rules to be imposed by government decree force anyone who wishes to upload a video to the web to get permission from the government ’s Communications Ministry .
Power brokers in the White House have openly declared war on free speech and targeted Internet “ conspiracy theorists ” as the main threat to their agenda .
In a 2008 white paper , Obama ’s Regulation Czar Cass Sunstein called for the government to tax or even ban outright political opinions of which it disapproved .
On page 14 of Sunstein ’s January 2008 white paper entitled “ Conspiracy Theories , ” the man who is now Obama ’s head of information technology in the White House proposed that each of the following measures “ will have a place under imaginable conditions ” according to the strategy detailed in the essay .
1 ) Government might ban conspiracy theorizing .
2 ) Government might impose some kind of tax , financial or otherwise , on those who disseminate such theories .
The ominous spectacle of major free speech websites going dark in supposedly democratic countries is a shocking portend of what the establishment wants to impose on a widespread basis .
Only by screaming bloody murder in defense of the last true outpost of free speech – the Internet – and threatening boycotts and aggressive public relations campaigns can we counter the insidious move to silence the only remaining open forum of lawful dissent .

Gary Coleman suffered an apparent seizure on the set of " The Insider " on Friday and was taken to a Los Angeles area hospital .
Fellow panelist Dr. Drew Pinsky , who was sitting next to him at the time , administered care until paramedics arrived .
( Note to self : If possible , always make sure Dr. Drew is nearby in case of emergency . )
It 's not the only recent medical setback for the Utah - based actor , who in January suffered a seizure requiring hospitalization while he was in L.A. for a meeting regarding removing full - frontal nudity from a film in which he stars .
Coleman , who is 41 , suffers from a congenital kidney disease and requires frequent dialysis , which he has said he prefers not to discuss .
" The Insider " says it wo n't release footage of the incident , E ! Online reports .
Coleman had appeared before on an " Insider " panel that aired Feb. 17 , angrily defending himself against questions regarding his relationship with his wife and allegations of domestic violence .
In that expletive - peppered appearance , Coleman stormed off the set .
Civilizations grow in complexity given the right circumstances .
And all too often they end up collapsing .
History is replete with examples .
Joseph Tainter , among others , has examined collapse from the standpoint of decreasing marginal return on investment in increasing complexity , which he posits is the most common factor in collapsed societies .
The key question one must ask is :
What critical circumstance ( if there is one factor above all others ) enables a society to grow in complexity in the first place ?
If we find an answer to that question we may also find what causes the decrease in marginal returns as complexity increases .
This is certainly a growing concern for our modern civilizations .
I advance a systems theoretical and principled thesis , below , that puts the increased flow of energy as the key enabler of increases in complexity .
And I examine what we might expect from declines in that flow rate when sources are depleted .
Joseph A. Tainter 's The Collapse of Complex Societies
If you have n't read Tainter 's 1988 ( some would say prescient ) book , The Collapse of Complex Societies ( Cambridge University Press ) , or if you have n't read it recently , you would do well to do so at your earliest convenience .
[ Also see a speech he gave the 94th Annual Meeting of Ecological Society of America , posted on The Oil Drum , here . ]
I had the great good fortune to meet Joe at the Second Annual Biophysical Economics Meeting in Syracuse , NY this last October .
He came to give the plenary talk in which he connected energy return on energy investment with his theory of how evolving complexity in societies figures into collapses , when they occur .
I then stopped over in Logan Utah on my way home to Washington state and spent some quality time talking with him that evening over a single malt scotch ( a label I had never heard of before - very smokey ! )
So I thought I 'd dig out my copy of Collapse when I got home and re-read it .
I remembered not being quite as interested in the details of Roman and Mayan societies in the way an archeologist would be ( Joe 's credentials ) and had probably skimmed too much .
His lecture at Syracuse piqued my interest now that I know a bit more about what seems to be going on in our modern societies in the post - peak oil world .
Much to my chagrin I could n't find my copy .
Actually I vaguely remembered having borrowed it from the library ( I was n't rich enough in 1988 to have much of a personal library ) , so I quickly got it from Amazon , along with a few other classics on the topic , and read it again .
This time with more informed , if not fresher eyes .
Joe 's thesis boils down to this :
Societies evolve greater organizational and technical complexity to solve social problems that arise due to external forces or population pressures or overuse of natural resources , etc. , and at some point , the marginal beneficial returns ( problems solved ) begin to decline leading to lowered margins of error for dealing with possible catastrophic impacts .
Societies collapse when increasing complexity no longer has a payoff and something else bad happens .
As I read this anew I thought about other areas that I have been developing some expertise in , namely the evolution of complexity in dynamical systems ( from general systems science ) under the influence of the flow of high potential energy .
I felt inspired to write more about that since I think there are some general principles that we could use to decipher what is going on in the world today and have some sense of what to expect from tomorrow .
Energy Flow and the Evolution of Internal Complexity
The term complexity has become somewhat problematic over the last several decades because of the difficulty researchers and authors have had in coming to some kind of consensus on its meaning .
Of course it is like pornography , right ?
We know it when we see it .
I have attempted to provide a more concrete treatment of the subjects of complexity and its evolution elsewhere , so I wo n't go into that in detail here .
Readers who want a more precise definition should take a look at those works .
For our purposes a brief summary follows .
There are really two kinds of complexity , potential and realized .
Potential complexity comes from the a priori existence in a semi-closed system of myriad raw components , both in absolute numbers and in types .
Types , here , refers to components that have different personalities or interaction potentials with other component types .
The more different types and interaction potentials there are , the more realized complexity might obtain within the boundaries of the system .
Realized complexity is what most of us think about when we come across something that already has organization and appears to be functioning through myriad actual interactions among the components .
When we see multiple kinds of arrangements of components that appear to be regular and strongly interacting , we apprehend the system as complex .
We can view a system from outside , say when we run into a complex piece of machinery ( perhaps looking inside to see the workings ) , or from the inside , as when we try to grasp the complex nature of our own society .
Either way , realized complexity is characterized by organization , stability of interactions , many kinds of interactions and often recognizable subsystems , which may be , themselves , complex .
A good example of a complex system with complex subsystems is a living cell , especially a protist such as a Paramecium .
A central question of the evolution of organization asks :
How does an unorganized collection of components ( potential complexity ) actually develop over time into an organized , functioning ( realized complexity ) system ?
This question lies at the heart of the still somewhat mysterious ( though not mystical ) issue of the origin of life on Earth .
Life emerged from non-living components perhaps some 2 to 3 billion years ago .
And once the basic formula of complex metabolism in cells developed , life proceeded to evolve further , eventually producing simple multi-cellular organisms , and then , in a much shorter time frame , to us .
Harold Morowitz ( Energy Flow in Biology , 1968 , Academic Press ) , following closely on the heels of Erwin Schrödinger , who famously asked the seminal question , " What is life ? " , provided an important insight into the nature of evolution of organization in semi-closed systems .
He demonstrated that when energy of the right kind flows from a source of high potential , through the system , and exits at a lower potential ( heat ) , that work is accomplished within the component milieu and structures obtain .
He coined the phrase made famous by Stuart Brand on the back cover of the Last Whole Earth Catalog , below the famous picture of the Earth taken from the moon : " The flow of energy through a system acts to organize that system . "
Morowitz was working on molecular organization in an attempt to be more precise about the origin of that organization in natural processes .
He detailed quite nicely the way in which photons of the right frequency could enter at one point in a semi-closed system ( being closed to material inputs or outputs ) , be absorbed by simple molecular or atomic components in which electrons were thus excited and new bonding arrangements could occur .
Energy that ended up in thermal modes would tend to excite molecules at the entry end of the system and cause material cycling ( convection ) to organize the molecules dynamically .
Thus both structure and motion ensue from the influx of the right photons .
He went on to analyze things like the information flow due to changes in structure and function , important to our understanding of life .
As any good disciplinarian scientist , he felt uncomfortable with too much generalization from his basic insights ( personal communication ) .
But I am not constrained by good disciplinarian constraints since I like to find generalizations that do seem to apply across disciplinary boundaries .
In this case I argue that the energy flow principle is , indeed , quite general and a good explanation for the evolution of organization and complexity in all systems , not just molecular in nature .
When Morowitz says " acts to organize a system " I would amend this to " enables the organization of a system to emerge " .
The energy flow does n't so much cause a specific organization to evolve as it is simply a necessary condition for any organization to emerge .
In fact any given system of some nominal potential complexity might evolve in any number of ways toward higher realized complexity .
The energy flow supplies the needed potential for work to be accomplished .
Here , by work , I mean all manner of reconfiguration of matter as new associations and movements are enacted .
Work is what energy enables , but exactly what work depends on what materials are in the neighborhood at the same time the energy is available .
For that we have to rely on something that resembles chance but in fact is itself inherently organized , and that is chaos .
Ilya Prigogine , at about the same time that Morowitz was wrestling with the internal mechanics of organization evolution , had an equally useful insight into the nature of systems in which there was no apparent organization of components , but tended to evolve organization over time .
He called these ( what I have labelled potentially complex ) systems as chaotic .
On close examination one finds that such systems are not truly random .
They actually do have some kind of structure , like a waterfall ; the pathway of the falling water , in bulk , is readily predicted , or the boundaries of the waterfall are observable , but the fate of any given molecule of water as it approaches the fall is completely unpredictable .
Turbulence in a stream is another example of chaotic systems .
If you ever stare at a rushing stream you will see that eddies appear quite regularly at certain points due to the underlying rock formations .
But you can't predict with any accuracy when an eddy will appear ( or even exactly where within some general boundary ) .
Chaos in a semi-closed system imposes some kind of overarching organization , generally limiting the kinds of interactions that can happen .
It is inherent in Morowitz 's convective cycles ; organization of flows and possible sorting ( say by weight differences ) of components lead to higher probabilities of certain interactions over just any arbitrary ones , a concept touched on by Dan Dennett in Darwin 's Dangerous Idea , ( 1995 , Simon & Schuster ) which he called " forced moves " .
Thus , the argument that order ( or I prefer organization ) can emerge from chaos ( the concept led Prigogine to get a Nobel Prize in Physics ! )
The key , however , remains the flow of the right kinds and amounts of energy through the system .
Solar influx through the Earth 's atmosphere and hydrosphere power a large majority of organizing work on the surface of the planet , with contributions from geothermal and tidal forces .
And the Earth went from a hot ball with poisonous gasses swirling around it to the blue green dot that graced the back of the Last Whole Earth Catalog .
Realized complexity obtains from the on - going pumping of energy flows through the system .
Over a sufficiently long time , and assuming there is a steady - state flow of those energies , components tend to organize and reorganize generating increasing complexity at a given level .
Evolution is the emergence of some new subsystem , at that level , followed by active selection for or against that subsystem by the rest of the whole system .
After a while , the fittest subsystems come to dominate even while chaotic variations still give rise to new variants .
Occasionally a new variant is ' more ' fit under the general circumstances and it survives .
When these subsystems are , themselves , capable of replication , as a living system is , then the newer variety will displace the older ones .
And then , at times , with the continuing flow of energy in which there are energies not completely used for work processes ( they just pass through as it were ) , the subsystems will have a tendency to discover yet new interactions with one another that give rise to a new level of organization .
This is exactly the case when single celled organisms evolved into multi-cellular ones .
New econiches are just organizational gaps where new energies are made available and a new subsystem can exploit those energies to develop new structures .
In one sense we see complexity at a given level go down when this happens .
Individual cells in a multi- cellular organism can begin to specialize , thus not needing to maintain all of the internal metabolic mechanisms for doing everything themselves .
They can get some of what they need from nearby cells that have specialized to produce that particular product .
Cells became simpler while organisms became more complex .
This process gives rise to hierarchies of organization .
In general , the net realized complexity of the whole goes up .
More energies that formerly may have escaped untransformed by work to heat are now used for new work .
Some of those previously unused energies end up captured in new structures ( conformational energy ) as the whole system develops greater realized complexity .
Multi-cellular organisms continued to evolve up the phylogenetic tree of life and way out on one of the newest branches of that tree sits an ape that has a spectacular brain and something we call second order consciousness .
They are conscious of being conscious .
They have abstract communications both spoken and written .
And they start to exploit all kinds of previously inaccessible energies to supplement their normal biological food .
They evolve complex social interactions because they have an increasing wealth of energy from these external sources .
The potential complexity for these beasts is staggering .
And they proceeded to evolve as many as they could given the chaotic constraints on their clustering .
A new level of organization appeared as societies .
Culture captures the degree of complexity , but look at what happens for individuals .
Just as cells in multi- cellular organisms could become ' simpler ' by specializing , individual humans could simplify by specializing in the work that they performed .
As they did so the total realized complexity of society increased but the life of an individual tended to become less complex .
At least for a while .
This brings us full circle to Joe Tainter 's point .
At any given flow rate of energy available to do work , a social system reaches the maximum complexity that solves problems for the system as a whole .
In Morowitz 's model , we need to ask , what happens when you reduce the flow of energy through an organized system ?
The reason this question is crucial is that that is exactly what is happening to our human societies .
The peak of oil production represents something even more pernicious to society , the peak of net energy to do useful work in our economy ( see : " Economic Dynamics and the Real Danger " ) .
What happens to Morowitz 's systems when energy flow declines ?
The simple answer is they go back to chaos .
Tainter documents how societies that reach the limits of marginal returns on increased complexity and then something bad happens .
They collapse .
What about a world in which we have ' artificially ' increased the flow of energy by using fossil fuels ( far above real - time solar influx ) so that we can evolve much higher orders of realized complexity than can be sustained once those fossil fuels start to decline ?
Have we not reached our point of maximum complexity where every investment in more complexity brings less actual return in benefits ?
And might it not be due to the fact that we have reach some kind of maximum flow of energy ?
That is the problem we face as a global civilization .
We are running short on oil and as a consequence we are going to find it harder to extract other energy and mineral resources .
Our net energy is already in decline and that is at the root of the global economic problems we are seeing .
The simple truth is that you cannot have a growing economy when the basis of all economic wealth production is in decline .
You cannot make up the difference with efficiency gains ( and in reality there really are n't many actual efficiency gains to be made ) .
The scope of energy flow due to fossil sunlight is just unbelievably huge .
Neither will we make up the difference with alternative , sustainable sources ( like real - time solar influx ) because we can't build out the scale of infrastructure that would be required in any reasonable time frame .
We can only start simplifying our societies and giving up the many discretionary expenditures of energy that we currently enjoy without much thought .
We can learn to once again live on real - time solar influx via our food raising systems .
And even then we are talking about an ability to support only a small fraction of the current population .
Ironically the simplification of society involves the increasing complexity of individual lives .
What this means in practice is that each individual must start to become more of a generalist in terms of the functions that support life .
Everyone will have to become a food grower !
Believe it or not that is n't simple !
Knowing how to grow your own nutrients is actually quite complicated and will demand a whole new set of cognitive skills .
I suppose it will be hard to see the similarities in the dynamics of molecules , or cells , and those of human societies for many people .
It is a very abstract viewpoint .
It might seem inhuman !
But if there really is a correspondence , a general law of complexity evolution based on energy flow then we might be wise to pay attention .
Small adjustments from the Bike Whisperer can make big differences to comfort and speed without breaking the bank
More power to your pedal with a quick and easy bike fit over a cup of coffee
If there is one thing us cyclists love more than cycling , it 's upgrading .
Whether we 're seeking greater comfort , less weight or more speed , buying new bits is the accepted route .
But , in real world cycling , do they really achieve anything ?
Or is there a better way to spend money if you want actual results ?
I pose the question because , for around £ 100 , you could have an upgrade that promises to make you faster , more comfortable and even protect you from injury : a bike fit .
The idea is simple ; you visit an expert fitter who adjusts your saddle , handlebars , shoes and riding style , all to get the most out of you and your cycle .
I took a trip to The Bike Whisperer in west London to see if a few hours of tweaking could change my riding for the better .
Co-founder Scherrit first makes me a cup of coffee at his home - cum - workshop and asks me what I ride , and how often .
It 's informal , the coffee is good , and his dog is friendly .
This does not , as I imagined it would , feel like a clinical examination .
We also discuss my health and whether I have any recurring problems while on the bike ( I do .
My left knee : it feels considerably older than the rest of me ) .
Then , consultation complete , he clamps my bike on to a turbo trainer – a kind of rolling road for bikes .
Scherrit is all over the room , watching me pedal from all angles ( even , oddly , from underneath ) , telling me to speed up , slow down or stop .
First he watches the angle of my feet as they spin , then makes tiny adjustments to the cleats in my shoes .
Previously my right knee had always felt strong , as though it was describing a perfect circle , but my left felt weak and wobbled from side to side .
Incredibly , after just a few tweaks my left knee feels more planted and stable than it ever has before on the bike - and the only downside is the embarrassment of having my feet up on a stranger 's lap while he moves my cleats .
I also have my knuckles rapped when I admit that I never warm up .
Doing this should improve things even further , I 'm told .
Once my pedals , shoes and saddle – what Scherrit calls the " motor " of the bike – are fixed , he turns his attention to my handlebars .
They always felt slightly too far away , which placed a lot of weight on my arms , but after another tiny , barely noticeable adjustment , this problem also fades away .
What is impressive is not just how quickly these issues are resolved , but by how small an adjustment .
My bike looks no different to when we began just over two hours earlier – each change is fractional , tiny , insignificant – but somehow my bike just fits better now .
Everything is now placed exactly where my limbs naturally want to be , the bike handles better and I can get more power down onto the pedals .
But the best part is that my knee does n't sting .
Placebo , perhaps , but this was the best £ 95 that I 've ever spent on a bike , and I 'm sent home with a sheet of measurements that will let me adjust my other bikes to be just as comfortable .
What losing an hour 's sleep really does to your children
How many hours ' sleep does your child get a night ?
However much it is , it 's likely to be less than you had as a child .
While many parents - thanks to baby gurus - obsess about babies ' sleep , this tails off after the nursery years .
The result is that modern children , from primary school age right up to secondary , get on average an hour less sleep each night than they did 30 years ago .
Research shows that half of all pre-teens are getting less than seven hours of sleep a night
Research suggests that half of all pre-teens get less than seven hours ' sleep on weekday nights , and only slightly more than six hours when they reach secondary school .
Why is this happening ?
The common 21st - century afflictions : over - scheduling of activities , burdensome homework , lax bedtimes and TVs and mobile phones in the bedroom .
Some scientists claim sleep problems during formative years can cause permanent changes in brain structure
Plus parental guilt : home from work late , wanting time with the children , reluctant to play the tyrant by ordering them to bed .
Until now , we could ignore the lost hour - if we were even aware it existed - because we did not know its true cost to children .
But using newly developed technological and statistical tools , sleep scientists have been able to isolate and measure its impact .
Because children 's brains are a work in progress until the age of 21 , and much of that work is done while asleep , this lost hour appears to have an impact on children it simply does n't have on adults .
The surprise is not merely that sleep matters - but how much it matters .
Not just to academic performance and emotional stability , but to seemingly unrelated phenomena , such as the obesity epidemic and the rise of attention deficit disorder .
Some scientists claim sleep problems during formative years can cause permanent changes in brain structure .
It 's even possible that many of the hallmark characteristics of being a teenager - moodiness , depression and binge drinking - are symptoms of chronic sleep deprivation .
Some scientists claim lack of sleep can dramatically affect the brain in the future
A few years ago , Dr Avi Sadeh at Tel Aviv University sent 77 third and fifth year pupils home with instructions to go to bed earlier or stay up later for three nights .
Each child was given an actigraph - a wristwatch - like device that allowed researchers to see how much sleep they were getting .
The team found that the first group managed to get 30 minutes more sleep a night .
The other group got 31 minutes less .
After the third night , a researcher tested the children using a computerised version of an IQ test .
Dr Sadeh discovered that a slightly sleepy fifth former performed in class like a third - former - the loss of just one hour 's sleep is equivalent to the loss of two years of cognitive maturation and development .
Dr Sadeh 's findings are consistent with other researchers ' work - which point to the academic consequences of small sleep differences .
With the benefit of MRI scans , researchers are starting to understand exactly how sleep loss impairs a child 's brain .
Tired children can't remember what they just learned , for instance , because their brain cells lose their ' plasticity ' , becoming incapable of forming new connections necessary to encode a memory .
A different mechanism causes children to be inattentive in class .
Sleep loss debilitates the body 's ability to extract glucose from the bloodstream .
Without this , one part of the brain suffers more than the rest - the prefrontal cortex , which is responsible for what 's known as Executive Function - orchestrating your thoughts to fulfil a goal and perceiving the consequences of your actions .
A tired brain gets stuck on a wrong answer and can't come up with a more creative solution , repeatedly returning to the answer it already knows is wrong .
Both these mechanisms weaken a child 's capacity to learn during the day .
But the most exciting science concerns what the brain is up to when a child is asleep .
A child 's capacity to learn at school is vastly diminished if they are tired
Dr Matthew Walker , an academic from California , explains that during sleep the brain shifts what it learned that day to more efficient storage regions of the brain .
Each stage of sleep plays its own unique role in capturing memories .
For example , studying a foreign language requires learning vocabulary , remembering new sounds and motor skills to enunciate the new word .
The vocabulary is processed by one area of the brain early in the night during slow - wave sleep , a deep slumber without dreams .
Meanwhile , memories that are emotionally laden get processed during REM , or dreaming sleep .
Children 's sleep is different in terms of its quality from adult sleep because they spend more than 40 per cent of it in slowwave stage ( adults spend just
This is why a good night 's sleep is so important to children for long - term learning .
But perhaps most fascinating is the way emotions associated with a memory affect where it gets processed .
Negative memories get processed by one area of the brain , the amygdala ; positive or neutral memories get processed by another , the hippocampus .
Sleep deprivation hits the hippocampus harder than the amygdala .
The result is that sleep - deprived people fail to recall pleasant memories , yet remember gloomy memories very well .
And what of the hidden role sleep plays in the obesity epidemic ?
In the past three decades , childhood obesity has tripled .
For a long time , we all focused on one culprit - television .
The connection to obesity seemed so obvious that few people thought it even needed to be supported scientifically .
But here 's the fascinating thing : researcher Elizabeth Vandewater at the University of Texas found that obese children watch no more TV than thin children .
In fact , while obesity has increased exponentially since the Seventies , children watch only seven more minutes of TV a day .
All the studies point the same way : children who sleep less are fatter than those who sleep more
While they do average a half - hour of video games and internet surfing on top of television viewing , the leap in obesity began in 1980 , before home video games and the invention of the web .
So something other than television is making children fatter .
Five years ago , already aware of an association between sleep apnoea and diabetes , Dr Eve Van Cauter , a sleep researcher , discovered a ' neuroendocrine cascade ' that links sleep to obesity .
Sleep loss increases the hormone ghrelin , which signals hunger , and reduces leptin , which suppresses appetite .
It also elevates the stress hormone cortisol , which stimulates your body to make fat .
Human growth hormone is also disrupted - normally secreted as a single big pulse at the beginning of sleep , it is essential for the breakdown of fat .
It 's drilled into us that we need to be more active to lose weight .
So it confuses us to hear that a key to staying thin is to spend more time doing the most sedentary inactivity humanly possible - sleep .
Yet this is what scientists are finding .
All the studies point the same way : children who sleep less are fatter than those who sleep more .
How sleep impacts on hormones is an entirely different way of explaining what makes people fat or thin - we normally think of weight gain as a straightforward calories consumed / calories burned equation .
But even by that familiar formula , the relation of sleep to weight makes sense .
While few calories are being burned in bed , at least a child is not eating .
In addition , children who do n't sleep well are often too tired to exercise .
So the net calorie burn after a good night 's rest is higher .
Most of us have coped on too little sleep for years and managed to get by .
But given this new research , when it comes to our children 's developing brains , are we willing to take the risk ?

Beer Silicon Against Osteoporosis
I know how dutiful you all are about your health and I 'm sure many of you will do the responsible thing and drink beer for your bones .
A new study suggests that beer is a significant source of dietary silicon , a key ingredient for increasing bone mineral density .
Researchers from the Department of Food Science & Technology at the University of California , Davis studied commercial beer production to determine the relationship between beer production methods and the resulting silicon content , concluding that beer is a rich source of dietary silicon .
Details of this study are available in the February issue of the Journal of the Science of Food and Agriculture , published by Wiley - Blackwell on behalf of the Society of Chemical Industry .
" The factors in brewing that influence silicon levels in beer have not been extensively studied " said Charles Bamforth , lead author of the study .
" We have examined a wide range of beer styles for their silicon content and have also studied the impact of raw materials and the brewing process on the quantities of silicon that enter wort and beer . "
Silicon is present in beer in the soluble form of orthosilicic acid ( OSA ) , which yields 50 % bioavailability , making beer a major contributor to silicon intake in the Western diet .
According to the National Institutes of Health ( NIH ) , dietary silicon ( Si ) , as soluble OSA , may be important for the growth and development of bone and connective tissue , and beer appears to be a major contributor to Si intake .
Based on these findings , some studies suggest moderate beer consumption may help fight osteoporosis , a disease of the skeletal system characterized by low bone mass and deterioration of bone tissue .
They tested 100 commercial beers .
Anyone have access to this journal and wants to tell us which beers are best ?
The lighter beers are better .
The researchers examined a variety of raw material samples and found little change in the silicon content of barley during the malting process .
The majority of the silicon in barley is in the husk , which is not affected greatly during malting .
The malts with the higher silicon contents are pale colored which have less heat stress during the malting process .
The darker products , such as the chocolate , roasted barley and black malt , all have substantial roasting and much lower silicon contents than the other malts for reasons that are not yet known .
Partly for the sake of my bones I also take vitamin D , calcium and biweekly high potency vitamin K ( as K2 fwiw ) .

Repeat after me , please : Wednesday , February 24th , a day Washington will never forget .
And introducing . . .
THE GET THE JOB DONE BRIGADE
This Brigade is all of us .
We all owe it our children , grandchildren , and to President Obama to participate on 2/24 .
History will not be kind to us if we sit this one out .
Not even one of us can sit and do nothing on 2/24 .
This means we put aside our differences and we fight together and collectively for Health Care Reform .
And as we approach what I believe will be an historic day , February 24th , 2010 , I want to tell you why we need everybody , not just the dependable worker bees .
There are over 200,000 people registered to use Daily Kos and rumor has it , many days close to 1,000,0000 people come here for news and information .
I 'm one of the relatively old people ( in more ways than I care to think about ) on Daily Kos .
When I first came , round about 2004 , people said to me , what 's Daily Kos ?
I told them back then , that what you read on Daily Kos , might get noticed by the traditional media oh , maybe two weeks later .
I said to all these hopelessly uninformed people , if you really want to know what 's happening -- before it happens , do yourself a favor , and add Daily Kos to you Favorite or Bookmark list .
Why is this story even more relevant and important today ?
Here 's why .
It 's up to all of you to send a Tsunami of outrage to Washington on Wednesday , February 24th .
If you do your job , you 'll be the wind beneath the sails of Barack Obama , the man we elected to make healthcare for all Americans a reality .
President Obama needs us to help him get the job done .
We all have our own vision of what we believe healthcare reform must look like .
But we share one common goal -- it must get done .
The day it gets done , is the day , we start the work of improving it .
I 'm one of the people profoundly impacted by relentless and uncontrolled insurer price gouging .
The story about egregious price gouging by the Murder By Spreadsheet insurer
Anthem against policy holders in California is not news to those of us who have been dealing with this organized larceny against working Americans for many long years .
Health care reform is deeply personal for me , and this is why I man the barricades of this crusade day - in and day - out .
If we do our work on 2 /24 , the media will wake up and take note .
They will know , the GET THE JOB DONE BRIGADE are bigger , stronger , meaner , smarter and more organized than those damn Tbaggers .
1,000,000 VOICES FOR HEALTHCARE REFORM : A VIRTUAL MARCH ON WASHINGTON
THE GET THE JOB DONE BRIGADE will do this via calls , faxes , Tweets , Facebook , emails , telegrams , balloon drops and carrier pigeons .
Whatever .
It . Takes .
Here 's some food for thought , BRIGADERS .
Your message is your own , whatever moves you , but there is one global message : DO YOUR DAMN JOB , PASS HEALTHCARE REFORM
Topline Message :
It 's time for Washington to stop stalling and pass real health care reform .
Sub -Message : Washington is playing politics as usual .
Instead of fixing our broken healthcare system , they look the other way as people are dying .
Americans simply cannot wait for comprehensive health care reform - it 's time for Democrats to stand up to Big Insurance and their conservative allies , and get reform done right .
During the Virtual March for Real Health Care Reform , we 'll send a million messages to Congress to make sure they know that voters want them to get to work and get health care done .
Additional Points for Consideration :
The only real hurdles to passing reform are issues of political will , not of procedure .
Democrats still have large majorities in both the House and the Senate .
If they have the political will to do so , Democrats can have the Senate pass a " fix " bill through reconciliation that includes changes negotiated with the House .
Passing comprehensive healthcare reform is both good politics and good policy .
Polling of the people who voted for Obama in 2008 and for Republican Scott Brown in 2010 shows that 82 % of them support a public option : they believe the failure in DC is that Democrats are not aggressive enough in fighting for them .
Our nation ’s health care crisis is not an incremental problem and cannot be fixed with incremental solutions .
We cannot ban denials for pre-existing conditions without mandates ; we cannot institute mandates without providing subsidies ; and we cannot provide subsidies without raising revenue .
All the most popular elements of true meaningful reform are intertwined .
The Public option is gaining momentum .
Support in the Senate for using reconciliation to pass a public option is growing by the day .
Currently 18 Senators have signed a letter in support of using reconciliation to pass a public option .
In addition , whip counts show that there are the votes needed to pass a public option .
In the House , more than 118 members have signed a similar letter .
All we ask , is that you take an action .
And if you want to help us continue this fight :
The funds donated to the Progressive Congress Action Fund , a 501 ( C ) 4 not for profit , will be used to advocate on behalf of the progressive agenda , to advance progressive
legislation , and may include payments to individuals engaged in fund raising .

Vermont calls to mind some vivid associations : maple syrup , progressive politics , cheese .
Laini Fondiller has brought two of the three together with Lazy Lady Farm .
Taking inspiration from the talk radio she listens to while making cheese from goat and cow milk in her off - the - grid facility , Fondiller has sent out offerings with names like Tomme Delay ( a riff on French tomme - style cheese ) , Barick Obama ( a square cheese from 2004 , named after the young state senator gave his speech at the Democratic National Convention ) and Fil - a - Buster ( a hefty wheel banded with spruce ) .
The Ben & Jerry ’s flavor Imagine Whirled Peace might make for a cute take on a bumper sticker for the state ’s rusty Saabs , but until Hubby Hubby becomes permanent , Lazy Lady has the leftie - foodie market cornered .
People who want to pick up a Crumb Cake goat cheese this month will be out of luck .
Wait , you mean cheeses have a season ?
Yes : Even Barack could n’t get a Barick from June to October .
As the organic milk from her goats naturally tapers off in the winter —
“ The goats just began to collect unemployment as of last Friday , ” Fondiller e-mailed me on Dec. 15 — she mixes it with organic milk from her neighbors ’
Holsteins and Jerseys to create cheeses like Bipartisan ( cow with goat in the middle ) , moving into all - cow before phasing back into goat in the spring .
For a few weeks in the fall of 2008 , she used the dregs of a vat of cow milk to make Palin Comparison : “ I said , ‘ This is where they drug her up from ! ’ ”

Fondiller and her goats do n’t make it easy on cheesemongers .
“ You do n’t pick the season ; we do ! ” she said .
As a result , Lazy Lady cheeses come and go faster than a Beltway news cycle .
The New York cheesemonger Anne Saxelby says , “ We tell restaurants that if they want something they can print on the menu , Lazy Lady is not a thing to choose . ”
So , here ’s the news from the Senate .
Martha Johnson was nominated to head the General Services Administration , and was confirmed by a nearly unanimous vote — but only after having had her nomination held hostage for nine months by Senator Kit Bond , who wanted more pork for Kansas City .
And now Senator Richard Shelby has placed a hold on — are you seated — all , all , Obama administration nominees , until he gets some pork for Alabama .
What ’s going on ?
The Senate has rules based on the idea that it was a chamber of gentlemen who would find ways to work together .
But now , 41 Senators belong to a party that has no interest in a working government , no desire to work with the majority in good faith .
There ’s a precedent for all this .
In effect , we ’ve now become 17th - century Poland :
… with the rise of power held by Polish magnates , the unanimity principle was reinforced with the institution of the nobility ’s right of liberum veto ( Latin for “ I freely forbid ” ) .
If the envoys were unable to reach a unanimous decision within six weeks ( the time limit of a single session ) , deliberations were declared null and void .
From the mid-17th century onward , any objection to a Sejm resolution — by either an envoy or a senator — automatically caused the rejection of other , previously approved resolutions .
This was because all resolutions passed by a given session of the Sejm formed a whole resolution , and , as such , was published as the annual constitution of the Sejm , e.g. , Anno Domini 1667 .
In the 16th century , no single person or small group dared to hold up proceedings , but , from the second half of the 17th century , the liberum veto was used to virtually paralyze the Sejm , and brought the Commonwealth to the brink of collapse .
“ Brink of collapse ” : get used to that concept .
You go , girls .

You outed a CIA officer , you lied to take us to Iraq .
You ruined the country .
You totally ruined the country .

Fancy book - author Karl Rove went to Beverly Hills last night to take questions about his very very gay dad .
But then Code Pink showed up to make a citizen ’s arrest , and Karl had no security !
Was he able to beat up these ladies good ?
Also , someone brings up the Downing Street Memo , which Rove calls a fabrication — just like in 2005 !
Lying us into a war is the kinda thing that can get people a tad bit upset .
Does
Rove really think he 's going to be welcomed at book events like he is with Jay Leno or on FOX News ?
Poor Michele Malkin was shaken to her core over the event .
I 'd figure it would just roll off her back since she stalks children and family 's like Graeme Frost because she disagrees on a policy level .
Hey , she even goes to their homes for a little chat .
UPDATE : TP commenter Mr. Ed notes that Malkin visited the Frost ’s home and business today .
A coworker of Mr. Frost tells Malkin that the family is “ struggling , ” but she refuses to believe it .
Jane Hall was on FOX and was shocked that the right wingers attacked a 12 year old boy .
Malkin and her kind are shocked that Rove would be confronted by the very un -scary Code Pink , but takes pride in stalking children .
Nice .

They can sure dish it out , but they can't take even a light little pink - colored whiff of it .
In a move set to outrage flying nerds everywhere , the FAA recently released new guidelines blocking the carrying - on of extra lithium - ion , alkaline and nickel metal - hydride batteries .
“ It will be a nightmare for passengers , ” said George Kerschner , who runs the DC based Portable Rechargeable Battery Association , and seems to have a very wide definition of the word “ nightmare . ”
He cautioned that the regulation will cause people to have to ship their batteries ahead of them ( instead of just … checking them ) , adding , “ We ’re talking about billions of dollars . ”
Kerschner went on to yell , “ YOU WILL LIVE TO REGRET THIS ! ” before blasting off in an escape pod to his island fortress made out of batteries .
The full text of the Department of Transportation ’s proposal can be viewed online – there ’s also a comment section where you can deposit your rage .
Kerschner has left several threatening comments on that page , which include :
“ GIVE ME BATTERIES OR GIVE ME DEATH ! ”
NO EXTRA BATTERIES ON FLIGHTS = HITLER
IF I CAN ’T BRING EXTRA BATTERIES ON MY PLANE , THEN THAT IS JUST A SITUATION THAT I HATE
FAA = FRIGGING ASSHOLES …ASSHOLES
Kerschner then went on to weep uncontrollably into a pile of batteries .

Around 18.3 million households in the UK have internet access , with 90 per cent of those using a broadband connection , according to the Office for National Statistics .
The Government has pledged universal internet access for all , at minimum speeds of two megabits per second , by 2012 .
BT also recently unveiled its own high - speed , next - generation broadband initiative , called Infinity , which will offer download speeds of up to 40 megabits per second .
IT was kind -- but really unnecessary -- for Ronan O'Gara and his cohorts of admirers to provide further evidence proving the point that I was making last week : that irrationalism and dysfunctionalism are unusually powerful influences in Irish life .
Indeed , it is hard to imagine any other country in which one of the most capped players in rugby history would write a letter denouncing the thoughts of a non -rugby commentator , to be followed by the hysterical shrieks of his fans .
This infantile babble seemed to focus on how much rugby I had ever played .
Children : one does not need to be a carpenter to see that the chair keeps falling over .
In fact I pointed fingers at five Irish participants in Paris : Kidney , O'Gara , O'Leary , Flannery and Healy .
And I identified the prime architect of that afternoon 's disappointment not to be any individual , but the Irish sub- conscious , and it was that -- and not Ronan O'Gara -- which was the main subject of the column .
I quote its final paragraphs now , because they have been vindicated by the hysterical and childish response to my piece .
The question is : why ?
What causes a people to behave so dysfunctionally as to make failure literally inevitable ?
Alas , it is a common Irish characteristic : far more common than we like to admit .
For we are comfortable with failure .
It 's a familiar condition and it suits us .
Even a natural winner like Declan Kidney can be subconsciously drawn by its allure .
We see the pathology of defeatism throughout the administration of our State .
Indeed , is not political violence -- and the reverence we show it -- evidence of a preference for malfunctionalism ?
Were our inevitably suicidal economic policies of the past decade not proof that we sought failure ?
Do we not repeatedly seek refuge in formulas that we subconsciously must know in advance cannot work , but then we blame the inevitable failure on something other than our own preference for it ?
Last season 's grand slam was the aberration -- and please remember , we nearly forfeited it with an idiotic and needless penalty in the last seconds of the final match , which the Welsh would probably have converted , had Gavin Henson kicked it .
So the following does n't make for pleasant reading ; but the Irish team that lost in France really was representing Ireland .
The infantile internet hate - storm that followed the publication of O'Gara 's letter in response to that column , and the two - person rant about what a horrible person I was on Newstalk FM -- with , naturally , no attempt at balance -- merely supplied proof of the irrationalism which governs so much of life .
For I have written about O'Gara before : when he stood with hands in his pockets while meeting Queen Elizabeth II last year after the Grand Slam win .
And for the bilious leprechaun definition of national identity , he was striking a blow for Irish freedom , by insulting the octogenarian head of state of a friendly power .
The cyber - storm about a mere newspaper column coincided with the resignation of the Minister for Defence on an issue that seemed to be unrelated , yet in a strange way meshed with it perfectly .
Until Eoghan Harris on Sunday revealed all the impromptu remarks made by Willie O'Dea , I was unaware of the context in which he had made his baseless allegation about Sinn Feiner Maurice Quinlivan owning a brothel .
Mr O'Dea 's opening words -- which were deleted from all RTE 's broadcasts of the tape -- were : " While occasionally we send out letters to planning applicants . . . we have never been involved with anyone who shot anybody , or kidnapped anybody , or robbed banks , or kidnapped people . "
STEP forward the unchanging and demented morality of Sinn Fein !
For Maurice Quinlivan then felt able to sue for the brothel allegation , and ignore the infinitely more terrible IRA implications .
Frankly , I 'd much rather be accused of running a knocking - shop full of exotic Brazilian girls than be associated with the IRA murderers of Jerry McCabe , Jean McConville , et alia .
Moreover , it 's nearly 20 years since police officers disturbed two armed intruders at the home of businessman Charles Tidbury in Hampshire , causing them to flee in a car which was later found at Stonehenge .
Its occupants , Pearse McAuley and Nessan Quinlivan , were charged with conspiracy to murder Mr Tidbury .
This same fine Quinlivan , of course , went on to be the owner of the flat about which O'Dea was speaking .
You could almost pick any event in modern Ireland as evidence of the irrationality which dominates the conduct of our public life today , but this little affair of the " shocking " brothel allegation will do .
Matching that is the generally perceived " insignificance " of the affidavit that the minister later signed , asserting that he had made no statement about Quinlivan brothel - keeping .
In a mature society , one in which one answers for one 's delinquencies , a false oath like that would be the all - time career - killer -- yet O'Dea still trumpets that he will be back !
And , do you know , in a dysfunctional society like ours , he probably will .
As for Ronan O'Gara : who can say ?
Not me , that 's for sure .

Perhaps stirred by Apple 's claim of being one of the biggest mobile device companies in the world , Sony is planning a number of new devices and services to compete with Apple 's iTunes Store , iPhone , and iPad .
That strategy will revolve around what 's currently being called Sony Online Service , along with smartphone and tablet - like devices meant to connect to it , according to a recent Wall Street Journal report .
Sony plans to launch its online media platform , aimed squarely at Apple 's iTunes Store , later this month .
The iTunes Store includes the App Store ( which offers apps for the iPhone , iPod touch , and now iPad ) and iBookstore ( which will offer books for the iPad later this month ) in addition to music , TV , and movies .
Sony Online Service is expected to offer much of the same music and video content , as well as Sony 's back - catalog of PlayStation games .
Sony aims to enable a number of devices to connect to the service .
The company is planning to make a smartphone capable of playing games made for the PSP Go — a sort of iPhone - like " PSP phone . "
A project is also underway to build a mobile device that " blurs distinctions among a netbook , an e-reader and a PSP , " according to the Journal 's sources .
That sure sounds like an iPad to us .
Other Sony Ericsson phones may also have access to the content , and it would presumably be accessible via the company 's Vaio line of laptops as well .
The initiative is part of CEO Howard Stringer 's plan to turn the company around after the recession and slow sales triggered job cuts and plant closings at the end of 2008 .
Since then , sales of the company 's mobile devices , such as the PSP Go and Sony Ericsson mobile phones , have been dismal at best .
Even a major price cut on the Playstation 3 lead to only a temporary spike in sales .
Sony needs new products that can move in significant numbers if Stringer 's plan to tie products into its online media service is to succeed .
" It 's still not quite clear what specific steps Sony will take to achieve that , especially when iPad and other highly capable mobile devices are crowding the market , " Nobuo Kurahashi , a consumer - electronics analyst at Japanese brokerage Mizuho Investors Securities , told WSJ .
Though the PSP
Go's high price tag and confounding issues with the download - only games have resulted in poor sales , the company has reportedly learned its lesson about how to develop products that rely on a download - only service ( we 'll remain skeptical ) .
Sony has hundreds of products spread across camcorders , digital cameras , video games , and A/V equipment , but a laser sharp focus on a smaller range of products — a strategy that has served Apple well — may be the only way to turn the ship around .
100 Tage Merkel & Westerwelle : Gelb war die Hoffnung
Der große Wahlgewinner hieß FDP .
Doch nach 100 Tagen Regieren sind viele Anhänger enttäuscht .
Sie stört das Beharren auf Steuersenkung oder die Vernachlässigung der Bürgerrechte .
" Freiheit " war der Grund , weshalb Martin Woestmeyer , heute 39 , in die FDP eintrat .
Und " Freiheit " ist der Grund , warum er jetzt wieder ausgetreten ist .
18 Jahre alt war Woestmeyer , als auf dem Platz des Himmlischen Friedens die Panzer rollten .
Freiheit , dachte er damals , ist das Einzige , das zählt - und wurde Mitglied der Partei , die das Wort " frei " im Namen trägt .
Später saß er drei
Jahre lang für die FDP in der Hamburgischen Bürgerschaft , engagierte sich in der Schulpolitik und kämpfte für die Rechte der Homosexuellen .
Doch nur wenige Monate nach dem Triumph der FDP bei der Bundestagswahl trat Woestmeyer aus der FDP aus - und in die Piratenpartei ein .
" Viele meinen , Macht macht sexy .
Ich sehe das anders " , sagt er. " Die FDP ist an der Macht unsexy geworden . "
Woestmeyer sitzt in einem Café an der Binnenalster , gegenüber ist das Thalia Theater , dessen Kundenzentrum er leitet .
Er bestellt einen Karamell - Macchiato und erzählt , warum er nach 20 Jahren die FDP verlassen hat .
Es sind mehrere Dinge , die zusammenkamen .
Zum Beispiel , dass ausgerechnet Dirk Niebel Entwicklungsminister wurde , obwohl der als FDP - Generalsekretär immer gepoltert hatte , das Ministerium solle abgeschafft werden .
Und dann dieses ständige Steuersenkungsmantra , seit der Wahl schien es nur noch um dieses eine Thema zu gehen .
" Ziemlich bieder " findet Woestmeyer das .
Das Thema , das ihm am Herzen liegt , rutschte hingegen auf der Prioritätenliste nach hinten : die Bürgerrechte .
Woestmeyer hatte gehofft , dass mit der FDP an der Regierung Schluss sein würde mit der ständigen Verschärfung der Sicherheitsgesetze .
Doch bei der ersten Gelegenheit gaben die Liberalen gegenüber der Union nach .
Und so hat die Misere der ersten hundert Tage Schwarz - Gelb für Woestmeyer einen Namen : Swift .
So wird das Abkommen genannt , das US - Fahndern Einblicke in europäische Bankdaten sichert , die schwarz - gelbe Regierung hatte es nicht verhindern wollen .
Woestmeyer hatte genug .
Per Twitter - Nachricht zwitscherte er es im Dezember in die Welt hinaus : " Ahoi ! Ich bin der Piratenpartei beigetreten ! "
Er ist nicht der einzige Liberale , der mit den ersten hundert Tagen Schwarz - Gelb unzufrieden ist .
Bei der Bundestagswahl erreichte die FDP mit 14,6 Prozent das beste Ergebnis ihrer Geschichte .
Inzwischen , so sagt es das Umfrageinstitut Forsa , würde die Partei ein gutes Drittel Stimmen weniger bekommen .
Hinter dem hohen Wahlergebnis für die FDP steckten offenbar völlig unterschiedliche Erwartungen .
Nun ärgern sich die einen über den Eindruck des Klientelismus , den die FDP mit der Senkung der Mehrwertsteuer für Hotelübernachtungen erweckt hat ; und die anderen schimpfen über die tollpatschigen Auftritte von Wirtschaftsminister Rainer Brüderle .
Den einen stinkt das Beharren auf Steuersenkungen trotz der Rekordneuschulden ; den anderen aber können sie gar nicht schnell und weit genug gehen .
Hilzingen .
Eine 8.500 - Einwohner - Gemeinde in Baden - Württemberg , an der Grenze zur Schweiz .
Der Südwesten war schon immer eine Hochburg der Liberalen .
Aber nirgendwo in ganz Baden - Württemberg haben so viele die FDP gewählt wie in Hilzingen : 31 Prozent .
Hilzingen ist die Heimat von Birgit Homburger , der FDP - Fraktionschefin im Bundestag .
" Gemeinde mit Tradition und Fortschritt " nennt sich der Ort. Gerade einmal 167 Arbeitslose gibt es hier , im Gewerbegebiet reiht sich eine mittelständische Firma an die andere : Heldele Elektrotechnik , die Oberbadische Filzfabrik , Renfert Dentaltechnik .
Andreas Puchstein , 41 , ist der Vorsitzende des Gewerbevereins Hilzingen .
Er vertritt 80 Unternehmer .
" L.E.I.S.T.U.N.G. " steht auf der Internetseite des Vereins .
Puchstein selbst betreibt ein Landschaftsbauunternehmen , zwischen zwei Terminen hat er sich etwas Zeit genommen , er kommt in grüner Landschaftsgärtnermontur .
Was er von der Arbeit der neuen Regierung hält ?
" Da müsste endlich mal einer auf den Tisch hauen . "
Wer als Unternehmer in Deutschland etwas auf die Beine stellen wolle , werde nur " geknechtet und geknebelt " .
Durch zu hohe Steuern und Abgaben und eine überbordende Bürokratie , so sieht es Puchstein .
Kein Wunder , dass sich da manche in die Schweiz oder nach Österreich verabschiede .
" Irgendwann hat der Staat den Bürgern das ganze Geld weggenommen . "
Puchstein trat der FDP im Jahr 2004 bei .
Es war die Hoch - Zeit eines neoliberalen schwarz - gelben Projekts , als Friedrich Merz für die Union die Bierdeckel - Steuererklärung forderte und die FDP gleich die vollständige Abschaffung des bisherigen Steuerrechts .
Es war die Zeit , in der der Staat gar nicht schlank genug sein konnte .
2005 wollte der Wähler Schwarz - Gelb nicht , für viele kam das überraschend .
Beobachter nennen die jetzige Regierung deshalb auch eine verspätete Koalition .
Doch seit der Staat in der Finanzkrise die Banken retten musste , hat sich der Zeitgeist völlig verändert .
Wenn man sich mit Puchstein unterhält , wird schnell klar , dass er sich dennoch dieses alte schwarz - gelbe Projekt herbeigesehnt hatte - Krise hin oder her .
Bierdeckelsteuer ?
Findet er immer noch gut .
Subventionen hält er für Marktverzerrungen .
Und ginge es nach ihm , würden Sozialleistungen genauso drastisch gekürzt wie die Stellen in der Verwaltung .
" Ich bin radikal " , sagt Puchstein .
Es waren aber nicht allein die Puchsteins der Republik , die der FDP ihren Wahlerfolg bescherten .
Sondern auch Teile eines großstädtischen " Kreativbürgertums " , das die Medien bei der Wahl ausfindig gemacht hatten .
In Berlin - Mitte etwa , in Galerien und den Restaurants " Borchardt " und " Grill Royal " , aber auch im bürgerlichen Teil Kreuzbergs , am Landwehrkanal , wo renovierte Altbauten stehen und Musiklabels , Grafiker und Werber ihre Büros unterhalten .
Dort hat auch Marcus Börner , 24 , seine Firma , eine Internetplattform zum Handel mit gebrauchten Videospielen und DVDs , die er zusammen mit seinen WG - Kumpels hochgezogen hat .
Inzwischen haben sie mehr als 50 Mitarbeiter .
Börner trägt abgewetzte Jeans , Turnschuhe , Hemd und Füntagebart .
Er fährt ein klappriges Damenrad und ist gegen Atomkraft .
In seiner Firma gibt es jeden Mittwoch Obst für alle , und wer nachts den Computer anlässt , muss Strafe zahlen wegen Energieverschwendung .
Man würde vermuten , dass einer wie er die Grünen wählt .
Doch auch er hat die FDP gewählt , und wenn man mit ihm redet , ist das doch recht plausibel :
Er spricht dann über nervende Ämter , unnötigen Papierkram , fehlende Effizienz und Anreize , die es braucht , damit jeder etwas leistet und den Wohlstand aller mehrt .
" Ich mag den liberalen Grundgedanken , dass der Mensch sein Schicksal selber in der Hand hat . "
Wie fällt nun Börners Fazit nach hundert Tagen Schwarz - Gelb aus ?
Daumen hoch oder runter ?
" Zur Seite " , sagt er . " Oder eher sogar nach unten . "
Der Grund dafür ist aber ein ganz anderer als der des Gewerbevereinschefs aus dem Südwesten .
" Steuern sind nicht per se schlecht " , sagt er .
Solange sie dafür verwendet werden , dass etwa Schulen und Universitäten besser werden , zahlt er sie gerne .
Deshalb ärgert es ihn auch so , dass die FDP nun ständig " Steuern runter " fordert - und das , obwohl der Staat in diesem Jahr die Rekordsumme von 86 Milliarden Euro an neuen Schulden aufnehmen wird .
" Man müsste den Leuten ehrlich sagen : Wir können uns keine Steuersenkungen leisten " , findet Börner .
Dass die FDP das nicht einsieht , enttäuscht den jungen Anhänger maßlos .
Es scheint , als wäre nur eine Kernklientel begeistert von der Rolle der FDP in der Regierung : Hoteliers , Vermieter , Apotheker und Ärzte .
Und so ist auch Fritz von Weizsäcker , 49 , zufrieden mit dem Anfang der Koalition .
Mehr als " ein paar kleine Stolperer " will er nicht erkennen .
Der Sohn des früheren Bundespräsidenten Richard von Weizsäcker trat am 12 .
September auf einem Fundraising - Dinner in der " Solarworld " - Firmenzentrale im Bonner Stadtteil Bad Godesberg der FDP bei .
Ein Zwei-Sterne - Koch kredenzte Wildschwein für die 280 Gäste , unter ihnen auch Parteichef Guido Westerwelle .
Jetzt sitzt Fritz von Weizsäcker in seinem Büro in der Schlosspark - Klinik in Berlin - Charlottenburg .
Er ist dort Chefarzt , unter seinem weißen Kittel trägt er ein blaues Hemd mit Manschettenknöpfen und Krawatte , dazu braune Budapester Schuhe .
" Man kann nach hundert Tagen keine Wunder erwarten " , sagt er .
Und so richtig losregiert werde ohnehin erst nach der Wahl in Nordrhein - Westfalen im Mai .
Dann erwartet er aber auch , dass die Gesundheitsreform angepackt wird , und zwar richtig .
Das heißt für ihn : mehr Eigenverantwortung , weniger Umverteilung .
" Ich bin nach wie vor froh , dass die Menschen sich so eindeutig für Schwarz - Gelb entschieden haben " , sagt er .
Die Sache ist nur die : Die Menschen sehen das nicht mehr so .
Glaubt man den Umfragen , würden derzeit nur 45 Prozent für die Union und die FDP stimmen - 3 Punkte weniger als für die SPD , die Grünen und die Linke .
UPDATES Judge Upholds ‘ Terminator ’ Sale ; Sony & Lionsgate Get Exclusive Negotiation
EXCLUSIVE : Now that Pacificor has pulled the Terminator franchise out of bankruptcy , the question becomes :
How to wrap up one of the great sci - fi franchises for hardcore fans who feel neither of the last two installments measured up to the first two that James Cameron directed ?
Cameron seems unlikely to return to the fold ( even though Terminator would fit nicely into the portfolio of 3D films like Fantastic Voyage he ’s producing . )
But what if I told you his writing partner on the first two films , William Wisher , has scripted a detailed 24 - page treatment for Terminator 5 , and a 4 - page concept outline for Terminator 6 ?
And that I ’ve read both ?
As a Terminator fanboy myself , I think Wisher has done a terrific job with a plot that accepts the storylines from Jonathan Mostow ’s Terminator 3 : Rise of the Machines and McG ’s Terminator : Salvation .
Most interestingly , he turns the story back to the core characters and time travel storyline of the first two films that Wisher crafted with Cameron .
Gale Anne Hurd shared writing credit with Cameron on the original film while Wisher got an “ additional dialogue by ” credit , but I ’m told he was plenty involved .
He and Cameron shared screenwriting credit on Terminator 2 : Judgment Day .
But Wisher walked away from the 3rd film out of loyalty to Cameron and had no involvement with Terminator : Salvation .
Now he wants back in .
I wo n’t give away Wisher ’s plotlines .
After all , it ’s not clear at this point whether Pacificor — or Sony and Lionsgate , the most likely studios to ultimately make the next installments — will engage him to write the final installments .
But I ’ve received permission to disclose some high points :
Wisher ’s 2 - picture construct takes place in a post - apocalyptic battleground , and factors in an element of time travel that allows for Sarah Connor and Kyle Reese to interact beyond their single fateful meeting when he traveled back in time to protect her in the original film .
Wisher has created a role for Arnold Schwarzenegger that is as surprising as his shift from villain in the first film , to John Connor ’s bodyguard in the second .
Schwarzenegger would n’t be needed until the final film , which would n’t shoot until after he ends his term as California Governor .
And who would n’t want to see Linda Hamilton back in aerobic top fitness form as Sarah Connor ?
There are several new villains , and plenty of firepower .
For instance , a swarm of “ Night Crawlers , ” 4 1/2 - foot tall border sentries that are set like mines to spring up out of the ground and ambush rebel fighters with 10 MM pistols built into their wrists , and fingers and feet that are razor sharp .
Also fresh off the Skynet assembly line are new shape - shifting cyborgs that can morph together in Transformers - like mode , and are more lethal than anything we ’ve seen in previous Terminator installments .
Wisher presents a satisfying conclusion to what by then would be a 6 - picture struggle between Skynet ’s machines and John and Sarah Connor to preserve a future that allows mankind to prevail over the machines .
I ’d pay to see these movies .
How about you ?
In a potentially significant reversal of policy , the Federal Communications Commission could be poised to make the big telecoms share their high - speed Internet fiber networks with smaller companies .
They would , in turn , offer more broadband services to the public .
That 's according to a Bloomberg story published on Friday , which adds that the proposal being considered comes from the Cbeyond broadband / telecom services firm .
We contacted the FCC about this and got no response .
But we also called AT&T , and they 're taking it seriously enough .
" We support the Commission 's efforts to promote investment to achieve universal broadband and create jobs in this difficult economy , " an AT&T spokesperson told us , " however , the rule changes pushed by Cbeyond will undermine these efforts . "
This would be big news if it 's true .
The Commission 's National Broadband Plan coordinator , Blair Levin , has recently made statements unsympathetic to this idea .
" We 're not that terribly interesting [ or interested , one presumes ] in moving toward things that will just freeze capital investment and have long , drawn - out court battles , " Levin told Amy Schatz of the Wall Street Journal in late December .
" That does n't strike me as that productive . "
And when the FCC announced that it had commissioned a study which explored the line - sharing question , Levin 's public statement declared that " We do n't want to reinvent the wheel . "
Cashless stimuli
Would this constitute wheel reinvention ?
Not likely — but it would produce a very different - looking circular object .
The FCC has taken a lot of criticism from public interest groups upset that its preliminary outline for its National Broadband Plan did n't deal with line sharing , among other issues .
And Cbeyond 's founder Jim Geiger has been campaigning for what he calls a " cashless stimulus " in the form of cheaper special access rates for smaller business broadband services providers .
Special access is telco jargon for what it costs these competitive carriers to connect to the big AT&T , Verizon , and Cox networks .
Were these rates more affordable and the access better , Geiger argues , small businesses could rely more on cloud computing and Web conferencing .
" The FCC should require the Bell monopolies to sell — at retail prices — the bandwidth necessary for competitors like Cbeyond to provide next - generation broadband applications to small businesses , " Geiger says .
As already mentioned , Cbeyond has formally petitioned the Commission to make this move .
" The FCC should adopt rules requiring incumbent LECs [ Local Exchange Carriers ] to provide unbundled access to the packetized bandwidth of hybrid loops , FTTH loops , and FTTC loops at retail rates , " Cbeyond says .
Translations for civilians :
FTTH and Fiber - To - The - Cabinet connections — the closest last - mile lines you can get via optical fiber , which is the best kind of broadband line around
Hybrid connections — combo copper / fiber pipes .
In 2003 , the agency relaxed rules requiring the big telcos to sell access to these kind of lines , leaving smaller competitors like Cbeyond to the mercy of inferior links like T - 1 facilities or faster , but pricier DS3 loops .
The FCC argued that " excessive network unbundling requirements tend to undermine the incentives of both incumbent LECs and new entrants to invest in new facilities and deploy new technology .
The effect of unbundling on investment incentives is particularly critical in the area of broadband . "
And so the agency ruled that incumbents did not have to offer unbundled access to newly rolled out fiber loops or to the packet - switching capabilities of hybrid loops .
But these policies , Cbeyond now argues in its petition , " have left small businesses to traipse a proverbial dirt path while a modem , three - lane highway is unused : "
Cbeyond is ready today to develop a series of applications for small businesses that are utilized almost exclusively by large businesses .
These applications include virtualized desktops , remote desktop management , high - resolution video conferencing , broadcast / live video streaming , robust data protection , sophisticated video security systems , cloud computing and software as a service .
These are proven applications that yield unquestioned efficiencies .
Small businesses could rely on them to lower their costs and increase productivity .
But Cbeyond cannot offer these applications via T - 1 loops because the applications require much more bandwidth than 1.5 Mbps .
Moreover , DS3 loops are too expensive to serve as a viable substitute .
Cbeyonds needs the increased capacity that fiber and hybrid loops can provide in order to deliver the applications at issue .
So the company wants the FCC to launch a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking considering to what degree to reverse its 2003 rules on fiber sharing .
Cbeyond 's petition relies heavily on the conclusions of that aforementioned study conducted by Harvard University 's Berkman Center for Internet and Society .
Berkman 's comparative survey of the broadband speeds and prices consumers enjoy around the world found that " the lowest prices and highest speeds are almost all offered by firms in markets where , in addition to an incumbent telephone company and a cable company , there are also competitors who entered the market , and built their presence , though use of open access facilities . "
Impermissables
Rest assured , to whatever degree the FCC moves in this direction , said actions will be fiercely opposed by the big telcos .
They repeatedly took even mildly procompetition line sharing rules to court up until the deregulatory order of 2003 .
The Telecommunications Industry Association has choice words for Cbeyond 's petition in a commentary filed with the FCC in late January , calling it " impermissibly based on a specific business plan contemplated by Cbeyond itself . "
" Contrary to the Petition ’s claims , investment in fiber networks has skyrocketed as a result , " of deregulation , argues the trade group .
" Broadband providers spend tens of billions of dollars in capital expenditures each year to deploy and upgrade their networks . "
As for the Berkman Study , the telcos are on record as calling it a dog , or an " embarrassingly slanted econometric analysis that violates professional statistical standards and is insufficiently reliable to provide meaningful guidance , " in AT &T 's words .
The FCC 's line - sharing policies have had " the effect of promoting massive investment in advanced broadband facilities and spurring ever more robust intermodal competition , " advised Verizon in its response to the Cbeyond petition , which " gives no basis to disrupt this successful policy . "
Apparently somebody at the Commission thinks otherwise .
Now everyone 's waiting for the next shoe to drop .
Georgian luger Nodar Kumaritashvili died Friday after he crashed during a training run at the Whistler Sliding Centre in preparation for the Vancouver 2010 Olympic Winter Games .
The video was quite disturbing and showed the body of the 21 - year - old being thrown off the track at 144 kilometres per hour .
UPDATE : 3:44 p.m. —
The IOC and VANOC just released this joint statement :
It is with great regret that we confirm the death of the Georgian luge athlete , Nodar Kumaritashvili , during the final training session at the Whistler Sliding Centre , this morning .
Mr Kumaritashvili died after crashing on the last corner of the course during training .
Doctors were unable to revive the athlete , who died in hospital .
“ Our first thoughts are with the family , friends and colleagues of the athlete .
The whole Olympic Family is struck by this tragedy , which clearly casts a shadow over these Games ” , said the President of the International Olympic Committee ( IOC ) , Jacques Rogge .
“ We are deeply struck by this tragedy and join the IOC in extending our condolences to the family , friends and teammates of this athlete , who came to Vancouver to follow his Olympic dream ” , said John Furlong , the CEO of VANOC , the Games Organising Committee .
For the International Luge Federation , President Josef Fendt said : “ This is a terrible accident .
This is the gravest thing that can happen in sport , and our thoughts and those of the ‘ luge family ’ , are naturally with those touched by this event . ”
An investigation is underway into the circumstances of the accident .
Training was suspended and technical officials are now trying to establish the causes .

A place to learn about yourself and how to change your life for the better .
We are not talking about something you have to learn , we are talking about a gift that is yours - it is all ready right within you .
I have discovered this simple truth - that you have been designed with greatness right within your own DNA for your success - and the path to that greatness is the theta brain wave .
Feb. 11 , 2010  -- Mark Winslow , a medical physicist from Upland , Calif. , was in no rush for his refund when he walked into H&R Block a couple of years ago to have his taxes prepared .
So he declined the tax preparer 's offer of a so - called quick loan to tide him over until the Internal Revenue Service check arrived .
" I thought the interest rate was outrageous , " Winslow , 37 , said of the annual interest rate of more than 19 percent , on top of a processing fee .
Such loans , he added , do n't make sense if a taxpayer is expecting a refund within weeks .
" It preys on poor people who need money the most , " he added .
But millions of Americans lack Winslow 's patience and buy pricey refund - anticipation loans , or RALs , instead of waiting for their free IRS checks .
Consumer advocates have warned taxpayers for years about the loans that , they say , drain millions of dollars out of U.S. tax refunds each year .
Indeed , 8.4 million Americans took out RALs in 2008 , costing them $ 806 million in interest payments and fees , according to data recently published by two consumer advocacy groups ; the Consumer Federation of America and the National Consumer Law Center .
RALs often carry annual percentage rates as high as 500 percent , according to the law center , with an average RAL of $ 3,300 carrying a rate of 72 percent .
Refund - anticipation lenders often target low - income taxpayers , especially those who receive the Earned Income Tax Credit , according to the IRS .
About 1 in 17 tax returns filed in 2008 involved a RAL .
" Refund - anticipation loans are extremely expensive and unnecessary loans that draw millions of dollars away from consumers , " Jean Ann Fox , director of financial services at the Consumer Federation of America , said .
" If you file your return electronically and get it deposited directly into your bank account , you can get all of your refund in less than two weeks , instead of sharing some of it with a banker . "
Refund - anticipation loans are perfectly legal and offered by a wide range of national companies , including H&R Block , Liberty Tax and Jackson Hewitt .
Because tax preparers lack licenses to make the loans , they usually partner with large banks such as HSBC and JPMorgan Chase .
Kate Rauber , a spokeswoman for H&R Block , said that " not all RALs are created equal , " adding that her company has taken several measures to improve service in recent years .
For example , she said , H&R Block has sharply cut prices and its average refund loan of $ 3,000 now carries an APR of 33 percent .
" These charges are similar to a convenience fee , " Rauber said , referring to the $ 29.95 refund account fee and interest rates that H&R Block charges .
" How many of us have paid expedited shipping fees to get something faster we ordered online ? "
Tax preparers offer customers no - fee options during their appointment and inform clients five times of costs associated with RALs before they 're asked to sign on the dotted line , she said .
Sheila Cort , a spokeswoman for Jackson Hewitt , said that RALs may be an " effective option to address a specific , timely individual need , " adding , however , that many clients also choose cheaper alternatives , including the IRS ' free direct deposit .
As is often the case with pricey financial products , RALs are often bought by consumers who might be desperate for cash or unaware of how the IRS operates .
Many users simply do n't know that the IRS does n't charge for electronic filings or direct deposits , and that they will usually receive their refunds in full within two weeks .
The loans are n't the only problem , according to the National Consumer Law Center .
Americans also spent $ 360 million in 2008 on what the group considered unnecessary refund products , such as temporary bank accounts offered by tax preparers for a fee of $ 30 a piece .
Recent Lawsuits
RALs allow tax preparers to hide how much they are really charging for tax preparation because preparation fees are usually taken out of the loan in advance , consumer advocates say .
" This is an easy way for them to obscure how expensive tax preparation is because if you do n't have to take the money out of your billfold or write a check , you might not notice how much you paid , " Fox of the Consumer Federation of America said .
" It enables tax preparers to charge a multiplicity of fees and hide what the total cost is going to be . "
In some cases , borrowers are drawn to these refund aids because they do n't have a bank account , Consumer Reports senior editor Tobie Stanger said .
H&R Block even sells a pre-paid MasterCard , the Emerald Card , which gives unbanked customers a way to receive their refunds .
H&R Block spokeswoman Rauber said the card helps customers save check - cashing fees .
The card is free as long as customers keep using it , she said .
Once it has been inactive for 90 days , however , H&R Block begins deducting a monthly $ 2.50 " inactivity fee " unless customers cancel the cards .
Companies such as H&R Block , Jackson Hewitt and Liberty Tax are accustomed to fighting off complaints from consumer advocates .
All three firms have been sued over RALs , both by state attorneys general and private lawyers .
California Attorney General Jerry Brown won a $ 1.3 million lawsuit last year against Liberty Tax and settled for $ 4.85 million with H&R Block over what he called misleading advertising about refund loans .
" Liberty Tax Service 's print and television ads misled customers by promising , ' Most refunds in 24 hours , ' " Brown said in a news release announcing its victory .
" In reality , Liberty was selling refund - anticipation loans , not a tax refund . "
His predecessor settled a similar lawsuit with Jackson Hewitt in 2007 for $ 5 million .
Although H&R Block and Jackson Hewitt did not admit to any wrongdoing in their settlements , the scrutiny from regulators has already yielded some changes .
Many tax preparers have toned down their advertising and cut their prices .
An average loan of $ 3,300 now carries an APR of 72 percent and costs about $ 65 instead of the $ 100 charged two years ago .
In addition , increased publicity about the drawbacks of RALs and the growing popularity of volunteer tax preparation networks such as the IRS Volunteer Income Tax Assistance Program have helped to shrink the number of RALs sold each year .
RALs peaked at 12.4 million loans sold in 2004 and fell steadily to 8.7 million in 2007 and 8.4 million in 2008 , according to the National Consumer Law Center .
Further declines may be in the offing , Fox of the Consumer Federation of America said , noting that Jackson Hewitt 's ability to offer loans recently received a blow .
The U.S. Office of the Comptroller of the Currency prohibited Santa Barbara Bank & Trust , one of the country 's largest RAL lenders , from making any loans during the 2010 tax season .
The bank provided about 75 percent of all RALs sold by Jackson Hewitt , the country 's third - largest tax - preparation chain , Fox said .
The office would not comment on why it blocked the 2010 loans .
But consumer advocates have welcomed the news .
" There is good news in the fight against RALs , " the Consumer Federation of America and the NCLC wrote in news release , urging regulators to prohibit any new banks from issuing RALs .
" Taxpayers can save themselves loan fees altogether by just saying ' no ' to quick - refund loans . "
Convenient for Some
But not all customers frown on RALs .
Chrissy Rauls , 27 , an administrative assistant from Pascagoula , Miss. , said she needed some extra money to buy Christmas gifts when H&R Block offered a loan , which she thought was a good deal .
" I think it was actually a good thing for me because I knew I was getting a large refund this year and they took the money I owed for the anticipation loan right out of my tax refund , " she said , adding that she paid $ 90 in fees and interest on a $ 900 loan .
Former VP candidate mocks President Obama in address to populist group that unites much of US rightwing
The US is " ready for another revolution " , Sarah Palin told conservative activists last night in a keynote speech to the first national tea party convention in Nashville which also roundly condemned Barack Obama .
" This movement is about the people , " the 2008 Republican vice - presidential nominee said last night to cheers .
" Government is supposed to be working for the people . "
Mocking Obama 's 2008 campaign slogan , Palin noted Democrats ' state electoral losses since Obama took office a year ago with talk of hope and promises of change , asking : " How 's that hopey , changey stuff workin ' out for you ? "
Her audience waved flags and gave a series of standing ovations as Palin addressed the tea party gathering , an anti-establishment , grassroots network motivated by anger over the growth of government , public spending and Obama 's policies .
The convention opened on Thursday night with a controversial speech by Tom Tancredo , a former Republican congressman who ran for president in 2008 .
Focusing mainly on illegal immigration , he invoked segregationist ideas by saying Obama had been elected because " we do not have a civics , literacy test before people can vote in this country " .
Palin 's address was less incendiary overall .
Peppered with her trademark folksy jokes , it amounted to a 45 - minute pep talk for the coalition and promotion of its principles .
But , aside from broad conservative principles like lower taxes and a strong national defence , it was short on policy ideas that might indicate serious plans to run for the White House .
Palin talked of limited government , strict adherence to the constitution , and the " God - given right " of freedom .
She said the " fresh , young and fragile " movement was the future of American politics and " a ground - up call to action " to both major political parties to change how they do business .
" You 've got both party machines running scared , " she said .
Palin suggested that the party should remain leaderless and cautioned against allowing the movement to be defined by any one person .
" This is about the people " and " it 's a lot bigger than any charismatic guy with a teleprompter , " she said , a dig at Obama .
The former Alaska governor , who resigned from office last summer before completing her first term , did n't indicate whether her political future would extend beyond cable news punditry and paid speeches to an actual presidential candidacy .
All she offered was a smile when a moderator asking her questions used the phrase " President Palin . "
That prompted most in the audience to stand up and chant : " Run , Sarah , run ! "
Palin said she would not keep her $ 100,000 ( £ 64,000 ) fee for speaking at the event , and would return it to " the cause " .
Activists paid £ 350 to attend the entire three - day gathering , or £ 225 just to hear Palin 's speech after a dinner of lobster and steak at the sprawling Gaylord hotel .
The cost led to criticism from some activists that it runs counter to the coalition 's image and could preclude people from attending .

In 1972 , a Computer Model Predicted the End of the World — And We 're on Track
BERLIN  Chancellor Angela Merkel said Monday that Germany would support much tougher sanctions against Iran in a bid to halt its nuclear ambitions .
“ We will work for more sanctions , ” she said at a joint news conference with the Israeli prime minister , Benjamin Netanyahu .
“ We always called for transparency and cooperation with Iran , but unfortunately Iran has not responded . ”
Germany is one of the six powers that have been working to curb Iran ’s nuclear program , which the West says is aimed at producing nuclear weapons .
Those nations met Saturday and agreed that Iran ’s response to their latest proposal was inadequate , but failed to agree on new sanctions .
Mrs. Merkel ’s comments , after a summit meeting with Mr. Netanyahu and a historic joint cabinet meeting here between the German and Israeli governments , were also aimed at allaying Israel ’s fears that it could become a target if Iran obtained nuclear weapons .

Tying Teacher Tenure to Student Scores Does n’t Fly
The day we can accurately measure a teacher ’s performance has finally arrived .
Or so the likes of District of Columbia Schools Chancellor Michelle A. Rhee and New York City Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg would have us believe .
In a speech this past fall in Washington , but directed at the New York state legislature , Mayor Bloomberg praised “ data - driven systems , ” while arguing that student test scores should be linked to teacher - tenure decisions .
His preferred analogy was to medicine :
To prohibit the use of student test - score data in such decisions , Bloomberg explained , would be as insane and inane as “ saying to hospitals , ‘ You can evaluate heart surgeons on any criteria you want — just not patient - survival rates . ’ ”
John Merrow , the education correspondent for “ PBS NewsHour , ” favors instead the swim - instructor analogy :
If half the class nearly drowns when trying to demonstrate what they ’ve learned , we ’d be downright daft not to find fault with the teacher .
—iStockphoto / chyrysh
The logic behind both analogies is seductive .
If someone ’s job is to teach you something and yet you do n’t learn it , or you are n’t able to demonstrate you ’ve learned it , then is n’t the only reasonable conclusion that the teacher has failed you ?
People like Rhee , Bloomberg , and Merrow are so certain of their positions — and so wildly confident in the data — that another perspective seems all but impossible .
The clear implication is that to disagree with them , you ’d have to be mentally ill , hopelessly naive , or wholly heartless .
But as seductive and seemingly straightforward as their logic appears , it also turns out to be deeply flawed .
Merrow ’s analogy , for instance , ignores a very important reality : A 10 - year - old who ’s ostensibly been taught to swim has much greater motivation to successfully display his newfound knowledge in the pool than do students who ’ve been taught fractions in math class .
No math student has ever drowned because he could n’t multiply one - half by one - third .
Rhee , Bloomberg , Merrow , and the many others now beating the fashionable drum of “ data driven ” accountability in education — right on up to U.S. Secretary of Education Arne Duncan and President Barack Obama — seem determined to ignore some basic truths about both education and statistical analysis .
" Numbers impress .
But they also tend to conceal more than they reveal . "
First , when a student fails to flourish , it is rarely the result of one party .
Rather , it tends to be a confluence of confounding factors , often involving parents , teachers , administrators , politicians , neighborhoods , and even the student himself .
If we could collect data that allowed us to parse out these influences accurately , then we might be able to hold not just teachers but all parties responsible .
At present , however , we are light - years away from even understanding how to collect such data .
Second , learning is not always , or easily , captured by high - stakes tests .
A student ’s performance on a given day reflects a whole lot more than what his teacher has or has n’t taught him .
When it comes to school accountability , today ’s favorite catchphrase is “ value added ” assessment .
The idea is that by measuring what students know at both the beginning and the end of the school year , and by simply subtracting the former from the latter , we ’re able to determine precisely how much “ value ” a given teacher has “ added ” to his or her students ’ education .
Then we can make informed decisions about tenure and teacher compensation .
After all , why should n’t teachers whose students learn more than most be better compensated than their colleagues ?
Why should n’t teachers whose students learn little be fired ?
The short answer to both questions is because our current data systems are a complete mess .
We tend to collect the wrong kinds of data , partly to save money and partly because we ’re not all that good at statistical analysis .
The accountability measures of the federal No Child Left Behind Act , for instance , are based on cross-sectional rather than longitudinal data .
In layman ’s terms , this means that we end up comparing how one set of 7th graders performs in a given year with how a different set of 7th graders performs the following year .
Experts in data analysis agree that this is more than a little problematic .
A better system — one based on longitudinal data — would instead compare how the same set of students performs year after year , thereby tracking change over time .
But these are not the data we currently collect , in large part because doing so is difficult and expensive .
There ’s no denying that we love data .
Indeed , we are enthralled by statistical analyses , even — or especially — when we do n’t understand them .
Numbers impress .
But they also tend to conceal more than they reveal .
Every educator knows that teaching is less like open - heart surgery than like conducting an orchestra , as the Stanford University professor Linda Darling - Hammond has suggested .
“ In the same way that conducting looks like hand - waving to the uninitiated , ” she says , “ teaching looks simple from the perspective of students who see a person talking and listening , handing out papers , and giving assignments .
Invisible in both of these performances are the many kinds of knowledge , unseen plans , and backstage moves — the skunkworks , if you will — that allow a teacher to purposefully move a group of students from one set of understandings and skills to quite another over the space of many months . ”
Until we get much better at capturing the nuances of such a performance , we should be wary of attempts to tie teacher tenure and compensation to student test scores .

Lovelock : ' We can't save the planet '
Professor James Lovelock , the scientist who developed Gaia theory , has said it is too late to try and save the planet .
The man who achieved global fame for his theory that the whole earth is a single organism now believes that we can only hope that the earth will take care of itself in the face of completely unpredictable climate change .
Interviewed by Today presenter John Humphrys , videos of which you can see below , he said that while the earth 's future was utterly uncertain , mankind was not aware it had " pulled the trigger " on global warming as it built its civilizations .

What is more , he predicts , the earth 's climate will not conveniently comply with the models of modern climate scientists .
As the record winter cold testifies , he says , global temperatures move in " jerks and jumps " , and we cannot confidently predict what the future holds .

Advertisement Prof Lovelock does not pull his punches on the politicians and scientists who are set to gain from the idea that we can predict climate change and save the planet ourselves .
Scientists , he says , have moved from investigating nature as a vocation , to being caught in a career path where it makes sense to " fudge the data " .

I love to make my own hummus at home .
It 's economical , and I can flavor it to my liking ( lots of garlic ! ) .
My favorite hummus is roasted red bell pepper hummus , but I have to admit I 'm a little lazy today .
I just did n't have it in me to roast up a red bell pepper - or spend the time waiting for it to cool down .
Inspired by my own laziness , I invented this unroasted red bell pepper hummus .
It 's super easy to make , considering it just uses raw red bell pepper .
I punched up the flavor with extra garlic and cayenne pepper .
This hummus is great as a dip or for sandwiches .
I plan on using it tonight to turn some leftover focaccia bread into hummus pizza .
Unroasted Red Bell Pepper Hummus
1 3/4 cups cooked chickpeas or one 16 ounce can , cooking or canning liquid drained and reserved
1/2 red bell pepper , roughly chopped
4 cloves of garlic , chopped
1/4 cup roasted tahini ( raw is okay , but roasted gives you a lot more flavor )
juice of half a lemon
1/2 teaspoon ground cumin
pinch cayenne pepper
salt and pepper to taste
Blend the chickpeas in a food processor until smooth , adding a tablespoon of cooking liquid at a time as needed .
Add the remaining ingredients and blend well .
Refrigerate for at least an hour .
Variations :
Try adding a favorite complementary spice like paprika or coriander .
Blend in a few drops of toasted sesame oil .
Something I almost forgot to mention were a pair of interviews I recently conducted for two different web sites .
The first interview I did for Comic Related took place a while ago and was held up in the publication schedule , but it ’s out there now and I encourage you to check it out .
It ’s a podcast and my segment comes in around the :15 minute mark .
The second interview I did for Comic Attack and it ’s your standard Q&A .
However , I thought the interviewer – Eli Anthony – asked a lot of really good questions .
Not just about Theater Hopper but about webcomics in general .
So if you want my opinion about how to establish yourself in this crazy business , swing over to Comic Attack and enjoy the interview !
I just wanted to say thanks to both Comic Related and Comic Attack for getting in touch with me to conduct these interviews .
I love to hear myself talk , so if you have a web site or podcast that you ’d like me to contribute an interview to , I ’d be happy to help .
Just send me an e-mail at theaterhopper@hotmail.com and we can work out the details !
For a list of my previous press appearances , be sure to check out the Press page under the About section here on the site .

Stolen Data Prompts Wave of Remorse German Authorities Expect Tax Evaders to Fess Up
The German government says it plans to buy a CD containing customer data apparently stolen from British bank HSBC 's operation in Switzerland .
The move has enraged Swiss officials , but it already appears to be bearing fruit .
Berlin expects a wave of tax evaders to turn themselves in over the coming days in the hope of avoiding prosecution .

Funniest reaction to hell - spouter ever .
We had our own campus preacher at the University of North Carolina , but I never got to see a counter - demonstration like this one at Yale :
If you ca n’t view the image , it ’s a picture of 25 - year - old evangelist street preacher Jesse Morrell , who has been preaching about the “ evils of sin ” on Yale ’s campus , wearing a sandwich - board reading : “ REPENT : Fornicators , Homosexuals , Liars , Thieves , Masturbators , Obama Voters , Buddhists , Dirty Dancers , Hindus , Gangster Rappers , Muslims , Drunkards , Feminists , Immodest Women , Democrats , Liberals , Evolutionists , Atheists , Potheads , Sodomites .
HELL AWAITS YOU ! ”

Melissa McEwen at ShakespearesSister provides a description
My goodness , I think I fall into somewhere about 10 of those categories ….
I do n’t think this demonstration will help poor Jesse Morrell , who will likely come away from the experience more convinced than ever that he lives in a sinful society desperately in need of his preaching .
But the counter - demonstration definitely helps everyone watching .
It ’s good to remind everyone that these sentiments can be laughed at and deserve ridicule in our society .
Signornò da L'Espresso in edicola
Quando l’Unione andò al governo nel 2006 e ricascò in tutti gli errori della volta precedente , Curzio Maltese parlò di “ coalizione a ripetere ” .
Nel frattempo è nato il Pd , ha cambiato tre segretari in due anni , ha perso tutte le elezioni possibili e ora si presenta alle regionali in formazione Arlecchino : ora con la sinistra ora senza , ora con Di Pietro ora senza , ora con l ’Udc ora senza .
In questa carnevalata c’è un unico comun denominatore : l’allergia alla questione morale e , in certi casi , pure a quella legale .
In tutte le regioni del Sud i candidati del centrosinistra sono inquisiti o addirittura imputati .
In Campania Enzo De Luca vanta due rinvii a giudizio per associazione per delinquere , truffa , concussione e falso .
In Puglia Nichi Vendola è ancora indagato per tentata concussione per le spartizioni nelle Asl , anche se due pm su tre sono orientati ad archiviare .
In Basilicata il governatore ricandidato Vito de Filippo ha ricevuto l’estate scorsa l’avviso di chiusura indagini ( che di solito prelude alla richiesta di rinvio a giudizio ) per favoreggiamento a un imprenditore ritenuto l’asso pigliatutto degli appalti per l’estrazione del petrolio .
In Calabria , nel processo “ Why Not ” , il governatore replicante Agazio Loiero ha appena sub ìto una richiesta di condanna a 1 anno e mezzo per due abusi d’ufficio .
In Sicilia , dove non si vota , il Pd sostiene la giunta anomala di Raffaele Lombardo , indagato per abuso d’ufficio dalla Procura e dalla Corte dei Conti per le assunzioni facili di venti giornalisti strapagati nel suo ufficio stampa .
Così , per la prima volta in 15 anni di Seconda Repubblica , il centrodestra candida personaggi intonsi da guai giudiziari e può rinfacciare al centrosinistra di non fare altrettanto .
Il che rende flebili sino all ’afonia le richieste di dimissioni avanzate da Bersani per Guido Bertolaso , appena indagato , e incomprensibile l’uscita di scena del sindaco di Bologna , Flavio Del Bono , per un ’indagine da quattro spiccioli .
Mentre l’Italia è scossa da scandali giudiziari che , secondo un uomo prudente come Paolo Mieli , “ possono far saltare il sistema come nel ‘ 92 ” , il centrosinistra si mozza la lingua da sè , privandosi di un argomento di sicura presa elettorale come le “ liste pulite ” .
Anzi lo regala alla maggioranza berlusconiana , con un ribaltamento paradossale e autolesionistico che nemmeno Tafazzi avrebbe saputo escogitare .
Ma non basta ancora : il
Pd non dice una parola sulla ricandidatura in Lombardia di Roberto Formigoni , eletto per ben tre volte fin dal 1995 , in barba alla legge 165 del 2004 che vieta tre mandati di fila ai presidenti di regione .
Formigoni è ineleggibile , ma da sinistra non s’ode uno squillo perché è ineleggibile anche Vasco Errani , che governa l’Emilia Romagna dal 2000 e si candida per il terzo mandato .
Finora molti elettori disgustati si turavano il naso e votavano il centrosinistra perché era meno peggio di Berlusconi .
Ora , dopo 15 anni di inseguimento , sta per eguagliare il peggio .
Non è meraviglioso ?

A third of children are now growing up without parents living under the same roof .
Each of the 150,000 to 200,000 separations per year is a source of sadness for the children involved , children who yearn – however unrealistically – for mummy and daddy to live together happily ever after .
But those partings can be handled more or less well .
“ The emotionally healthy 18 year - olds , ” says Judge Nicholas Crichton , who works in the family courts , “ are those who can say , ' Whatever happened between my parents , I knew I was loved and that I was free to love both parents without feeling guilty .’? ”

Former US President Bill Clinton is " in good spirits " after undergoing a heart procedure at a hospital in New York City , his doctor has said .
Cardiologist Dr Allan Schwartz said the insertion of two devices known as stents in an artery had gone smoothly .
The 63 - year - old had not had a heart attack and was likely to be discharged on Friday , Dr Schwartz added .
Mr Clinton 's wife Hillary , the US Secretary of State , and their daughter Chelsea have joined him at his bedside .
The state department has said Mrs Clinton will still travel to Qatar and Saudi Arabia at the weekend as planned , although her flight will leave later to allow her to spend more time in New York .
' Good spirits ' [ Mr Clinton ] said the efforts in Haiti were too important for him to be laid up for too long
White House statement
Profile : Bill Clinton
The stents - wire - mesh tubes that help the flow of blood - were placed in a coronary artery that had become blocked since Mr Clinton had a quadruple - bypass operation in 2004 .
Speaking to media outside the Columbia Campus of New York Presbyterian Hospital on Thursday evening , Dr Schwartz said the former president had been feeling discomfort in his chest for several days .
" Of the four bypass grafts that he had six years ago , one of the bypass grafts was completely blocked , " the cardiologist said .
HOW A CORONARY STENT WORKS 1 .
The stent is a wire mesh tube used to hold open narrow arteries .
It is guided into place by a catheter 2 .
Once in position the catheter is inflated and the stent is expanded 3 .
The catheter is removed and the stent remains in place to help keep blood flowing through the artery " The artery that had been supplied previously by this bypass graft was opened by placing the two stents . "
He added : " President Clinton has since been up and walking around and visiting with his family .
He is in good spirits . "
The BBC's Steve Kingstone in Washington says it is being stressed that Mr Clinton 's diet and active lifestyle were not triggers for this scare .
The former Arkansas governor became known for his love of fast food and jogging during his two terms as president .
He later set up the William J Clinton Foundation to promote and address international humanitarian causes such as treatment and prevention of HIV / Aids and global warming .
Last year , he was appointed UN special envoy to Haiti , where he has been working in recent weeks to help the relief effort in the wake of the devastating earthquake there on 12 January .
The White House said Mr Clinton had told President Barack Obama he felt " absolutely great " after the procedure .
" [ Mr Clinton ] said that the efforts in Haiti were too important for him to be laid up for too long and hopes he 'll be ready to get back to work as soon as possible , " the White House said in a statement .
BILL CLINTON Born on 19 August 1946 in Hope , Arkansas Elected Democratic governor of Arkansas in 1978 Becomes US president in 1993 , defeating George Bush Sr Re-elected president in 1996 , beating Bob Dole Cleared of all charges in his impeachment trial over Monica Lewinsky sex scandal in 1999 Launches William J Clinton Foundation after stepping down as president in 2001 Appointed UN special envoy to Haiti in 2009 A friend of Mr Clinton told ABC News that he had been suffering from a cold and had been worn out from a trip to Haiti last week .
Stents are used to keep an artery open after it is unclogged in the angioplasty .
Doctors thread a tube through a blood vessel in the groin to a blocked artery , inflate a balloon to flatten the clog , and slide the stent into place .
One of the most common medical procedures worldwide , more than a million angioplasties are carried out in the US alone each year .
Dr Clyde Yancy , the president of the American Heart Association , said it was " not unexpected " that Mr Clinton needed new stents .
Patients often required another procedure five to 10 years after a bypass or angioplasty because new clogs tended to develop , he said .
" This kind of disease is progressive .
It 's not a one - time event , so it really points out the need for constant surveillance , " Dr Yancy told the Associated Press .

It is astonishing that everything about the credit crisis is still discussed in the technical terms of economics .
Although , as most commentators agree , almost all economists failed to predict the financial crisis that swept through the western economies in 2008 - we still slavishly discuss and analyse it in their technical terms .
Whether it is straight journalism , or columnists ' rants , or even imaginative responses like the play Enron , the problem is described either as a technical system that went wrong or as a set of strange inventions that were then corruptly used by bad and greedy people .
And in doing this all the journalists , and the critics , and the playwrights earnestly try and explain to us the system in the terms , and the framework of " market - speak " created by the economists and the financiers .
The high point of this came last week when lead items on TV news were devoted to the letters written by two opposing groups of economists .
It was the height of absurdity as economists from the opposing camps came on News - 24 to announce pompously that " this is far more important than politics " .
As David Blanchflower ( ex-member of the Monetary Policy Committee ) pointed out in a really good piece in the New Statesman - HERE - they have absolutely no basis for any of their claims .
The reason is that they have no idea what is going to happen to the economy in the next 12 months .
But more than that - perhaps the economists are the problem ?
That they themselves cannot see the full dimensions of the project of which they have been a part .
But still we listen to them , and still our journalists use their language and assumptions .
Which means that despite the disasters we are still trapped in the economists ' world .
But the moment you pull back and look at that world from a wider perspective strange things start to emerge .
When the neoliberal project first began in 1979 with Mrs Thatcher the idea was that politicians would give away power to the markets and the state would shrink .
Over the past 15 years the idea of the " market " has been extended to practically every area of society - education , health , even the arts .
But to make this happen those running the neoliberal project had to enforce it by creating vast and intricate performance indicators and feedback systems ( which in many cases led to wide scale absurdities ) .
And to do this they used the mighty power of the state .
The crucial thing is that these systems had practically nothing to do with the original idea of the " market " .
They are actually a strange pseudo - scientific piece of planning engineered by politicians and groups of technocrats that borrowed far more from cold - war ideas of feedback engineering and cybernetics than from the risky roller coaster of the market .
And to create the systems they had to greatly enlarge the state and the extent of its power , which is the very opposite of the vision of a free - market utopia .
And when you examine the roots of the neoliberal idea of the market it gets odder still .
The ideas that rose up in the post - war years that captured the imagination of people like Mrs Thatcher are actually a very strange mutation of capitalism .
If you listen to interviews with Friedrich Hayek he talks far more like a cold war systems engineer discussing information signals and feedback than Adam Smith with his theories of Moral Sentiment .
While the roots of the technical systems that the banks created to manage risk also lie back in the cybernetic dreams of the 1950s and 60s .
Dreams not of progress through the dynamism of markets - but of using computers to create a balanced , almost frozen world .
- just like in the Cold War .
Which raises the question - have we misunderstood what we have lived through since 1979 ?
We think it was the resurgence of capitalism .
But maybe it was something very different ?
Something that we can't see properly because we are still trapped in the economists ' world and their mindset .
I am putting up a film I made as part of the Pandora 's Box series - because I think it is relevant .
The Pandora 's
Box series looked at how scientific ideas were taken up and used by politicians and other powerful groups to justify what were essentially political attempts to change and re-engineer the world .
In this episode I argue that Mrs Thatcher 's monetarist experiment of the 1980s was not just giving power away to the markets .
In reality it was a pseudo - scientific attempt to re-engineer Britain that had far more in common with the preceding Old Labour attempts at " scientific " economic planning that it did with any free market theory .
And I think it would be good to pull back and look at the recent crisis in the same terms .
The film also includes the most fabulous machine I have ever seen .
A giant interconnected system driven by water to model the whole British economy .
The first free Unix - like operating system available on the IBM PC was 386BSD , of which Linus Torvalds said in 1993 : " If 386BSD had been available when I started on Linux , Linux would probably never have happened . "
386BSD was a direct descendant of Bill Joy 's Berkeley Software Distribution , which was the core of SunOS and other proprietary Unix distributions .
386BSD and the patchkit for the port to the Intel chip formed the basis for FreeBSD , NetBSD and OpenBSD , which have carried the torch for BSD and open source Unix to this day .
Lars Wirzenius , a student friend of Linus Torvalds , recalled : " FreeBSD did n't exist then .
386BSD did , but it would n't have worked on my computer , since it required a 387 co-processor .
I used SCO Xenix from fall 1991 to spring or summer of 1992 , until Linux matured enough to be a usable environment for writing code . "
Alan Cox tells a similar story .
When he saw the 386BSD announce he thought " Woah !
- finally there is something worth running on a PC . "
The trouble was that 386BSD needed floating point hardware , and Linux did n't .
" I had n't got the floating point chip , which was 70 quid at the time , so I installed Linux , " he said .
386BSD was a long time coming .
The first public release ( Version 0.0 ) was on St. Patrick 's Day , 1991 , and was barely functional .
Most users had to wait until Bastille Day , 1992 for the first functional release ( Version 0.1 ) .
A year or two earlier , a couple of small fixes , and Linux may never have seen the light of day .
What ifs
The most popular of the BSDs is FreeBSD .
FreeBSD , like the other BSDs , had a 15 year start on Linux , based as it was on BSD Unix , which had played a large part in defining the standards for operating systems and networking that have held good to the present day .
For much of its early history , FreeBSD was technically superior to Linux and still retains an enviable reputation for reliability .
So it is interesting to speculate why Linux , and not FreeBSD , became the flag bearer , not only for free software , but for Unix - like operating systems .
BSD had been around for a long time , and Linux grew from small beginnings .
Most of the early contributors to Linux and the projects that sprang from the early success of Linux , were hobbyists and students with no great history in computing , yet GNU / Linux , not FreeBSD , was adopted by the traditional Unix companies to become the universal operating system that Unix had promised to be .
Could have been a contender FreeBSD did n't stagnate , or lose , and is probably healthier that it ever was , big on networking devices , friendly with web hosting companies and big with Apple , but has n't had the impact of Linux on the rest of the computing industry , despite an enviable record for technical excellence .
Any number of reasons can be given for this .
During the period 1992 - 1994 , when GNU / Linux was beginning to emerge as a viable option for Intel servers , the BSDs were the subject of a copyright dispute between USL and BSDi , which was indisputably a setback to uptake and development , but the BSDs bounced back from this setback and were the favoured solution for many web and ftp servers during the dotcom boom .
In 1999 , " Walnut Creek CD-ROM set the world record for most bytes of network traffic processed in 24 hours by a single host :
One single - processor PII box ( a then - famous FreeBSD ftp server ) handled 1.39 terabytes .
( This burst of traffic was , ironically , occasioned by the release on that machine of Slackware 4.0 . ) "
Freedom is as freedom does
The persistent argument between Linux and BSD users surrounds the meaning of , and the parameters around , the word ' freedom ' , and how this is reflected in the licensing of the software .
The BSD licence is permissive , in that the code can be repackaged in any form , re-labelled and absorbed into proprietary formats , as long as attribution is given .
Changes to the code can be passed on in a closed format .
The GPL also allows third parties to take the code , repackage it , and pass it on in any form they wish , but ensures reciprocity by obliging those who distribute the code to pass on any changes under the same licence , thus preventing forks and preserving the free and open source nature of the code .
BSD users have always argued that a permissive licence is more friendly to business , protects ' IP ' and offers real freedom to the end user who is able to do as he or she wishes with the software .
Advocates of Free Software argue that the GPL not only guarantees the freedom of the code , but also helps to build recopricity and community , and ensures open standards and the continuity of the code which are vital if people are going to interoperate in a networked world .
After the war The Unix companies had their fingers burnt with the fracturing of Unix and open standards during the eighties and nineties .
If they had learned anything from the " Unix wars " , it was that proprietary operating systems , even if they are your own , cost money and create hurdles for other parts of your business - unless you have a monopoly on the operating system , as Microsoft does , or in its own corner of the market , as Apple does .
Solaris , which was developed by Sun Microsystems , was n't quite like Irix ( SGI ) , which was n't quite like HPUX ( HP ) , which was n't quite like AIX ( IBM ) , which was n't quite like Tru64 ( DEC ) .
And none of them necessarily played well together , which complicated the market for ISVs and inhibited the development of common interfaces and utilities .
Unix had been touted as the universal operating system , and each of these companies was pouring huge resources into developing proprietary versions of the same operating system at the expense of the hardware , services and userland software that were their core business .
Liberating the OS
The arrival of GNU / Linux opened up new possibilities .
Once more than one hardware company had formed a commitment to Linux it became obvious that there was a mutual advantage in contributing back to the project , and they did .
The framework that made this possible was the GPL .
The release of core chunks of corporate code accelerated the development of Linux and ensured its success in the enterprise , enhanced by its portability across a wide range of hardware .
Adoption of FreeBSD was equally plausible on a technical level but , assuming that the BSDs were ever considered for a similar role the BSD licence made it easier to fork the code , which retracted the advantages of being " open source " - which were commonality , interoperability , and the shared benefits of collaboration with your competitors .
GNU / Linux also had the political advantage of being an independent implementation of the POSIX specification , based on Unix Sys V R4 , which was the basis for commonality among the proprietary versions of Unix .
The GPL encourages commoditisation , and at the system level , commoditisation reduces costs and benefits everybody .
Commoditisation of the operating system ensures commonality of standards .
This makes it easier to port software between different machines and architectures , and makes it easier to design hardware itself , which increasingly operates within very slim margins .
Dozens of companies contribute to the Linux kernel , and get the benefits of the contributions of all the others .
They do not contribute out of generosity , but because this effect has made it possible to port anything to anything at a vastly reduced cost , because the costs are shared .
This effect may or may not have been a factor in the original adoption of GNU / Linux , but has worked to the long term advantage of its many participants .
Very few companies are in the pure operating system business .
The operating system is a facilitator , not the business .
Companies do n't use GNU / Linux because of sentimental attachment to Linux , or the GPL , or " open source " .
They use GNU / Linux and free software because it makes business sense .
And the GPL , which gives assurance of the continued freedom and commonality of the code , is the driver behind it .
Changing the world If FreeBSD had been licensed under the GPL things might have been different .
But then again , probably not .
The BSD hackers have an aphorism that speaks some truths , which says " BSD is what you get when a bunch of Unix hackers sit down to try to port a Unix system to the PC .
Linux is what you get when a bunch of PC hackers sit down and try to write a Unix system for the PC . "
This aphorism speaks of a difference in the cultures that is greater than the words contained within it .
Free software was a world changing idea that the Linux community managed to both capture and encapsulate , and the atmosphere of do - it - yourself - anyone can do that - I can do this - you can do that - which surrounded GNU / Linux made it possible for everyone and anyone to become involved - and they did , and ported GNU / Linux to everything and anything , and if it did n't work , there was every chance that it might later .

Two bombs in the Pakistani city of Karachi have killed at least 25 people and injured more than 50 .
In the first blast , a motorbike laden with explosives hit a bus carrying Shia Muslims to a religious procession and exploded , killing 12 people .
An hour later , another bomb exploded outside the entrance to the emergency ward of the hospital where the victims of the first attack were being treated .
At least 13 people were killed in the second attack .
The bombings happened in spite of tight security across Pakistan .
ANALYSIS Syed Shoaib Hasan , BBC News
This is the first time such a double attack has hit Karachi .
Although no - one has yet accepted responsibility , the Taliban have often used such tactics in the North West Frontier Province .
The attack is likely to fuel more violence in what is already a volatile metropolis .
Karachi is already reeling from weeks of unrest due to targeted political killings .
These started after political tensions boiled over following a similar attack on a Shia procession in December , which killed more than 40 people .
Forty days ago , during the last major Shia festival , a suicide bomber killed 25 worshippers in the city .
Shia Muslims are marking the end of the Arbaeen religious festival , with Friday being the final and most important day of 40 days of mourning for the Prophet Muhammad 's grandson .
Also on Friday , at least 40 Shia Muslims were killed in the Iraqi city of Karbala as they took part in a major Arbaeen event .
Approximately a million Shia Muslim pilgrims are in Karbala to visit the Imam Hussein shrine at the end of commemorations .
Sectarian tension Karachi police now think both bombs were remotely detonated .
The first blast took place on a commercial street near the main Sharah - e - Faisal road connecting Karachi airport with the city .
The bus that was attacked was one of dozens used to transport Shia pilgrims from all over the city to a central procession .
In pictures : Shia festival attacks
Who are the Shia ?
The attack injured about 50 people , who were taken to Jinnah hospital .
About an hour later there was a large blast just outside the emergency ward of the hospital .
The BBC's Jaffer Rizvi , who was at the scene at the time , said there was a huge panic inside the hospital .
Hundreds of people mourning those killed in the first attack had gathered there and were shouting slogans condemning both militants and the government .
Police officer Ghulam Nabi also told Reuters news agency another bomb had been defused after being discovered inside a TV set on the hospital premises .
The Shia community in Karachi has declared that Saturday will be a day of mourning .
Sectarian tension between the Shia minority and the Sunni majority rose after the December attack , and riots erupted .
Tension remains high , and paramilitary troops were deployed in the city days ago amid deadly clashes between rival political groups .
The Shia -Sunni schism originates from a dispute soon after the death of the Prophet Muhammad over who should lead the Muslims .
Sunnis remain the majority globally , with Shias estimated to number about 10 % of all Muslims .

Just getting started in design ?
Tempted to try out crowdsourcing or spec work ?
Before you head down that path check out these 99 alternatives to build your portfolio , expand your skill set , and make a few bucks .
Earlier this week I wrote a post that cast a bit of positive light on the otherwise shunned idea of crowdsourcing and speculative work ( read : One Good Thing About Crowdsourcing ) .
I made the claim that it was okay for beginning designers to try their hand at such places as 99 Designs and offered a few reasons why it could further their career .
After much deliberation – and a few swift kicks in the pants from my commenters – I felt it necessary to provide a follow up post that offers some alternatives to spec work for those just getting started in design .
So I sat down and gathered up 99 ideas for ways designers could build their portfolio , gain some experience designing , and possibly make a few bucks .
I ca n’t claim to have tried all of these ideas but I know there are many that work well .
And if you ca n’t find something on this list to get your design motor running , maybe you ’re in the wrong field .
I ’ve Got 99 Ideas but Crowdsourcing Ain’t One
I ’m sure there are many other options out there .
Be creative and feel free to share any in the comment section below .
And if you still feel the need , go visit 99designs and try your luck .

London , England ( CNN ) --
It is still regarded as one of the greatest upsets in World Cup history ; the day the U.S. shocked the world .
In the group stages of the 1950 World Cup finals in Brazil , center back Walter Bahr marshaled his collection of semi-professionals ( mainly postmen and miners ) to a 1 - 0 victory against arguably the best team in the world : England .
The victory over America 's former colonial masters created headlines around the world , but one of Bahr 's overriding memories of the event was the lack of interest it caused back home .
" The only person who met me at the airport when we flew [ back ] was my wife , " recalls Bahr , who was a high school teacher in his home city of Philadelphia at the time .
Have your say on the World Cup .
Click here to become a CNN Super Fan .
" England was the king of soccer , everyone thought they would be in the final but the papers had nothing in there .
The Philadelphia paper , I still have a copy of it , it has a two - inch column .
I do n't think I did a single interview about the World Cup until 25 years later . "
While the rest of the world reacted with stunned disbelief -- legend has it several British newspapers did n't report the score at first , fearing that it had been mistyped and England had really won 10 - 0 -- back home Team USA 's exploits had been met with almost complete indifference .
A clear illustration of the long , and not always happy , relationship the U.S. has had with soccer .
As almost every nation on Earth embraced its rapid spread around the globe , the U.S. remained one of the few , resolute outposts of abstention .
But why has it been so difficult for Americans to take soccer to their hearts ?
Colonial legacy
Part of the answer can be found in soccer 's parentage .
While the British were using colonial missionaries to spread soccer , the U.S. chose instead to invent its own national pastimes , in a bid to aid nation building .
" In the 1880s and 1890s the game was being exported by English missionaries , or mercenaries as some would see it , to the U.S. , " explains David Wangerin , author of " Soccer in a Football World : The Story of America 's Forgotten Game . "
" Soccer was pushed out by the rugby variation [ of the game ] , Americans thought it was their destiny to devise games on their own without relying on the old country .
There was no interest in games that were seen as un-American .
That persisted right up to the 1970s . "
So when the newly codified version of association football , or soccer , arrived on America 's shores , a different type of football was already evolving .
The U.S. universities of Princeton , Yale , Harvard and Columbia each played their own versions of the game , some using their hands , others using their feet .
But it was Harvard 's rugby - based rules that largely won out in a historic meeting between the colleges in Springfield , Massachusetts , in 1876 , rules which would eventually lead to the game 's distinctly " American " character with its touchdowns , snaps and lines of scrimmage .
Immigrant initiative
" There was a desire amongst immigrants to fit in , " says Wangerin .
" Multiculturalism was n't high up on the American agenda back then .
You wanted to fit in so you played American football . "
By the turn of the 20th century , soccer was being kept alive by immigrant communities in pockets along the East Coast , concentrated in cities like New York , Baltimore , Pittsburgh and Philadelphia .
Teams were usually attached to big factories , like the successful but short - lived Bethlehem Steel FC , and by 1921 a small professional league -- the American Soccer League -- had been set up .
For a young Walter Bahr growing up in Philadelphia , and at a time when the American national team finished third at the very first World Cup in 1930 , there was only one path to follow .
" In my neighborhood , Kensington , only two sports were played baseball and soccer , and baseball was for the summer , " recalls Bahr .
" Philadelphia was divided by ethnic groups and a lot of it was based on what work was available .
My neighborhood was a textiles area , so we had a big British influence , Scotch and Irish too .
St. Louis had a lot of soccer through the Catholic Church because they had an order of Irish priests and kept the game going in their parish . "
Part - time passion
At 15 he joined the Philadelphia Nationals and , after the interruptions of the Second World War , won three league titles with them before being selected for the World Cup squad destined for Brazil .
But the part - timers found it difficult getting any kind of playing time before the tournament .
" In 1950 we played Besiktas of Istanbul , in St. Louis .
They beat us badly , 5 - 0 .
It was a tryout as much as anything , and then we faced an English select team with Stanley Matthews playing , in New York , and they won 1 - 0 .
Those were the first times the World Cup team played together .
The next day we left for Brazil .
It took us two and a half days to get down there ! "
After the team 's shock victory against England , Bahr went on to enjoy a long career as both a player and a coach , but the victory against the old rivals failed to sear soccer into the public consciousness .
" We never had our own stadiums so we played on baseball fields like Ebbets Field , " says Bahr .
" In 1953 we played an English select team .
It was only three years after the World Cup , the same teams that played in Brazil , at Yankee Stadium on a Sunday .
But the Yankees had final say on the games ; if it was bad weather they had the right to call it off in case we ruined the field .
There was a torrential downpour that morning and they postponed it until Monday .
Only 7,000 turned up in the end . "
The awkward alien
Normal service had been restored , England winning 6 - 3 in front of a half - empty stadium .
The American Soccer League limped on in various incarnations until the 1980s , briefly tussling with the superstars of the North American Soccer League for supremacy .
But soccer could never quite shake off its tag of being an alien , foreign game .
" Soccer wo n't ever reach the height of baseball or [ American ] football and it probably wo n't be as popular as ice hockey , " suggests Wangerin .
" But it will find its place .
One analogy I 've read is that soccer will be more like a boutique coffee shop , rather than a massive supermarket . "
For now , though , Bahr and the handful of surviving teammates must manage the many interview requests from U.S. magazines , newspapers and TV networks eager for their story ahead of June 's World Cup finals in South Africa , where the USA will once again face England .
Was he surprised by all the attention he now gets from the media ?
" You can say victory has a thousand fathers , " laughs Bahr , paraphrasing former U.S. President John F. Kennedy .
" But defeat is a bastard .
That 's an old one for you . "
It was n't meant to go this way .
For months we were told that the efforts to ban the construction of minarets in Switzerland were doomed .
The polls suggested that around 34 percent of the Swiss population would vote for this shocking initiative .
On Nov. 27 , in a meeting organized in Lausanne , Switzerland , more than 800 students , professors , and citizens were convinced that the referendum would see the motion rejected , and so were focused instead on how to turn this silly initiative into a more positive future .
That confidence was shattered today , as 57 percent of the Swiss population did as the Union Démocratique du Centre ( UDC ) had urged them and approved a ban of the minarets – a worrying sign that this populist party may be closest to the people 's fears and expectations .
For the first time since 1893 an initiative that singles out one community , with a clear discriminatory essence , has been approved in Switzerland .
Hopefully the ban will be rejected at the European level , but regardless , the results of the vote are no less alarming .
What is happening in Switzerland , the land of my birth ?
There are only four minarets in Switzerland , so why is it that it is there that this initiative has been launched ?
My country , like many in Europe , is facing a national reaction to the new visibility of European Muslims .
The minarets are but a pretext – the UDC wanted first to launch a campaign against the traditional Islamic methods of slaughtering animals but was afraid of testing the sensitivity of Swiss Jews , and instead turned its sights on the minaret as a suitable symbol .
Every European country has its specific symbols or topics through which European Muslims are targeted .
In France it is the head scarf or burqa ; in Germany , mosques ; in Britain , violence ; cartoons in Denmark ; homosexuality in the Netherlands – and so on .
It is important to look beyond these symbols and understand what is really happening in Europe in general and in Switzerland in particular :
While European countries and citizens are going through a real and deep identity crisis , the new visibility of Muslims is problematic – and it is scary .
At the very moment Europeans find themselves asking , in a globalizing , migratory world , " What are our roots ? , " " Who are we ? , " " What will our future look like ? , " they see around them new citizens , new skin colors , new symbols to which they are unaccustomed .
Over the last two decades Islam has become connected to so many controversial debates – violence , extremism , freedom of speech , gender discrimination , and forced marriage , to name a few – it is difficult for ordinary citizens to embrace this new Muslim presence as a positive factor .
There is a great deal of fear and a palpable mistrust .
Who are they ?
What do they want ?
And the questions are charged with further suspicion as the idea of Islam being an expansionist religion is intoned .
Do these people want to Islamize our country ?
The campaign against the minarets was fueled by just these anxieties and allegations .
Voters were drawn to the cause by a manipulative appeal to popular fears and emotions .
Posters featured a woman wearing a burqa with the minarets drawn as weapons on a colonized Swiss flag .
The claim was made that Islam is fundamentally incompatible with Swiss values .
( The UDC has in the past demanded my citizenship be revoked because I was defending Islamic values too openly . )
Its media strategy was simple but effective .
Provoke controversy wherever it can be inflamed .
Spread a sense of victimhood among the Swiss people :
We are under siege , the Muslims are silently colonizing us , and we are losing our very roots and culture .
This strategy worked .
The Swiss majority are sending a clear message to their Muslim fellow citizens :
We do not trust you , and the best Muslim for us is the Muslim we cannot see .
Who is to be blamed ?
I have been repeating for years to Muslim people that they have to be positively visible , active , and proactive within their respective Western societies .
In Switzerland over the past few months , Muslims have striven to remain hidden in order to avoid a clash .
It would have been more useful to create new alliances with all these Swiss organizations and political parties that were clearly against the initiative .
Swiss Muslims have their share of responsibility but one must add that the political parties in Europe , as in Switzerland , have become cowed , and shy from any courageous policies toward religious and cultural pluralism .
It is as if the populists set the tone and the rest follow .
They fail to assert that Islam is by now a Swiss and a European religion and that Muslim citizens are largely " integrated . "
That we face common challenges , such as unemployment , poverty , and violence – challenges we must face together .
We cannot blame the populists alone – it is a wider failure , a lack of courage , a terrible and narrow - minded lack of trust in their new Muslim citizens .

Sen .
John McCain wants to call in the cavalry to defend Arizona from illegal immigrants crossing the border from Mexico�and to shore up his own right flank .
McCain asked the Obama administration Monday to send National Guard troops to the border after a prominent Arizona rancher was found shot to death on his own property .
Rancher 's murder fuels firestorm
" I am asking you and the administration to immediately reconsider your position and send National Guard troops to our southern border region , " McCain wrote in a letter to Homeland Security Secretary Janet Napolitano .
Last year , the administration denied a request from Arizona Gov. Jan Brewer for National Guard protection for the border .
McCain supported comprehensive immigration reform during the Bush years �legislation that would have provided a path to citizenship for the more than 10 million immigrants currently living in the U.S. illegally .
The position angered many on the right , but it 's a position he 's backed away from in the face a stiff primary challenge from former Rep. J.D. Hayworth .
Hayworth , a darling of Tea Party activists , has repeatedly attacked McCain as wrong on immigration .

A state senator said Thursday he wants to ask voters to impose a special tax on medical marijuana .
Sen . Chris Romer , D - Denver , said he intends to amend a bill that creates regulations for medical - marijuana dispensaries to include a provision that places an excise tax on medical marijuana , similar to the special excise tax that already exists for alcohol .
Because of the Taxpayer ’s Bill of Rights , that provision — if first approved by lawmakers — must be put before the voters before the tax could be imposed .
Romer wants to use the resulting revenue — which he hopes to be about $ 10 million to $ 15 million annually — to fund drug education programs for teens , substance - abuse treatment centers , and medical care for veterans and the poor .
Romer said he is concerned the state ’s boom in medical - marijuana use could create a companion boom in recreational marijuana use among young people .
The idea received a cautious reception from medical - marijuana advocates .
Attorney Rob Corry said he ’s intrigued by the idea but would first need to see more specifics .
“ With taxation comes legitimacy , ” Corry said .
“ This industry is one of the few that is asking to be taxed and legitimized to join the rest of the business world . ”
The measure would be inserted into House Bill 1284 , which creates new requirements for the state ’s medical - marijuana dispensaries , and is just one of several changes the bill will likely see when it comes up for its first hearing next week .
A civil trial that opened Wednesday in Portland will show that the
knew it had child molesters in its leadership for decades but kept the problem quiet , according to an attorney for one of the victims .
The case , expected to attract national attention , centers on a Portland man who confessed to Scout leaders that he had molested 17 Scouts but was allowed to continue joining boys in Scouting activities .
On a broader scale , the case is one of the first to bring into open court hundreds of confidential files that the 100 - year - old organization kept on Scout leaders and others suspected of sexually abusing boys .
Though the Scouts , based in Texas , have been sued dozens of times over allegations of sexual abuse , most cases have been settled out of court , keeping files from becoming public .
Patrick Boyle , the Washington , D.C. - based author of " Scout 's Honor : Sexual Abuse in America 's Most Trusted Institution , " said Wednesday that this case may be only the second time such files have been used in a trial .
" It 's very embarrassing to them , " Boyle said .
The case that opened Wednesday in Multnomah County Circuit Court was brought by
, a Portland attorney who specializes in child sex abuse cases , and involves a former assistant Scoutmaster named
.
The lawsuit , brought by a victim of Dykes listed in court documents by the pseudonym Jack Doe , seeks at least $ 14 million from the Boy Scouts of America and the
.
The Scouts , Clark said in opening statements , knew it had pedophiles in its organization yet allowed Dykes and others to continue to associate with its members .
He held up file folder after file folder from Boy Scout headquarters that he said proves the organization knew of at least 1,000 suspected child molesters from 1965 to 1985 .
" Those decisions led naturally , predictably and foreseeably to the abuse of boys like " my client , he said .
Attorneys for the two Scouting organizations said in their opening statements that their clients were n't at fault .
Boy Scouts of America attorney Charles T. Smith said he would call experts who would testify that sexual abuse of children was n't a problem specific to the Scouts but one that occurs throughout society .
He also told jurors that child molesters are difficult to track and that the organization kept confidential files on them in an effort to protect children .
" These people move , " Smith said .
" They go from state to state .
And they change their names or their birth dates or they do something to try to slip back in . "
The trial , expected to last four weeks , focuses on Doe , who was a Boy Scout when he was abused by Dykes in the 1980s .
The Oregonian is not naming Doe , now 37 , because he is a victim of sex abuse .
A pedophile 's history
Who :
Timur Dykes , 53
Victims :
Confessed to or was convicted of molesting more than 20 boys , most of them Boy Scouts .
First conviction :
Arrested in 1983 on accusations of molesting several boys .
Pleaded guilty to attempted second - degree sexual abuse and received probation .
Second conviction :
Charged in 1985 with molesting boys .
Pleaded guilty to first - degree sexual abuse and sexual penetration with a foreign object .
His sentence is unclear .
Third conviction :
Found guilty in 1994 after a nine - day trial in which several boys said he molested them .
He was sentenced to 18 years in prison but was released in 2005 .
Today :
A registered sex offender and on post - prison supervision until 2013 .
Listed as a transient living at Southwest First Avenue and Burnside Street .
According to Clark , Dykes was 25 when he met a 9 - year - old Doe in 1981 .
Later , Doe joined a Southeast Portland Scout troop where Dykes was an assistant Scoutmaster .
The troop met at a building , in the 9900 block of Southeast Caruthers Street , owned by the
.
The boys also often went to Dykes ' apartment to work on merit badges or spend the night , with their parents ' approval , Clark told jurors .
" All of the parents trusted Timur Dykes because he was a Scout leader , " Clark said .
The apartment , Clark said , was like a playground for boys .
" He had ferrets , " Clark said .
" He had snakes , including a boa constrictor .
...
He had a knife collection .
He gave ( Doe ) french fries for breakfast on a regular basis . "
In January 1983 , the mother of a Scout who said he had been molested by Dykes went to Gordon McEwen , a Mormon bishop who headed the local Scouting program , Clark said .
McEwen confronted Dykes , who confessed to abusing 17 Scouts .
Nonetheless , Dykes was allowed to continue to spend time with the boys in the program , Clark said .
McEwen contacted the parents of the 17 Scouts but " did nothing to warn the other parents of boys within Timur Dykes ' reach and grasp , " Clark said .
Dykes was arrested that year on accusations of molesting boys .
He pleaded guilty to attempted second - degree sexual abuse , received probation and was ordered to stay away from children .
Yet , Clark said , he continued Scouting activities .
After his confession , Dykes molested Doe at least six times , Clark said .
Four times ,
Doe awoke to discover he was on top of Dykes , who was aroused .
Another time , Dykes pulled Doe 's hand into his shorts .
During a recent deposition , Dykes admitted abusing Doe .
In July 1984 , police pulled over Dykes while he was driving a van full of Scouts on a camping trip .
Police discovered his 1983 conviction and arrested him .
Doe 's parents learned of Dyke 's history and , alarmed , asked their son if he had been a victim .
" To protect his parents , he said , ' No , Timur never touched me , ' " Clark said .
But the abuse deeply disturbed Doe , who started getting bad grades , using drugs and getting in trouble with the law , Clark said .
Today , he suffers from depression , nightmares and flashbacks , Clark said .
Clark is also representing seven other victims of Dykes in lawsuits against the Boy Scouts .
Those plaintiffs also sought damages from the Mormon church , and the church settled .
Paul Xochihua , an attorney for the Cascade Pacific Council , painted a much different picture .
He disagreed with how Clark characterized McEwen 's response to Dykes ' confession , saying McEwen cooperated with a police investigation .
Police also knew of McEwen 's plan to contact the parents of the abused children , he said .
" He will say he acted immediately , " Xochihua said .
Smith , the attorney for the Boy Scouts of America , said neither the local nor national organization was directly involved in the operation of Doe 's troop .
That fell to the Mormon church .
But , Smith told jurors , " Boy Scouts of America is not here to blame this on the church .
Those decisions will be up to you . "
Boyle , the author , said Smith 's argument is one he 's heard before .
" ' We do n't run the local troop .
We do n't choose the leaders , ' " Boyle said .
That argument has been successful in the past , he said .
What 's more , Boyle said , the public has a lot of good will toward the Scouts .
" People are unwilling to punish the Boy Scouts , " Boyle said .
" I draw a distinction with the Catholic Church , because a lot of people do n't like the Catholic Church . "

Recently I had been reading a lot about the various RCs around and as Ive always been curious about drugs .
I started smoking pot at 12 then went through amphetamine , Ecstacy , benzodiazapines , crack cocaine , cocaine , methadone , LSD , mushrooms and ended up taking heroin and getting hooked for some years , so Ive had experience with both uppers and downers .
But as Id kicked the heroin habit I decided to try these Rcs.
Firstly I tried Mephedrone , swallowing 250 mg in a ' bomb ' before going to a house party .
After 15 min I could feel a slight restlessness which got stronger as time went on .
By the 1hr mark I was defiantly feeling something .
The closest I could compare it to was amphetamines but it wasnt anywhere near as aggressive .
On speed I just HAD to move , even if sitting I had to jiggle my leg but with mephedrone it didnt seem to be like that at all although I was still strongly stimulated .
I could sit and be still , no compulsion to move myself if I didnt want to , where on speed I felt I had to .
I also had an overwhelming need to talk and be frank with people .
The other thing I noticed , I had a great empathy with people , not as strong as with MDMA , but personally I felt MDMA to be too overwhelming in its empathy giving qualitys .
With mephedrone it seemed I had the right balance for me .
After 3hrs I decided to top up as I seemed to have crashed all of a sudden with no warning , which was a shock as with other things used its always tapered off , so I swallowed another 250mg and this took me back to where I was before .
As the night went on I found it very easy to talk to people I knew and didnt know at the party which is normally hard for me and as night turned to day ( I swallowed my first bomb at 6 pm , my second at 9 pm ) I decided to leave for home , which was around 5.30 am .
I felt sleep was impossible for me so I stayed awake , not feeling any come down but just generally drained , due to no sleep .
Then next night I slept fine and wanted to repeat this experience .
My next experience with mephedrone was drastically different and is maybe a cautionary tale about mixing drugs , at least mephedrone and cocaine .
The amount was the same , 250 mg swallowed around 6 pm then out to friends house for a party .
I smoked some pot and talked away feeling the same empathy and stimulation .
This time though a friend brought out some grams of cocaine which some of us proceeded to take .
Alltogether , over the night ( from 7 pm to 5 am ) I had gone through 2 grams myself pretty much , but the 2 drugs didnt mix well at all .
Where the last time I was clearheaded and knew what I wanted to say , this time I kept forgetting what I wanted to say , I was jabbering a lot and falling drastically behind in conversation .
An example of this is how a friend and I were trying to remember the word penicillin as we were talking about allergies , but we couldnt think of the word .
Some hrs later it popped into my head and I shouted  penicillin !!
even though the friend I was talking to about this earlier was long gone .
Evidently the mix of both drugs had impaired my mind greatly so I dont think Ill do this again , as although it did feel good at the time , looking back though it was too much on my brain .
So in conclusion I think Mephedrone is a very good stimulant , it has all the good qualities of amphetamine , like stimulation , increased awareness and confidence but with the added bonus of a feeling of empathy and euphoria , which speed doesnt have .
Back to the Future in Berlin Restored ' Metropolis ' Comes Home
After 83 years , Fritz Lang 's Sci-Fi classic " Metropolis " has returned to Berlin in its full glory .
On Friday night 2,000 fans braved the snowy weather to watch the restored classic at the Brandenburg Gate .
It took restorers a year to repair the damage to the newly discovered scenes .
They say the original film was much more complex and interesting than just a sci - fi cult classic .

A human rights group criticized Jordan on Monday for stripping the citizenship of nearly 3,000 Jordanians of Palestinian origin in recent years .
Concerned about increasing numbers of Palestinians , who make up nearly half the population , Jordan began in 2004 revoking the citizenship from Palestinians who do not have Israeli permits to reside in the West Bank .
Human Rights Watch said Jordan stripped about 2,700 Jordanians of Palestinian origin of their citizenship between 2004 and 2008 , rendering them stateless .
The former Foreign Secretary became very slightly flustered and wanted to find a document which he thought would bolster his case : “ I ’ll turn up , if I may , um , when he um , said that …put it in my draft and then dropped it in the end … not the case that there was only one view of the better view ” .
Andrew Bogut keying Bucks ’ resurgence
As the # 1 overall pick in the 2005 draft , Andrew Bogut has had his share of ups and downs in his career .
Lofty draft status means heightened expectations , and when the seven - foot Australian missed most of last season with a back injury , a friend of mine declared that he was a bust .
While my buddy was no doubt just trying to tweak me —
I ’m a longtime Bucks fan — he did have something of a point .
Deron Williams and Chris Paul went # 3 and # 4 in the same draft , and they were both already playing at an All - Star level .
To that point , Bogut ’s best season was his third , where he averaged 14 - 10 with 1.7 blocks in 35 minutes of playing time .
He certainly was n’t a bust , though he had n’t lived up to his lofty expectations , either .
But Bogut has undergone something of a transformation over the last 12 months .
His fine play this season — 16 - 11 on 53 % shooting , 2.3 blocks ( 2nd in the league ) — can be attributed to a few factors .
First , Michael Redd is now out for the season after trying to come back from knee surgery , so head coach Scott Skiles has asked Bogut to carry a bigger load offensively .
He has developed a terrific left hand hook , which has made him one of the league ’s few “ go - to ” post players .
Secondly , the quickness and vision of Brandon Jennings has created easy opportunities for Bogut around the rim .
While they ’re not running as much of it as they were early in the season , the two are very adept at the pick - and - roll .
Jennings has a good feel for when to deliver the pass , while Bogut has soft hands and the ability to finish at the rim .
Lastly , Bogut has stayed relatively healthy .
He did miss six games in October , and Milwaukee went just 2 - 4 over that span .
His presence is crucial to the Bucks ’ rising playoff hopes .
Over the last two months , he ’s averaging 17 - 11 on 56 % shooting along with 2.8 blocks per game .
The Bucks have gone 17 - 10 in that span and have won five straight , including a 16 - point win over the Knicks in which Bogut posted 24 points , 20 rebounds and five blocks .
His monster game came against David Lee , who got an All - Star nod over Bogut a few short weeks ago .
But the thing I really like about him is his hard - nosed play .
You would n’t think it , but the Aussie is a perfect match for Milwaukee ’s blue - collar nature .
He is very vocal for a big man and is n’t afraid to get on his teammates if the situation warrants it .
He signed a five - year , $ 60 million extension without any drama , and if he continues on this career trajectory , he ’ll be worth it .
In response to the sometimes quiet atmosphere at the Bradley Center , he even created “ Squad 6 , ” buying 100 lower level tickets and giving them away ( via audition ) to the loudest , rowdiest fans .
After their game in Milwaukee , Mavs owner Mark Cuban said that they were the “ most fun fans ” that he ’s seen on the road “ ever . ”
The Bucks were one of the few fringe playoff teams looking to add talent during this February ’s trade deadline , and the trade for John Salmons has already paid dividends .
If Bogut can keep up his stellar play and Jennings continues to develop , the Bucks could be a feisty # 6 or # 7 seed in this year ’s playoffs .
This is the Bogut - Jennings show now , and even in the dead of winter , there ’s reason for optimism in Milwaukee .

In Australia , compensation lawyers sydney and compensation lawyers Melbourne are among those who play an important role in determining how the workers will get their compensation and what are the chances that they will get the desired value and benefits after the approval of the compensation claim .
In fact , there are a number of various things and the numerous factors that determine which level of compensation will be offered to the worker .
Sometimes the company offers a flat rate for the compensation of their employees in a particular category and mostly it is all according to the legal requirements and terms and conditions determined by the law in particular state .
To evaluate the worth of benefits included in a workers compensation the compensation lawyers Canberra and compensation lawyers Newcastle assure to analyze the few basic things that govern the overall process .
The worker compensation includes the various things that are based on the different factors affecting the compensation in the following ways :
The claim depends on the designation of the worker and it depends on the kind of work the person does or the designation he or she has in an organization .
This will determine the benefits as per the T and Cs of the company .
In addition to that , compensation lawyers gold coast , and compensation lawyers Brisbane suggest that kind of disability or injury that is caused during the work or at the workplace also determines the claim type and amount as well as the benefits that they will offer to the worker .
Depending on the amount on medical bills , the compensation value may be determined quite easily so that it covers the expenses in an easy way .
In case of disputes , there is also a way out by finding a suitable settlement and get the desired benefits so that the worker may get enough and sufficient support .
Mostly , compensation lawyers Adelaide and compensation lawyers Liverpool can help workers understand what level of benefits the workers can get in order to avoid issues later on .
I made the mistake of looking at Slate Dot Com and discovered this headline :
Ah . " The Fox on Fox . " Witty .
( Stabs self in eye with pencil . )
But what is meant by this mysterious term , " Post - feminist " ?
This class of thing , presumably :
The future of Fox News began on Feb. 1 , when Megyn Kelly popped up behind the anchor desk on a new two - hour show called America Live ( 1 p.m. ET ) .
The program itself is not anything special , nor does it need to be .
As a midday show , its sole purpose is to keep a stream of information — meaningless and otherwise — flowing at a decent pace .
As a Fox News offering , it just needs to throw out some red - state red meat , U.S. commercial grade or higher , every other block ....
Megyn's Manhattan studio offers a view of Sixth Avenue by way of a video screen and of her legs by way of a clear plastic desk .
The desk is positioned atop a map of the 48 contiguous states such that Kansas City would seem to have a good view up her skirt .
If it is less than gallant to make such an observation , it is more than fair to believe that Kelly would be OK with that .
On Tuesday , for reasons unknown , one her colleagues presented us with a photo of Kelly wearing a strapless dress , tan lines glowing , at some black - tie function , and she heaved a deep laugh when he said , " I just think you look fabulous in that dress you 're not wearing in this photograph , Megyn . "
On Wednesday , when she thanked spy novelist Alex Berenson for coming in for an interview , he submitted that any red- blooded American male would rush to bask in her glow , and she said , " Honesty — so refreshing ! "
Then she recommended that her female viewers give the men in their lives a Berenson book for Valentine 's Day : " You could deliver it in a saucy little outfit , combine everything all in one . "
Secure enough in her intelligence to be comfortably upfront about working her sex appeal , Megyn Kelly qualifies as a post - feminist news babe .
Do n't laugh me out of room for saying so ; the case is tighter than Anderson Cooper 's T - shirt ....
In any event , you cannot write her off as a bimbo just because her wavy hair shines the same color as the bullion bricks in the commercial breaks ' many advertisements for gold .
She has a former lawyer 's precision with language , an appetite for sparring , a natural understanding of news reading as performance art , and the rare skill ( a guest of hers has mentioned ) for relaxing her guests to the point that they forget they 're on television .
Though she has a mastery of the dark arts of offering false equivalency as balance and unironically chastising " the mainstream media , " she also calls herself out for editorializing .

Australian ISP iiNet has won a landmark Federal Court battle against the Australian Federation Against Copyright Theft ( AFACT ) .
AFACT , representing Roadshow Films , Channel 7 and other film studios including Universal Pictures , Warner Bros Entertainment , Paramount Pictures , Sony Pictures Entertainment , Twentieth Century Fox Film Corporation , and Disney Enterprises attempted to sue iiNet for failing to act against customers downloading illegal content over the Internet via BitTorrent and P2P file sharing networks .
[ Check out a timeline of the AFACT vs. iiNet case ]
In handing down his verdict , Justice Cowdroy said that though there was substantial evidence of users downloading pirated content , iiNet can't be seen as " approving infringement . "
" I find the mere provision of access to the Internet is not the means of infringement .
Rather , the means by which the applicant 's copying is infringed is in iiNet users ' use of the constituent parts of the BitTorrent system .
iiNet has no control over the BitTorrent system and is not responsible for the operation of the BitTorrent system , " ruled Justice Cowdroy .
" I find that iiNet simply cannot be seen as sanctioning , approving or countenancing copyright infringement , " he continued .
In addition to ruling in favour of iiNet , Justice Cowdroy also ruled that AFACT pay iiNet all court costs .
In a media statement released following the verdict , iiNet welcomed the Federal Court ’s judgment and stressed that it has " never supported , encouraged or authorised illegal sharing or downloading of files . "
" We have never supported or encouraged breaches of the law , including infringement of the Copy Right Act of the Telecommunications Act.
Today ’s judgment is a vindication of that and the allegations against us have been proven to be unfounded , " said the statement .
" We do not and never have supported , encouraged or authorised illegal sharing or downloading of files in breach of the copyright laws .
We are eager to engage with the film industry and copyright holders to make this material legitimately available . "
The film studios represented by AFACT also released a statement expressing disappointment on the verdict .
" Today ’s decision is a set back for the 50,000 Australians employed in the film industry , " said AFACT director Neil Gane .
" But we believe this decision was based on a technical finding centred on the court ’s interpretation of the how infringement ’s occur and the ISPs ability to control them .
We are confident that the Government does not intend a policy outcome where rampant copyright infringement is allowed to continue unaddressed and unabated via the iiNet network . "
" We will now take the time to review the decision before making further comment on next steps . "
It is not yet known whether AFACT will appeal the decision .

One reason progressive politics fares so poorly is because we spend too much time on individual campaigns and not enough on issues .
While the former tend to drive away the independent , the skeptical and those who do n't like a particular a candidate , the latter can attract all sorts to join with others who may agree only one issue .
not by ideology .
It 's a lot easier to get a cross section of people backing a particular issue than it is for them to buy into your whole philosophy of life .
Use the former approach on the streets and save the latter for the bar .
You do n't need common ideology if you have common causes .
from the Ivy League and more from Iowa .
do n't get to even look at a glass ceiling .
But many of them run into locked doors every day .
Pay much more attention to the latter .
Convert them with policies that actually help them .
Do a good enough job and they 'll forget about abortions and gay marriage .
they are an undeveloped market . , too .
Just because a black politician talks about hope and change does n't mean he 's Martin Luther King .
Especially if he 's from Chicago .
Nobody else does .
Nobody else does .
Nobody else does and everyone else would love itback to the top of the list .
Since the 1980s , liberals have forgotten this basic part of their heritage , which brought us things like an end to the depression , Social Security , a minimum wage and Medicare .
Besides , economic issues are ones that best cut across geographic , cultural and ethnic lines .
Just about every successful great movement has moved along to the sound of its own music .
You 're only helping to build his base .
Follow Samuel Goldwyn's advice and " do n't even ignore him . "
The more he becomes the issue the less important real issues become .
A progressive movement can't be built on the mirror image of Bill O'Reilly or with endless sarcastic comments about your opponents .
It can be built by people understanding and becoming enthusiastic about the policies you support .
One of the things many people do n't like about traditional liberals is how federally oriented they are .
This is due in no small part to an elite class that longs for jobs in Washington .
Let them get these jobs on their own .
Stop constantly designing stimulus packages for them with new federocentric legislation .
All national legislation with state and local impact should meet the standards of what the Catholic Church used to call the principle of subsidiarity : government power should exercised at the lowest practical level .
There lots of ways to do this in federal legislation .
Here are a few : - Revenue sharing - Giving money instead of orders for public education and other programs .-
Decentralizing government agencies like some of the best existing ones such at the National Park Service , Coast Guard and US Attorney - all highly decentralized and involved with local governments and communities . -
Not making too many decisions at the federal level . -
Supporting the 9th and 10th amendments that clearly limit the federal government 's role but which traditional liberals routinely ignore .
for three good reasons : it works , gun prohibition laws do n't and you 'll make all sorts of new friends .
If you really want to change American politics , start a group called Gays for Guns .
Support instant runoff voting , public campaign financing , more states , a larger House of Representatives with mixed proportional and district representation like Germany , state banks , and a constitutional amendment to end corporations ' legal status as " persons . " and good jobs for regulators .
New laws often favor the latter which is why we keep adding regulators but can't bring the Glass - Steagall Act back .
and your offspring may be crooks .
Stop selling out so cheaply .
It sure helped progressive populists in the past .
Everyone talks about having a black president , but hardly anyone does anything about the huge number of young black and white males to whom we offer two main futures : incarceration or pain if not death on the battlefield .
It is similar with the poor in general .
They have not only been deserted by conservatives and centrists but by liberals as well .
A great recession is a wonderful time to get rid America 's most unsuccessful and expensive policy this side of foreign wars .
It will save money , reduce the police state , limit prosecutorial discrimination against the poor , lower the crime rate and attract a lot of young voters who did n't even known they were progressives .
When your movement is pretty much down to Bernie Sanders and Dennis Kucinich at the national level , you know there 's plenty of room for you .
Most great movements have been led by those most had n't even heard of a few years earlier .
You could be one of them .
One of the most useful techniques in organizing is to support the work of others .
A mass movement is built by groups alternately leading and following each other .
And one of the best ways to get respect is to give it .
One of the great failures of liberalism has been its great disinterest in local power .
The closer government is to the people the more they like it and the more responsive it tends to be .
Besides , if you can't be an effective progressive in the 'hood , then you 'll be a pretty lousy one in Washington .
It worked for some 200 years until we decided to turn them into human drone development and detention centers where the young are taught to pass tests rather than to learn things .
Try to do the most for the most .
If your politics clearly help the most , then they wo n't mind so much when you also help smaller groups within our society .
But if you help minorities while ignoring the majority you 're in trouble .
Remember , everyone wants to be in show business .
turf protectors , budget bullies , ambitious lawyers and CYA bureaucrats kill good ideas .
Given the state of contemporary political culture , it would be unlikely that Social Security , Medicare or a minimum wage could be passed today .
That 's not so much a reflection of our politics as it is of our culture .
We have mainly learned how to say no .
Progressives need to reintroduce the concept of yes .
Our goal is not to overthrow the system but to make it irrelevant .has involved repeated conflict between the specifics of the soul and institutional abstractions -- between people and places on the one hand and , on the other , a succession of systems desiring to exploit , subjugate or supplant them .
We need to oppose not only the bad systems of the moment but unnatural systems in general - all those that revoke , replace or restrain the natural rights of human beings and the natural assets of their habitats .is to act free .
The number of liberals and progressives that follow this rule is sadly small .
Everyone these days seems to prefer to talk about balancing rights instead of exercising them .
But the rights outlined in the Constitution were n't bargaining chips ; they were permanent guarantees .
Progressives leave the right 's phony theological arguments largely unchallenged , but even an atheist can point out that the Ten Commandments does n't say anything about abortion or gay marriage but sure as hell is down on adultery , stealing ( even on Wall Street ) , bearing false witness ( even in political ads ) and coveting anything that belongs to your neighbor ( even in the name of capitalism ) .
The Bible also does n't like usury and strongly suggests that the earth is the lord 's and not the property of multinational corporations .
The ultimate irony of right wingers is that that they are comprised in no small part of despoilers , usurers , war - mongers , hypocrites , idolaters and groupies of false prophets - all of whom are frowned upon by the book it pretends to follow .
And its opponents , who are more faithful to the words that the conservatives only quote , are often such good Christians that they never say a mumblin ' word about it all .is to make sure that every organization , church , school , or club is run according to its principles .
There are still a lot of nice liberals around with whom to make common cause , but the word itself carries too much baggage .
Progressives are activists ; liberals are a demographic .
Progressives emphasize economic change ; liberals in recent years have largely ignored it .
Progressives convert their opponents ; liberals rant about them .
Progressives are grassroots ; liberals are federocentric .
No , we do n't all agree on how things should be done , but we can all understand that we can't have our liberty unless others do as well .
Both right and left spend far too much time trying to stop others from doing things their way .
The trick is how as many as possible can do things their way as long as it does n't hurt others .
It 's a word that is n't heard much any more but could ease a lot of our pain .
Tolerance is often a necessary waypoint for people on the way to accepting new ideas .
It 's the trial period before full acceptance .
Part of the misery of today 's America is that there are too many people unhappy with the system who have live their misery alone .
Part of the beauty of the 1960s was in varied alternative communities .
Put down your Ipod and join with others who agree with you .
Issues like climate change are complicated for many and hard to grasp , especially since our schools have devoted more time to teaching driving and creating drug free zones than they have to science .
Help people understand issues and do n't blame them for not . -
Part of the illusion of mass media is that change can be organized like a TV series .
Try it and typically one of two things happen : it fails or it becomes just more political mush .
Too many web - based liberal organizations are simply more lobbying groups .
They do n't change politics , souls , or history .
Despite TV and the Internet , change still comes from the bottom .
Build from up there .
Those with tightly defined ideas about how we should behave often make little distinction between people who merely accept the values of their culture and those who market and manipulate them .
It helps to remember that we are all creatures of our cultures and often speak in their voice .
This may not be an admirable characteristic but it certainly is a human one .
After all , if it were n't for Rush , dittoheads would have nothing to ditto .

In a forty - eight hour period beginning on Christmas Eve 2008 the Christian fundamentalist Lord ’s Resistance Army ( LRA ) killed , dismembered and burned at least 200 Congolese civilians .
Soldiers raped women and girls , twisted the heads off babies , and cut the lips and ears off those they did not kill .
They hacked the rest to death using machetes or axes .
Child soldiers helped abduct other children .
During the same period the Israeli government and Hamas officials entered the final stages of failing ceasefire talks .
War was on the horizon , but had not yet begun .
An errant Hamas rocket killed two Gazan sisters ; otherwise there were no cross - border casualties .
According to AlertNet ’s World Press Tracker , the two - day Israeli - Palestinian stand - off was reported in the global media forty times . [ i]
There were no reports on the LRA massacre in the Democratic Republic of the Congo ( DRC ) .
Over the next three weeks Israel ’s incursion into Gaza left 926 Palestinian and three Israeli civilians dead .
The global media reported these events 2896 times .
In the same period , Joseph Kony ’s LRA killed 865 civilians and abducted 160 children .
The media reported these events a total of twenty times .
The Western media ’s fascination with the Israeli - Palestinian conflict has long overshadowed death and oppression in other parts of the world .
Gilad Shalit and the Qassam rocket are known to many ; the death of 5.9 million in the eight - nation Second Congo War is not .
Recent Israeli and Palestinian elections were covered worldwide in real - time , while images of genocide in Rwanda and Sudan did not surface until it was too late .
Countless articles argue media bias in favour of Israel or the Palestinians , yet few address the media bias towards the conflict itself .
The disproportionate media coverage raises several uncomfortable questions : why were the deaths of Congolese civilians at the hands of the LRA deemed less newsworthy than , in the first instance , crumbling cease - fire talks and , later , the deaths of Palestinian civilians ?
More generally , why is the west so consumed by the Israeli - Palestinian conflict and what are the consequences of underreporting other conflicts ?
Finally , can anything be done to redress the media balance so that the rights of all humans – regardless of colour , ethnicity , and geography – are given equal weight ?
Explanation
At first glance , the discrepancy in coverage appears linked to racism : how else to explain the ‘ sins of omission ’ [ ii ] in Rwanda and Sudan ?
Or the laissez - faire attitude towards Sierra Leone , Liberia , DRC , and , most recently , the ignored civilian massacres in Guinea and Nigeria ? [ iii ]
It is unlikely that the international community would remain silent if hundreds of thousands ( or even hundreds ) of Palestinians and Israelis were being killed .
However , the indifference is not limited to sub-Saharan Africa : conflicts in southeast Asia ( Philippines , Thailand ) , Latin America ( Colombia ) , the Caucasus ( Georgia , Nagorno - Karabakh ) , the Balkans ( Bosnia ) , and even North America ( Mexico ) have been equally ignored . [ iv ]
Consequently , the charge of racism may be misplaced .
Instead , a more plausible explanation is simple self - interest : the geopolitical , ideological , and religious implications of the IPC threaten global harmony .
A sharp escalation in violence in Israel or Palestine could spark a regional if not global conflict .
In contrast , a war between Eritrea and Ethiopia , regardless of casualties , does not carry the same threat to international stability .
When Jews , Christians , Muslims , and Baha ’i jostle for position in the Holy Land the religious sensitivities of more than half the world ’s population are at stake .
Conversely , internecine fighting between the Kikuyu and Luo of Kenya , again regardless of casualties , is seen as a tribal matter of little consequence to the outside world .
Finally , and perhaps most important , the Israeli - Palestinian conflict has been made a proxy for a much larger ideological clash between the west and the Muslim world .
Israel is either perceived as a symbol of western imperialist power conducive to western regional interests – particularly those of the much - reviled United States – or as a beacon of democracy in a sea of oppressive Arab pseudo - states .
The Palestinians are seen to either represent the menace of the Arab and Muslim world or a David righteously fighting the world ’s Goliaths .
The framing of the conflict in these ways permits the west to justify its actions in the middle east and allows regional leaders to deflect attention away from their own repressive autocratic regimes .
The Israelis and Palestinians are pawns in a greater ideological game , one whose every move is crucial to the national self - interest of every Western , Arab and Muslim country alike .
It is clear then that the Israeli - Palestinian conflict is important and that the global media have an obligation to closely monitor the ongoing turmoil .
However , while the conflict is undeniably significant , the human rights violations that occur in Israel - Palestine are of no greater comparative importance than those that occur elsewhere .
Yet the global media does not make this crucial distinction and instead conflates the two .
For example , while the Israeli - Palestinian conflict may be of greater global interest than the LRA ’s activities , the rights of the 865 civilians killed in the DRC are as important as the 929 civilians killed in the Gaza conflict .
Consequently , while these explanations account for disproportionate media coverage , they do not justify it .
Justifications
Still , arguments are made that the human rights of those involved in the Israeli - Palestinian conflict are distinct from others and need to be prioritized .
However , each attempted justification reveals contradictions when compared to past and ongoing conflicts .
I. Special responsibility
One justification for the media ’s fixation is that the world , and the west in particular , bear a unique responsibility for the Israeli - Palestinian conflict as they abetted the creation of a state for one displaced people by displacing another .
However , if a sense of post - partition or post - colonial responsibility is the justification then what of Pakistan and India ?
Kashmir , another tragic by - product of colonial mapmaking , has largely flown under the Western media radar despite the deaths of 67,000 civilians since a rebellion broke out in the Himalayan region in 1989 .
The conflict is over a territory twenty times the size of Israel and the Palestinian territories , involves twice as many people , and has resulted in ten times as many deaths .
There are other post - partition losers – Nigeria , Ethiopia and Western Sahara , for example – who do not attract the same media spotlight despite heavy civilian casualties and rampant oppression .
If the west feels a moral obligation towards Palestinians and Israelis , then a similar obligation should be felt towards the hundreds of millions of others whose lives were also permanently disrupted due to historical western interference .
II .
Democratic accountability
A second justification for the media ’s dogged attention is that Israel as a democracy is accountable to higher standards of behaviour – most importantly on human rights .
Their actions deserve magnification , hence global media attention .
However , if membership in the club of democracies demands greater media scrutiny , then Sri Lanka – a democracy of 20 million – should have featured as heavily in the media during and especially after its war with the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam ( LTTE ) in early 2009 .
AlertNet ’s World Press Tracker points in a different direction .
The daily average of global headlines for the two conflicts during hostilities is severely unbalanced : the Israeli - Palestinian conflict , on average , received 148 per day ; Sri Lanka / LTTE , on average , 29 per day .
The contrast is more disturbing when considering the civilian death toll : hostilities between January and May of 2009 left 20,000 Sri Lankan civilians dead .
Both cases involved a government force attacking a terrorist group [ v ] in areas dense with civilians .
Yet the Israeli - Palestinian conflict featured in global media five times more often frequently , despite the death of twenty times more civilians in Sri Lanka . [ vi ]
The average number of daily headlines for the two - week period following the end of hostilities is equally disproportionate : the Israeli - Palestinian conflict received 75 per day ; Sri Lanka / LTTE , 19 per day , the latter conflict falling off the media map almost entirely .
This is particularly disturbing as both the Sri Lankan government and the LTTE also stand accused of war crimes .
Israel and Hamas ’ alleged war crimes received intense media follow - up and a UN inquiry .
The UN and the international community condemned the LTTE – accused of using civilians as human shields – and the Sri Lankan government – accused of executing unarmed Tamil prisoners of war and shelling hospitals and schools – but this was hardly picked up on by the western media .
The UN has not initiated a war crimes probe as of 10 March 2010 .
In this instance , democracy did not lead to greater accountability .
III .
Extreme oppression and suffering
A third justification is that the oppression suffered by the Palestinians warrants disproportionate media attention .
Indeed , suffering incurred by Palestinians should be exposed so as to foster change .
However , their cause should not overshadow the plight of the other 35 million refugees and 24.5 million internally displaced persons ( IDPs ) worldwide .
Millions of Central African refugees who live in constant fear of rebel and government attack are oppressed .
Millions of Burmese IDPs with little or no freedom , including the right to leave their country , are oppressed .
Yet their plight rarely receives international exposure .
Since 1980 , total civilian deaths in the Sri Lankan conflict have been fifty times that of the Israeli - Palestinian conflict ; Kashmir has seen one hundred times more civilians killed ; and the conflict in the DRC has claimed five thousand times more lives than the Israeli - Palestinian conflict .
Death tolls alone are not a barometer of oppression .
However , other indicators can be used to contextualize human suffering .
For example , the UNDP ’s human development index , which measures ’ health , knowledge , and standard of living ’ , ranks the Palestinian territories higher than every sub-Saharan African country , including South Africa . [ vii ]
The index places the Palestinians in the ‘ high human development ’ category for adult literacy rates ( 93.8 % ) , life expectancy at birth ( 73.3 years ) , and malnourished children ( 3 % ) .
In all categories , the territories ranked higher than all south Asian and Arab countries , and even outpaced Brazil , Russia ( adult literacy notwithstanding ) , India , and China .
Even after Israel ’s invasion of Gaza , World Health Organization representative Mahmoud Daher stated that the territory 'is , of course , crowded and poor , but it is better off than nearly all of Africa as well as parts of Asia .
There is no acute malnutrition , and infant mortality rates compare with those in Egypt and Jordan ’’.[ viii ]
Average aggregate GDP per capita in the Palestinian territories ( $ 4,400 in the Gaza Strip [ ix ] , $ 2,800 in the West Bank[ x ] ) is greater than eighty other countries including Albania , Armenia , Morocco , Uruguay , Ukraine , Indonesia , and Viet Nam .
These inconvenient truths are not intended to diminish the Palestinian right to freedom of movement , trade and a homeland : the aim is simply to put the Israeli - Palestinian conflict into global perspective and to promote a more equitable coverage of global suffering .
IV .
Type of Conflict
A final justification for disproportionate media attention is that the IPC is an ongoing national liberation movement rather than a civil war . [ xi ]
This line of reasoning raises two problems .
First , there exist other ongoing wars of national liberation involving large - scale death and destruction that receive little or no media coverage .
Second , coming full circle , the type of conflict cannot be conflated with human rights violations : individuals are equal under international human rights law .
Other national liberation movements
The struggle to free Tibet has claimed one million lives , many of them horrifically , since 1959 .[ xii ]
In pre-Olympic violence in March of 2008 , Chinese police shot dead 140 protesting Tibetans .
The events did make global headlines , but the coverage ended once the Olympics did – despite the continuation of human rights abuses .
The conflict in Chechnya , classified as an national liberation movement by several groups [ xiii ] , has left 60,000 Chechen civilians dead since 1994 .
The Russians have massacred civilians and assassinated Chechen politicians , while the Chechens have launched suicide attacks and sown terror – violence similar to that withnessed in Israel - Palestine yet largely unreported .[ xiv ]
Western Sahara is a national liberation movement where the Sahrawi people reject Morocco ’s 1974 annexation of the former Spanish colony .
A 2,700 km wall ( the Berm , or Wall of Shame ) , constructed by Morocco in the 1980s , divides the country .
It is manned by Moroccan armed forces , limiting the movement of the Sahrawi .
The US , the EU , the AU , and the UN do not recognize Morocco ’s occupation of Western Sahara .
AlertNet has a record of three international headlines for the conflict during the whole of 2009 , all linked to Sahrawi human rights activist Aminatou Haidar ’s month - long hunger strike in a Spanish airport .
The number of casualties in the conflict is ‘ only ’ in the low hundreds , but its similarities with the Israeli - Palestinian conflict – including human rights abuses on both sides – demonstrate that national liberation movements do not necessarily receive an equal place under the global media spotlight .
Human rights law
Differentiating – and prioritizing – a certain type of conflict over another ignores the fundamental concept of human rights enshrined in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and the Fourth Geneva Convention : a civilian oppressed or killed in any part of the world under any illegal circumstances represents a human rights violation .
Every individual is entitled to the same protection under international human rights law , international humanitarian law , and international criminal law regardless of the intensity or breadth of the conflict causing their deadly or oppressive circumstances .
This includes the 150,000 Liberians killed in the civil war of 1999 - 2003 , the 300,000 North Koreans starved or worked to death in gulags since 2005 , and the 37,000 Kurds killed by Turkish forces since 1984 .
Yet there were few protests in European and North American cities over Liberia , nor have any UN resolutions been passed on behalf of the North Koreans , and there have been no calls for divestment of Turkish assets .
The fact that none received media coverage proportionate to that of the Israeli - Palestinian conflict , despite vastly higher casualty numbers and thoroughly oppressive conditions , conveys a clear message to these victims : their human rights are secondary to the rights of more favoured individuals .
Further , individual victims of human rights abuses who have no internal mechanism for recourse are more vulnerable than victims of formal conflicts such as the Israeli - Palestinian conflict .
For example , women stoned to death for suspected adultery [ xv ] , men publicly executed for suspected homosexuality [ xvi ] , albinos killed for body parts [ xvii ] , lesbians ‘ correctively raped ’ [ xviii ] , or adults and children used as slaves [ xix ] - these isolated groups can all have their safety enhanced through increased international media attention .
Yet advocacy on their behalf through the media ( and even by human rights groups ) is minimal when compared to the Israeli - Palestinian conflict , leaving them out of sight and , consequently , out of mind .
The consequences
Ultimately , there is no justification for the media ’s preferential coverage of human rights abuses in the Israeli - Palestinian conflict .
The immediate consequences of this conflict bias are the further polarisation of an already fragile divide and the export of its inflammatory politics to the rest of the world .
An indirect but equally important consequence is that the media attention helps the Israeli - Palestinian conflict command a disproportionate chunk of global humanitarian aid , to the detriment of refugees and internally displaced persons around the globe .
While the Israeli - Palestinian conflict is at the forefront of the public consciousness , dozens of other conflicts involving hundreds of millions of people are almost entirely ignored .
The United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near East ( UNRWA ) provides education , health care , social services and emergency aid to 400,000 Palestinians .
There exists no other UN agency dedicated solely to refugees from a specific region or conflict .
The rest of the sixty million refugees and internally displaced persons around the globe rely on the United Nations High Commission on Refugees ( UNHCR ) .
In 2000 , UNRWA spent $ 72 per Palestinian while the UNHCR spent $ 53 per capita on refugees from the rest of the world , an inexplicable shortfall of 25 % .
The UNRWA claims it is underfunded and makes repeated funding appeals to its two main donors – the United States and the European Union . [ xx ]
Israel is the largest recipient of US aid in the world , topping 2.5 billion dollars in 2009 .
Although the majority of aid is tied to military spending , this works out to more than $ 400 per Israeli .
In 2006 , Israel received 12 % of all US foreign assistance , [ xxi ] the same proportion as the whole of Africa ( minus Egypt ) .
For reference , the population of Israel is 7.3 million .
The African continent is home to over 1 billion .
GDP per capita in Israel is $ 28,900 while the average African GDP is under $ 3,000 .
With 300 million Africans living below the poverty line and 27 % of their children malnourished , it is not difficult to argue that US aid is closely tied to its own interests and not to where it is needed most . [ xxii ]
The tragedy of disproportionate aid is that it perpetuates the conflict – perhaps intentionally – providing little incentive for leaders to move beyond the status quo.[ xxiii ]
Military aid to Israel has fostered belligerence , political rigidity , and a regional arms race .
Israeli governments act with impunity knowing that the US is loath to withdraw aid .
The UNRWA has propped up governments dedicated to violence , seen millions of dollars siphoned off by officials , and has employed known terrorists .[ xxiv ]
Former UNRWA general - counsel James G. Lindsay stated in 2009 that the UNRWA 'has taken very few steps to detect and eliminate terrorists from the ranks of its staff or its beneficiaries , and no steps at all to prevent members of organizations such as Hamas from joining its staff . [...]
No justification exists for millions of dollars in humanitarian aid going to those who can afford to pay for UNRWA services .’[ xxv ]
Accordingly , Canada redirected aid earmarked for the UNRWA to projects strengthening the Palestinian judicial system to " ensure accountability and foster democracy .’’[ xxvi ]
In short , not only does disproportionate aid leave millions of others worse off , it helps reinforce intransigence in the Israeli - Palestinian conflict and makes its continuation more likely .
The greatest consequence of disproportionate media coverage is that many conflicts involving gross violations of human rights never reach the public consciousness .
As demonstrated above , the rights of Liberians , Sudanese , Sri Lankans , North Koreans , Rwandese , Colombians , Congolese , Guineans , Burmese , Nigerians , Sierra Leoneans , Mexicans , Tibetans , Chechens , Sahrawis , Kurds , Kashmiris , and even those of Palestinians outside the Occupied Territories [ xxvii ] have been largely ignored .
While the slightest event in the Israeli - Palestinian conflict ( such as the building of an Israeli museum on top of the parking lot of a fifteenth century Palestinian cemetery ) is covered in nearly every major western newspaper , ongoing human rights abuses in the rest of the world ( such as the continued killing of Sudanese civilians ) do not .
CNN International ’s one year retrospective on the ' War in Gaza ' [ xxviii ] is a fitting example : during the show , two statistics scrolled by at the bottom of the screen '... 15,000 civilians estimated dead in Mexico drug wars ... 225,000 child slaves in Haiti ...’
That these disturbing realities were only afforded a short strip of ticker tape , while a year old conflict was the subject of an entire programme , is further evidence that the western media ’s fascination with the Israeli - Palestinian conflict outstrips that of any other conflict today , regardless of the scale of human rights abuses .
The solutions
Redressing the media balance will not be simple : after decades of reinforcement , the Israeli - Palestinian conflict is firmly entrenched in our hearts and minds .
However , if one conflict can turn so many heads , so can others .
The international media reaction to Darfur , while too late , likely stopped further atrocities and was an indication that diversification of human rights coverage is possible .
Unfortunately , most conflicts do not have enough geopolitical , ideological , or religious significance to trigger a global response .
However , as outlined above , global media consumers are motivated to act on behalf of others when self - interest and compassion are present .
For example , the death of 8,000 foreigners in the 2004 Indian Ocean tsunami led to massive international media coverage and aid mobilisation which continued for years .
Books were written and films were made .
In contrast , cyclone Nargis ( which killed at least 150,000 Burmese ) received widespread media attention , however , the death , destruction , and eventual famine faded from global headlines as western interests were not apparent and the regret and compassion felt quickly dissipated .
While difficult to manufacture , these sentiments can be communicated through various conduits , by images and world leaders .
A single image from the Ethiopian famine of 1984 sparked an unparalleled response from the international community .
Since then , horrific and shocking images of suffering are required if a natural disaster or conflict is to penetrate the public consciousness .
Both the Palestinians and Israelis harness this potential expertly .
Unfortunately , other conflicts are unable to generate images due to lack of access and material .
There were no images of the LRA massacre in DRC because there were no reporters .
‘ You can not fight for what you do not see , ’ was the reply of a Congolese villager when asked if he begrudged the world for ignoring his plight .
Similarly , there were few images of the 20,000 dead Sri Lankan civilians due to government media restrictions .
However , citizen journalism – whereby civilians are armed with smart technology that can easily diffuse images of suffering – has proven to be an effective awareness - raising technique that compensates for a lack of access and material .[ xxix ]
However , even if images are produced they are often ineffectual on the receiving end due to information overloads and desensitization .
The competition between tragedies is fierce and can quickly overwhelm the media consumer to the point of inaction .
One awareness - raising method that has proven to be remarkably effective is using world leaders to diffuse messages .
Particularly powerful is the celebrity - as - spokesperson approach .
While it may seem trivial , the level of importance the world attributes to its celebrities should not be underestimated . [ xxx ]
Concerts for debt relief , telethons for earthquake victims , and special UN goodwill ambassadors have all proven exemplary at helping causes rise from obscurity and into the living room of the mass media consumer .
Once images are generated – and world leaders and celebrities attached to them – they can be used as tools by activists and diasporas to instigate change .
Again , Palestinians and Israelis demonstrate that this method can be exceptionally effective for publicizing discontent .
The cynic , of course , would argue that the media is a vehicle of the agenda - setting elite and that any attempt to breach the hegemony is futile .
While pushing unheralded stories through various media channels is not easy , recent and anti-war and anti-globalisation demonstrations have shown it is possible .
In addition , recent campaigns by human rights groups such as Amnesty International and Human Rights Watch have confirmed civil society ’s importance in public debate and demonstrated that if communal will is strong enough , changes of perception are possible .
Conclusion
The debate surrounding humanitarian intervention and the responsibility to protect has stalled .
In the meantime , soft power in the form of the global media should be used to ensure equal representation .
This will , in turn , ignite public opinion and promote change without infringing on state sovereignty .
While perfectly representative coverage would be difficult to achieve , proportionate diversified coverage is entirely possible .
This does not imply that support for Palestinians or Israelis should be abandoned ; only that it should be shared with those who are ignored .
If our moral code guides us in the Israeli - Palestinian conflict then let it be our beacon elsewhere as well .
Concern for human rights needs to stretch beyond a small patch of land in the middle east .

While it is difficult to compare conflicts , similarities can be found between the conflicts : both are long - standing struggles relating to identity and claims on territory .
In such cases an acceptable measure of comparing conflict intensity has traditionally been , but is not exclusive to , death tolls .

The Israeli -Palestinian conflict can by definition be labelled a civil war in that it is between two nations created from a formerly - united entity – the British mandate of Palestine .
The aim of one side may be to take control of the nation or a region , to achieve independence for a region , or to change government policies .

The suggestion recently that Irish rock - star Bono should be the next director of the World Bank demonstrates the power celebrities wield .
Streaming video websites like YouTube face growing pressure from consumers to provide support for native standards - based Web video playback .
The HTML5 video element provides the necessary functionality to build robust Web media players without having to depend on proprietary plugins , but the browser vendors have not been able to build a consensus around a video codec .
Although the h264 codec has gained dominance due to its excellent compression and broad support in the consumer electronics ecosystem , it is covered by patents that preclude broad royalty - free usage .
Several browser vendors , including Opera and Mozilla , favor the Ogg Theora media codec , which is believed to be unencumbered by patents .
Ogg may offer advantages from a licensing standpoint , but there are still many unanswered questions about its quality and suitability for Internet video streaming services .
Streaming media consultant Jan
Ozer conducted a hands - on comparison of Ogg and h264 in order to shed some light on the relative difference in encoding quality and performance .
He has published the results of his comparison , including screen captures and sample clips , in a report at the Streaming Learning Center .
In the videos and still images that he provides for comparison purposes , the h264 content has better color quality and higher detail than the Ogg Theora content .
Comparing 468 kbps clips , one can detect a very noticeable difference in quality between the two codecs .
Even the 1 mbps Ogg Theora clips are not on par with the 468 kbps h264 clips .
Based on the results ,
Ozer concludes that h264 will have the upper hand in many Internet streaming scenarios .
" These tests are very aggressive , but purposefully so — at very high data rates , all codecs look good .
In particular , YouTube encodes their H.264 video at 2 mbps , about 2.5X higher than my tests .
So my conclusion is n't that Ogg is a bad codec ; it 's that producers seeking the optimal balance between data rate and quality will find H.264 superior , " he wrote .
Indeed , the outcome of such tests generally seems to differ depending on the nature of the source material and the target bitrate .
Last year , Xiph's Greg Maxwell conducted a test that focused on comparing Ogg Theora clips against h264 videos on YouTube .
Based on a comparison that is specific to the encoding parameters and bitrate used by YouTube , Maxwell found that Ogg Theora was competitive .
" It can be difficult to compare video at low bitrates , and even YouTube 's higher bitrate option is not high enough to achieve good quality .
The primary challenge is that all files at these rates will have problems , so the reviewer is often forced to decide which of two entirely distinct flaws is worse .
Sometimes people come to different conclusions , " Maxwell wrote .
These comparisons provide a lot of insight into the relative adequacy of Ogg Theora , but it 's still unclear if Theora is suitable in all of the settings where the HTML5 video element will be used .
There is hope that Google , which recently acquired video compression technology company On2 , will end the HTML5 video codec debate by opening up On2's high - performance VP8 video codec .
In an open letter to Google that was published last week , the Free Software Foundation urges the search giant to liberate the Web from proprietary video plugins by making the underlying technology behind VP8 available perpetually under royalty - free terms .
" With your purchase of On2 , you now own both the world 's largest video site ( YouTube ) and all the patents behind a new high performance video codec — VP8 , " the letter says .
" Just think what you can achieve by releasing the VP8 codec under an irrevocable royalty - free license and pushing it out to users on YouTube ?
You can end the web 's dependence on patent - encumbered video formats and proprietary software ( Flash ) . "
Some streaming video experts , including Ozer , are not convinced that royalty - free VP8 will solve all of the problems that the industry is facing with standards - based video .
He contends that the cost of reencoding existing content will make it difficult for streaming content providers to adopt alternatives to h264 at this stage regardless of whether the alternative is royalty - free .
Streaming video is an increasingly important part of the Web experience and the need for an unencumbered codec that can be freely redistributed seems clear relatively clear , regardless of the technical challenges associated with reencoding existing content .
Comparisons seem to indicate that Theora still has catching up to do , but Google has the power to deliver a viable alternative if it decides to open VP8 .
Update : Much like benchmarking , there a lot of different opinions about the best way to do video encoding quality tests .
Some of the specific parameters that Ozer used for encoding may have negatively impacted the Theora results .
Maxwell has commented here with some additional details .

The off - year elections were , in two big races , an unmistakable rebuke of Democrats .
Dems , incumbents get wake - up call
RICHMOND , Va. —
Eager to drain the 2009 elections of drama and import , White House press secretary Robert Gibbs claimed Tuesday night that President Barack Obama was “ not watching returns . ”
You can be sure that he is studying them closely now :
The off - year elections were , in two big races , an unmistakable rebuke of Democrats , reshuffling Obama ’s political circumstances in ways likely to have severe near - term consequences for his policy agenda and larger governing strategy .
Advertisement
Independents took flight from Democrats .
They suffered humiliating gubernatorial losses in traditionally Democratic New Jersey , where Obama lent his prestige in a pair of eleventh - hour campaign rallies Sunday , and in Virginia , which had been trending leftward and just last year was held up as an example of how Obama was redrawing the political map in his favor .
Tuesday night ’s trends were emphatically not in Obama ’s favor .
Among those paying closest attention are dozens of Democrats who won formerly Republican congressional districts in 2006 and 2008 and are up for reelection in 2010 .
Many of these pickups that powered the Democrats ’ recapture of Congress came in Southern and border states , or in the Ohio River Valley , where political conditions are similar to those in Virginia .
Obama now faces a much tougher challenge persuading these mostly moderate Democrats to put themselves further at risk by backing such liberal priorities as expanding government ’s role in heath care or limiting greenhouse gases .
It was a consolation prize — cherished by national Democrats urgently looking for some good news — that Democrat Bill Owens won a special election for the 23rd Congressional District in upstate New York .
What ’s more , there is an argument that these off - year elections may not have produced an ideological or partisan verdict so much as revealed a deeply aggrieved electorate — ready to rough up incumbents of all varieties .
New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg , who previously had been perceived as a highly popular independent , barely fended off a listless and badly outspent Democratic challenge from City Comptroller William Thompson Jr .
The results in the New York House race — in a remote , historically Republican bastion — came after a bitter intramural fight among Republicans in which Conservative Party candidate Doug Hoffman and his backers effectively ran GOP establishment pick Dede Scozzafava out of the race .
“ I think all incumbents need to be on full alert , ” Rep. Chris Van Hollen of Maryland , the leader of the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee , told POLITICO in a telephone interview .
The election campaigns were followed swiftly by post - game campaigns to shape perceptions of the results .
The Democratic line , from the White House on down , is to plunge into nuance — making the case that the big 2009 contests were effectively local races waged by two weak candidates in incumbent Jon Corzine in New Jersey , beaten by Republican Chris Christie , and state Sen.
Creigh Deeds in Virginia , who was clubbed like a harp seal in his 17 - percentage - point loss to GOP nominee Bob McDonnell .
It is true enough that both Democratic candidates had severe limitations —
Deeds was a notably unprepossessing candidate compared with the polished McDonnell , and Corzine was deeply unpopular and at the helm of a state suffering through difficult economic times .
Neither race should be viewed as strictly a referendum on Obama .
But if there is a danger in overinterpreting off - year elections , it is also a mistake to underinterpret .
Particularly in Virginia , the rout of three Democrats running for three separate statewide offices , as well as the loss of several legislative seats , sent an unambiguous message .
The independent voters who helped Obama in 2008 become the first Democratic presidential candidate in 44 years to carry the Old Dominion have swung wildly in a different direction .
The swing from Obama 's win last year to McDonnell 's Tuesday : 23 points .
Exit polls showed Republican McDonnell won 63 percent of independent voters .
Likewise in Democratic - trending Northern Virginia , the Republican carried the three largest suburban counties of Fairfax , Loudoun and Prince William — all counties Obama won handily last year .
In New Jersey , likewise , Christie won 58 percent of independents .
“ This is a shot across the bow to the moderates and Blue Dog Democrats as they decide votes on health care ” and other issues , said Rep. Eric Cantor ( R - Va. ) , the House minority whip .
Democratic National Committee Chairman Tim Kaine — who as current Virginia governor had previously won plaudits for making his state more competitive for his party — saw his reputation scuffed .
But he cautioned against drawing national trends , saying opinion polls show Obama still winning majority support among independents nationally .
" These two races each had their own spin , " Kaine told POLITICO .
Notably , one of Virginia ’s most prominent Democrats , former Gov. L. Douglas Wilder — the nation ’s first elected African - American governor — sided more with Cantor .
“ It ’s a wake - up call for Democrats across the country , ” said Wilder , who did not endorse Deeds .
He said independents are worried about what they see as careless spending by Obama and his Democratic allies in Washington , and he advised Obama to reorganize his White House to rely less on campaign operatives and focus more on governing .
Mississippi Gov. and Republican Governors Association Chairman Haley Barbour compared Tuesday ’s results with 1993 , when Republicans also won Virginia and New Jersey , saying the party ’s success would spur more GOP candidates to run next year .
“ It served as a springboard for the 1994 elections , ” Barbour told POLITICO , alluding to the precursor to the GOP ’s capture of the congressional majority .
“ We elected 73 Republican freshmen in the House of Representatives .
More than half of them made the decision to run for Congress after the November 1993 election . ”
Further , Barbour said , the wins Tuesday would boost the spirits of a party that has been deeply demoralized since not long after Bush ’s 2004 reelection .
“ It energizes and excites our volunteers , our organization people and our donors , ” he said .
Christie ran in heavily Democratic New Jersey , faced an engaged and popular president , was badly outspent by the self - funding Corzine — who ran a barrage of negative ads , some suggesting the former prosecutor was too fat to lead — and also fended off a former Republican running as a third - party candidate who gave anti-Corzine voters an alternative to the GOP nominee .
Yet Christie still defeated Corzine by 4 percentage points — the largest victory by a New Jersey Republican in nearly a quarter - century .
Christie ’s margin marked a 20 - point swing from Obama ’s performance .
The New Jersey race was especially painful for the White House , which , sensing a loss in Virginia , sought to prop up Corzine in the campaign 's final weeks .
The president came to the state for get - out - the - vote rallies on the Sunday before the election , where he called Corzine his “ partner ” in an effort to fire up the Democratic base .
“ We will not lose this election if all of you are as committed as you were last year , ” Obama told a heavily black crowd in Newark .
Obama also appeared in an ad for Corzine aimed at Hispanic voters and recorded robocalls for the governor .
But if Democrats were disappointed in New Jersey , Republicans were elated by Virginia .
The landslide of McDonnell , a former state attorney general , appears to offer the GOP a model for victory in swing states .
A graduate of Pat Robertson ’s Regent University who made his name in the state Legislature as a social conservative , McDonnell downplayed social issues in the campaign and focused intently on winning back the Virginia suburbs that fueled the Democratic resurgence in recent years .
" He focused heavily on the issues that are on voter ’s minds : jobs , transportation , taxes and spending , ” said Barbour .
Democrats took solace in the Owens victory in New York ’s North Country , where they picked up a GOP seat previously held by John McHugh , now the Army secretary .
Republicans seemed to lock up the seat on Saturday when their struggling nominee , Scozzafava , dropped out , giving the Conservative Party nominee , Hoffman , a one - on - one race in a historically Republican district .
But Scozzafava endorsed Owens on Sunday , and some of her moderate supporters from her state Assembly district appear to have followed suit and delivered their votes to the Democrat .
Van Hollen held up their success in New York as indicative of what could happen in the future when the conservative and moderate wings of the GOP clash .
“ The Republican Party spent close to a million dollars to lose a seat they had held since the Civil War , and in the process launched a civil war of their own , ” he said .
Former Republican Rep. Tom Davis of Virginia , an outspoken moderate who is often frustrated by his party ’s rightward tilt , said the message of the Christie and McDonnell wins — and the Hoffman loss — is that his party should own the center on economic issues .
But he said the lesson for Democrats is even more urgent .
“ Any Democrat from a border or Southern or even a rural district has got to take a deep breath and look for some ways to get some distance from from Obama , ” Davis said .
Jonathan Martin reported from East Brunswick , N.J .
The death of a luge competitor who left the track at high speed has cast a shadow over the 2010 Winter Olympics .
Georgian Nodar Kumaritashvili's sled flipped and he smashed into a steel pole at the Whistler Sliding Centre , killing the 21 - year - old .
Georgia confirmed they will compete in the Games as a tribute to him , while organisers said the luge event will take place following an investigation .
The Georgian team were given a standing ovation at Friday 's opening ceremony .
Kumaritashvili's sled struck the inside of the track 's last turn during his sixth and final training run , sending his body into the air and over a concrete wall .

Media requires JavaScript to play .
His sled remained on the track , and the visor from his helmet appeared to continue down the ice .
Medical staff at the track and doctors at a local hospital tried to resuscitate Kumaritashvili , part of a seven - strong Georgian team , but the country 's Olympic delegation later confirmed he had died as a result of his injuries .
" We are all in deep shock , we do n't know what to do .
We do n't know whether to take part in the opening ceremony or even the Olympic Games themselves , " said delegation head Irakly Japaridze .

" This tragedy casts a shadow over these Games , " said a visibly upset International Olympic Committee ( IOC ) president Jacques Rogge , while International Luge Federation chief Josef Fendt said the incident was " the gravest thing that can happen in sport " .
The decision to go ahead with the luge competition on Saturday was taken after probes by the Coroners Service of British Colombia and the International Luge Federation ( FIL ) .
Officials concluded the track was not deficient but that the athlete " did not compensate properly " going into a bend .
BBC Sport 's Colin Bryce , a former British bobsleigh competitor , said Kumaritashvili was " clearly nervous going down the final run - you could see his head sticking up . "
WHISTLER SLIDING CENTRE
Opened : Winter 2008 Vertical drop : 152 m Max gradient : 20 % Track top speed : 95.65 mph ( 153.93kph ) Cost : 104 m Can dollars ( £ 63 m )
Average speed at Whistler is 15 mph greater than at other tracks Average vertical drop at Whistler is 28 m greater than at other tracks Bryce added : " He was very scared going down the fast corners .
" It 's up to the organisers whether there is such a small percentage chance of that happening again that we continue with the race , or whether we stop . "
The track at Whistler , which is shared by the sports of luge , skeleton and bobsleigh , already has a reputation as one of the fastest - and most dangerous - in the world .
In the build - up to the Games several teams had raised concerns about the safety of athletes , who regularly exceed 90 mph as they compete , though Kumaritashvili crashed at a corner which had not been previously identified as a danger area .
Before the incident , British skeleton slider Amy Williams told BBC Sport : " I just hope Whistler is safe and that there are n't too many crashes and serious injuries . "

Australia 's Hannah Campbell - Pegg added : " I think they are pushing it a little too much .
" To what extent are we just little lemmings that they just throw down a track and we 're crash - test dummies ?
I mean , this is our lives . "
Their comments followed earlier accidents , including one involving gold medal favourite Armin Zoeggeler of Italy and several during women 's luge training runs on Wednesday .
Among those who crashed , Romania 's Violeta Stramaturaru was knocked unconscious for a few minutes and taken to hospital .
The track is where British competitor Adam Rosen crashed during training in October last year .
He suffered a dislocated hip as well as nerve and tendon damage .
After intensive rehabilitation , Rosen made the team for his second Winter Games and was taking part in the same training session when Kumaritashvili crashed .
" We are a family in luge , so a sudden and tragic loss such as this impacts everyone deeply , " said Rosen in a statement released by the British Olympic Association .
" We know that the international federation , the IOC and ( Vancouver organisers ) have no higher priority than ensuring our safety , on and off the field of play .
" I know they are looking into this and , should it be deemed necessary for them to introduce additional measures , they will do so . "
British skeleton 's performance director , Andi Schmid , said before the Games that a lack of track time for athletes in the run-up to the Games had increased the risk of accidents .
" To what extent are we just little lemmings that they throw down a track ?
I mean , this is our lives "
Hannah Campbell - Pegg , Australian luger " I would say especially for speed sports you need to have more access to tracks and whoever organises the Olympics needs to offer that , " said Schmid in January .
" Not only so that everyone has a fair chance but also because of the danger .
We need to be careful so that these sports stay great action sports and do n't become dangerous killer sports .
" I 'm not saying that will happen but some athletes from other nations are less experienced . "
Kumaritashvili competed in five World Cup races this season , finishing 44th in the world standings .
He had already crashed in the second of his six training runs , emerging shaken but unhurt .
His average speed in others runs - 88 mph - was considerably less than speeds achieved by top competitors so far .
Prior to the Vancouver Games , no Winter Olympic athlete had been killed during an event .
But the 1964 Games in Innsbruck were overshadowed by the deaths of two competitors before it began .
British luger Kazimierz Kay - Skrzypeski was killed during practice two weeks before on the Igls Olympic track , and Australian skier Ross Milne died during training for the same Games .

The forever lovely final girl of The Texas Chainsaw Massacre 2 ( the real one , not that lame The Beginning bullshit ) is thankfully still stretching her legs in the horror business , and word has come that she ’s just landed a role in Madison County director Eric England ’s new flick , Contracted !
Bloody Disgusting reports that Caroline Williams has joined the previously announced cast , which includes Katie Stegeman , Charley Koontz , Najarra Townsend , E - Kan Soong , Matt Mercer , Simon Barrett , Alice Macdonald , Jennifer Gonzalez , Ruben Pla , and Lionel D. Carson .
“ Contracted is really a product of all the promiscuity that goes on in the world and the lack of understanding for which the consequences carry , ” England told us in an earlier interview .
“ There are shows that glamorize promiscuous sex like ‘ Teen Moms ’ and ‘ Jersey Shore ’ , and I just wanted to take that and kind of spin it on its head .
Contracted is definitely not a ‘ preachy ’ movie by any means .
It does n’t get on a soapbox about anything ; it ’s more of just a really gruesome PSA on sex and relationships all spinning out of control .
Love , passion , and emotions are all powerful things ; and if they ’re played with in the wrong ways , they can become deadly . ”
The film , penned by England , tells the tale of “ a young girl who has a one - night stand with a random stranger and contracts what she thinks is a sexually - transmitted disease – but is actually something much worse . ”
Contracted is coming to us from the new production company BoulderLight Pictures , co-founded by JD Lifshitz and Raphael Margules , and Southern Fried Films .

* Paper says Obama to propose $ 3.8 trillion 2011 budget
* White House outlines proposed cuts to help tame deficit ( Updates with New York Times report , adds details on cuts )
WASHINGTON , Jan 30 ( Reuters ) - President Barack Obama will propose trimming or chopping 120 government programs to help rein in the U.S. deficit , the White House said on Saturday , in a 2011 budget proposal that a newspaper reported would hit $ 3.8 trillion .
Obama is slated to publish his budget proposal on Monday for the fiscal year starting on Oct 1 .
The White House declined to confirm or deny a report in the New York Times that valued the 2011 budget at $ 3.8 trillion .
The newspaper said the proposal would include $ 25 billion for struggling states and provide funding increases for programs at the Energy Department , National Institutes of Health , National Science Foundation and the Census Bureau .
An administration official confirmed to Reuters that the budget would include a 6 percent increase in civilian research programs .
Obama has promised to tackle record deficits with a spending freeze on some domestic programs .
The three - year freeze , which excludes spending on national security and defense programs as well as Social Security , Medicare and Medicaid entitlement programs , would save $ 20 billion in fiscal 2011 and $ 250 billion by 2020 .
The White House gave a preview of some of the proposed cuts on its blog on Saturday .
“ The President believes we need to be honest about what is working and what is n’t and that making tough choices about which programs to fund and which to reduce or terminate is part of governing , ” White House Communications Director Dan Pfeiffer said in a statement .
The country ’s 1.4 trillion budget deficit is a political albatross for Obama , with Republicans seeking to paint the president as a big spender while the White House emphasizes he inherited a $ 1.3 trillion deficit when he took office .
CUTS , INCREASES
One of the administration ’s proposals , a repeat from last year , would eliminate the “ Advanced Earned Income Tax Credit , ” which allows eligible taxpayers with children to get a portion of a tax credit paid out in their paychecks .
The White House said only 514,000 people -- 3 percent of those eligible -- claimed the credit and the error rate for the program was high , with 80 percent of recipients not complying with one or more of the program ’s requirements .
“ This ineffective and prone - to - error program should be eliminated , ” Pfeiffer said .
Congress rejected that cut last year -- a sign that it may be hard to get through this proposal .
The White House said it would fight congressional resistance to cut wasteful programs .
Other changes would include consolidating 38 programs at the Department of Education into 11 to clamp down on inefficiencies and demand greater accountability from states and school districts on grants .
The budget would again target a program originally created to restore land with abandoned coal mines .
The program had changed from its original focus and now allowed payments to go to states and tribes that had already cleaned up the mines .
A program related to national parks was also on the chopping block .
The New York Times said space agency NASA ’s mission to fly back to the moon would be scrapped and some public works projects by the Army Corps of Engineers would lose funding .
The budget would provide more funds for military programs , including the Pentagon ’s Special Operations forces , the U.S. Army ’s Black Hawk and Chinook helicopters , and the F - 35 Joint Strike Fighter , the paper reported .
The White House declined to identify what each of the programs listed on Saturday would save individually .
Last year Obama proposed terminating or trimming 121 programs to save $ 17 billion in one year .
Congress approved only a portion of those cuts .

Education and policing are more effective than the filter says the group .
Google and Yahoo have joined two Australian organisations calling for a " rethink " of the country 's controversial internet filter plans .
The Australian government has announced proposals to introduce a mandatory filter which would block all RC ( Refused Classification ) content .
The groups argue that the subjects covered by RC material are too wide - ranging for a blanket ban .
They also warn that the filter will not " effectively protect children " .
They claim this is because hardcore material , specifically that featuring children , tends to appear on chatrooms and peer - to - peer networks which are more difficult to filter .
The signatories include the Australian Library and Information Association ( ALIA ) and the Inspire Foundation , which encourages young people to get online .
ALIA 's Executive Director Sue Hutley said that blanket bans on material through filtering have been " shown to trap legitimate information and adversely affect valid internet access and performance " .
The statement on the ALIA website adds that a report about government trials of the filter acknowledged the strain of filtering sites with very high traffic .
Dealing with sites such as YouTube could " cause additional load on the filtering infrastructure and subsequent performance bottlenecks , " they claim .
Ms Hutley warns that the current filter proposals would create a " false sense of security " for Australian web users .
" We are directing our support for national cybersafety education and increased funding for policing , " she said .
The filter , first announced by Stephen Conroy ( Australia 's Minister for Broadband , Communications and the Digital Economy ) in 2008 , has proved controversial .
Groups including Systems Administrators Guild of Australia ( SAGE - AU ) and Electronic Frontiers Australia have spoken out against it , and the topic has trended highly on Twitter .
On 10 and 11 February an activist group called Anonymous attacked several official Australian government websites in protest , taking them offline for short periods of time .

Photo : redmaxwell via FlickrBill Gates , the Microsoft founder and philanthropist , made waves last week when , at the much - celebrated tech conference TED , he proclaimed that climate change is the most important problem facing the planet .
Wo0t !
Obviously having someone of Gates ’ stature supporting the clean energy race is an unqualified good .
( See Alex Steffen on Gates ’ talk . )
That said , Gates has burst on to the energy scene with some rather ill - considered thinking .
To get a flavor , see his blog post , “ Why We Need Innovation , Not Just Insulation . ”
The idea is that “ conservation and behavior change ” might get the world to its 2020 or 2030 targets , but to get to 80 percent emissions reductions by 2050 we ’ll need fundamental technological innovation .
Ergo : we should pay more attention to , and devote more money to , basic science and R&D .
Now : it ’s incontestably true that the U.S. investment in R&D is lower than it should be .
We should increase funding in the search for game - changing technology that can help us generate and use energy more sustainably .
Indeed , we should increase funding in lots of things !
Therein lies the rub .
There are two problems with Gates ’ dichotomy between innovation and insulation .
The first is the more obvious but the second is more meaningful .
( Also , see Joe Romm and Sean Casten for further Gates critiques . )
1. Insofar as there ’s a distinction between developing new technology that helps generate more / cleaner / cheaper energy and using energy more wisely , we obviously need to do both .
Just as efficiency alone will never get us to our goals , neither will new generation .
Richard Heinberg at the Post - Carbon Institute argues , in his report “ Searching for a Miracle , ” that …
… there is little likelihood that either conventional fossil fuels or alternative energy sources can reliably be counted on to provide the amount and quality of energy that will be needed to sustain economic growth — or even current levels of economic activity — during the remainder of the current century .
I do n’t know if Heinberg ’s right .
I ’m inclined to think there ’s greater potential in renewable energy than he allows , but I ’m too keenly aware of my cognitive shortcomings to get into the Math ’n ’ Graph Olympics .
Either way , it ’s a safe bet that whatever breakthroughs in energy generation technology arrive in coming decades , they wo n’t be able , in and of themselves , to keep up with rising population and affluence .
And it would be sheerest folly to depend on their arrival .
Getting maximum energy services out of each electron will be an overriding human imperative in the 21st century , and it will require every bit as much ingenuity and imagination as the pursuit of new generation technology .
It ’s not a zero sum game ; there is no reasonable sense in which concern for efficiency is eclipsing concern for innovation .
We absolutely have to do both , and no country on earth is doing either at the scale that will ultimately be required .
2. Innovation ≠ technology .
The deeper and more pernicious problem with Gates ’ framing is the implication that technology is where we innovate ; in all other areas of life , we just … manage .
This taps into some deep archetypes that are worth digging up .
In modern industrial society we ’ve come to see progress as effectively synonymous with technology .
When it comes to energy , when someone says “ invest in new technology or , ” the or is usually followed some version of restricting , curtailing , or sacrificing .
Technology is the opposite of constraint .
Proponents of the technology - centric policy perspective cast themselves as forward - looking optimists — in contrast , implicitly or explicitly , to the dour doom - and - gloomers who want you to shiver in the dark .
They find easy favor because in America optimism is technology , and vice versa .
I ’ve come to think that this conflation of progress / innovation and technology — specifically energy - generation technology — is one of the principal barriers to a bright green future .
To illustrate the point , consider a book I recently reviewed , Reinventing the Automobile , by two engineers from from GM ’s advanced auto division and the head of MIT ’s Smart Cities program .
Among other things , it describes the sustainable city of the future in considerable detail .
Here is an extremely condensed sketch of that city :
Everything is linked up in a smart , integrated communications , power , and transportation network .
The city “ knows ” which roads are congested and which parking spots are free .
It can communicate to individuals what combination of walking , transit , and individual vehicles will get them where they ’re going fastest .
Vehicles are small , electric , modular , and — via sensors , GPS , and broadband wireless — intelligent , so they can pilot and park themselves .
They can be charged by parking - integrated stations or even electromagnetic coils embedded in curbs , and since they ’re interchangeable and easily customizable , they can be public goods ( like today ’s car - sharing services ) , easily swapped out and thus continuously in use .
The city uses the vehicles ’ batteries as distributed energy storage , along with other storage options including pumped hydro integrated into the sewer system .
Rooftops , parking lots , and other marginal lands are covered with solar panels ; small - scale wind turbines are perched on bridges and towers ; cogeneration systems are attached to every industrial facility .
Through smart design and sensing , every building and neighborhood maximizes efficiency .
The city senses power demand , knows where power is being produced and stored , and continuously balances supply and demand .
Cool , right ?!
At first blush it sounds like a Jetsons techno - fantasy .
Here ’s the thing , though : according to the authors , who should know , most of the necessary technology either exists or is in development .
None of it relies on any major breakthroughs .
By a wide margin , the biggest barriers to creating such bright green cities are social .
To pick just a handful :
Building a city that behaves like an integrated organism means developing a holistic , long - term plan that will coordinate multiple agencies and levels of government .
Big , long - term thinking is not exactly an American strong suit these days .
Also — and this is a underappreciated problem — cities are cripplingly dependent on the financial largesse of state and federal authorities .
They have very little autonomy to borrow money and invest in their own futures .
There are all kinds of collective action and first - mover problems :
Who puts the charging stations in if there are n’t electric cars on the road yet , and vice versa ?
Who pays for a smart grid before distributed generation is in place , and vice versa ?
How can public infrastructure and private market development be coordinated ?
Many of the investments involve high upfront costs that are paid back slowly over time .
New financing models will be needed both for private individuals and companies and for cities themselves .
Changes in the way individuals live , work , communicate , and travel must be introduced in a way that maintains social cohesion and political support for further changes .
That requires research in social psychology and other behavioral disciplines ( sorely lacking in much policymaking ) .
How these things are introduced matters just as much as what they are .
One could go on .
The point is that the way we live together now , the way we govern ourselves , the way we arrange our physical spaces and our commerce , the way we do economics and measure prosperity — all these have to be changed in creative ways if we want to achieve the goal of sustainable prosperity .
All these changes require … wait for it … innovation .
Innovations in the way we think , interact , and structure our lives require just as much imagination , intelligence , persistence , and funding as innovations in technology .
Consider this analogy :
The best brain research and social science show that reason , emotion , instinct , and social context are all part of a seamless whole , human being .
There is no separate faculty called “ reason ” that operates outside or above .
The division between “ reason and emotion ” is spurious — there is no one without the other ; they are part of the same process .
Similarly , technology is not a separate thing unto itself .
Tools , like customs , laws , built spaces , and ecological processes , are part of a seamless whole of human society .
Technology happens in a social context , is of a social context ; it shapes and is shaped by the context .
Innovating new tools is not an alternative to innovating new social arrangements , much less a substitute ; it is part and parcel of the same process .
Bill Gates is right that we need more funding , support , and attention applied to energy technology .
But if we truly seek to fashion a sustainable future , we need just as much applied to laws , regulations , infrastructure , economics , behaviors , and values .
We need to innovate a new way of being in the world , not just new tools .
After a long , and historically snowy winter here in Washington DC , we harvested our winter crop on March 10th .
We have been enjoying the lettuce , spinach , turnips , carrots , and greens ever since .
From the beginning , we wanted to demonstrate that a four - season garden was indeed possible even in Washington D.C.
As it turned out , this winter was harsher than most and in fact more like the ones typical to Chicago , with the city experiencing over two feet of snow one week !
[ [ nid:10248 ] ]
Farmers and gardeners around the world are extending their growing seasons through the very simple technology of hoop houses .
We used a smaller version that is often referred to as high tunnels .
The structures are simply a series of four or five metal bars arched over the beds about three feet high .
Fixed to the bars is a simple plastic covering which traps the heat of the sun during the day to keep the plants from freezing at night .
We were cautiously optimistic that our hoop houses would protect the crops and were pleasantly surprised .
All told we harvested just under 50 lbs of produce .
A modest harvest compared to what the summer had brought , but it is exciting to have been able to produce food during a long harsh winter .
The lettuce and spinach are particularly sweet and delicious .
We also learned a few things .
For example , we planted our carrots a little too late .
They were not as big as we had hoped , but the little things are tasty !
We also discovered that the beds to the north side of the garden get considerably more sun the beds that the beds on south side .
The sun is much lower in the sky and late in the day the southern beds are shadowed by surrounding trees .
Next year , we will be sure to put plants that need more sun on the north side of the garden .
Good lessons to learn , but all together a nice surprise .
Over the next few weeks we will be getting the garden ready for our spring planting .
Seeds are being sprouted and at the First Lady ’s request we have expanded the garden by 500 square feet so we can grow even more varieties of fruits and vegetables .
Needless to say we are excited for Spring so stay tuned !
More than most new businesses , restaurants are vulnerable to vagaries beyond their control , and COVID - 19 has created even more speed bumps on the path from “ opening soon ” to “ now open . ”

AROUND 3000 spectators descended on a steep hill near Brockworth , Gloucestershire , on Monday to witness a now world - famous annual cheese - rolling event .
A long held tradition dating back to the 1800s , participants defy health and safety warnings to chase a wheel of cheese 200 metres down Cooper ’s Hill .
In this year ’s event a foam cheese wheel replaced the more traditional 8lb piece of Double Gloucester after organisers were told they could face legal action in case of an accident .
This year , an Australian traveller , Caleb Stalder , 30 , took out the title in the second race of the day .
Mr Stadler , from Taree , NSW , now lives in London .
He told the BBC he was not expecting to win the prize .
“ You ca n’t control yourself whatsoever so it ’s a case of rolling down and seeing where you end up , ” Mr Stadler said .
“ I ca n’t believe I got the cheese .
It ’s awesome .
I was n’t anywhere near being first down and the cheese took a bit of a turn and I caught it . ”
The opening race was won by an American daredevil in a stars and stripes morph suit , who had travelled more than 4,000 miles from Colorado Springs to take part .
Kenny Rackers , 27 , told the BBC he had come to the UK to participate in the race .
I trained a long time for this and got hurt on the hill practising .
I came three days early and I took a bad spill , but I came to win and that ’s what I did , ” he said .
“ I came 3,000 or 4,000 miles just for this race .
I put it on my bucket list and today it was to win and that ’s what I did . ”
The woman ’s race was won by Brockworth local , Lucy Townsend , 16 .
Local Ryan Fairley took out the third men’s race , and Tomoaki Tanaka from Japan claimed the fourth men ’s race dressed as a ninja .
The event was held unofficially , following the cancellation of the 2009 official event after more than 15,000 people turned up as spectators to watch .
Highlights from the 2013 cheese - rolling festival :
How does it compare to 2009 ?
CAMP LEATHERNECK , Afghanistan — When the Marines cry " Havoc ! " and let slip the dogs of war , one remains in his kennel .

Supercharge your retirement savings plan no matter how far you are along with the smartest tools , tips , and technology experts can recommend .
When we talk about retirement , we often use abstract terms like " When I stop working , I 'll … " or " Eventually , I 'll have enough money for … "
But are we taking the right steps to ensure we ’re saving enough to stop working and retire comfortably ?
According to a survey from Northwestern Mutual , we are n’t doing nearly enough .
Over two - thirds of respondents are concerned that they will outlive their retirement savings .
Around 20 % did n’t have any retirement savings at all , and about a third of baby boomers have less than $ 25,000 set away for retirement .
With so much concern about having enough money to stop working , it is important to start saving as soon as possible and then continually add to your retirement fund .
Afterall , the more you save now , the more you ’ll have in retirement .
We traversed the internet and gathered some of the best personal finance advice available to help you get started planning for retirement .
Wwe 've whittled down all the overwhelming information out there to serve up 13 insanely smart ways that 'll empower you to start planning and saving for retirement today .
Let 's get started !
Figure Out How Much You 'll Need in Reitrement
" I want to retire rich " sounds like a great plan , but you 'll need to be more specific about your financial goals if you have any hopes of achieving them .
The Department of Labor reports that you 'll need anywhere from 70 to 90 percent of your current income to retire comfortably in your later years .
Do n't want to do the calculations on your own ?
Use this retirement calculator to get exact figures of how much you 'll need to save .
Have you heard of SMART goals ?
You can apply them to your finances , too , especially when it comes to saving for retirement .
Here 's how SMART would work when it comes to saving for retirement :
Specific :
Save money and buy coffee only two mornings a week instead of five .
Of course , you can swap coffee for any other small purchase
The point is that small purchases can add up to big bucks over the years — and those funds can pad your retirement savings account .
Measurable :
You already figured out how much you need to save , no break that into monthly , or yearly chunks and track your progress .
Achievable : Make saving as easy as possible by having 10 — 15 percent automatically deducted from your paycheck .
Or use an app like Acorns , which automatically rounds up credit card payments and invests the change ( which really adds up ! )
Talk about a great way to painlessly save and invest a few extra dollars per week .
Realistic :
Set goals based on your current income , what you need , and give yourself plenty of time to get to the end result .
Time bound :
Set and stick to savings deadlines whenever possible .
This will prevent you from saying things like " someday I 'll have $ 5,000 in my retirement account . "
Instead , you 'll know that in " 2 years , I 'll have $ 5,000 in my retirement account . "
Optimize Your monthly Contributions to Boost Your Retirement Fund
You already know you should be making monthly contributions to your 401 ( k ) or IRA .
But how much should you be saving ?
Many experts at say save " as much as you can . "
What does that mean for you ?
Well , some will say that 10 % is a good rule of thumb , but it only if you got an early start to saving for retirement .
If you 're in your 40s , and you 're getting a late start , you 'll want to shoot for 15 % to get back on track with saving for retirement .
In the end , if you really want to have financial security come retirement , you 'll have to optimize those contributions .
Notice we said optimize your contributions , not max them out .
There 's a reason for that .
If you 're making good money , it makes sense to contribute the maximum allowed for your retirement fund every year .
But since it 's the IRS , there are going to be details and rules that you need to keep in mind .
Basically , what you need to know is :
You can only put in $ 54,000 per year into your retirement accounts to qualify for tax considerations .
This amount changes per year .
In 2016 , it was $ 53,000 .
How much money you can factor in ( how high of an amount you can say you need to save based on your income ) from your salary and employer matching is also capped .
The compensation is limit $ 270,000 in 2017 .
Nice problem to have !
If you 're not putting aside money in an emergency fund for short - term financial needs ( more on this later ) , then you should rethink contributing the max amount to your 401( k ) .
Get Your Savings On
Here are a few scenarios in which you can make the most of your retirement fund contributions :
If you have a 401 ( k ) or a 403 ( b ) , check whether your company matches your contributions , and if so , how much .
You want to be contributing at least enough to get the full company match , preferably more .
If your company does NOT offer a retirement plan , open an IRA at a brokerage firm like Fidelity or Vanguard .
Depending on your situation , you can choose a traditional IRA or a Roth IRA .
Traditional IRAs enable you to invest pre-tax dollars for retirement — the money grows tax - free , but you 'll pay taxes when you withdraw the money in retirement .
Paying taxes later is n't the end of the world , since your tax bracket usually is lower than where you were when you started i.e. your income is lower since you 've retired !
Roth IRAs invest after - tax dollars — instead of getting a tax deduction today , you pay taxes now but can withdraw the money tax - free in retirement .
They 're good if your income is high now and may be lower when you retire .
Like a health care plan , a retirement fund is an important employee benefit .
When you switch jobs , you 'll want to keep an eye out for retirement benefits — even more so than a higher salary .
Some companies are better than others when it comes to supporting your retirement .
Think Before you Fund Additional Retirement Accounts .
While saving more money sounds like it will automatically improve your financial future , you 'll need to pay attention to which funds work better when it comes to tax benefits .
Plus , some accounts may charge fees if your balance is n't high enough .
If your company does n't have a 401 ( k ) , here 's another option for you : the myRA .
As far as retirement funds go , it 's one of the easiest to manage because you do n't have to make any investment choices :
The myRA is invested only in a U.S. Treasury retirement savings bond whose value is guaranteed .
Ted Beck , president , and CEO of the National Endowment for Financial Education , has this to say about investing in a myRA :
If you are very risk - averse , and many people are , this is a guaranteed rate .
You do n't have to worry about having your balance go below what you started at or fees chewing away at your principal .
Did we just say " guaranteed " ?
We sure did .
There are n't many guarantees in life , and there are practically none when it comes to money .
Small contributions to your myRA are fine , as there are no fees for low balances
There is one drawback — once your balance reaches $ 15,000 or the account is open for 30 years , you must rollover your myRA into a Roth IRA .
Speaking of rollovers , do n't forget that when you switch jobs , you have to rollover your previous 401 ( k ) into whatever retirement fund your new employer is ( hopefully ) offering .
There is some paperwork involved , but it 's mainly taken care of by the HR departments at your former and current companies , so get it taken care of soon after you start your new job .
Understand the Power of Compound Interest
Grab a calculator — it 's time for a quick lesson in compound interest .
In simplest terms , it 's interest that earns interest .
Basically , when the balance of your retirement fund earns interest , that interest gets reinvested to earn more interest so that the whole sum grows and grows .
Using 7 % as the annual rate of return , here 's what an IRA max contribution of $ 5,500 per year looks like over the decades if you started saving at age 25 :
You simply can't get that large of a return on investment with a regular savings account — which offers , on average , less than 0.25 % in interest .
So while you can't pull a stress - free retirement out of a hat , it makes sense to take advantage of compound interest .
Yes , it 's math , but it still seems like magic , right ?
It 's enough to make you want to work longer and keep saving , right ?
Just kidding .
The point of all this financial sacrificing is so that one day you 'll take your leave of the rat race .
You 'll get there , but you do have to do one thing above all …
Make Saving a Priority and Sleep Better at Night
Who here has n't laid in bed unable to sleep while their mind spins with thoughts about how their bills or piling up or how they 'll afford daycare next month ?
It has to be one of the worst feelings in the world : not sleeping due to stress about money .
You want a good night 's sleep .
Right ?
Of course , you do .
Stress about money and security is some of the worst .
Here 's how to get rid of the obstacles that are keeping you from saving as much as you can each month :
Pay Off Debt
Debt gets in the way of everything , but it especially gets in the way of saving .
If you 've got credit card debt , pay it off as fast as you can .
Once you 've gotten those balances down to zero , take that same figure you were paying your credit card company and apply it toward your emergency or retirement fund .
Remember That a Little Can Go a Long Way
Finance expert David Bach presents
The Latte Factor® as proof that small daily sacrifices can lead you to the life of a millionaire down the road .
Could giving up your daily latte make you a millionaire ?
It may , especially if giving up an overpriced beverage gets you thinking about other small sacrifices you can make for the sake of financial independence .
Automate Your Savings
Your company 's 401 ( k ) is deducted automatically from each paycheck , so you wo n't miss having that extra money in your paycheck .
If you 've got an IRA , do the same thing .
If you do n't see the money in the first place , you wo n't miss it .
The more painless you can make your savings each month , the better off you 'll be .
Think of the above tips as the " new " form of counting sheep — you 'll sleep better knowing you 're as focused as you should be on your future finances .
Take Advantage of Financial Planning Resources
Many people think they need to have hundreds of thousands of dollars saved up to work with a financial planner .
While wealth managers typically charge a fee equal to 1 - 1.5 % of their clients ' assets , companies like Charles Schwab or Fidelity often work with individuals and couples who are just getting started in learning how to save for retirement .
Other low - cost options include robo-advisors that provide resources to people growing their nest eggs .
The major benefit of working with a financial professional is that you 've got an expert on your side who understands market volatility and how to make portfolio adjustments accordingly .
He or she is adept at recognizing and managing risk , so you 'll get a fair warning when you need to pivot your investments .
And if you do n't know your mutual fund from your ETF ( more on these later ) , your financial adviser can help explain complex financial terms in an easy - to - understand manner .
Do n't procrastinate because of the paperwork
Keep in mind that it 's completely OK to have lots of questions about your retirement fund — but do n't wait to get the answers before you open an account .
When it comes to saving for retirement , it 's better to act now and ask questions later .
And if you 're allergic to paperwork , know that you have options .
Get Automated and Get Rid of the Financial Paperwork
Even if you 're a small potatoes investor ( for now ) , you can still avail yourself of many online financial resources .
Here 's a sample of some of the best saving apps out there , according to a survey by PC Mag :
These apps make managing your money ridiculously easy , so if you 've got modest savings , you can most likely manage it yourself on your smartphone — for now .

Get Schooled in Investments and Get an A+ for Your Retirement Portfolio
If you 're like most people , ≈ the stock market ticker is just a jumble of numbers and decimal points .
While it 's not necessary to get your broker 's license to gain a handle on your personal finances , it does make sense to have a basic understanding of the different types of investments available .
Here 's a quick list of five key investment terms :
Stocks
Stocks :
When you buy a stock , you are paying to own a ( very ) small part of a public company .
There are many stockholders for any given company , but when the company does well , you 'll all do well .
The stock market is rather volatile , though — meaning it has many ups and downs .
Many experts would agree : Invest in stocks and hang on for the ride , since over long stretches of time , the market typically goes up in value .
Bonds
Bonds :
Even successful businesses need loans from time to time .
When you invest in bonds , you are loaning money to businesses , which will later pay you back with interest according to the terms of the bond .
Many investors like bonds because they more or less know what they 're getting back on their investment .
If you like to keep a conservative portfolio , bonds are the way to go .
Mutual Funds
Mutual funds :
These are groups of assets , like stocks and bonds .
Mutual funds are ideal for new investors , as it does n't take much money to invest and build a diverse portfolio that incorporates different types of investments .
Diversity is key to investing , as it helps investors manage risk .
ETFs
ETFs : ETFs stand for exchange - traded funds .
These are similar to mutual funds , but they trade on the stock exchange similar to stocks .
Regular folks like us like them because they often come with fewer fees and more choices .
Real Estate and Infrastructure
Real estate and infrastructure :
Even if you 're not ready to purchase your own home , you can still invest in real estate and infrastructure development .
Investing in infrastructure , including airports , bridges , and mass transit , offers low - risk alternatives to traditional stocks and bonds .
Again , diversity is key to a strong investment portfolio , so your retirement fund should reflect a healthy mix of most or all of the investments featured above .
Include Social Security in your Financial Planning and feel secure about your future
As we mentioned earlier , the future of Social Security is uncertain .
If you want to plan for a financial rainy day , then it makes sense not to overestimate your future Social Security payments .
But do n't think you 're financially savvy by excluding them from your retirement planning .
Why ?
Is n't it better to err on the side of caution ?
Not necessarily .
Here 's why :
If you leave Social Security out of the equation entirely , you 're not planning for a rainy day ; you 're planning for a complete washout , followed by a zombie apocalypse .
That 's not being conservative ; that 's being unrealistic .
While the future of any government program can be iffy , many experts say that even if Social Security does n't make it for the long haul , there will be something similar to take its place .
So do n't lose sleep over Social Security .
All that money you 've been paying over the years will still be there in some form or another .
The Department of Labor reports that when you start collecting Social Security , it comes out to about 40 percent of what you earned before retirement .
Remember that Retirement Contributions are Pre-Tax
Breaking news :
Paying income tax is not going anywhere anytime soon .
But consider this : 401( k ) and Roth IRA contributions are taken out of your paycheck before taxes .
Sure , you may balk at the idea of paying more money each month into your 401 ( k ) or Roth IRA when you 're living paycheck to paycheck .
But your income is only taxed after that chunk is taken out .
So if you start making bigger contributions to your retirement fund each month , guess what ?
Your taxable income is even lower , which means you pay the government less .
Depending on how much you can take out , you could even put yourself into a lower tax bracket .
Work with Your Partner to Save for Retirement
What 's better than a well - funded retirement account ?
Two well - funded retirement accounts !
Boost your retirement savings by strategizing as a couple .
Here are two ways to make the most out of your partnership :
Let the younger partner take on more risk .
This is especially important if the couple has an age gap .
It makes sense for an individual to take fewer investment risks as he or she reaches retirement age .
But the younger partner has more time to recover from market volatility .
The younger partner in your relationship should check in with a financial adviser and make the necessary portfolio adjustments .
Stagger your respective retirements .
If you are close in age , it makes sense to retire at a different time than your partner .
From a financial perspective , the retiree can begin to live off of retirement payouts while the partner who is still working can max out retirement contributions or perhaps even pay catch - up contributions , which are additional retirement fund deposits that individuals 50 and older can make .
From a personal perspective , retirement is a major lifestyle adjustment , and it may be beneficial to experience that adjustment one person at a time .
They 're not joking when they say two is better than one — in matters of the heart and money management .
Leave your Retirement Savings Alone to Avoid Penalties
If you 're doing everything right , you 're going to see your retirement account grow handsomely over the years .
Admire that balance all you want — but do n't touch that account unless it 's for an extremely good reason .
Not only will you pay a penalty for early withdrawal , but you 'll also set yourself back big time with saving .
Only in some very specific instances , the IRS does let you withdraw from your retirement savings accounts ( 401 ( k ) , IRA , etc. ) without having to pay a stiff penalty .
Depending on your retirement fund and your age ( you can take out as much as you like when you 're 59.5 years old ) , you are allowed early withdrawals or loans — as exemptions — against your balance .
Here are a few reasons that someone would consider withdrawing money from a retirement fund :
Down payment for a home
College costs for a child
Disability
Medical expenses
If you need money , apply for a personal loan or tap into your emergency fund .
Set up an Emergency Fund
An emergency fund is just that : Money set aside in case of emergency .
In addition to setting money aside for retirement , you want to have money you can access if you get sick or lose your job .
The idea here is to let nothing get in the way of your retirement savings .
But sometimes , things have a way of getting in the way of everything .
Do n't Regret Past Financial Mistakes
Here 's a bit of advice that 's more personal than finance :
Now that you know how to save for retirement , do n't wallow in past financial mistakes .
It 's not healthy , and it 's certainly not productive .
The point is to get started !
By using some of the tips and tricks we 've shown you here , you 'll soon establish momentum in saving for retirement .

Former GSA adminstrator Lurita Doan
-- Al Kamen , in a WaPo " In the Loop " item yesterday ,
Actually , the story turned out to be even stinkier .
As I wrote
So here we were the other day , jumping ugly on poor Lurita Doan as she slinked out of her post as administrator of the General Services Administration -- in disgrace , we assumed , for the conversion of the GSA to an arm of Karl Rove 's Right - Wing Political Bulldozing Machine and the mounting murmurs of money diversion that took place on her watch .
Now word is that Lurita was made to walk the plank , not for being corrupt , but for not being corrupt enough !
Apparently even as the Bush regime 's days dwindle , it 's never too late for the powers that be to be ramming more of their partisan hacks and cronified Republicrooks into gummint employment .
And it seems that Lurita actually stood in the way , and so had to go .
reported that he was told by then - Rep. Tom Davis ( R - VA ) , ranking member of the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee and a Doan supporter , that she " rejected a series of White House candidates for the jobs of GSA general counsel and chief acquisition officer . "
According to Davis , backed up by " GSA officials , " " That seems to be the straw that broke that camel 's back . "
Yesterday Al reported :
A Washington Post investigation of Doan 's activity turned up , among other things , a no-bid procurement order she had approved for a friend 's firm .
This led to a House oversight committee investigation , another by the GSA inspector general and one by Sen.
Charles Grassley ( R - Iowa ) .
The U.S. Office of Special Counsel urged President George W. Bush to discipline her " to the fullest extent , " including canning her .
So on Tuesday we got an e-mail from a local public relations company .
" Lurita Doan is a former administrator of the U.S. General Services Administration ( GSA ) and former small business owner ; she is an expert on the principles of small business and can give a unique background on how government affects it , " the note said .
" These include fiscal discipline , good government , leadership , and the execution risks inherent in most government initiatives .
Ms. Doan can bring her keen insight to your organization in perhaps a weekly column .
Her writings have previously appeared in USA Today , LA Times , Roll Call and others . "

Actually , the story turned out to be even stinkier .
As I wrote back in May Congress Daily 's Dan Friedman reported that he was told by then - Rep. Tom Davis ( R - VA ) , ranking member of the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee and a Doan supporter , that she " rejected a series of White House candidates for the jobs of GSA general counsel and chief acquisition officer . "
According to Davis , backed up by " GSA officials , " " That seems to be the straw that broke that camel 's back . " Yesterday Al reported :
At the top of anyone 's list of Bush regimistas who used their invaluable experience as a stepping stone to bigger and better things would be our old pal Michael " Heckuva Job , Brownie " Brown , the man who presided over FEMA 's spectacular nonresponse to the Katrina disaster .
As our pal Al points out , our Brownie " went into the disaster recovery consulting business and is now a radio talk show host quoted frequently in the media on disaster matters , " adding : " Well , despite somewhat limited experience in this field -- we 're not counting his time as judges and stewards commissioner for the International Arabian Horse Association -- he did spend four years at FEMA .
" Now Al has tidings of another of our favoritest regimistas , onetime General Services Administration administrator Lurita Doan , " bounced [ according to Al ] in 2008 by the White House amid allegations that she tried to award work to a friend and misused her authority for political ends . "
All indications were , and are , that in her tenure at the helm of GSA she had been unhesitating in adopting Karl Rove 's mission to turn the entire executive branch into a propaganda arm of the regime .

Comcast and NBC Universal did n't get a whole lot of love at Thursday 's emotional Senate and House hearings on their proposed merger .
But company representatives did get plenty of questions .
At the Senate Judiciary Committee hearing , Wisconsin Democrat Herb Kohl cracked no smiles as he ran through four " principal areas of concern " about the deal : potential programming price hikes , loss of free over - the - air TV content , hobbling independent programmers , and weakening Internet TV .
" It is essential that you explain to us and the American public how the creation of this media conglomerate will serve the interests of the American people , not just the interests of your companies , " Kohl grimly demanded of Comcast CEO Brian Roberts and NBCU President Jeff Zucker as they prepared to make their case .
Meanwhile , at the House Commerce Committee 's subcommittee on the Internet , Mark Cooper of the Consumer Federation of America told Representatives that the merger " has so many anticompetitive , anticonsumer , and antisocial effects that it can not be fixed .
Comcast ’s claim that FCC oversight will protect the public is absurd . "
It 's murder
Even Sen. Orin Hatch ( R - UT ) confessed some concern about the marriage .
He called worries about the union " justified " in light of rising cable rates that are " difficult to understand . "
But it was the faux pas in his opening statement that suggested how nervous everyone is about this deal .
" In other words , " Franken continued irately , " looking to get approval for this merger , you sat there in my office and told me to my face that these rules would protect consumers , but your lawyers had just finished arguing in front of the Commission that it would be unconstitutional to apply these rules . "
" Both of these countries , er , companies are iconic in their industries , " Hatch began .
And later : " While horizontal murders , uh , mergers , tend to receive more criticism and scrutiny , vertical mergers " can also result in " a significant foreclosure of competition , " he warned .
Roberts and Zucker argued that this particular killing is primarily vertical — a union of Comcast 's huge network power with NBCU 's popular content ( presumably they would consider a merger of Comcast with Time Warner Cable to be horizontal ) .
But both execs insisted that its impact will be benign at worst , positive at best , and chock full of public interest goodies to boot .
Comcast is promising , for example , to preserve NBC 's over - the - air video fare , albeit while moving towards a terrestrial TV business model that " can be workable in the evolving economic and technological environment " ( we leave it to Ars readers to parse that caveat ) .
Plus , the companies promised , the deal will allow the cable giant to invest more in NBCU programming .
" In the end , the proposed transaction simply transfers ownership and control of NBCU from GE , " they explained , " a company with a very diverse portfolio of interests , to Comcast , a company with an exclusive focus on , and a commitment to investing its resources in , its communications , entertainment , and information assets . "
I was there
But before Roberts and Zucker made their pitch , an ex-television star was giving the plan raspberries .
" I worked for years for NBC , " noted former Saturday Night Live cast member and now Senator Al Franken ( D - MN ) in his opening remarks .
" I really feel I owe a lot to NBC , but what I know from my previous career has given me reason to be concerned ... very concerned " about the merger .
Franken recalled that back in the 1980s , the television networks urged the FCC to drop its Financial Interest and Syndication ( FYN - SYN ) rules , which barred networks from owning all but a small chunk of the programming that they aired — which the agency did .
The senator recalled that , at the time , NBC executives promised that relaxing FYN - SYN would not lead the network to favor its own content .
" But by 1992 NBC was the single largest supplier of its own primetime programming , " Franken continued .
" Today , if an independent producer wants to get its own show on NBC 's schedule , on any network 's schedule , it is routine practice , and you guys know it , for the network to demand at least part ownership of the show ...
And that 's just a fact .
So while I commend NBCU and Comcast for making voluntary commitments as part of this merger , you 'll have to excuse me if I do n't trust these promises . "
What you said
Later on in the hearing , Franken disclosed that Comcast 's Roberts had met with him days earlier , claiming that the FCC 's program carriage rules would protect consumers .
" You said that those rules will make sure that you always have a wide variety of programs because they forbid you [ NBC ] from discriminating against other company 's programs . "
With that , Franken pointed to a large sign board behind him with a quote from Comcast in its recent battle with the NFL Network over which tier on Comcast would carry the sports channel .
" The Commission is simply not equipped or constitutionally empowered to make an independent assessment of the myriad , complex , and dynamic considerations that affect carriage , tiering , and pricing decisions , " said the quote from Comcast attorneys .
" Thus the First Amendment requires that the Commission exercise extreme caution before interfering with any carriage decision . "
" In other words , " Franken continued irately , " looking to get approval for this merger , you sat there in my office and told me to my face that these rules would protect consumers but your lawyers had just finished arguing in front of the Commission that it would be unconstitutional to apply these rules . "
Roberts looked a little offended by Franken 's comments .
" When we met , perhaps I was confused .
I thought that we were talking about program access , now you are talking about program carriage , " he explained — the latter category deals with where programs will appear on a cable distribution system after they have been granted access .
" Whether it 's program access or program carriage , did you not say that this rule protects the people of Minnesota ? "
Franken declared , then asked NBC's Zucker about those FYN - SYN questions .
" I think my characterization was pretty accurate , do n't you ? "
Zucker paused .
" It 's a long time ago and I think there 's a lot of factors that went into back then ... "
" C'mon , " Franken interrupted .
" You guys said : ' We 're in the business of ratings !
Why would we favor our own programming ' ? "
" I can tell you what 's happening today , " Zucker pressed on .
" NBC has just ordered 20 pilots for new shows ... "
" I think what you did was put an NBC - produced show [ the now - canceled Jay Leno Show ] on at ten o'clock for five nights a week is what I think you did , " Franken retorted .
New horizons
Meanwhile , at both the House and Senate hearings , Mark Cooper challenged the notion that the Comcast NBCU merger was just a vertical affair .
In fact , both companies have stakes in the Internet TV market , he noted — NBC with its share in Hulu.com , and Comcast with Fancast.net and its TV Everywhere initiative .
The latter will allow Comcast cable video customers to access Comcast fare online .
" Comcast is clearly attempting to control the distribution of the video content it makes available on the Web by restricting sales exclusively to Comcast cable customers , " Cooper charged , in that the content is not available to non-Comcast subscribers .
" By contrast , NBC has exactly the opposite philosophy — or at least it did , " he warned .
" Through Hulu , NBC is competing for both Comcast and non-Comcast customers by selling video online that is not tied to cable .
NBC also has incentives to make its programming available in as many points of sale as possible .
Merger with Comcast will put an end that pro-competitive practice . "
NBCU holds " approximately a 32 percent , noncontrolling , nonmanagement interest in Hulu , " Comcast and NBCU disclosed in a statement to the FCC on the proposed merger .
Do n't Boxee me in
Speaking of Hulu , at the House Committee hearing , Representative Rick Boucher asked NBC's Zucker about the Boxee Incident .
As we 've reported , last February Hulu told the media viewing software company to remove Hulu content from its browser app .
" Did Hulu block the Boxee users from access to the Hulu programs ? "
Boucher asked .
" This was a decision made by the Hulu management , " Zucker replied .
" What Boxee was doing was illegally taking the content that was on Hulu without any business deal .
And , you know , we have several distributors , actually many distributors of the Hulu content that we have legal distribution deals with so we do n't preclude distribution deals .
What we preclude are those who illegally take that content . "
Boxee 's Avner Ronen quickly responded to this assertion his blog .
" We do n't ' take ' the video , " Ronen wrote .
" We do n't copy it .
We do n't put ads on top of it .
The video and the ads play like they do on other browsers or on Hulu Desktop .
And it certainly is legal to do so . "
As for Zucker 's claim that this decision was made by Hulu management , here 's what Hulu CEO Jason Kilar wrote on his blog last year shortly after the move .
" Our content providers requested that we turn off access to our content via the Boxee product , and we are respecting their wishes , " he explained .
" While we stubbornly believe in this brave new world of media convergence — bumps and all — we are also steadfast in our belief that the best way to achieve our ambitious , never - ending mission of making media easier for users is to work hand in hand with content owners . "
Clearly there are a lot of stakeholders in this proposed wedding .
Fortunately for Comcast and NBCU , their betrothal is not subject to ratification by the Senate and House of Representatives ; the Department of Justice and FCC will review the deal .
But after Thursday 's hearings , there 's no doubt that Capitol Hill is watching this engagement very closely .
By E.J. Dionne - February 11 , 2010
WASHINGTON --
So what exactly is the Tea Party movement and why has it risen up ?
The ferocity of its opposition to President Obama is mystifying to political progressives .
Most of the left simply does n't see the current occupant of the White House as especially liberal , let alone " socialist . "
Obama , after all , is the man who saved the banks and the capital markets .
Now the bankers are secure and most of them are still rich .
His health care proposals stopped far short of the single - payer system that so many liberals have long sought , and his plan is the kind of thing moderate Republicans offered back when they were a significant force .
Obama put absolutely no political muscle behind the progressives ' backup idea , a public option that could have served as a beachhead for a single - payer system .
The president is also decidedly moderate on budget questions .
His stimulus plan was , if anything , too small .
And Obama endorsed a bipartisan commission to reach a deal on deficit reduction , an idea that originated with centrist Democrats and moderately conservative Republicans -- and that most liberals opposed .
Why has this middle - of - the - road leader inspired such enthusiastic counter - organizing , and called forth such venom ?
The most popular theory on the left is that Obama 's race is a big part of the story , and that we are seeing a reaction among some whites against the multiracial , multicultural political coalition he has brought together .
The phrase " losing our country " is often on the lips of his enemies , which raises the question of who they mean by the word our .
At last week 's Tea Party Convention , former Rep.
Tom Tancredo , famed for his attacks on illegal immigration , gave backers of the racial explanation all the ammunition they needed .
In an astonishingly offensive speech , cheered by the Tea Party crowd , Tancredo declared that " people who could not even spell the word ' vote ' or say it in English put a committed socialist ideologue in the White House .
His name is Barack Hussein Obama . "
Even worse , if that 's possible , Tancredo harkened back to the Jim Crow South that denied the right to vote to African - Americans on the basis of " literacy tests " that called for potential black registrants to answer questions that would have stumped Ph.D.s in political science .
The reason we elected " Barack Hussein Obama , " according to Tancredo , is " mostly because I think that we do not have a civics literacy test before people can vote in this country . "
Where is the party of Abraham Lincoln ?
The GOP 's leaders have been shockingly silent , but Meghan McCain , John McCain 's daughter , honorably stepped up to condemn Tancredo .
On ABC's " The View , " she said the call for literacy tests amounted to " innate racism . "
So , yes , parts of this movement do seem to be motivated by a new nativism , and by racism .
But it would be a mistake to see the hostility to Obama only in terms of race .
Something else is going on in the Tea Party movement , and it has deep roots in our history .
Anti-statism , a profound mistrust of power in Washington , goes all the way back to the Anti-Federalists who opposed the Constitution itself because they saw it concentrating too much authority in the central government .
At any given time , perhaps 20 percent to 25 percent of Americans can be counted on to denounce anything Washington does as a threat to " our traditional liberties . "
This suspicion of government is not amenable to " facts " -- not because it is irrational , but because the facts are beside the point .
For the anti-statists , opposing government power is a matter of principle .
If those who think this way are asked whether an economic collapse would have been better than passing a stimulus and bailing out the banks , the anti-statists typically say " yes , " even if they might also challenge the premise of the question .
The purest expression of this disposition has come from Rep. Ron Paul , the libertarian Republican from Texas .
In 2008 , Paul strenuously criticized President Bush 's proposed bank bailout for " propping up a failed system so the agony lasts longer . "
Without a bailout , Paul conceded , " It would be a bad year .
But , this way , it 's going to be a bad decade . "
Understanding the principled anti-government radicalism that animates this movement explains why its partisans see the conservative Bush as a sellout and the cautiously liberal Obama as a socialist .
For now , their fears of Obama are enough to tether the Tea Partiers to the GOP .
In the long run , establishment Republicans are destined to disappoint them .

Only one in 12 Netflixers subscribe to the Blu-ray service , and at just 6 % of their total streaming catalog , HD content is " underwhelming , " according to Netflix .
Two stories , one lesson : HD just is n't what matters right now to Netflix .
Advertisement
For all the marketing dollars thrown behind HD , Blu-ray is still a marginal technology when compared to DVD , the obsoleting of which is taking longer than many expected .
That less than 10 % of Netflix subscribers opt for the Blu-ray option is n't that surprising .
In the larger context of Blu-ray adoption , this is n't too surprising .
What is surprising , though , is hearing Netflix actively downplaying the importance of HD content in this interview with The Wiire :
PS3 and Xbox users have 1 in 17 titles available in HD , and it 's streamed in 720 ... it 's not in 1080 , and it 's not in 5.1 surround sound or anything ... So , the HD experience at Netflix Instant Watching is n't that overwhelming .
It 's a little bit underwhelming .
So the Wii folks are n't going to miss that much .
Advertisement
Yep , that 's Netflix Communications VP Steve Swasey .
His job is specifically to make Netflix sound whelming , without the " under . "
And yet , in the context of the Wii , deflation .
It 's obvious why Nintendo would talk like that , but Netflix ?
Really ?
G/O Media may get a commission Subscribe and Get Your First Bag Free Promo Code AtlasCoffeeDay20
Rest assured , there 's a plan here .
Netflix is wrestling with two inevitabilities : HD content will supplant SD content , and physical media for video will die .
Netflix knows this , which is why they were willing to go along with Warner Brothers ' irritating disc availability delays in the service of streaming deals .
Advertisement
By downplaying Netflix 's HD content to help ease their Wii rollout , Netflix is rightly choosing customer expansion over video quality , which many customers would n't even notice .
I mean honestly , it wo n't be long before recording movies to a disc , sending that disc in an envelope , inserting that disc into a DVD player and sending the disc back in the mail will sound like some kind of Rube Goldberg contrivance ( when you put it that way , it sort of already does ... ) , and when streaming video over IP will be the only way to watch movies , so if making 26 million Wii owners feel like their lack of HD support is n't a big deal is what it takes to convert them into subscribers in your eventual streaming mega-empire , Netflix , deflate all you want .

Rafael Benítez 's dislike of Sir Alex Ferguson manifested itself tonight in the Liverpool manager responding to another damaging setback to his side 's aspirations of qualifying for the Champions League by demonstrating more bitterness towards the man who has become his nemesis in English football .
Benítez was aggrieved by the penalty that set Manchester United on the way to a 2 - 1 win , accusing Antonio Valencia of diving , and he referred to his previous accusations that Ferguson placed referees under pressure .
" We know about the influence of Sir Alex in everything , " he said .
" I 've seen three replays [ from different angles ] and the last one was suspicious .
See the replay for yourself and how he fell to the ground . "
Asked whether he was saying it was a dive , he replied : " Yes , I think so .
There is contact but the way he fell down – it was strange . "
Television pictures showed the initial contact from Javier Mascherano had been outside the penalty area and Benítez was asked whether Ferguson had been trying to get into the mind of the referee , Howard Webb , when he talked on Friday of the Anfield club getting preferential treatment .
" Just on Friday he said something ? " he interrupted , his tone heavy with sarcasm .
" Which Friday ?
This Friday or every Friday ?
Or every Friday of every year ? "
Ferguson had written in his programme notes that he felt " a twinge of sympathy " for Benítez 's current predicament , but the bad feeling between the two managers led to a confrontation on the touchline shortly after Wayne Rooney had scored his 33rd goal of the season , turning in the rebound after Pepe Reina had saved his penalty .
Rooney , recently troubled by a knee injury , left Old Trafford with a pronounced limp .
His goal cancelled out Fernando Torres 's fifth - minute header for Liverpool , with Park Ji-sung scoring the winner in the second half .
" When you have different opinions you have to express those different opinions , " Benítez said of that argument .
" As you know , he [ Ferguson ] has his own opinion about everything . "
Ferguson 's argument was that Mascherano should have been sent off .
" I thought the penalty kick was a red card , " he said .
" There was no way [ Jamie ] Carragher could have got across to stop Valencia from shooting , absolutely no way .
He [ Valencia ] is too quick for Carragher to get across .
It was a penalty but the law of the game is that if you stop a player from a goalscoring opportunity it's a red card , but not today it was n't . "
The United manager was unaware at that point that Benítez had spoken of Valencia being creative in his fall .
" He [ Mascherano ] tugged him , and obviously I think the referee is right , " Ferguson said .
" He has got to play the advantage [ after the first contact ] because he was right through on goal and it was n't until he was inside the box that he brought him down .
So I think that was correct . "
Benítez , however , was angered by what he perceived as several crucial decisions going in United 's favour and said he was sufficiently concerned at half - time to tell Torres to keep his focus on the game .
It was " not easy " for Torres , the manager reflected , and there was more heavy irony when he noted how Gary Neville 's studs had connected with Maxi Rodríguez , leaving the Argentinian with a bloodied head .
" I think it must have been a bird from the sky , " he said .
Park needed a stitch for a facial gash , inflicted by Glen Johnson 's boot .
" A game like that , it 's always been feisty , " Ferguson said .
" Both teams , with their pride and history , are going to compete .
I do n't think it got to a serious point at any stage . "
While Liverpool are languishing in sixth , 18 points behind United at the top of the table , Ferguson 's men have their sights on a fourth successive title , two points clear of Arsenal and four ahead of Chelsea , and have the added motivation of overtaking their Merseyside rivals with a 19th championship in total .
" We have been very consistent in the last two or three months , " Ferguson said .
" For periods of the game we played very well and in other periods we had to dig in and concentrate .
It 's always difficult to lose a goal and come back and win , it 's a great quality that Manchester United have and it was that quality that won us the game again today . "
I am feeling a bit nostalgic these days , and so I think I will do something that I have n’t done in a really long time : I ’m going to build up a graphical system in Ubuntu .
It ’s not anything terrifically difficult actually — there is almost no configuration to do , and there ’s definitely no compiling .
Why Ubuntu ?
Well mostly because I took a chunk out of Ubuntu a few days ago when I complained about the weight of the Gnome desktop in Karmic , and I ’m still feeling a little guilty about that .
And also because I still see random notes here and there about how the button location in Lucid is a dealbreaker 🙄 and it ’s clear that a lot of people have n’t cued in on how simple ( dreadfully simple ) it is to get your own system built in Ubuntu .
Just to be daring , I ’m going to start with a command - line system installed from the Lucid beta alternative ISO .
As far as I know there has never been any way to install a CLI - only Ubuntu system from the desktop ( or “ live ” ) CD , which means if you do n’t have one of the alternate versions or usually just ignore it … well , the time is ripe .
There ’s a little trick to installing the command - line only system , and this is where it ’s hiding .
You pick the CLI version from the boot menu when you start up the CD .
Select your language , your keymap if necessary , then press F4 for the installation modes .
From that menu , pick the command - line system option .
And then highlight “ Install Ubuntu ” and press return .
I leave you to decide how to partition or arrange your machine ; if you ’re on an older computer — and by that I mean something pre-2001 — I recommend changing the filesystem to ext2 and selecting the “ noatime ” option .
( If you are on a very , very old machine — and by that I mean pre-1998 — remember that your hard drive size may be an issue for your BIOS ; if you have an oversized , newer drive in there you better set up a dedicated / boot partition . )
Expect your command - line system to take up about 600 Mb , if df is to be believed .
After your system is in place and your network is running and your keyboard is set up , it ’s time to get serious .
This is probably what your first boot will look like , once you ’ve updated from the beta ISO .
Pretty boring .
Let ’s change that .
The first thing we need is the graphical system itself , the software that interprets what you ’re doing with the mouse and keyboard and whatnot , and translates it for Linux .
Type sudo aptitude install xorg and you ’ll see what that will require .
There ’s quite a bit there to install , and while it ’s possible to carve some of that out , let ’s just go ahead and bring it all in .
Once it is downloaded you ’ll need to wait while aptitude installs and configures it .
Once of the nice things about Ubuntu is that those steps are taken care of , and you do n’t need to do a thing .
Here ’s what it will probably look like , when it ’s done .
Believe it or not , most of the heavy lifting is finished .
You can actually start a graphical system here , but it ’s nothing particularly spectacular — in fact , all you get is terminal emulator , with nothing else behind it .
Boring .
Let ’s give it something to chew on : A file manager .
Try this one , and see if you like it : sudo aptitude install -y emelfm2 .
Notice that I tacked on a -y to the installation command : I did that because I did n’t want aptitude to ask my permission again .
Now let ’s start the graphical desktop and see what trouble we can get into : startx
There ’s the terminal emulator I mentioned .
Not very exciting .
If I type emelfm2 and press return , the file manager starts up , and will probably look like this .
Nice , but not particularly genius .
And we have no window borders .
How can we move things around if we want ?
Or close them ?
Or maximize them ?
We need some way to manage our windows .
Okay , here ’s a window manager for you : sudo aptitude install -y openbox .
And if we startx again . …
Ooh , the background has changed color .
And there ’s right - click menu now .
And boxes have frames and controls on them .
If I start emelf m2 now , by typing the command in the emulator window , it ’s much more comfortable .
And that ’s the way things work , basically .
If you add obconf and obmenu to your desktop here , you can more or less coordinate your entire graphical experience without much work at the command - line : sudo aptitude install -y obconf obmenu — and yes , you can stack applications to install like that , when you use aptitude .
Add items to your right - click menu by editing the entries in ObMenu , and then using the Reconfigure command in the right - click menu to update it while it runs .
Simple as pie .
But now we have a couple other issues that need work : Proper wallpaper , and we must do something about that hideous interface .
It looks like a reject from Windows 98 .
Let ’s try gtk- chtheme and gtk2 - engines : sudo aptitude install -y gtk- chtheme gtk2 - engines .
Now if I start gtk- chtheme , I can switch styles , fonts and appearances .
For wallpaper there are a lot of solutions available to you , but my preference is feh , which can double as an image viewer .
sudo aptitude install -y feh .
feh sets the wallpaper at the command line , with feh -- bg - scale wallpaper -name.jpg .
You can get the same results again , at each startup , by opening a little file in your home directory called .xinitrc and adding this line to it .
eval `cat .
fehbg` &
exec openbox - session
That ’ll do the trick .
There are other ways to set the wallpaper or even just set a color for it ; poke around and you ’ll probably see dozens more .
So what else can you add to your desktop ?
How about everyone ’s favorite browser .
Of course , if you do that — sudo aptitude install -y firefox — you inherit a huge vat of dependencies , including a lot of Gnome crud .
You can avoid that in turn by installing it without the recommended packages , kind of like this , but even that is more than is necessary .
I would recommend downloading the precompiled Linux binary and decompressing it into your home directory .
You can edit your Openbox menu to start it directly , and spare yourself the Gordian knot of Ubuntu ’s generic Gnomified Firefox .
Start here , if that sounds like something you would prefer .
P.S. , you ’ll need the libasound2 and libdbus - glib - 1 - 2 libraries from the repositories to use it — sudo aptitude install -y libasound2 libdbus - glib - 1 - 2 .
I have some other recommendations for software in a graphical system , but you should be experimenting on your own and trying out as many different ones as you can .
You have the general idea now — install , add to your right - click menu , and repeat .
You have an immense number of choices available to you , and do n’t forget things like automounting daemons , audio suites , image managers , e-mail clients , games and video players .
And like I said , the real benefit in doing this yourself is that you have the opportunity to avoid a lot of the weight that comes with Ubuntu in its default forms .
Exercise your freedom , build your system your way , and you ’ll gain a sense of pride and satisfaction at the same time . 😀
Once again , Square Enix has addressed the never - ending Final Fantasy VII remake situation , this time claiming that it would only happen if the game could be put together in one year .
The statement comes by way of producer Yoshinori Kitase , who simply thinks a VII remake would take too long .
" If it were possible that we had all the right facilities and the right environment to be able to make and prepare a Final Fantasy VII remake within a year , we ’d very much like a go at it , " says Kitase .
" But even Final Fantasy XIII has taken over three and a half years to create .
If we were to recreate Final Fantasy VII with the same level of graphical detail as you see in Final Fantasy XIII , we ’d imagine that that would take as much as three or four times longer than the three and a half years it has taken to put this Final Fantasy together .
So it ’s looking pretty unrealistic . "
So , there 's your answer .
I give it three days before somebody else feels the need to ask again .
Final Fantasy XIII 's Motomu Toriyama and Yoshinori Kitase - Interview [ TechDigest ]
Recent DDoS chaos on the Australian internet may have been great fun for all involved – but behind the good - humoured anarchy lies a growing concern that the government really does have a dark and Big Brotherly vision for the future of politics in the country .
As reported in The Register this week , groups exasperated by government plans for a mandatory firewall that will censor far more than the child porn material claimed , finally resorted to long - promised direct action , with a short and successful DDoS attack on government sites and offices .
At its peak , the attacks floored Australia 's parliamentary website for around an hour as well as having serious impact on The Department of Broadband , Communications and the Digital Economy website .
Communications Minister Stephen Conroy responded by branding those who carried out the attacks " irresponsible " .
This is the stock response of officialdom to direct action that causes any form of inconvenience : however , such action has a long and distinguished pedigree , with supporters arguing it is absolutely justified where existing political mechanisms do not give voice to a significant point of view .
While distancing itself from the action – and denying all responsibility for it – the Australian Sex Party has accused Mr Conroy of being anti-democratic in the way he is conducting debate .
The action appeared to spring from a Sex Party media release last week that reported the banning of women with small breasts from adult magazines by Australian censorship authorities .
Convenor Fiona Patten said : " Senator Conroy ... uses unfair tactics by continuing to ban the Australian Sex Party website from within his own department .
" Despite letters of protest about the unconstitutional nature of such bans he refuses to budge .
These bans have now spread to state government departments with the Victorian Dept of Infrastructure the latest government agency to ban access to the Sex Party ’s site . "
She also expressed concern over Senator Conroy ’s statements in Senate Estimates that he admired Google ’s role in blocking content in countries such as China and Thailand .
She adds : " First he tells us that it is only Refused Classification ( RC ) material that will be blocked and only via a complaint driven scheme .
Now he is discussing getting Google to block search requests for what might be considered RC material . "
Having recently discovered a backbone in its dealings with China , Google declared itself unimpressed .
Warning that this would lead to the removal of many politically controversial but harmless YouTube clips , a spokesman said Google will not " voluntarily " comply with the government 's request that it censor YouTube videos in accordance with broad " refused classification " content rules " .
A French national is under arrest in Thunder Bay , Ont. , suspected of trying to " buy " a five - year - old boy online in the United States for sexual purposes .
Patrick Molesti , 56 , of Woodstock , Ga. , faces extradition to the U.S. and a charge of sexual exploitation of children .

Police in Georgia said they acted on an anonymous tip that someone had tried to use the internet to acquire a child .
Reports say the accused had been hunted since March 18 , when police searched his home .
Lt. Jay Baker of the Georgia Sheriff ’s Office said it did not appear that a specific boy was targeted .
Police also said child pornography was found on a personal computer .
Molesti was stopped in Thunder Bay on Friday night when the bus he was taking from Calgary to Montreal stopped to refuel .
Police detained him at the Greyhound terminal after a warrant was issued by the Canada Border Services Agency .
Tony Blair is to be paid at least £ 200,000 by a City firm accused of profiteering from the financial crisis that brought Britain 's banks to their knees .
The former Prime Minister has been hired by the hedge fund Lansdowne Partners to deliver four presentations to staff about the world political situation .
Mr Blair , one of the world 's most highly - paid speakers , reportedly commands between £ 50,000 and £ 170,000 for a single speech .
Details of his latest money - spinning appearance emerged days before he is due to appear before the Chilcot inquiry into the Iraq war .
He was accused last night of a “ shameless ” willingness to accept money from any source .
The deal caused further surprise as the company 's chairman Paul Ruddock has donated more than £ 400,000 to the Conservative Party — most of it since David Cameron became its leader .
Lansdowne , which has held significant stakes in companies from Manchester United to J Sainsbury since it was set up in 1998 , is Europe 's fourth largest hedge fund .
It is believed to have made hundreds of millions of pounds during the 2008 banking crisis from “ short - selling ” shares .
A short - seller makes money from a declining share price .
A trader borrows a stock from a longer - term investor for a fee and immediately sells it .
The trader waits for the stock to fall before buying it back and returning it , pocketing the difference .
Allies stress that Blair undertakes a variety of charitable and unpaid work , including his role as international envoy to the Middle East .
Lansdowne said that Mr Blair would not be acting as a consultant , but would simply be making a series of presentations to staff on “ geopolitics ” .
Lord Oakeshott of Seagrove Bay , a Liberal Democrat Treasury spokesman , said : “ Tony Blair is utterly shameless .
He seems to be happy to take money from anybody , whether they are donating hundreds of thousands of pounds to the Tory party or whether they are hedge funds that made huge profits from selling Britain 's banks short .
“ This man appears to have a total mental block where ethics are concerned — if they pay enough money he will not ask any questions . ”

With greater emphasis on sustainable buildings , owners and developers increasingly are looking to geothermal systems to save energy and protect the environment .
Open - loop and standing - column geothermal well systems , for instance , are a proven , efficient and reliable renewable cooling and heating method that can be used in a wide array of different applications , particularly in areas like New York City that are actively looking to expand the use of “ green ” technologies .
According to the Environmental Protection Agency ( EPA ) , geothermal systems operate 75 percent more efficiently than oil furnaces , 48 percent more efficiently than gas furnaces and 40 percent more efficiently than air source heat pumps .
Yet , if a geothermal well ’s system is not developed and maintained correctly , the entire system will operate inefficiently or not at all .
Too often , geothermal well owners and operators dedicate significant time and money to the design of a system , materials , drilling and other activities associated with well construction , and leave little for actual well development and maintenance .
Recently , operators of geothermal systems have begun looking at impulse generation well development and rehabilitation techniques as an alternative to conventional methods .
These techniques , such as the U.S. and European patented Hydropuls system , involve releasing a compressed gas into discrete sections of the well screen in quick , short bursts , causing subsurface soils to vibrate , break apart cohesive bonds between particles and loosen sediment and biological deposits on the well screen and surrounding formation .
In New York City , in particular , the process has proved more effective and affordable in treating a variety of well types ( open- loop geothermal and remediation wells ) than conventional development methods .
Deteriorating Conditions
Geothermal wells draw on the thermal properties of groundwater to provide heating and cooling to a structure .
In the summer time , this water is circulated through the building ’s mechanical equipment to cool the building .
The heated water is then returned to the ground and is dissipated into the surrounding bedrock .
In the winter , the reverse process is done where the thermal potential of ground water is used to provide for heating of the building .
For instance , the Brooklyn Children ’s Museum in New York City underwent a recent expansion and renovation that doubled the museum ’s space and incorporated several sustainable operating systems .
In particular , the state - of - the - art LEED - certified facility is the first museum in New York City to use an open - loop geothermal system for heating and cooling instead of fossil fuels .
The Brooklyn Children ’s Museum ’s geothermal system consists of two 300 - foot - deep ground water supply wells and two diffusion ( injection ) wells .
The wells were drilled using mud rotary methods , and initial development of the wells was completed using mechanical methods of surging and water jetting .
However , as operators prepared to initiate use of the wells , a system test indicated the wells produced limited flow and demonstrated excessive back pressure — a clear sign of a pumping and injection well blockage .
The New York City Department of Design and Construction ( NYCDDC ) called in well engineering experts to assess the wells ’ condition .
Project hydrogeologists evaluated the system design , aquifer characteristics and well construction .
The evaluation included using down - hole video and geophysical logging and preparation of a redevelopment program .
Project hydrogeologists determined that the wells were not sufficiently developed after construction , which resulted in partial plugging of the supply wells and complete blockage of the diffusion wells with drilling fluids and fine - grained material .
In a situation such as this , owners typically look to mechanical agitation , hydraulic jetting or chemical treatments , costly and / or ineffective methods in resolving the core issue of mechanical plugging that occurs as a result of the well construction methodology and / or incomplete development .
Impulse Edge
In order to break up the plugging that prevented water from being pumped or injected back into the aquifer , the engineering team chose impulse generation technology combined with isolation pumping .
Impulse generation techniques are fairly straightforward .
An impulse generator , equipped with a pressurized hose and valve system , is positioned in the well screen or water producing zone .
Once in place , the operator releases impulses of high - pressure nitrogen in controlled repetitive bursts .
Through the release of compressed nitrogen , the impulse generator produces an elastic impulse and a secondary expansion of gas bubbles , causing a pressure wave that moves laterally through the screen into the well ’s gravel pack and adjacent formation .
The expansion of compressed gas creates an airlift effect that vibrates and loosens mechanically plugged sediment and biological deposits from the screens and surrounding aquifer .
Ideally , the impulse generator is used simultaneously with an isolation pumping system to remove the sediment and biological deposits loosened by the impulse generator .
At the Brooklyn Children ’s Museum , the redevelopment work removed significant volumes of residual drilling mud and fine - grained sediment from the well screen intervals .
After using Hydropuls technology well capacity increased 241 % in one well and 908 % in the second .
The geothermal system was returned to service in time for the facility ’s grand opening and continues to operate at optimal capacity .
The Brooklyn Children ’s Museum illustrates the potential advantages of impulse generation for initial geothermal well development .
The same technology can also be used for routine maintenance in order to regain lost capacity .
These projects also highlight the importance of initial well development in ensuring that the geothermal system will operate at maximum efficiency .
Using impulse generation , such as Hydropuls , will reduce the time required to develop an efficient well , thus saving significant costs .
The bottom line — proper development of geothermal system wells will result in lower energy costs and longer well life .
Well rehabilitation is inevitable ; the cost and frequency is dependent on how effectively the wells are maintained and the choice of well maintenance techniques

NEW YORK ( Reuters ) - Nude dancing is not necessarily a crime of “ moral turpitude ” warranting deportation , a divided federal appeals court ruled .
Wednesday ’s 2 - 1 ruling by the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals in San Francisco is a defeat for the federal government and a victory for Victor Ocegueda Nunez , who was seeking to avoid being sent back to his native Mexico .
A Justice Department spokesman said the government is reviewing the ruling .
Cheryl Franke , a lawyer for Ocegueda , did not immediately return a call seeking comment .
According to the ruling , the government sought to deport Ocegueda , who had entered the country illegally in 1993 , after he was convicted over a 10 - year period of what it called two crimes of moral turpitude : petty theft and indecent exposure .
A federal immigration judge ordered Ocegueda ’s removal , and the Board of Immigration Appeals agreed .
Ocegueda appealed , saying this would cause extreme hardship for his wife and three children , all of whom are U.S. citizens .
Writing for the Ninth Circuit , Judge Stephen Reinhardt wrote that while California ’s indecent exposure law punishes conduct that “ offends the sensibilities of many , and perhaps most people , ” it does not “ categorically ” meet the federal standard for moral turpitude .
Citing a variety of case law , the judge also concluded that while the question of what constitutes moral turpitude is “ nebulous , ” it is “ as clear as can be ” that nude dancing lies outside the definition .
“ Erotic , completely nude dancing is offensive to many people , ” Reinhardt wrote .
“ It is not , however , so ‘ base , vile , and depraved ’ that it shocks the conscience . ”
Judge Jay Bybee dissented , accusing the majority of dismissing Ocegueda ’s conduct as “ relatively harmless ” without having any basis for its judgment .
“ Whatever Ocegueda did to get himself convicted of indecent exposure , we can be fairly confident that it involved more than being a nude dancer at a bar or a ‘ tasteless prank , ’ ” he wrote .
Bybee added that he was “ quite confident that there is nude dancing going on in California bars even as I write this , ” and which yet is not resulting in arrests under California law .
Judge Milan Smith joined Reinhardt in the majority .
Reinhardt was appointed to the court by President Jimmy Carter .
Bybee and Smith were appointed by President George W. Bush .
The case was argued in April 2007 .
The case is Ocegueda Nunez v. Holder , U.S. Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals , No. 06-70219 .
RANDOLPH -- A 67 - year - old Randolph man accused of
shooting and killing his pet parrot
because it allegedly annoyed him while he was drunk and watching a NASCAR race on television was indicted today on a charge of animal cruelty .
Dennis Zeglin was charged with killing his 20 - year - old pet African gray parrot , Mikey , on June 7 at 4:30 p.m. , by shooting the bird three times with a BB gun , court documents stated .
An indictment handed up by a grand jury in Morristown accuses Zeglin of one count of third - degree animal cruelty , a crime punishable by three - to - five years in prison and up to a $ 15,000 fine .
At the time of the incident , Zeglin ’s wife , who was upstairs , came down to find Zeglin still sitting in his chair and the bird dead in its cage , court documents stated .
Zeglin cooperated with police and voluntarily turned over his Daisy Powerline Model 93 CO2 - cartridge BB gun so it could be destroyed .
After the shooting , Zeglin was treated for alcoholism , his attorney said .
Reconstructing Building Interiors from Images
This paper proposes a fully automated 3D reconstruction and visualization system for architectural scenes ( interiors and exteriors ) .
The reconstruction of indoor environments from photographs is particularly challenging due to texture - poor planar surfaces such as uniformly - painted walls .
Our system first uses structure - from - motion , multi-view stereo , and a stereo algorithm specifically designed for Manhattan - world scenes ( scenes consisting predominantly of piece - wise planar surfaces with dominant directions ) to calibrate the cameras and to recover initial 3D geometry in the form of oriented points and depth maps .
Next , the initial geometry is fused into a 3D model with a novel depth - map integration algorithm that , again , makes use of Manhattan - world assumptions and produces simplified 3D models .
Finally , the system enables the exploration of reconstructed environments with an interactive , image - based 3D viewer .
We demonstrate results on several challenging datasets , including a 3D reconstruction and image - based walk - through of an entire floor of a house , the first result of this kind from an automated computer vision system .

WASHINGTON ( Reuters ) - President Barack Obama will pitch his bid to revamp the U.S. healthcare system as a way to control big insurance company rate increases when he releases his healthcare plan on Monday , the White House said .

The Democratic president will propose giving the U.S. government new power to block health insurers from attempting excessive premium hikes in the plan to be posted on the White House website at 10 a.m. EST ( 1500 GMT ) , an administration official said .
The White House is gearing up for a nationally televised bipartisan healthcare “ summit ” on Thursday , which it hopes will help seize back control of the debate on how to overhaul the $ 2.5 trillion U.S. medical care system .
The new program to give the Department of Health and Human Services more authority over rate increases by private insurers and create a new Health Insurance Rate authority had not been included in Democratic healthcare overhaul bills reached after months of debate in the House of Representatives and Senate .
The White House has been targeting health insurers with particular vehemence as it made its case for the revamp , seeing corporate profits as a relatively easy target for public anger in the face of flagging voter interest in one of Obama ’s top domestic policy priorities .
Administration officials had said rising insurance rates would be the backdrop of Thursday ’s meeting .
The White House has pointed to premium increases of up to 39 percent for some California customers of WellPoint Inc. ’s Anthem Blue Cross plans to make its case about the need for a major healthcare reform .
“ As bad as things are today , they ’ll only get worse if we fail to act .
We ’ll see exploding premiums and out - of - pocket costs burn through more and more family budgets , ” Obama said on Saturday .
WellPoint has said the higher prices reflect growing costs and are in line with competitors .
The company , stung by the criticism , said it would postpone the increase by two months .
POLITICAL PRESSURE FOR SOME RESULT
With unemployment hovering near 10 percent , Obama ’s Democrats are under pressure to produce results on something before elections in November in which the entire House and more than a third of seats in the Senate will be up for grabs .
White House officials said they expected Obama ’s plan -- the first formally proposed by the White House during the year - long healthcare debate -- would combine the best features of the House and Senate bills .
Those bills are broadly similar .
Both would extend coverage to many of the 46 million Americans now without insurance and impose restrictions on insurance companies like requiring them to cover people with pre-existing medical conditions .
Obama ’s proposal is also expected to require most Americans to carry health insurance .
Congressional Republicans , who have remained solidly united in opposition to the healthcare bills , have called on Democrats to scrap both and start over with a far less sweeping agenda .
Obama asked Republicans to publish their own overhaul program before the meeting , but there has been no indication they will do so , with Republican aides saying party leaders will continue to offer their own ideas , not a plan .
“ We believe that we think a better way to go is to , step by step , move in the direction of dealing with the cost issue , targeting things like junk lawsuits against doctors and hospitals , interstate insurance competition , small association health plans , ” Mitch McConnell , the Senate Republican leader , said on Fox News Sunday .
“ There are a number of things you can do without having the government try to take over one - sixth of the economy . ”
Analysts have criticized Obama for relying on Democrats in Congress to promote the healthcare revamp , and Thursday ’s conference could put his stamp firmly on it in the eyes of the public .
Although Obama ’s approval ratings have dropped to about 50 percent , polls show Americans still view him more favorably than either Republicans or Democrats in Congress .
If the summit is marked by partisan gridlock , it could give the Democrats an excuse to combine the House and Senate measures as a privileged budget reconciliation bill , which only needs a simple 51 - vote majority to pass the 100 - member Senate , bypassing Republican opposition .
The spate of recent controversies about climate research has given fresh voice to a group of scientists who question the mainstream view that human activity is warming the planet to dangerous levels .
Very few scientists disagree that the earth 's climate has warmed since 1850 .
But some have long argued that there are too many uncertainties about man 's role in the warming , and that other factors , such as solar activity and the greenhouse effect of clouds , could account for a large part of the observed warming trend .
Among this ...
In every downturn , unions cannibalize their junior membership , throwing them to the dogs .
This downturn is no different , except that cuts will be much deeper and far more lasting .
Please consider Laid - off CTA workers upset with unions , management .
Ralph Cleveland says getting a job driving a bus for the Chicago Transit Authority was the best thing that happened to him since moving up North 10 years ago .
" When I came to Chicago in 2000 from Bibb County , Alabama , I was so proud about having a uniform on , " said Cleveland , 56 , who started with the CTA almost 6 1/2 years ago .
" I stood in the mirror , and I could n't believe the Lord had blessed me with that . "
He looked forward to getting up in the morning and going to work at the transit agency 's 77th Street bus garage , then coming home to take care of his wife , who has severe arthritis and other ailments .
But the couple was dealt a serious setback this month when Cleveland became one of 1,059 CTA workers laid off because of CTA service cuts that slashed bus service by 18 percent .
Like many of his former co-workers , Cleveland says his labor union , the Amalgamated Transit Union , has let him and others down , almost abandoned them , to preserve the pay raises and full benefits for almost 7,000 union brothers and sisters with more seniority , who the CTA did not let go .
He has seen larger and larger deductions from his paycheck in recent years for union dues and other union expenses , Cleveland said .
In contrast to his union 's strident opposition to negotiating concessions , Cleveland is willing to take a pay cut if that 's what is needed for him to get behind the wheel again .
" If I could get my job back , that 's what would make me happy , making money for me and my wife , who I love so much , and my grandchildren , '' he said .
His CTA employee health care benefits were cut off at 11:59 p.m. on Feb. 6 , a minute before the service cuts took effect .
CTA officials have called on the agency 's bus and rail unions to make those concessions to help eliminate a $ 95.6 million budget deficit in 2010 .
Leaders of the Amalgamated Transit Union have refused to reopen the current contract , which expires at the end of next year .
" I'm willing to make a sacrifice , '' said Cleveland , who worries that he wo n't have enough money saved up to take his wife back home to Alabama for retirement at some point .
" I 've been making a sacrifice ever since I came into this world . ''
" I ain't looking for handouts or public aid .
I wish I could just go back on a bus and pick up people , " he said .
CTA bus driver Vanessa Garrett , who also was laid off , shares the same wish .
She recently separated from her husband of 25 years , and she is the sole provider for her large family .
" Everything is on me , " said Garrett , 55 .
" I would take the furlough days and all the things the CTA is asking for , because the economy is affecting everybody everywhere and it's a bad time .
If the CTA needs to take some things from us , fine , it 's still a very good job . "

Ahead Of The Curve
Democrats will finish their health reform efforts within the next two months by using a majority - vote maneuver in the Senate , Majority Leader Harry Reid Harry Mason ReidGOP senators confident Trump pick to be confirmed by November Durbin : Democrats can ' slow ' Supreme Court confirmation ' perhaps a matter of hours , maybe days at most ' Supreme Court fight pushes Senate toward brink MORE ( D - Nev. ) said .
Reid said that congressional Democrats would likely opt for a procedural tactic in the Senate allowing the upper chamber to make final changes to its healthcare bill with only a simple majority of senators , instead of the 60 it takes to normally end a filibuster .

" I 've had many conversations this week with the president , his chief of staff , and Speaker Pelosi , " Reid said during an appearance Friday evening on " Face to Face with Jon Ralston " in Nevada .
" And we 're really trying to move forward on this .
" The majority leader said that while Democrats have a number of options , they would likely use the budget reconciliation process to pass a series of fixes to the first healthcare bill passed by the Senate in November .
These changes are needed to secure votes for passage of that original Senate bill in the House .
"
We 'll do a relatively small bill to take care of what we 've already done , " Reid said , affirming that Democrats would use the reconciliation process .
" We 're going to have that done in the next 60 days .
" The move would allow Democrats to essentially go it alone on health reform , especially after losing their filibuter - proof majority in the Senate after Sen.
Scott Brown's ( R ) special election victory in Massachusetts .
Republicans have protested the maneuver as a hyperpartisan tactic to ram through a health bill , and have said that plans to use the reconciliation process make moot a bipartisan summit at the White House this week , where both GOP and Democratic leaders are supposed to present their ideas on healthcare .
Reid said that the final Democratic bill is likely to be unveiled Monday night .

Enex TestLab did not test ISP - level filtering products on internet connection speeds greater than 8 Mbps , raising questions of possible degradation at ADSL2 + and fibre speeds .
Further , none of the nine ISPs who piloted filtering technologies could provide an environment to test Internet Protocol version 6 ( IPv6 ) , an addressing scheme the internet industry expects will be necessary in the coming years as IP v4 addresses run out .
Communications Minister Stephen Conroy yesterday revealed the long - awaited Enex report on the Government 's controversial trials of ISP - level filtering technologies .
The report concluded the filtering technologies did not degrade internet performance - except when filtering content above and beyond the ACMA blacklist , in which Enex found the filters were hampered by over - blocking .
But the report also shows that only internet speeds of up to 8 Mbps were subjected to the tests .
A shade over two million Australian households and 186,000 business and government users had connection speeds of 8 Mbps and beyond , according to Australian Bureau of Statistics figures released in June .
Internode network engineer Mark Newton - a fervent opponent of the filter proposal - said it was " extraordinary " that the Federal Government had not tested the impact of content filtering on higher speed connections .
“ If the Minister thinks this report puts the speed question to bed , he 's sorely mistaken , " Newton said .
" [ He ] has to accept that this report leaves open questions about whether or not his censorship policy is compatible with his 100 Mbps national broadband network . "
Update : A DBCDE spokesman has since confirmed that speeds greater than 8
Mbps were not tested as ISPs involved in the live pilot could not provide those services for testing .
The same reason was given for IPv6 .
The statue shows the young Barack Obama holding a butterfly
A statue of US President Barack Obama will be removed from a park in Indonesia 's capital Jakarta because of public opposition , officials say .
They say the bronze statue of Mr Obama as a 10 - year - old boy will be moved from the Menteng Park to the school he attended while living in the city .
The move comes after more than 56,000 people joined a campaign on Facebook calling for the statue to be removed .
They argue that - although popular - Mr Obama is not Indonesia 's national hero .
' No contribution '
" The Jakarta administration has decided to remove the Obama statue from Menteng Park and take it to his former school , " city spokesman Cucu Ahmad Kurnia told AFP news agency .
" We follow the aspirations of the people , who think that the removal of the statue to his former school is more appropriate , " he added .
City officials said they wanted to move the two - metre ( 7ft ) statue before Mr Obama 's planned visit to Indonesia in March .
Heru Nugroho , initiator of the Facebook campaign to remove the statue from the park , welcomed the decision .
" It 's good - a little too late .
But I appreciate it , " Mr Nugroho was quoted as saying by the Associated Press .
He added that statues in Indonesia should be reserved for those who have made significant contributions to the country .
" Obama is a very good man , he 's a good dreamer .
But he has no contribution for Indonesia , " Mr Nugroho said .
Mr Obama spent four years of his childhood in Indonesia with his American mother and Indonesian stepfather .
He went to school in Jakarta and is a local hero of sorts to young Indonesians , the BBC's Karishma Vaswani in Indonesia says .
The statue - depicting Mr Obama as a boy in shorts and a T - shirt with a butterfly perched on his hand - was erected in the park last December .

The " nanostructure " of tiny rods bends light around a bump in the gold surface
Scientists have created the first device to render an object invisible in three dimensions .
The " cloak " , described in the journal Science , hid an object from detection using light of wavelengths close to those that are visible to humans .
Previous devices have been able to hide objects from light travelling in only one direction ; viewed from any other angle , the object would remain visible .
This is a very early but significant step towards true invisibility cloaks .
Tolga Ergin , a scientist from the Karlsruhe Institute of Technology in Germany led the study .
We put the carpet cloak on top of that bump and it bends the light so that the distortions disappear
Tolga Ergin
Karlsruhe Institute of Technology
He told BBC
News that his team 's cloak was based on the concept that you can " transform space " with a material .
He and his colleagues designed a photonic metamaterial , which influenced the behaviour of light rays .
" You can think of any transformation that you would like to have , and tailor your material to mimic this , " he explained .
The basis of the design is known as a " carpet cloak " .
This was first proposed by Professor Sir John Pendry from Imperial College London , who also took part in this study .
" He proposed the theoretical design of having an object hidden under a bump and making the bump disappear , " said Mr Ergin .
" It 's like a carpet mirror , " he continued .
" If you hide an object under it , there is a bump , so you see a distortion in the reflected image .
" We put the carpet cloak on top of that bump and it bends the light so that the distortions disappear .
" You have the impression that the mirror you 're looking at is flat . "
Bending light
The trick is to change the speed and direction in which light travels through the material - that is , to change the material 's refractive index .
The researchers achieved by this using a polymer crystal made up of very tiny rods .
" By changing the thickness of the rods , you can change the ratio of air to polymer , " explained Dr Ergin .
" Since the refractive index of air is about one and the refractive index of the polymer is about 1.52 , " he explained , " in principle , we can get any refractive index between those two numbers , " he said .
By tailoring the refractive index of the surface of the bump , the scientists rendered it invisible to a wide range of light wavelengths slightly longer than those that we can see .
We wo n't have a body - sized invisibility cloak tomorrow but this has demonstrated a remarkable proof of principle
Professor Ortwin Hess
University of Surrey
As a result , under this light , the reflective surface appeared to be flat .
A similar effect has been achieved previously in two dimensions - changing the refractive index of a piece of silicon by drilling tiny holes in its surface .
But , these holes can only be drilled in one direction .
" So if you at look at the thing from [ any other ] angles , you immediately see it , " said Mr Ergin .
In this case , the team used a technique called laser writing to create their 3 - D cloak .
This uses a very finely focused laser , to " write " into a light - sensitive material .
" Wherever you put the focus spot into the material , it will harden , " explained Dr Ergin .
" It 's a similar process to photography - when you develop it , whatever has n't been exposed to the laser will be washed away . "
Third dimension
The carpet cloak was originally designed to work in two dimensions .
But when Dr Ergin and his colleagues calculated how the rays of light would travel through an object , they realised that they could use their technique to build a structure that would work in three dimensions .
In this case , the researchers use the device to cloak a bump one micrometre ( one thousandth of a millimetre ) high .
" But in theory there are no limits [ to the size of the object you could hide ] , said Dr Ergin .
" You could blow this up and hide a house .
Crystal structures influence the speed and direction of light rays " But it took us three hours to make this structure , so if you wanted to make it even one millimetre in size you would have to wait a very long time . "
Professor Ortwin Hess from the University of Surrey in the UK said that this study was a " huge step forward " .
" The really remarkable aspect is the demonstration of invisibility in three dimensions . "
One of the major challenges that remains in the design of cloaking devices is hiding objects from wavelengths of light that are visible to humans .
" Photonic crystals usually work because the constitutive elements are not visible to the wavelength by which one observes them , " Professor Hess explained .
" So if you look at the desk in front of you , you do n't see the individual atoms because they are so small .
You just see whole structure - the wood or the plastic . "
This means that cloaking devices for visible light would have to be made up of much smaller rods .
So for this technique , the laser beam would have to be made even smaller .
Currently , the rods can be made as small as 200 nanometres .
To hide a bump from visible light would require rods as small as 10 nanometres .

Honda recalls 438,000 cars for airbag hazard
NEW YORK ( CNNMoney.com ) --
Honda announced it is expanding a previously announced recall to replace an airbag inflator in an additional 438,000 vehicles worldwide , including 379,000 in the United States .
In a statement posted on its Web site late Tuesday , Honda said the driver 's airbag inflators in these certain vehicles may expand with too much pressure , which can cause the inflator casing to break and could result in injury or death .
The expanded recall includes 2001 and 2002 Accord , Civic , Odyssey , CR - V , and selected 2002 Acura TL vehicles , the statement said .
Honda said there have been 12 incidents related to the airbag inflator problem .
One Honda Pilot car and one Acura CL vehicle may also be affected , the spokesman said .
The original recall involving this issue was announced in November 2008 for 2001 and 2002 models of Accords and Civics as well as some 2002 model year Acura TL vehicles , a Honda spokesman told CNNMoney.com .
It affected 3,940 U.S. vehicles , and 265 in Canada and Mexico .
Last summer , Honda added 510,150 cars to the recall worldwide , including 443,727 additional units in the United States .
The recall now affects a total of 952,118 vehicles , with more than 826,000 in the United States .
Although none of the reported problems occurred after July 2009 , Honda said it was still expanding the recall because it could not be sure that the inflators in the aforementioned vehicles would work correctly .
Honda said it will notify affected customers by mail and phone with instructions on how to have their vehicles inspected and updated at an authorized dealer .
The entire production of each of the models in question is not necessarily included in the recall .
Last month , Honda announced a separate recall of 646,000 2007 and 2008 Fit , City and Jazz models worldwide , after a fire hazard involving a power window switch resulted in a death in South Africa .

Student dads who do not financially support their children could begin to pay child maintenance , the Government has signalled .
Under current rules full - time students do not have to make any contribution .
But junior work minister Helen Goodman said a new Child Support Agency scheme will " promote responsibility amongst all parents " .
She told MPs yesterday that the Child Maintenance and Enforcement Commission has been instructed to " review the maintenance status of full - time students " , and that the changes could come into effect by 2011 .
Ms Goodman also said parents who do not live with their kids and who are on benefits are obliged to pay £ 5 a week to their children .
This goes up when they enter work .
She added : " From 2011 , when the new child maintenance scheme is introduced , the payment will increase to £ 7 . "
British Airways has stooped to new lows in its efforts to intimidate cabin crew .
Around 13,000 workers are set to begin a three - day strike on Saturday in protest at bosses ’ plans to slash jobs , cut and freeze pay and impose worse conditions .
BA bosses have responded by ripping up workers ’ rights .
One cabin crew worker recently had an accident and had to phone in sick .
She was told she would not be paid sick pay — even though sick pay is part of her contract .
“ I ’ve had back pain , neck pain and headaches since the accident , ” she told Socialist Worker .
“ I do n’t want to be worrying about whether I ’ll be paid or not when I ’m trying to recover . ”
This is in line with the treatment BA has dished out to many workers in the run-up to the strike .
Unite believes that BA bosses have passed their personal details , including addresses and phone numbers , to the Daily Mail newspaper , in an attempt to intimidate them , after the newspaper contacted some workers and union reps .
Despite the intimidation , cabin crew are determined to fight .
It is the duty of the whole trade union movement to back them .
Do you have a story about BA bosses ?
Are you set to strike this weekend ?

There 's been a lot of press about Aquaponics and sustainable fish farming cropping up lately , so I wanted to share this astonishingly beautiful example :
Sepp Holzer lives on a mountaintop in Austria , where he casually but thoughtfully manages a fish farm that provides all of his food , clean water , income , and electricity through nothing but a series of carefully placed pond systems .
Gravity pulls the water from pond to pond , and little micro-organism - eating fish are gradually replaced by bigger and bigger predatory fish until he has clean water and full - sized trout !
It 's so simple it might seem like magic , but it 's actually cooler than that .
You can watch another short profile about Holzer 's paradise here , and go here to see Eco Film 's entire series on Permaculture .

First published Fri Mar 26 , 2004
G.E. Moore ( 1873 -1958 ) ( who hated his first names , ‘ George Edward ’ and never used them — his wife called him ‘ Bill ’ ) was an important British philosopher of the first half of the twentieth century .
He was one of the trinity of philosophers at Trinity College Cambridge ( the others were Bertrand Russell and Ludwig Wittgenstein ) who made Cambridge one of centres of what we now call ‘ analytical philosophy ’ .
But his work embraced themes and concerns that reach well beyond any single philosophical programme .
Moore grew up in South London ( his eldest brother was the poet T. Sturge Moore who worked as an illustrator with W. B. Yeats ) .
In 1892 he went to Trinity College Cambridge to study Classics .
He soon made the acquaintance there of Bertrand Russell who was two years ahead of him and of J. M. E. McTaggart who was then a charismatic young Philosophy Fellow of Trinity College .
Under their encouragement Moore decided to add the study of Philosophy to his study of Classics , and he graduated in 1896 with a First Class degree in the subject .
At this point he turned his energies towards attempting to follow in the footsteps of McTaggart and Russell by winning a ‘ Prize ’ Fellowship at Trinity College which would enable him to continue the study of philosophy there .
In 1898 he was successful and over the next six years he matured as a dynamic young philosopher , actually leading Russell away from the idealist philosophy of McTaggart and others which was then dominant in Britain .
Moore 's Fellowship ended in 1904 ; after a spell away from Cambridge , Moore returned there in 1911 to a lectureship in the University and he then lived there for the rest of his life ( apart from an extended visit to the U.S.A. in 1940 - 44 ) .
In 1921 he became editor of Mind , the leading British philosophical journal , and in 1925 he became a Professor at Cambridge .
These two appointments confirmed his position as the most highly respected British philosopher of the time , and with Wittgenstein back in Cambridge after 1929 , Cambridge became the most important centre of philosophy in the world .
Moore retired as Professor in 1939 ( to be succeeded by Wittgenstein ) and as editor of Mind in 1944 ; these retirements marked not only the end of his pre-eminence , but also of the golden age of Cambridge philosophy .
Early in his time in Cambridge Moore became friends with some of the young men who went on to form the ‘ Bloomsbury Group ’ , such as Lytton Strachey , Leonard Woolf and Maynard Keynes .
Through these friendships
Moore exerted an indirect influence on British twentieth - century culture as profound as that of any more ‘ engaged ’ philosopher .
These long - lasting friendships bear witness to Moore 's Socratic personality and thus to a side of his character which his writings do not convey .
Gilbert Ryle , the Oxford philosopher who was Moore 's successor both as editor of Mind and as the dominant British philosopher after 1945 , emphasized this side of Moore 's personality :
He gave us courage not by making concessions , but by making no concessions to our youth or our shyness .
He treated us as corrigible and therefore as responsible thinkers .
He would explode at our mistakes and muddles with just that genial ferocity with which he would explode at the mistakes and muddles of philosophical high - ups , and with just the genial ferocity with which he would explode at mistakes and muddles of his own .
( Ryle 270 )
Moore was first drawn to philosophy through contact with McTaggart and under McTaggart 's influence he fell briefly under the spell of British idealism , especially the work of F. H. Bradley .
Thus when in 1897 he made his first attempt to win a Prize Fellowship at Trinity he submitted a dissertation on ‘ The Metaphysical Basis of Ethics ’ in which he acknowledges his indebtedness to Bradley and presents an idealist ethical theory .
One element of this theory is what he calls ‘ the fallacy involved in all empirical definitions of the good ’ , which is immediately recognisable as a precursor of his famous claim in Principia Ethica that there is a fallacy , the ‘ naturalistic fallacy ’ , in all naturalistic definitions of goodness .
This point indicates that although , as we shall see below , Moore quickly came to reject the idealist philosophy of Bradley and McTaggart , he held that their criticisms of empiricism , as represented by J. S. Mill 's philosophy , were sound and he carried this hostility to empiricism forward into his mature philosophy .
In this respect , therefore , his early idealist enthusiasm had an enduring impact on his thought .
A substantial part of this early dissertation is devoted to a critical discussion of Kant 's moral philosophy , and it is striking that although in his general approach and conclusions Moore endorses the kind of idealism advanced by Bradley , he is already critical of Kant 's conception of practical reason .
He argues that Kant 's use of this conception blurs the distinction between ‘ the psychological faculty of making judgments and inferences ’ and that which is ‘ true and objective ’ .
This distinction , Moore maintains , ‘ cannot be either done away or bridged over ’ .
Hence , he argues , Kant 's conception of morality as founded on a priori principles of practical reason is untenable .
It is easy to see how this line of thought could be extended to a general criticism of Kant 's conception of the a priori ; and it is precisely this generalisation that Moore undertakes in his successful 1898 dissertation .
At the same time he comes to see that his previous enthusiasm for Bradley 's idealism was not well founded ( though it still takes him a little time to accept that the arguments of Bradley and McTaggart against the reality of time are flawed ) .
So it is in this 1898 dissertation that Moore turns decisively against idealist philosophy , both in its Kantian and Bradleian forms .
There are several aspects to this .
As I have indicated , he rejects Kant 's conception of the a priori as a muddled form of subjectivism or psychologism .
The following passage from Principia Ethica ( 1903 ) is indicative of his polemic which can be found in many of his writings of this period :
That ‘ to be true ’ means to be thought in a certain way is , therefore , certainly false .
Yet this assertion plays the most central part in Kant 's ‘ Copernical Revolution ’ of philosophy , and renders worthless the whole mass of modern literature , to which that revolution has given rise , and which is called Epistemology .
( Principia Ethica 183 )
The distinction Moore is drawing on here between thought on the one hand and what is objective or real on the other is one that runs through his critique of idealism .
An important early context in which he elaborates it is his discussion of meaning in his famous paper ‘ The Nature of Judgement ’ ( 1899 ) , which comes largely from his 1898 Dissertation .
Moore begins here by attributing to Bradley a quasi- empiricist view of meaning as abstracted from the total content of judgement .
This is a mistake , but what is important is what follows : as against this view Moore holds that meanings , which he calls ‘ concepts ’ , are entirely non-psychological .
They come together in propositions , which are the ‘ objects ’ of thoughts and , as such , are to be sharply distinguished from any mental contents or representations .
Indeed true propositions do not represent or correspond to a fact or real state of affairs ; instead they just are facts .
He put this point very clearly in a short entry written a year later on ‘ Truth ’ :
it seems plain that a truth differs in no respect from the reality to which it was supposed merely to correspond : e.g. the truth that I exist differs in no respect from the corresponding reality — my existence .
So far , indeed , from truth being defined by reference to reality , reality can only be defined by reference to truth .
( ‘ Truth ’ 21 )
As Moore came to see ten years later , this radical metaphysics of true propositions is too simple .
But in the present context what is striking about it is the way in which by itself it hovers between idealism and realism .
If propositions are thought of as contents of judgment , then to hold that reality just comprises true propositions is to take an idealist stance .
What makes the position realist in Moore 's hands is his uncompromising realism concerning propositions and concepts : although they are possible objects of thought , Moore writes , ‘ that is no definition of them ’ ; for ‘ it is indifferent to their nature whether anybody thinks them or not ’
( ‘ The Nature of Judgment ’ 4 )
Moore 's most famous criticisms of idealism are contained in his paper ‘ The Refutation of Idealism ’ ( 1903 ) .
The basic theme of this paper is the extension to sense - experience of the strong distinction between the mind and its objects which we have encountered in connection with meaning .
Moore concentrates here on the case of a ‘ sensation of blue ’ and maintains that this experience is a kind of ‘ diaphanous ’ consciousness or awareness of blue , which is not a ‘ content ’ of experience at all , but something real whose existence is not dependent on experience .
His argument here is in part phenomenological : ‘ when we try to introspect the sensation of blue , all we can see is the blue ’ ( 41 ) ; but he also argues that to suppose otherwise , that the ‘ blue ’ is merely a content of the experience is to suppose that it is a quality of the experience , so that the experience is blue in much the way in which a blue bead is blue , which he takes to be absurd .
Not surprisingly Moore 's critics were not happy with this comparison , but it was not until the formulation of the ‘ adverbial ’ theory of experience by Ducasse in the 1940's , according to which someone who has a sensation of blue is someone who ‘ senses bluely ’ , that there was a reasonably robust response to Moore 's criticism .
What is , nonetheless , odd about Moore 's paper is that he makes no attempt to address the famous ‘ argument from illusion ’ .
Moore concludes that ‘ “ blue ” is as much an object , and as little a mere content , of my experience , when I experience it , as the most exalted and independent real thing of which I am ever aware ’ ( 42 ) .
As he was soon to realise , more needs to be said to handle cases in which something which is not in fact blue looks blue .
The final aspect of Moore 's critical response to idealism concerns his rejection of the monism which was characteristic of British idealism .
This is the holistic thesis that ordinary things are essentially inter-related in such an intimate way that they constitute together an ‘ organic unity ’ which is , in a sense , the only thing that ‘ really ’ exists , since it is the only thing whose existence is not dependent on the existence of anything else .
This thesis is especially characteristic of Bradley 's idealism , according to which the Absolute is the one real thing .
In his early writings and in Principia Ethica Moore engages in a good deal of polemical criticism of this thesis , but it is hard to find any arguments against it , as opposed to a robust affirmation of a realist pluralism .
Rather later , however , in his paper ‘ External and Internal Relations ’ ( written in 1919 ) Moore focused on the idealist conception of internal relations which lies at the heart of the monist thesis .
Moore 's argument against the thesis that all relations are internal starts from the claim that the burden of proof lies on its supporters since it conflicts with our common sense conviction that things are not essentially inter-related in such a way that a change to one thing in one respect necessitates changes to everything else .
Moore then argues that the best reason one could have for the thesis involves a logical fallacy ; he shows how the thesis that all relations are internal might be plausibly , but fallaciously , inferred from Leibniz ’
Law , the uncontentious principle that things which differ in their relations must differ in their identity .
Simplifying a bit , and using Moore 's concept of entailment ( see below ) , his argument runs as follows :
Leibniz ’
Law states that xRy entails ( z = x → z Ry ) , where ‘→ ’ is the truth - functional conditional Since entailment is a necessary connection , one might infer xRy → Necessarily ( z = x → z Ry ) From ( 2 ) one can immediately infer xRy → Necessarily ( x = x → xRy )
Since x = x is itself a necessary truth , one can now infer xRy → Necessarily ( xRy ) which expresses the thesis that all relations are internal .
So , on the face of it , this thesis has here been inferred from Leibniz ’ Law .
Moore observes , however , that the step from ( 1 ) to ( 2 ) is invalid ; it confuses the necessity of a connection with the necessity of the consequent .
In ordinary language this distinction is not clearly marked , although it is easy to draw it with a suitable formal language .
Moore 's argument here is a sophisticated piece of informal modal logic ; but whether it really gets to the heart of the motivation for Bradley 's Absolute idealism can be doubted .
My own view is that Bradley 's dialectic rests on a different thesis about the inadequacy of thought as a representation of reality , and thus that one has to dig rather deeper into Bradley 's idealist metaphysics both to extract the grounds for his monism and to exhibit what is wrong with it .
The main achievement of Moore 's early period is his book Principia Ethica .
It was published in 1903 but was the culmination of the reflections which Moore commenced in his 1897 dissertation on ‘ The Metaphysical basis of Ethics ’ .
The main impetus , however , came from a series of lectures in London on ‘ The Elements of Ethics ’ which Moore gave late in 1898 .
Moore had the text of these lectures typed up with a view to publishing them ; but as his thoughts progressed he reworked his text and Principia Ethica is the result of this reworking ( the lectures have recently been published as The Elements of Ethics ) .
Most of the first three chapters come from the 1898 lectures ; whereas the last three chapters are largely new material .
In the first three chapters Moore sets out his criticisms of ‘ ethical naturalism ’ .
At the core of these criticisms is the thesis that the position involves a fallacy , the ‘ naturalistic fallacy ’ , of supposing that goodness , which Moore takes to be the fundamental ethical value , can be defined in naturalistic terms , in terms , say , of pleasure or desire or the course of evolution .
As against all such claims Moore insists that goodness is indefinable , or unanalysable , and thus that ethics is an autonomous science , irreducible to natural science or , indeed , to metaphysics .
Moore 's main argument against the possibility of any such definition of goodness is that when we confront a putative definition , such as that to be good is to be something which we desire to desire , we can tell that this is not a claim that is true by definition because its truth remains for us an ‘ open question ’ in the sense that it remains sensible to doubt it in a way which would not be possible if it were just a definition which makes explicit our understanding of the words .
The merits of this argument are questionable ; in many cases we can sensibly doubt the truth of a definition , especially where the definition makes use of discoveries that have not been part of our ordinary understanding , as is normally the case with definitions in the natural sciences .
But there is , I think , a way of modifying Moore 's argument which takes it around this objection , namely by taking it to rest on the epistemological thesis that ethical questions cannot be answered without the explicit involvement of ethical beliefs .
The reason that this thesis is inimical to naturalistic definitions of ethical values is that an important role of definitions in the natural sciences and elsewhere is that they enable one to answer questions in new ways that would not otherwise be possible : it is thanks to the definition of water as H 2 O , and not in terms of its familiar phenotype , that we can be confident that some comets are mainly composed of water .
But there is no way in which we would accept that the answer to a novel ethical question , for example concerning the acceptability of the use of human embryos for stem cell research , is to be found by finding a definition of ethical values which enables us to answer this question without drawing on beliefs that are expressed with the familiar ethical ‘ phenotype ’ , i.e. , explicitly ethical concepts .
This defence of Moore 's argument does not address a different concern , namely that the argument applies only to versions of ethical naturalism which involve a definition of ethical value , and thus that naturalist positions which maintain that ethical value is an irreducible natural property are not touched by the argument .
Moore 's argument against positions of this kind rests on the claim that the ethical value of a situation is not a feature of it which is independent of its other properties ; on the contrary it depends on its other properties .
As he puts it in the preface he composed for the second edition of Principia Ethica , but never actually published , a thing 's ‘ intrinsic value ’ depends on its ‘ intrinsic nature ’ , and he glosses this dependence in terms of the relationship which we now call ‘ supervenience ’ ( though Moore does not use the term ) : things with the same intrinsic nature , or natural properties , must have the same intrinsic value ( see ‘ The Conception of Intrinsic Value ’ 286 ) .
Moore took it that supervenience was not an inherently reductive relationship , and thus that it was consistent for him to hold that goodness is not a natural property even though it supervenes upon natural properties ; but , he assumed , if one takes the view that goodness is itself a natural property , the fact that it supervenes upon other natural properties makes it impossible to avoid a reductive thesis .
So the supervenience of intrinsic value removes the option of a non-reductive naturalism without contradicting his version of ethical non-naturalism .
Subsequent discussion has shown that the relationship between supervenience and reduction is a complicated matter , and though I think that Moore 's position is defensible this is not the place to take the issue further .
Instead I want to turn to the concept of intrinsic value which is central to Moore 's theory .
One aspect of this is easy , namely the distinction between the ‘ intrinsic ’ value of a situation and its ‘ instrumental ’ value : this is the distinction between the value inherent in a situation and that which depends only on the situation 's consequences .
Despite this distinction it remains the case that intrinsic value is the fundamental type of ethical value , since instrumental value is definable in terms of the intrinsic value of a situation 's consequences .
But intrinsic value is not merely non-instrumental value ; for it is also to be distinguished from what Moore calls the ‘ value as a part ’ of a situation , namely the extra contribution which the situation makes to the value of a complex situation of which it is a ‘ part ’ , over and above its intrinsic value .
This is not a conception which is familiar to us , but Moore illustrates the point by the following case : although knowledge has little intrinsic value , the value of the aesthetic appreciation of a beautiful work of art ( which is , according to Moore , potentially one of the most valuable things there is ) is greatly enhanced by knowledge about it .
So this kind of knowledge can have a substantial ‘ value as a part ’ even though it has little intrinsic value .
As before intrinsic value remains the fundamental conception of value , since a situation 's value as a part is defined in terms of the overall intrinsic value of a complex situation to which it makes a contribution beyond its own intrinsic value .
Nonetheless this point implies that a thing 's intrinsic value is not simply its value irrespective of its consequences ; it is also its value irrespective of its context .
Hence the concept of intrinsic value is to be such that a type of situation has the same intrinsic value in all contexts — which is why Moore holds that its intrinsic value depends only on its ‘ intrinsic nature ’ .
There are two connected problems here : the first concerns the way in which something 's ‘ value as a part ’ depends on accepting that when it occurs as an element of a complex situation it may affect the latter 's value in a way which is not simply the result of taking its intrinsic value into account .
This judgement is enshrined by Moore in his ‘ principle of organic unities ’ , which declares that this kind of non-aggregative valuation of complex situations is liable to occur .
The problem here is not that Moore 's principle is incorrect , but rather that it seems irrational since it puts a block on moral reasoning .
The second problem concerns the thesis that intrinsic value is the same in all contexts .
For this just seems wrong , in that the value of , say , friendship differs from one context to another .
Although , as Moore rightly says , friendship is normally one of the most valuable things there is , it has no value at all where claims of justice are at stake , as in a court of law .
So Moore 's conception of absolutely universal intrinsic values should be replaced by a conception which allows for the ‘ bracketing ’ of normal values in certain contexts ; and once this is in place , along with a more sophisticated account of normative values than Moore provides , it is reasonable to hope that the phenomena captured by Moore 's irrational principle of organic unities will find a more comprehensible interpretation .
Another area where Moore 's ethical theory is problematic is his account of ethical knowledge .
Because of his hostility to ethical naturalism Moore denies that ethical knowledge is a matter of empirical enquiry .
But , as we have seen , he is equally hostile to Kant 's rationalist thesis that fundamental ethical truths are truths of reason .
Instead he holds that ethical knowledge rests on a capacity for an intuitive grasp of fundamental ethical truths for which we can give no reason since there is no reason to be given .
The trouble with this is that if we can say nothing to support a claim to such knowledge , those who disagree with it can only register their disagreement and pass on ; hence ethical debate is liable to turn into the expression of conflicting judgements which admit of no resolution .
In the light of this , it is not surprising that Moore 's ethical theory was regarded as undermining the cognitive status of morality , and thus that it led directly to the development of ethical non-cognitivism by those who were influenced by Moore , such as A. J. Ayer and C. L. Stevenson .
Yet there was another side to Moore 's discussion of ethical issues , in which he found himself arguing against the hedonist thesis that pleasure is the only thing with positive intrinsic value , despite the fact that officially he held that no such arguments could be given .
When engaged in this kind of ‘ indirect ’ method of argument , Moore sees himself as seeking to obtain agreement rather than to establish the truth , though he also acknowledges that from a first - person point of view there is little difference here .
Because this indirect method is not integrated into his official method of ethical inquiry , he says little about its presuppositions .
But it seems to me that one can find here the beginnings of a ‘ common sense ’ approach to ethics which is distinctly preferable to his official appeal to intuitive judgments concerning the relative intrinsic value of situations of arbitrary complexity .
So far I have discussed Moore 's ‘ metaethics ’ , his views about the metaphysics of ethical value and the nature of ethical knowledge .
This emphasis reflects the fact that this aspect of Moore 's ethical theory has been most influential ; but it is also worth mentioning briefly some points from his moral theory .
Moore presents a straightforward consequentialist account of the relationship between the right and the good : the right action is that which will produce the best outcome .
In practice , because it is so difficult for us to determine by ourselves what is the best outcome , he allows that we probably do best if we follow established rules ; thus Moore ends up recommending a conservative form of rule consequentialism , for which he was criticised by Keynes and Russell .
Later critics such as W. D. Ross argued that because Moore subjects our personal responsibilities to the impersonal test of producing the best outcome his position does not adequately capture the way in which they arise from our relationships with particular people ; as recent critics put it , Moore 's moral theory is resolutely ‘ agent - neutral ’ and for that reason inadequate as an account of the personal responsibilities which involve irreducibly ‘ agent - relative ’ values .
Finally , in the last chapter of Principia Ethica , Moore sets out his ‘ ideal ’ — a deliberately unsystematic list of intrinsic goods ( such as friendship and the appreciation of beauty ) and intrinsic evils ( such as consciousness of pain ) .
Moore 's choice of values is striking : it connects with the ‘ Bloomsbury ’ ideal of life devoted to Art and Love , and excludes social values such as equality and freedom .
The individualism of the resulting morality is enhanced by the fact that Moore maintains that these intrinsic values are incommensurable , and thus that the assessment of priorities among them is inescapably a matter of individual judgment .
As Keynes put it , Moore 's ideal was a kind of secular ‘ religion ’ - not much use for public policy but fine for talented individuals who could agree to differ in their detailed value judgments .
By the time Moore returned to Cambridge in 1911 to a lectureship there , Russell and Whitehead were finishing off their massive project of exhibiting the logical foundations of mathematics — Principia Mathematica .
Although Moore was neither a mathematician nor a logical theorist he was one of the first people to grasp that Russell 's new logical theory was an essential tool for philosophy and offered important new insights .
One example of this concerns the status of propositions , the ‘ objects ’ of thought .
As we saw above , in his early work Moore had been emphatic that propositions are altogether independent of thought and had even proposed that facts are just true propositions .
But as he came to think more about falsehood in his lectures Some Main Problems of Philosophy of 1910 – 11 , it became clear to him that this position was a mistake , since the truth of a proposition should not affect its ontological status and yet it would be absurd to give false propositions the status of facts .
So he now rejected the view that facts are just true propositions .
On his new view , facts are , as before , constituted by objects and their properties ; but what about propositions ?
According to Moore , philosophers talk legitimately of propositions in order to identify the aspects of thought and language which are crucial to questions of truth and inference , and in doing so it may appear that they regard propositions as genuine entities .
But , Moore now holds , this implication is unwarranted : the mistake here is one of supposing that ‘ every expression which seems to be a name of something must be so in fact ’
( Some Main Problems of Philosophy , 266 ) .
Moore does not allude here explicitly to Russell 's theory of incomplete symbols and logical fictions , but it is clear that this is the kind of position he has in mind .
The new logic enables one to preserve realist appearances without accepting realist metaphysics .
Yet Moore was not an uncritical follower of Russell .
He was critical of Russell 's account of implication in which Russell proposes that the truth - functional conditional expresses all there is to the logical relationship of implication between propositions , and introduced instead the term ‘ entailment ’ for this latter relationship ( ‘ External and Internal Relations ’ 90 ff . ) .
While recognising that entailment is closely connected to logical necessity he came to think that entailment is not just a matter of the necessity of the truth - functional conditional , thereby setting off a debate about this relationship which continues to this day .
Again , Moore was critical of Russell 's treatment of existence , in particular his denial that it makes sense to treat existence as a first - order predicate of particular objects ( for Russell , existence has to be expressed by the existential quantifier and is therefore a second - order predicate of predicates ) .
While agreeing with Russell that existence is not a straightforward first - order predicate ( so that the logical form of ‘ Tame tigers exist ’ is not the same as that of ‘ Tame tigers growl ’ ) , Moore argued that statements such as ‘ This might not exist ’ make perfectly good sense and that they could not do so unless the simpler statement ‘ This exists ’ also makes sense ( ‘ Is Existence a Predicate ? ’ 145 ) .
Moore 's uses of Russell 's logic take place in the broader context of his use of analysis as a method of philosophy .
Although Moore always denied that philosophy is just analysis , there is no denying that it plays a central role in his philosophy and it is therefore important to determine what motivates this role .
This question is especially pressing in Moore 's case because he rejected the main analytical programmes of twentieth century philosophy — both Wittgenstein 's logical atomism and the logical empiricism of the members of the Vienna circle and their followers such as A. J. Ayer .
In the first case , Moore rejected Wittgenstein 's thesis that whatever exists exists necessarily ; as with the idealist thesis that all relations are internal , Moore held that our common sense conviction that some of the things which exist might not have done so creates a strong presumption against any philosopher who maintains the opposite , and that the logical atomist position does not provide convincing reasons why this presumption should be overturned .
In addition Moore held that it is just not true that all necessity is logical necessity , as Wittgenstein maintained ; in his early writings , despite his hostility to Kant , he had explicitly defended the conception of necessary synthetic truths and he did not change his mind on this point .
This point also provides a reason for his rejection of logical empiricism , since this position famously includes the thesis that all necessary truths are ‘ analytic ’ .
But Moore also recognised that his early criticisms of William James ' pragmatism can be applied to the logical empiricist position .
In connection with James , Moore had observed that where a proposition concerns the past , it may well be that we are in a situation in which a proposition and its negation are both unverifiable because there is now no evidence either way on the matter .
But , he argued , it does not follow that we cannot now affirm that either the proposition or its negation is true , thanks to the Law of Excluded Middle ; in which case it cannot be that truth is verifiability — contrary both to James ' pragmatism and to logical empiricism .
Yet why then did Moore think that the analysis of propositions was so important ?
In part his motivation derives from his acceptance of a principle which Russell had introduced — that ‘ every proposition which we can understand must be composed wholly of constituents with which we are acquainted ’ ( Russell 91 ) .
For this principle motivates the ‘ sense - datum analysis ’ of perception to which he devoted so much attention and which I shall discuss in a moment .
In addition , when explaining the importance of philosophical analysis , he emphasized the importance of getting clear what is at issue in some debate ; but an issue which he himself was not clear about was that of the implications of an analysis .
In his early writings he took the view that in so far as the analysis of a proposition clarifies it , it also clarifies its ontological implications ; thus he then held it to be an objection to a phenomenalist analysis of propositions about material objects that the analysis calls into question the existence of such objects .
But he later took the opposite point of view , maintaining that a phenomenalist analysis just provides an account of what their existence amounts to .
In between these two positions , in his 1925 paper ‘ A Defence of Common Sense ’ ( which I discuss further below ) , Moore had held that what the sense - datum analysis of perception shows is that sense - data are the ‘ principal or ultimate subject <s >’ ( 128 ) of propositions about perception .
This remark , I think , reflects the true importance of philosophical analysis for Moore : its importance for him is metaphysical in so far as it reveals the ‘ ultimate ’ substances which are the subjects of our ordinary common sense thought and talk .
It did not take Moore long to realise that the realist position he had advanced in ‘ The Refutation of Idealism ’ was too ‘ na•ve ’ to be tenable ; he had to be able to accommodate ‘ false ’ appearances somehow .
But the strategy Moore adopted to deal with this remained true to the basic thesis of ‘ The Refutation of Idealism ’ that one should account for the appearances of things in terms of the properties of the primary objects of experience , and not the qualities of experiences themselves .
To elaborate this position Moore introduced the term ‘ sense - datum ’ to describe these primary objects of experience :
But now , what happened to each of us , when we saw that envelope ?
I will begin by describing part of what happened to me .
I saw a patch of a particular whitish colour , having a certain shape ….
These things : this patch of a whitish colour , and its size and shape I did actually see .
And I propose to call these things , the colour and size and shape , sense - data … ( Some Main Problems of Philosophy 30 )
Moore implies here that the colour , shape and size are distinct sense - data ; but he soon revised his terminology so that these are regarded as properties of the visual sense - datum he ‘ actually saw ’ , or ‘ directly apprehended ’ as he normally says .
Once the concept of a sense - datum has been introduced in this way , it is easy to see that false appearances can be handled by distinguishing between the properties of sense - data we apprehend and the properties of the physical objects which give rise to these sense - data .
But what is the relationship between sense - data and physical objects ?
Moore took it that there are three serious candidates to be considered : ( i ) an indirect realist position , according to which sense - data are non-physical but somehow produced by interactions between physical objects and our senses ; ( ii ) the phenomenalist position , according to which our conception of physical objects is merely one which expresses observed and anticipated uniformities among the sense - data we apprehend ; ( iii ) a direct realist position , according to which sense - data are parts of physical objects — so that , for example , visual sense - data are visible parts of the surfaces of physical objects .
The indirect realist position is that to which he was initially drawn ; but he could see that it leaves our beliefs about the physical world exposed to skeptical doubt , since it implies that the observations which constitute evidence for these beliefs concern only the properties of non-physical sense - data , and there is no obvious way for us to obtain further evidence to support a hypothesis about the properties of the physical world and its relationship to our sense - data .
This argument is reminiscent of Berkeley 's critique of Locke , and Moore therefore considered carefully Berkeley 's phenomenalist alternative .
Moore 's initial response to this position was that the implied conception of the physical world was just too ‘ pickwickian ’ to be believable .
This may be felt to be too intuitive , like Dr. Johnson 's famous objection to Berkeley ; but Moore could also see that there were substantive objections to the phenomenalist position , such as the fact that our normal ways of identifying and anticipating significant uniformities among our sense - data draw on our beliefs about our location in physical space and the state of our physical sense - organs , neither of which are available to the consistent phenomenalist .
So far Moore 's dialectic is familiar .
What is unfamiliar is his direct realist position , according to which sense - data are physical .
This position avoids the problems so far encountered , but in order to accommodate false appearances Moore has to allow that sense - data may lack the properties which we apprehend them as having .
It may be felt that in so far as sense - data are objects at all , this is inevitable ; but Moore now needs to provide an account of the apparent properties of sense - data and it is not clear how he can do this without going back on the initial motivation for the sense - datum theory by construing these apparent properties as properties of our experiences .
But what in fact turns
Moore against this direct realist position is the difficulty he thinks it leads to concerning the treatment of hallucinations .
In such cases , Moore holds , any sense - data we apprehend are not parts of a physical object ; so direct realism cannot apply to them , and yet there is no reason to hold that they are intrinsically different from the sense - data which we apprehend in normal experience .
This last point might well be disputed , and at one point Moore himself considers the possibility of a distinction between ‘ subjective ’ and ‘ objective ’ sense - data ; but once one has introduced sense - data in the first place as the primary objects of experience it is not going to be easy to make a distinction here without assuming more about experience than Moore at any rate would have wanted to concede .
Moore wrote more extensively about perception than about any other topic .
In these writings he moves between the three alternatives set out here without coming to any firm conclusion .
From the outside , it seems clear that what was leading him astray was the sense - datum hypothesis itself and his reflections on perception can be regarded as an extended reductio ad absurdum of this hypothesis .
It was only towards the end of his career that he encountered in Ducasse 's adverbial theory a serious alternative to the sense - datum hypothesis .
But the adverbial theory provides no easy way of avoiding the difficulties Moore confronted : Moore rightly objected to Ducasse that it is not at all clear how the structure of a sensory field can be construed in adverbial terms .
Yet there were other alternatives : in particular , from the start of the twentieth century the phenomenological movement had offered an account of perception based upon a recognition of its inherent intentionality which avoids some of the pitfalls of the sense - datum theory .
It is , I think , a pity that Moore did not engage with this position , but this detachment was all too characteristic of the relationship at the time between the analytical and phenomenological traditions .
An important aspect of Moore 's rejection of idealism was his affirmation of a ‘ common sense ’ realist position , according to which our ordinary common - sense view of the world is largely correct .
Moore first explicitly championed this position in his 1910 - 11 lectures Some Main Problems of Philosophybut he made it his own when he responded in 1925 to an invitation to describe his ‘ philosophical position ’ by setting this out as ‘ A Defence of Common Sense ’ .
Moore begins the paper by listing a large number of ‘ truisms ’ such as that ‘ the earth had existed also for many years before my body was born ’ .
Concerning these truisms he then asserts , first , that he knows them for certain , second , that other people likewise know for certain the truth of comparable truisms about themselves and , third , that he knows this second general truth ( and , by implication , others do too ) .
So the truth and general knowledge of these truisms is a matter of common sense .
Having set out these truisms , Moore then acknowledges that some philosophers have denied their truth or , more commonly , denied our knowledge of them ( even though , according to Moore , they also know them ) and he attempts to show that these denials are incoherent or unwarranted .
These claims might seem to leave little space for radical philosophical argument .
But in the last part of the paper Moore argues that his defence of common sense leaves completely undecided the question as to how the truistic propositions which make up the common sense view of the world are to be analysed ; the analysis may be as radical as one likes as long as it is consistent with the truth and knowability of the propositions analysed .
Thus , for example , he is content to allow that philosophical argument may show that a phenomenalist analysis of propositions about the physical world is correct .
This last point shows that Moore 's defence of common sense is not as much of a constraint on philosophical theory as one might at first have thought ; for philosophical analysis can reveal to us facts about the ‘ principal or ultimate subject ’ of a truistic proposition which are by no means what common sense supposes .
This implication is important when one turns to consider Moore 's most famous paper , his ‘ Proof of an External World ’ — the text of a British Academy lecture delivered in 1939 just when Moore was retiring from his Cambridge Professorship .
Moore here sets himself the task of doing what Kant had earlier set himself to do , namely providing a proof of the existence of ‘ external objects ’ .
Much of the lecture is devoted to working out what counts as an ‘ external object ’ , and Moore claims that these are things whose existence is not dependent upon our experience .
So , he argues , if he can prove the existence of any such things , then he will have proved the existence of an ‘ External World ’ .
Moore then maintains that he can do this —
How ?
By holding up my two hands , and saying , as I make a certain gesture with the right hand , ‘ Here is one hand ’ , and adding , as I make a certain gesture with the left , ‘ and here is another ’ ( ‘ Proof of an External World ’ 166 ) .
Moore then goes to argue that this demonstration of his hands was a ‘ perfectly rigorous ’ proof of the existence of external objects .
For its premises certainly entail its conclusion and they are things which he then knew to be true —
I knew that there was one hand in the place indicated by combining a certain gesture with my first utterance of ‘ here ’ and that there was another in the different place indicated by combining a certain gesture with my second utterance of ‘ here ’ .
How absurd it would be to suggest that I did not know it , but only believed it , and that perhaps it was not the case !
You might as well suggest that I do not know that I am now standing up and talking — that perhaps after all I 'm not , and that it 's not quite certain that I am !
( ‘ Proof of an External World ’ 166 )
The significance of this performance has been debated ever since Moore set it out .
It is commonly supposed that Moore here sets himself to refute philosophical skepticism ; and that his performance , though intriguing , is unsuccessful .
But this interpretation is incorrect : Moore 's avowed aim is to prove the existence of an external world , not to prove his knowledge of the existence of an external world .
Moore himself set this out clearly in a subsequent discussion of his lecture :
I have sometimes distinguished between two different propositions , each of which has been made by some philosophers , namely ( 1 ) the proposition ‘ there are no material things ’ and ( 2 ) the proposition ‘ Nobody knows for certain that there are any material things ’ .
And in my latest British Academy lecture called ‘ Proof of an External World ’ … I implied with regard to the first of these propositions that it could be proved to be false in such a way as this ; namely , by holding up one of your hands and saying ‘ This hand is a material thing ; therefore there is at least one material thing ’ .
But with regard to the second of the two propositions ….
I do not think I have ever implied that it could be proved to be false in any such simple way … ( ‘ A Reply to my Critics ’ 668 )
Setting aside any anti-skeptical intent therefore , what needs assessment is the metaphysical significance of Moore 's proof , as a proof of an ‘ external world ’ .
Clearly , everything here depends on what is to count as ‘ external ’ , in particular whether Moore 's demonstration of the existence of his hands proves the existence of things that are in no way at all dependent upon experience or thought .
It is , I think , obvious that it does not ; for that issue is one which depends on broader philosophical questions about idealism which cannot possibly be settled that way .
Moore 's own distinction between questions of truth and questions of analysis should be introduced here .
Moore 's ‘ proof ’ demonstrates the ‘ empirical ’ truth of a simple truism , that he has hands ; but it leaves entirely open the question of the analysis of this truism .
Yet it is at the level of analysis that the ‘ transcendental ’ question of whether things such as hands are altogether independent of experience and thought is to be answered .
Although , as I have indicated , Moore did not intend his ‘ proof ’ as a refutation of skepticism , he did frequently argue against skeptical views ; and in his early writings , despite the passage quoted just now , he does sometimes give the impression that he thinks one can refute skepticism by simply bringing forward a straightforward case of knowledge , such as ‘ I know that this is a pencil ’ .
But on examination it turns out that his strategy here is more subtle ; he wants to argue that we get our understanding of knowledge primarily through straightforward cases of this kind , and thus that skeptical arguments are self - undermining : for , on the one hand , they rely on general principles about the limits of knowledge and thus assume some understanding of knowledge but , on the other hand , they undermine this understanding by implying that there are no such straightforward cases of it .
The force of arguments of this kind is , however , disputable , since the skeptic can always present his argument as a reductio ad absurdum of the possibility of knowledge ; and the same point applies to Moore 's other attempts to convict the skeptic of some kind of pragmatic incoherence .
In two of his last writings , ‘ Four Forms of Skepticism ’ and ‘ Certainty ’ , Moore , perhaps dissatisfied with these earlier arguments and with the misunderstanding of his ‘ proof ’ , returned to the issue and set himself the challenge of refuting Cartesian skepticism .
Notoriously , by the end of ‘ Certainty ’
Moore acknowledges defeat : having agreed that if he does not know that he is not dreaming , then he does not know such things as that he is standing up and talking , he accepts ( with reservations ) that he cannot know for certain that he is not dreaming .
Most commentators agree that Moore lost his way here .
But it is not clear where , since Moore makes no obvious mistake .
Nonetheless the viability of a ‘ common sense ’ response to skepticism remains an important feature of later discussions of the topic .
Moore was clearly right when , for example , he remarked that despite Russell 's frequent skeptical professions , Russell was nonetheless perfectly sure , without a shadow of doubt , on thousands of occasions , that he was sitting down .
But what is difficult to achieve here is a formulation of the skeptical dialectic which both shows the importance of Moore 's ‘ common sense ’ affirmations of certainty and yet avoids a dogmatic insistence that knowledge does not need to be vindicated in the face of skeptical argument .
I myself think that Wittgenstein 's writings On Certainty , which were much influenced by Moore , best indicate how this is to be achieved , but this is not the place to demonstrate this achievement .
Moore was not a systematic philosopher : unlike Reid 's philosophy of common sense , Moore 's ‘ common sense ’ is not a system .
Even in ethics , where he comes closest to presenting a ‘ theory ’ he explicitly disavows any aspiration to provide a systematic account of the good .
Hence , as the preceding discussions show , Moore 's legacy is primarily a collection of arguments , puzzles and challenges .
One notable addition to those mentioned already is ‘ Moore 's paradox ’ : if I am mistaken about something , then I believe something which is not the case — perhaps that it is raining when it is not .
Yet if I attribute this mistake to myself by saying ‘ It 's not raining but I believe that it is ’ my statement is absurd .
Why is this so ?
Why is it absurd for me to say something that it is true about myself ?
Moore himself thought that the explanation here was just that we generally believe the things we say , so that when saying ‘ It 's not raining ’
I imply that I believe this ; but Wittgenstein rightly saw that this explanation was superficial and that Moore had put his finger on a much deeper phenomenon here which concerns our sense of our own identity as thinkers .
This case is typical .
Moore had an unparalleled ability for identifying philosophical ‘ phenomena ’ .
His own discussions of their significance are not always satisfying ; but he would be the first to acknowledge his own fallibility .
What matters is that if we start where he starts we can be sure that we are dealing with something that will tell us something important about ourselves and the world .
