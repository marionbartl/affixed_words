Chief constables across England and Wales have been told to ignore a landmark ruling by the European court of human rights and carry on adding the DNA profiles of tens of thousands of innocent people to a national DNA database .
Senior police officers have also been " strongly advised " that it is " vitally important " that they resist individual requests based on the Strasbourg ruling to remove DNA profiles from the national database in cases such as wrongful arrest , mistaken identity , or where no crime has been committed .
European human rights judges ruled last December in the S and Marper case that the blanket and indiscriminate retention of the DNA profiles and fingerprints of 850,000 people arrested but never convicted of any offence amounts to an unlawful breach of their rights .
Britain already has the largest police national DNA database in the world , with 5.8 m profiles , including one in three of all young black males .
Thousands more are being added each week .
So far the Home Office has responded to the judgment by proposing a controversial package to keep DNA profiles of the innocent for six to 12 years , depending on the seriousness of the offence .
The official consultation period ended today .
The advice to senior officers comes in a letter from the Association of Chief Police Officers criminal records office .
The letter , seen by the Guardian , tells chief constables that new Home Office guidelines following the ruling in the case of S and Marper are not expected to take effect until 2010 .
" Until that time , the current retention policy on fingerprints and DNA remains unchanged , " it says .
" Individuals who consider they fall within the ruling in the S and Marper case should await the full response to the ruling by the government prior to seeking advice and / or action from the police service in order to address their personal issue on the matter .
" Acpo strongly advise that decisions to remove records should not be based on [ the government 's ] proposed changes .
It is therefore vitally important that any applications for removals of records should be considered against current legislation . "
Chris Huhne , the Liberal Democrats ' shadow home secretary , said it was clear from the letter that the government intends to string out its response to the European court ruling that they should not keep the DNA of innocent people .
" It is unacceptable that new guidance wo n't be provided to police until 2010 .
In that time thousands more innocent people will have been added to the database , where they will remain for years .
" It is not up to police forces to ignore court judgments because they or their masters do not like them . "
The tone of the letter is in sharp contrast to what the Home Office told the House of Lords in June when peers sharply criticised the government 's intention to push through their plan to keep innocent people 's DNA for up to 12 years by using " back door " secondary legislation to get it through parliament .
The Home Office told peers that they could not afford the delay that would be involved in making the changes in primary legislation that would allow MPs and peers to fully debate the changes .
Home Office officials said they face a possible " surge of pressure " from individuals seeking deletion of their data from the relevant databases .
Ministers have already received some legal challenges .
But the Lords committee on delegated powers and regulatory reform has told ministers that provision " about this important and complex subject should be in primary legislation " .

Hierarchies Many datasets can be organized into natural hierarchies .
Consider : spatial entities , such as counties , states , and countries ; command structures for businesses and governments ; software packages and phylogenetic trees .
Even for data lacking apparent hierarchy , statistical methods such as k-means clustering may be applied to organize data empirically .
Special visualization techniques exist to leverage hierarchical structure , allowing multiscale inferences of both individual elements and global trends .
Dendrograms Sunbursts Icicles Indented Trees Circle Packing Node - Link Trees Treemaps
Networks Graph visualizations often seek to reveal relationship patterns between entities and groups in the underlying dataset .

Q : Can you describe a time you faced a challenge and how you overcame that challenge ?
A : I was being crushed under a mountain of work .
Reports , emails , spreadsheets , you name it .
I was at that point where you just feel so overwhelmed that you do n’t even know where to start .
Something had to give , so I took the initiative and rescheduled our family vacation for next year , which opened up like 80 extra hours to whittle down the pile .
Before I knew it , the workload was back to being manageable , especially once they instituted the mandatory overtime .
I got major kudos on that one .
Q : Tell me about a time you went above and beyond what was required of you .
A : It was a Tuesday which meant it was my turn to brew the morning coffee .
While I was pouring the grounds into the filter , I realized that by switching to a generic bean and outsourcing our accounts receivable department the company could save thousands of dollars each year .
It was kind of a mixed blessing , though , because after that I was asked to make the coffee on Thursdays too !
Q : How do you like to be managed ?
A : That ’s a good question and very important , obviously , because it really affects the day - to - day process and will have a huge impact on the relationship between manager and the person being managed .
I know that some prefer to really dig in and have a lot of control over the shape of the work that ’s being done while others take a more hands - off approach and favor more autonomy , just jumping in when things require intervention .
Both approaches certainly have their pros and cons or pluses and minuses if you will depending on your perspective and the nature of the manager - managee relationship , or partnership I like to think of it as because it ’s very important that those two , we two I suppose , can communicate on the same level .
But always with a solid understanding of who ’s in what role of course !
Q : What are your greatest strengths ?
A : I think my previous colleagues would say one of my greatest strengths is my dedication .
I ca n’t tell you the number of times coworkers would pass my cubicle on their way out for the evening and say , “ Wow , Tim , I really admire your dedication .
We ’re all so impressed ! ”
Q : And your weaknesses ?
A : I work too hard !
Nah , just kidding ; I bet you ’ve heard that line a hundred times .
No , for me it ’s that I sometimes struggle to achieve a good work - life balance with things usually heavily skewed towards the work side of the equation .
It ’s something I ’m working on improving … but only on my off hours , do n’t worry !

General Motors took a big step toward its reinvention as the " New G.M. " today when it opened what it calls the largest automotive battery laboratory in the United States , a move the struggling company believes will hasten the development of electric vehicles .
GM invested $ 25 million in the 33,000 - square - foot Global Battery Systems Lab to develop and test the drivetrains underpinning the Chevrolet Volt and other hybrid , battery - electric and hydrogen fuel cell vehicles .
The automaker believes the facility , at its sprawling Warren Technical Center campus outside Detroit , will help make it a market leader in battery and EV technology .
" The new global GM battery lab will benefit consumers across America by helping us advance the development of battery technology in the United States and put cleaner , more efficient vehicles on the road more quickly and affordably , " CEO Fritz Henderson said in a statement .
" Our new lab improves GM 's competitiveness by speeding the development of our hybrid , plug - in and extended - range electric vehicles . "
The lab 's opening comes one week after General Motors filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy and vowed to reinvent itself as a leaner , greener company focused on fuel efficiency .
It also comes as major automakers align themselves with battery manufacturers to bring cars with cords to market .
Volkswagen , for example , recently signed a deal with Chinese auto - and battery - maker BYD , and Daimler bought nearly 10 percent of Tesla Motors last month .
The Global Battery Systems Lab is four times larger than the cramped quarters where engineers had been working on the lithium - ion battery pack used in the Volt .
It employs more than 1,000 engineers .
The operation features 160 test channels and 42 thermal chambers that subject batteries to real - world driving conditions and temperarture variations .
It also has 32 battery cyclers , " treadmills " used to deplete and charge the packs repeatedly .
" This facility is state - of - the - art and represents one of the largest and most capable battery test labs in the world , " said Jim Queen , vp of global engineering .
The lab has a maximum power capacity of 6 megawatts .
The lab also features a thermal shaker table for testing the structural integrity of each pack and a battery tear - down workshop for failure analysis and reverse - engineering competitors ' batteries .
The Global Battery Systems Lab is the crown jewel in GM 's battery program , which includes labs in Mainz - Kastel , Germany and Honeoye Falls , N.Y. General Motors is working with LG Chem on the battery that will provide the Volt with an all - electric range of 40 miles , and it has a joint deal with Compact Power and LG Chem to continue developing the technology .
GM also has joined the University of Michigan in creating a battery - specific engineering curriculum and a battery lab in Ann Arbor .
GM filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection last week and is radically scaling back its operations , but work on the battery lab started in December 2007 shortly after GM started developing the Volt .
Construction started in August and engineers started testing batteries there in January .
The company plans to open a factory somewhere in Michigan to begin producing batteries by the end of 2010 , at which point the Volt is slated to start rolling off an assembly line at the Detroit - Hamtramck Assembly factory .

The creators of Wikipedia will add about 50 servers in a new European traffic hub in a " green " data center in Amsterdam , the company said today .
The Wikimedia Foundation has signed a contract with EvoSwitch , which will donate more than 300,000 euros ( about $ 415,000 ) of in - kind support in bandwidth and hosting services .
The Wikipedia site is hosted on about 300 servers in a primary data center in Tampa , Fla .
The 50 servers at the EvoSwitch data center in Amsterdam will provide content storage and delivery .
Amsterdam is one of the world 's most important network hubs , with hundreds of European networks exchanging traffic in the city 's data centers .
" We 're very pleased with EvoSwitch 's professional and well secured data center environment , which includes a highly cost - efficient infrastructure in a location that is of great strategic importance to us , ” said Brion Vibber , Chief Technology Officer for the Foundation .
“ We will be using the Amsterdam site for caching in particular , aiming to reduce the response time of our project websites in Europe .
EvoSwitch will also be a good location for backing up content that is stored at our Florida data center .
Finally , we will be relocating European publishing projects to EvoSwitch , such as Toolserver.org – a project of the German Wikimedia chapter .
" The Amsterdam servers will both retrieve the content from the servers in Florida , as well as store it , " Vibber added .
" Web pages can then be displayed to Internet users directly from Amsterdam , which will improve the speed and accessibility of the web pages in Europe significantly .
I expect that we will further increase our capacity at EvoSwitch in the near future due to the required storage capacity and new European publishing projects . "
EvoSwitch is a 100,000 square foot data center supported by 20 megawatts of power capacity that is generated entirely from sustainable energy sources including , solar , wind and biomass .
The facility uses free cooling ( fresh air economization ) to reduce its use of energy for air conditioning .
Vibber says this was a factor in Wikimedia 's selection of EvoSwitch .
" As operators of one of the most heavily accessed web property on the web , we are aware of the impact that the Internet and its energy consumption have on the environment , " said Vibber .
" EvoSwitch ’s energy - saving measures , combined with their use of green energy and CO2 compensation are very attractive to us . "
" We are strong supporters of Wikimedia and their Wikipedia publishing project in particular , " said Eric Boonstra , EvoSwitch ’s Commercial Director .
" The Foundation 's operations coincide with the objectives of our own organization , to keep the Internet ' open ' and stimulate freedom of expression and the transmission of knowledge via the Internet .
This partnership is all the more special to us because of Wikimedia ’s faith in EvoSwitch . "
A new , highly detailed study of the H1N1 flu virus shows that the pathogen is more virulent than previously thought .
Writing in a fast - tracked report published July 13 , 2009 in the journal Nature , an international team of researchers led by UW - Madison virologist Yoshihiro Kawaoka provides a detailed portrait of the pandemic virus and its pathogenic qualities .
In contrast with run -of - the - mill seasonal flu viruses , the H1N1 virus exhibits an ability to infect cells deep in the lungs , where it can cause pneumonia and , in severe cases , death .
Seasonal viruses typically infect only cells in the upper respiratory system .
" There is a misunderstanding about this virus , " says Kawaoka , a professor of pathobiological sciences at the UW - Madison School of Veterinary Medicine and a leading authority on influenza .
" People think this pathogen may be similar to seasonal influenza .
This study shows that is not the case .
There is clear evidence the virus is different than seasonal influenza . "
The ability to infect the lungs , notes Kawaoka , is a quality frighteningly similar to those of other pandemic viruses , notably the 1918 virus , which killed tens of millions of people at the tail end of World War I .
There are likely other similarities to the 1918 virus , says Kawaoka , as the study also showed that people born before 1918 harbor antibodies that protect against the new H1N1 virus .
And it is possible , he adds , that the virus could become even more pathogenic as the current pandemic runs its course and the virus evolves to acquire new features .
It is now flu season in the world 's southern hemisphere , and the virus is expected to return in force to the northern hemisphere during the fall and winter flu season .

To assess the pathogenic nature of the H1N1 virus , Kawaoka and his colleagues infected different groups of mice , ferrets and non-human primates — all widely accepted models for studies of influenza — with the pandemic virus and a seasonal flu virus .
They found that the H1N1 virus replicates much more efficiently in the respiratory system than seasonal flu and causes severe lesions in the lungs similar to those caused by other more virulent types of pandemic flu .
" When we conducted the experiments in ferrets and monkeys , the seasonal virus did not replicate in the lungs , " Kawaoka explains .
" The H1N1 virus replicates significantly better in the lungs . "
The new study was conducted with samples of the virus obtained from patients in California , Wisconsin , the Netherlands and Japan .
The new Nature report also assessed the immune response of different groups to the new virus .
The most intriguing finding , according to Kawaoka , is that those people exposed to the 1918 virus , all of whom are now in advanced old age , have antibodies that neutralize the H1N1 virus .
" The people who have high antibody titers are the people born before 1918 , " he notes .
Kawaoka says that while finding the H1N1 virus to be a more serious pathogen than previously reported is worrisome , the new study also indicates that existing and experimental antiviral drugs can form an effective first line of defense against the virus and slow its spread .
There are currently three approved antiviral compounds , according to Kawaoka , whose team tested the efficacy of two of those compounds and the two experimental antiviral drugs in mice .
" The existing and experimental drugs work well in animal models , suggesting they will work in humans , " Kawaoka says .
Antiviral drugs are viewed as a first line of defense , as the development and production of mass quantities of vaccines take months at best .

In another move to crack down on information flowing out of Iran , the Islamic Republic 's judicial chief has ordered the prosecution of individuals " who cooperate with satellite television programming providers , " a reformist newspaper reported Sunday .
Iran 's judicial chief reportedly has ordered the prosecution of people who " collaborate " with satellite TV networks .
" The individuals , who in any way collaborate with these networks or are entrenched in the nucleus of organizations which are active through Internet sites , must be adequately and properly subject to legal actions .
It is imperative that this phenomenon be seriously dealt with by all judicial authorities of the country as well as by provincial judicial authorities , " Ayatollah Seyyed Mahmoud Hashemi -Shahroudi said in his order , which was quoted by the newspaper Hamshahri .
The ayatollah called on local judicial heads to work with investigators to determine " intentions , objectives and their sources of financial , political and intelligence support " of individuals who " operate against the system , " according to Hamshahri , a widely circulated pro-reform publication that has been in print for more than a decade .
The scope of the reported threat and whether it was referring to international networks , reporters and stringers was not immediately clear .
Because international journalists have been limited in their ability to gather news in Iran , CNN has not been able to confirm the news report .
However , the government has been trying to limit the flow of online information and other forms of communications in Iran , according to activists and human rights officials .
Since June 12 , when disputed presidential election results sent tens of thousands of Iranians into the streets to protest , the world got a front - row view of the unrest thanks largely to dissidents using online tools to spread the news .
News from Internet users has been important as Iran 's government began kicking out some reporters from traditional media outlets , arresting others and restricting the movements of those who remained .
More than 1,000 people have been arrested over the election fallout , including several journalists , according to the international human rights watchdog Amnesty International .
Most recently , the semi-official Fars News Agency reported that a journalist for Newsweek magazine who was arrested in Tehran confessed to doing the bidding of Western governments , though CNN could not verify the report .
Maziar Bahari , 42 , made his alleged confession at a news conference Tuesday .
Fars reported that the Canadian - Iranian reporter , who had worked for the BBC and England 's Channel 4 network , admitted having filed false reports for Newsweek during the elections .
The magazine has rejected the allegation .
CNN 's Doug Gross contributed to this report .

Someone sent this to me and I just had to share . .
“ A Well - Planned Retirement – From The London Times :
Outside the Bristol Zoo , in England , there is a parking lot for 150 cars and 8 coaches , or buses .
It was manned by a very pleasant attendant with a ticket machine charging cars 1 pound ( about $ 1.40 ) and coaches 5 pounds ( about $ 7 ) .
This parking attendant worked there solid for all of 25 years .
Then , one day , he just did n’t turn up for work .
“ Oh well ” , said Bristol Zoo Management – “ we ’d better phone up the City Council and get them to send a new parking attendant . . . ”
“ Err . . . no ” , said the Council , “ that parking lot is your responsibility . ”
“ Err . . . no ” , said Bristol Zoo Management , “ the attendant was employed by the City Council , was n’t he ? ”
“ Err . . . no ! ” insisted the Council .
Sitting in his villa , somewhere on the coast of Spain ( presumably ) , is a man who had been taking the parking lot fees , estimated at 400 pounds ( about $ 560 ) per day at Bristol Zoo for the last 25 years .
Assuming 7 days a week , this amounts to just over 3.6 million pounds ( $ 7 million – or $ 280,000 every year for 25 years ) !
And no one even knows his name ! ”
The Chinese authorities yesterday blamed exiled Muslim Uighur separatists for trouble in the restive western province of Xinjiang which killed at least 156 people and injured hundreds more .
But the government was in turn accused of heavy - handed repression which , according to the claim of one Uighur representative , may have left up to 400 people dead .
The violence , which may have been the deadliest in China since Tiananmen Square in 1989 , began in the regional capital Urumqi on Sunday night when tensions between Uighurs and Han Chinese boiled over .
State television showed images of rioters throwing rocks at police , smashing buses and setting fire to shops and cars , as well as bystanders holding faces streaming with blood .
Burnt - out buildings and vehicles continued to smoulder yesterday , broken glass littered the roads and bloodstains dotted the concrete .
It was the second major eruption of ethnic violence in China in less than 18 months .
In March last year , protests and riots flared up in the Tibetan capital , Lhasa , with authorities saying 19 people were killed and exile groups saying the real figure was 200 .
The latest trouble in Xinjiang also comes at an embarrassing time for the Communist Party in Beijing , just three months before it is due to celebrate the 60th anniversary of the founding of the People 's Republic of China .

Urumqi was under lockdown last night .
At the Grand Bazaar , usually populated by Uighur vendors touting a dazzling array of daggers or a rogue camel , columns of camouflage - wearing paramilitary police carrying batons and shields marched in a show of strength , defying any more would - be protesters or rioters .
And there were cyber restrictions too , with reports that Urumqi residents were unable to access the internet .
The state - run Xinhua news agency reported that 700 suspects had been arrested , including more than 10 key players who fanned the trouble , and that authorities were searching for another 90 .
There were other reports that students had been targeted .
Mamet , a restaurant worker in the city , told the Associated Press about a raid he had witnessed outside Xinjiang University .
" First they fired tear gas at the students .
Then they started beating them and shooting them with bullets , " he said .
" Big trucks arrived and students were rounded up and arrested . "
Amnesty International called on Beijing to " fully account for all those who died and have been detained " and demanded " a fair and thorough investigation " into the weekend 's events
However , the government was already apportioning blame yesterday .
" The violence is a pre-empted , organised violent crime .
It is instigated and directed from abroad , and carried out by outlaws in the country , " it said in a statement .
Xinjiang 's Governor , Nur Bekri , went on state television to accuse Rebiya Kadeer – a Uighur businesswoman who was jailed for years in China before being released into exile in the United States – of stoking the violence .
" She had phone conversations with people in China on 5 July in order to incite , and websites ... were used to orchestrate the incitement and spread propaganda , " he said .
It was a charge swiftly denied .
" It is a common practice of the Chinese government to accuse me for any unrest [ in this region ] and His Holiness the Dalai Lama for any unrest in Tibet , " Ms Kadeer , who heads the World Uyghur Congress ( WUC ) , said in a statement .

There were several conflicting reports , not only of the death toll but whether the victims were Uighurs or Han Chinese .
Xinhua said 156 people had been confirmed as killed , and the number was likely to rise .
It quoted a senior security official as saying many of the bodies he had seen were Han .
" It was like a war zone here , with many bodies of ethnic Han people lying on the road , " said Huang Yabo , deputy director of the Urumqi Public Security Bureau .
But in a telephone interview , Alim Seytoff , a spokesman for the WUC , put the death toll closer to 400 .
" Most of the dead are Uighurs , shot and killed by the Chinese security forces , " he said , adding that protesters had been confronted by four kinds of police ( regular , anti-riot , Special Police and the People 's Armed Police ) , who had used " lethal force " to disperse them .
" This is a very dark day in the history of the Uighur people " .
Tensions between the two ethnic groups have risen as the government has encouraged Han migration to Xinjiang .
The Uighurs – who now make up just half of the region 's 20 million people – complain that they are being culturally destroyed , citing Beijing 's plans to raze their ancient Silk Road city of Kashgar as a prime example .
The other grievance is that they are being muscled out of jobs and other economic opportunities and this is particularly pertinent in the main city Urumqi where the Han are in the majority .
It is unclear what prompted the hundreds of Uighurs to take to the streets in protest on Sunday .
There were reports that a June dispute in one of the region 's toy factories between Uighur and Han workers , in which two Uighurs died , was the trigger , but other China - watchers suggested it might be simply pent - up anger at long - standing grievances .
There were reports last night that protests had spread to Kashgar , but analysts were doubtful that they will snowball into a mass movement that will really trouble Beijing .
" The Chinese are very good at putting things down and keeping a lid on them when they really want to , " said Brad Adams , the Asia Director of Human Rights Watch .
The Chinese President Hu Jintao was in Italy yesterday ahead of this week 's G8 summit .
At a press conference after meeting the Italian ceremonial head of state , Giorgio Napolitano , he made no mention of the situation back home .
Heroine or enemy ?
Rebiya Kadeer
The woman the Chinese government accuses of masterminding the Uighur protests over the weekend is a 62 - year - old former laundry lady with 11 children who lives more than 6,000 miles away from the scene of the violence : there is no doubt that Rebiya Kadeer makes an unlikely radical figurehead .
In 1996 , the one - time laundry worker was a successful businesswoman in Xinjiang nicknamed the Millionairess , and a Communist Party member .
But in 1997 , Chinese security forces killed Uighur protesters in the city of Gulja .
Outraged , Kadeer used her considerable influence to mobilise opposition .
Two years later , she was imprisoned .
Released in 2005 , she fled to join her husband in the United States , where she has continued her efforts as president of the World Uyghur Congress .
To the West and her own people , she is a heroic freedom fighter ; to the Chinese government , she is a subversive enemy of the state .
Her supporters insist she had nothing to do with the demonstrations that erupted in Urumqi .
But there is no doubt that she remains a hugely influential voice .
On Tuesday the Israeli navy , in a blatant act of piracy on the high seas , assaulted the vessel ‘ Spirit of Humanity ’ and abducted six British nationals who were taking part in a voyage of mercy .
The tiny unarmed ship was bringing a humanitarian cargo of medicines , children ’s toys and reconstruction materials to the devastated people of Gaza .
Israel ’s murderous 22 - day offensive last December / January left more than 50,000 homes , 800 industrial properties , 200 schools , 39 mosques and two churches damaged or destroyed .
The International Committee of the Red Cross says the 1.5 million Palestinians living in Gaza are “ trapped in despair ” , unable to rebuild their lives because Israel , having wantonly wrecked their civil society and infrastructure , is blocking efforts to bring in the necessary repair materials .
Those on board the Spirit of Humanity were acting in accord with donors ’ pledges of $ 4.5 billion for reconstruction and rehabilitation and US President Obama ’s request to Israel to let those supplies pass .
The mercy ship sailed from Larnaca , Cyprus , with a crew of 21 human rights activists , humanitarian workers and journalists from 11 different countries , including Nobel laureate Mairead Maguire and former US Congresswoman Cynthia McKinney .
In the early hours of Tuesday morning Israeli warships surrounded it and threatened to open fire if the crew did n’t turn back .
When they refused to be intimidated , the Israelis jammed their instrumentation and blocked their GPS , radar , and navigation systems , putting all lives at risk .
The ship had been searched and given security clearance by the Port Authorities in Cyprus before sailing , and posed no threat .
Richard Falk , the United Nations special rapporteur on human rights , says the seizing of the Spirit of Humanity is unlawful and the continuing blockade of Gaza a crime against humanity .
Yes , yes , Mr Falk .
But the question as always is , what is your paralytic , useless organization doing about it ?
Or is hand - wringing all it ’s good for ?
Many here , including myself , immediately wrote to David Miliband , the British foreign secretary , about the outrage .
Two days later I called the Palestine desk at the Foreign Office in London .
The person I spoke to sounded uncomfortable having to trot out the same old gobbledigook about “ working hard to resolve the problem ” and “ doing all we can ” .
He said the six Brits were in Israeli custody and nobody was sure where exactly the incident took place .
However , the vessel was fitted with a SPOT GPS tracker , so the system should have a record of their position when attacked .
The real problem , as I suggested , is that Israel dares to kidnap Brits on the high seas and does n’t fear the consequences – no doubt confident there wo n’t be any .
I was reminded that Israel had issued warnings ( and so had the Foreign Office ) not to travel in that area .
What area ?
Must n’t one travel in international waters ?
The spokesman assured me that progress was being made .
There was “ movement ” on getting humanitarian supplies into Gaza , but I pointed out that nobody had seen any evidence of Israel conforming with international law and Geneva Conventions .
He claimed there was also “ movement ” on halting settlements on occupied territory , although I observed that the Israelis had just OK ’d more illegal building .
I also reminded him about the ramming of the MV Dignity on a similar mission by an Israeli gunboat on 30 December , 53 miles from shore , and how people here were still hopping mad that nothing had been done about it .
The vessel , with 16 on board , was badly damaged and had to limp to a safe Lebanese port .
As far as I know , there was never an offer of compensation and no demand from London .
As usual , somebody else had to pick up the tab for Israel ’s unbridled destruction .
The Dignity had a cargo of 3.5 tonnes of medical supplies , the majority donated by the Cyprus government , and a British skipper and a Greek mate .
It carried fourteen passengers , one of whom was Cynthia McKinney .
There were also two surgeons and a Palestinian physician .
A friend of mine was among them and wrote this chilling account of the attack …
At 04.55 hrs EMT on 30 December , searchlights appeared astern .
There were two Israeli gunboats .
They came abreast , circled and stayed with us .
These boats can do over 45 knots , carry ten tonnes of fuel and have sophisticated weapon systems including Hellfire missiles .
Tracer bullets were fired skywards , forming ellipses , and flares put up .
At 05.30 hrs approximately , one gunboat was playing its searchlight on the port side of ‘ Dignity ’ .
Suddenly there was a tremendous crash at the bow , and then another almost simultaneously , and another on the port beam …
The bow dipped and it seemed the boat was breaking up .
It was dark , the wind force was 4 to 5 and there was a 10 ft sea .
The master shouted ‘ we have been rammed ’ .
It was feared the boat would sink .
He broadcast a Mayday distress signal ; there was no response .
Cynthia McKinney and Caoimhe Butterly could not swim ; the life jackets were rapidly deployed to all .
The hull was taking water but bilge pumps were working .
The first words from a commander of one of the gun boats came over the radio .
First there was the accusation that the ship ’s company was involved with terrorists and that it was subversive .
Then there came the threat to shoot .
The master was forbidden from making for Gaza or further south to El Arish in Egypt .
He was ordered to return to Larnaca – about 160 miles , even though the boat was badly damaged and the Israeli did not know whether there was sufficient fuel , which there was not .
He set a northerly course and the boat stayed buoyant in a moderating sea .
A crew member arranged with the Lebanese authorities for a safe harbour in Sour ( Tyre ) where jubilant crowds thronged the quays .
A UNIFIL ship came out to escort us and the Israeli gunboats , which were following , fell back .
Was there lethal intent ?
A gunboat came out of the black of night with no lights showing whilst a searchlight from the other gun boat displayed our port hull as its target .
It would have approached at about 30 degrees to the Dignity ’s port and at speed .
The intention to sink the Dignity and thus to drown its company was clear .
If the hull had been GRP ( Glass Reinforced Plastic ) it would have shattered and the boat would have sunk like a stone 53 nautical miles off Haifa .
Fortunately , the hull was constructed of marine ply with timber ribs and survived … .
The ship ’s company were repatriated except for a resolute Scot , Theresa McDermott .
She was imprisoned in Ramleh gaol .
When the British Consulate in Israel was contacted for assistance in finding Teresa , staff refused to help locate her saying they could n’t provide assistance to a UK citizen unless she personally requested it .
Teresa was released after six days , her ‘ crime ’ probably being a member of the International Solidarity Campaign like Rachel Corrie before her .
My written question to Mr Miliband was simply this : “ Why is n’t Her Majesty ’s Government providing the mercy ship ‘ Spirit of Humanity ’ with an escort to protect against the unlawful , piratical interference and threat to life by the Israeli navy ?
There have been repeated incidents of harassment , damage , theft and armed aggression on the high seas or in Palestinian waters by the Israeli regime against unarmed vessels ” .
The British government has loudly pledged Royal Navy help to stop the “ smuggling ” of arms to the Gaza resistance but wo n’t protect Gaza ’s fishermen from being fired on by Israeli marauders while trying to earn their living .
And evidently the government ca n’t be bothered to protect our own people going about their lawful business .
But , sure enough , they kicked up an almighty fuss when Iran nabbed 15 British sailors two years ago for allegedly straying into Iranian waters .
For our sins we are saddled with a foreign secretary who calls for Israeli tank crewman Gilad Shalit ’s release but not the release of 11,000 Palestinian civilians – some of them women and children – rotting in Israeli jails .
He even allows the British ambassador to become a dogsbody of the Jewish community in this one - sided campaign .
On 25 June Miliband said : ‘ Today is the third anniversary of the kidnapping of Gilad Shalit .
Both British Ministers and the British Ambassador in Israel have had repeated contact with Gilad ’s family and emphasized our support for Gilad ’s immediate release .
Last September , the Ambassador helped to deliver over 2,000 Jewish New Year cards for Gilad to the ICRC as part of a campaign organized by the UK Jewish community .
I repeat the UK ’s call to Hamas for his immediate , unconditional , and safe release .
We share the Shalit family ’s dismay at Hamas ’s refusal to allow the ICRC access to Gilad .
It ’s shameful that his dismay does n’t extend to the 11,000 Palestinian families .
British people are waking up to the truth about Israel ’s lawlessness .
In the absence of firm action from the British government they are taking reprisals of their own , in the form of boycotts , which has driven Mr Miliband to complain that “ the Government is dismayed that motions calling for boycotts of Israel are being discussed at trade union congresses and conferences this summer ” .
He insists that boycotts “ obstruct opportunities for co-operation and dialogue and serve only to polarise debate further .
Boycotts would only make it harder to achieve the peace that both Palestinians and Israelis deserve and desire ” .
Mr Miliband has n’t learned the lesson of the last 61 years .
And our prime minister - in - waiting , David Cameron ( a Zionist and , like Brown and Blair , a patron of the Jewish National Fund ) , is no different .
He says : “ I think there ’s something else we need to do , which is to say to our academics in this country that boycotts of Israel are completely unacceptable , and I think we also need to say that to the trade unions . ”
Nowadays you have to carefully to pick your way through a veritable obstacle - course of pro-Zionists , Chosen Ones and Israeli stooges that inhabit every nook and cranny in the corridors of power and dominate Britain ’s key defence bodies .
These Israeli flag - wavers seem only too happy for the Israelis to piss on us – and on the rest of the world – while rewarding them with more and more trade and scientific co-operation .

Martial Law and the Militarization of Public Health : The Worldwide H1N1 Flu Vaccination Program
by Michel Chossudovsky
Global Research , July 26 , 2009
GlobalResearch.ca
The flu season is upon us .
Which type will we worry about this year , and what kind of shots will we be told to take ?
Remember the swine flu scare of 1976 ?
That was the year the U.S. government told us all that swine flu could turn out to be a killer that could spread across the nation , and Washington decided that every man , woman and child in the nation should get a shot to prevent a nation - wide outbreak , a pandemic .
Mike Wallace , CBS , 60 Minutes , November 4 , 1979 )
" The federal officials and industry representatives had assembled to discuss a disturbing new study that raised alarming questions about the safety of a host of common childhood vaccines administered to infants and young children .
According to a CDC epidemiologist named Tom Verstraeten , who had analyzed the agency 's massive database containing the medical records of 100,000 children , a mercury - based preservative in the vaccines -- thimerosal -- appeared to be responsible for a dramatic increase in autism and a host of other neurological disorders among children ...
It 's hard to calculate the damage to our country -- and to the international efforts to eradicate epidemic diseases -- if Third World nations come to believe that America 's most heralded foreign - aid initiative is poisoning their children .
It 's not difficult to predict how this scenario will be interpreted by America 's enemies abroad .
( Robert F. Kennedy Jr. , Vaccinations : Deadly Immunity , June 2005 ) " Vaccines are supposed to be making us healthier ; however , in twenty - five years of nursing I have never seen so many damaged , sick kids .
Something very , very wrong is happening to our children . " (
Patti White , School nurse , statement to the House Government Reform Committee , 1999 , quoted in Robert F. Kennedy Jr. , Vaccinations : Deadly Immunity , June 2005 )
On the basis of ... expert assessments of the evidence , the scientific criteria for an influenza pandemic have been met .
I have therefore decided to raise the level of influenza pandemic alert from Phase 5 to Phase 6 .
The world is now at the start of the 2009 influenza pandemic .
...
Margaret Chan , Director - General , World Health Organization ( WHO ) , Press Briefing 11 June 2009 )
" As many as 2 billion people could become infected over the next two years — nearly one - third of the world population " ( World Health Organization as reported by the Western media , July 2009 ) " Swine flu could strike up to 40 percent of Americans over the next two years and as many as several hundred thousand could die if a vaccine campaign and other measures are n't successful . "
( Official Statement of the US Administration , Associated Press , 24 July 2009 ) .
" The U.S. expects to have 160 million doses of swine flu vaccine available sometime in October " , ( Associated Press , 23 July 2009 ) " Vaccine makers could produce 4.9 billion pandemic flu shots per year in the best - case scenario " , Margaret Chan , Director - General , World Health Organization ( WHO ) , 21 July 2009 ) Wealthier countries such as the U.S. and Britain will pay just under $ 10 per dose [ of the H1N1 flu vaccine ] .
...
Developing countries will pay a lower price , ( Business Week , July 2009 )
War without borders , a great depression , a military adventure in the Middle East , a massive concentration of wealth resulting from the restructuring of the global financial system .
The unfolding economic and social dislocations are far - reaching .
People 's lives are destroyed .
The World is at the juncture of the most serious crisis in modern history .
Bankruptcies , mass unemployment , the collapse of social programs , are the untold consequences .
But public opinion must remain ignorant of the causes of the global crisis .
" The worst of the recession is behind us " ;
" There are growing signs of economic recovery " ,
" The Middle East War is a ' Just War ' " , a humanitarian endeavor ,
Coalition forces are involved in " peace - keeping , " we are " fighting terrorism with democracy "
" We must defend ourselves against terrorist attacks "
Figures on civilian deaths are manipulated .
War crimes are concealed .
People are misled on the nature and history of the New World Order .
The real causes and consequences of this Worldwide economic and social collapse remain unheralded .
Realities are turned up side down .
The " real crisis " must be obfuscated through political lies and media disinformation .
It is in the interest of the political powerbrokers and the dominant financial actors to divert public attention from an understanding of the global crisis .
How best to achieve this goal ?
By artificially creating an atmosphere of fear and intimidation which serves to weaken and disarm organized dissent directed against the established economic and political order .
The objective is to undermine all forms of opposition and social resistance .
We are dealing with a diabolical project .
The public must not only remain in the dark .
As the crisis worsens , as people become impoverished , the real causes must be replaced by a set of fictitious relationships .
A crisis based on fake causes is heralded : " the global war on terrorism " is central to misleading the public 's understanding of the Middle East War , which is a battle for the control over extensive reserves of oil and natural gas .
The antiwar movement is weakened .
People are unable to think .
They unequivocally endorse the " war on terrorism " consensus
They accept the political lies .
In their inner consciousness , terrorists are threatening their livelihood .
In this framework , the occurrence of " natural disasters " , " pandemics " , " environmental catastrophes " also plays a useful political role .
It distorts the real causes of the crisis .
It justifies a global public health emergency on humanitarian grounds .
The Worldwide H1N1 swine flu pandemic : Towards a Global Public Health Emergency ?
The Worldwide H1N1 swine flu pandemic serves to mislead public opinion .
The 2009 pandemic , which started in Mexico in April , is timely : it coincides with a deepening economic depression .
It takes place at a time of military escalation .
The epidemiological data is fabricated , falsified and manipulated .
According to the World Health Organization ( WHO ) , an epidemic of worldwide proportions now looms and threatens the livelihood of millions of people .
A " Catastrophic Emergency " is in the making .
The WHO and the US Centre for Disease Control ( CDC ) are authoritative bodies
Why would they lie ?
The information released by these organizations , although subject to statistical errors , could not , by any stretch of the imagination , be falsified or manipulated .
People believe that the public health crisis at a global level is real and that government health officials are " working for the public good . "
Press reports confirm the US government 's intent to implement a mass H1N1 vaccination program in Fall - Winter of 2009 .
A major contract for 160 million doses has been established with Big Pharma , enough to inoculate more than half the US population .
Similar plans are ongoing in other Western countries including France , Canada , the UK .
Volunteers are being recruited to test the swine flu vaccine during the month of August , with a view to implementing a nationwide vaccination program in the Fall .
Manipulating The Data
There is ample evidence , documented in numerous reports , that the WHO 's level 6 pandemic alert is based on fabricated evidence and a manipulation of the figures on mortality and morbidity resulting from the N1H1 swine flu .
The data initially used to justify the WHO 's Worldwide level 5 alert in April 2009 was extremely scanty .
The WHO asserted without evidence that a " global outbreak of the disease is imminent " .
It distorted Mexico 's mortality data pertaining to the swine flu pandemic .
According to the WHO Director General Dr. Margaret Chan in her official April 29 statement : " So far , 176 people have been killed in Mexico " .
From what ?
Where does she get these numbers ?
159 died from influenza out of which only seven deaths , corroborated by lab analysis , resulted from the H1N1 swine flu strain , according to the Mexican Ministry of Health .
Similarly in New York city in April , several hundred children were categorized as having the H1N1 influenza , yet in none of these cases , was the diagnosis corroborated on a laboratory test .
" Dr. Frieden said .
Health officials reached their preliminary conclusion after conducting viral tests on nose or throat swabs from the eight students , which allowed them to eliminate other strains of flu . "
Tests were conducted on school children in Queen's , but the tests were inconclusive : among theses " hundreds of school children " , there were no reports of laboratory analysis leading to a positive identification of the influenza virus .
In fact the reports are contradictory : according to the reports , the Atlanta based CDCP is the " only lab in the country that can positively confirm the new swine flu strain — which has been identified as H1N1 . "
( Michel Chossudovsky , Political Lies and Media Disinformation regarding the Swine Flu Pandemic , Global Research , May 2009 , last quotation is from the New York Times , April 25 , 2009 )
Influenza is a common disease .
Unless there is a thorough lab examination , the identity if the virus cannot be established .
There are numerous cases of seasonal influenza across America , on an annual basis .
" According to the Canadian Medical Association Journal , the flu kills up to 2,500 Canadians and about 36,000 Americans annually .
Worldwide , the number of deaths attributed to the flu each year is between 250,000 and 500,000 " ( Thomas Walkom , The Toronto Star , May 1 , 2009 ) .
What the CDCP and the WHO are doing is routinely us re-categorizing a large number of cases of common influenza as H1N1 swine flu .
" The increasing number of cases in many countries with sustained community transmission is making it extremely difficult , if not impossible , for countries to try and confirm them through laboratory testing .
Moreover , the counting of individual cases is now no longer essential in such countries for monitoring either the level or nature of the risk posed by the pandemic virus or to guide implementation of the most appropriate response measures .
( WHO , Briefing note , 2009 )
The WHO admits that laboratory at a country level testing is often absent , while emphasising that lab confirmation it is not for data collection , with a view to ascertaining the spread of the disease :
A strategy that concentrates on the detection , laboratory confirmation and investigation of all cases , including those with mild illness , is extremely resource - intensive .
In some countries , this strategy is absorbing most national laboratory and response capacity , leaving little capacity for the monitoring and investigation of severe cases and other exceptional events .
...
For all of these reasons , WHO will no longer issue the global tables showing the numbers of confirmed cases for all countries .
However , as part of continued efforts to document the global spread of the H1N1 pandemic , regular updates will be provided describing the situation in the newly affected countries .
WHO will continue to request that these countries report the first confirmed cases and , as far as feasible , provide weekly aggregated case numbers and descriptive epidemiology of the early cases .
( Ibid )
At a June 2009 WHO press conference , the issue of lab testing was raised :
Marion Falco , CNN Atlanta :
My question may be a little basic but if you are not , and so forgive me for that , if you are not requiring testing in the countries that already have well established numbers of cases , then how are you distinguishing between seasonal flu and this particular flu .
I mean how are you going to separate the numbers ?
Dr Fukuda , WHO , Geneva :
It is not that we are recommending not doing any testing at all .
In fact when the guidance comes out , what it will suggest is what countries are to do is tailor down their testing so that they are not trying to test everybody but certainly keeping up testing of some people for exactly the kinds of reasons that you bring up .
When people get sick with an influenza - like illness it will be important for us to know whether is it caused by the pandemic virus or whether is caused by seasonal viruses .
What we are indicating is that if you ratchet down the level of testing we will still be able to figure that out and so we do not need to test everybody for that , but we will continue to recommend some level of testing – at a lower level of people who continue to get sick .
See Transcript of WHO Virtual Press Conference , Dr Keiji Fukuda , Assistant Director - General for Health Security and Environment , WHO , Geneva , July 2009 , emphasis added ) .
" Figure that out " ?
What the foregoing statements by the WHO suggest is that :
1 ) the WHO is not collecting data on the spread of H1N1 based on systematic lab confirmation ;
2 ) the WHO in fact discourages national health officials to conduct detection and laboratory confirmation , while also pressuring the countries ' public health authorities to duly deliver to the WHO on a weekly basis the data on H1N1 cases .
3 ) The WHO in its reporting only refers to " confirmed cases " ( see relevant tables ) .
It does not distinguish between confirmed and non-confirmed case .
It would appear that the " non-confirmed " cases are categorized as confirmed cases and the numbers are numbers then used by the WHO to prove that the disease is spreading .
The swine flu has the same symptoms as seasonal influenza : fever , cough and sore throat .
What is happening is that the widespread incidence of the common flu is being used to generate the reports delivered to the WHO pertaining to the H1N1 swine flu .
Nonetheless , in the tabulated release of country level data , the WHO uses the term : " number of laboratory - confirmed cases " , while also admitting that the cases are , in many cases , not confirmed .
Worldwide Pandemic
The WHO establishes trends on the spread of the disease , essentially using unconfirmed data .
Based on these extrapolations , the WHO is now claiming , in the absence of laboratory confirmation , that " as many as 2 billion people could become infected over the next two years — nearly one - third of the world population . "
In turn , in the US , the Atlanta based Centers for Disease Control ( CDC ) suggests that " swine flu could strike up to 40 percent of Americans over the next two years and as many as several hundred thousand could die if a vaccine campaign and other measures are n't successful . "
( AP , July 24 , 2009 ) .
How did they come up with these numbers ?
The CDC estimate has nothing to do with an assessment of the spread of the H1N1 virus .
It is based on a mechanical pro-rata extrapolation of trends underlying the 1957 pandemic , which resulted in 70,000 deaths in the US .
The presumption here is that the H1N1 flu has the " same transmission path " as the 1957 epidemic .
Creating a Crisis where there is No Crisis
The underlying political intent is to use the WHO level six pandemic to divert public attention from an impending and far - reaching social crisis , which is a largely the consequence of a deep - seated global economic depression .
On the basis of ... expert assessments of the evidence , the scientific criteria for an influenza pandemic have been met .
I have therefore decided to raise the level of influenza pandemic alert from Phase 5 to Phase 6 .
The world is now at the start of the 2009 influenza pandemic .
...
Calling a pandemic is also a signal to the international community .
This is a time where the world 's countries , rich or poor , big or small , must come together in the name of global solidarity to make sure that no countries because of poor resources , no countries ' people should be left behind without help .
... The World Health Organization has been in contact with donor communities , development partners , resource poor countries , and also drug companies as well as vaccine companies .
Margaret Chan , Director - General , World Health Organization ( WHO ) , Press Briefing , 11 June 2009
How best to tame the Nation 's citizens , to rein in people 's resentment in the face of mounting unemployment ?
Create a Worldwide pandemic , instil an atmosphere of anxiety and intimidation , which demobilizes meaningful and organized public action against the programmed enrichment of a social minority .
The flu pandemic is used to foreclose organized resistance against the government 's economic policies in support of the financial elites .
It provides both a pretext and a justification to adopt emergency procedures .
Under the existing legislation in the US , Martial Law , implying the suspension of constitutional government , could be invoked in the case of " A Catastrophic Emergency " including a the H1N1 swine flu pandemic .
Martial Law
Legislation inherited from the Clinton administration , not to mention the post 9/11 Patriot Acts I and II , allow the military to intervene in judicial and civilian law enforcement activities .
In 1996 , legislation was passed which allowed the military to intervene in the case of a national emergency .
In 1999 , Clinton 's Defense Authorization Act ( DAA ) extended those powers ( under the 1996 legislation ) by creating an " exception " to the Posse Comitatus Act , which permits the military to be involved in civilian affairs " regardless of whether there is an emergency " .
( See ACLU at http://www.aclu.org/NationalSecurity/NationalSecurity.cfm?ID=8683&c=24 )
The issue of a pandemic or public health emergency , however , was not explicitly outlined in the Clinton era legislation .
The Katrina disaster ( 2005 ) constitutes a dividing line , a watershed leading de facto to the militarization of emergency relief :
" The disaster that struck New Orleans and the southern Gulf Coast has given rise to the largest military mobilization in modern history on US soil .
Nearly 65,000 US military personnel are now deployed in disaster area , transforming the devastated port city into a war zone , " ( Bill Van Auken , Wsws.org , September 2005 ) .
Hurricanes Katrina ( August 2005 ) and Rita ( September 2005 ) contributed to justifying the role of the Military in natural disasters .
They also contributed to shaping the formulation of presidential directives and subsequent legislation .
President Bush called for the Military to become the " lead agency " in disaster relief :
" ..... The other question , of course , I asked , was , is there a circumstance in which the Department of Defense becomes the lead agency .
Clearly , in the case of a terrorist attack , that would be the case , but is there a natural disaster which -- of a certain size that would then enable the Defense Department to become the lead agency in coordinating and leading the response effort .
That 's going to be a very important consideration for Congress to think about .
( Press Conference , 25 Sept 2005 http://www.globalresearch.ca/index.php?context=viewArticle&code=BUS20050925&articleId=1004 )
Militarization of Public Health : The Avian Flu
The 2005 bird flu crisis followed barely a month after Hurricane Rita .
It was presented to the US public as an issue of National Security .
Following the 2005 outbreak of avian flu , president Bush confirmed that the military would be actively involved in the case of a pandemic , with the authority of detaining large numbers of people :
" I am concerned about avian flu .
I 'm concerned about what an avian flu outbreak could mean for the United States and the world .
... I have thought through the scenarios of what an avian flu outbreak could mean ....
The policy decisions for a president in dealing with an avian flu outbreak are difficult .
...
If we had an outbreak somewhere in the United States , do we not then quarantine that part of the country ?
And how do you , then , enforce a quarantine ?
...
One option is the use of a military that 's able to plan and move .
So that 's why I put it on the table .
I think it 's an important debate for Congress to have .
... But Congress needs to take a look at circumstances that may need to vest the capacity of the president to move beyond that debate .
And one such catastrophe or one such challenge could be an avian flu outbreak .
( White House Press Conference , 4 October , 2005 , emphasis added )
On the day following Bush`s October 4 , 2005 Press Conference , a major piece of legislation was introduced in the US Senate .
The Pandemic Preparedness and Response Act .
While the proposed legislation was never adopted , it nonetheless contributed to building a consensus among key members of the US Senate .
The militarization of public health was subsequently embodied in the John Warner Defense Authorization Act of 2007 .
" Public Health Emergency " and Martial Law : The John Warner Defense Authorization Act of 2007 .
H.R. 5122
New legislation is devised .
The terms " epidemic " , and " public health emergency " are explicitly included in a key piece of legislation , signed into law by President Bush in October 2006 .
Lost in the midst of hundreds of pages , Public Law 109 - 364 , better known as the " John Warner Defense Authorization Act of 2007 " ( H.R.5122 ) includes a specific section on the role of the Military in civilian affairs .
Section 1076 of this legislation entitled " Use of the Armed Forces in Major Public Emergencies " allows the President of the United States the deploy the armed forces and the National Guard across the US , to " restore public order and enforce the laws of the United States " in the case of " a natural disaster , epidemic , or other serious public health emergency " :
SEC .
1076 .
USE OF THE ARMED FORCES IN MAJOR PUBLIC EMERGENCIES .
( a) Use of the Armed Forces Authorized -
(1) IN GENERAL - Section 333 of title 10 , United States Code , is amended to read as follows :
` Sec. 333 .
Major public emergencies ; interference with State and Federal law
` (a ) Use of Armed Forces in Major Public Emergencies - ( 1 ) The President may employ the armed forces , including the National Guard in Federal service , to --
` ( A ) restore public order and enforce the laws of the United States when , as a result of a natural disaster , epidemic , or other serious public health emergency , terrorist attack or incident , or other condition in any State or possession of the United States , the President determines that --
` ( i ) domestic violence has occurred to such an extent that the constituted authorities of the State or possession are incapable of maintaining public order ; and
`( ii ) such violence results in a condition described in paragraph ( 2 ) ; or
` ( B ) suppress , in a State , any insurrection , domestic violence , unlawful combination , or conspiracy if such insurrection , violation , combination , or conspiracy results in a condition described in paragraph ( 2 ) .
` (2 ) A condition described in this paragraph is a condition that --
` ( A ) so hinders the execution of the laws of a State or possession , as applicable , and of the United States within that State or possession , that any part or class of its people is deprived of a right , privilege , immunity , or protection named in the Constitution and secured by law , and the constituted authorities of that State or possession are unable , fail , or refuse to protect that right , privilege , or immunity , or to give that protection ; or
` ( B ) opposes or obstructs the execution of the laws of the United States or impedes the course of justice under those laws .
` (3 ) In any situation covered by paragraph ( 1 ) ( B ) , the State shall be considered to have denied the equal protection of the laws secured by the Constitution .
`(b ) Notice to Congress - The President shall notify Congress of the determination to exercise the authority in subsection ( a ) ( 1 ) ( A ) as soon as practicable after the determination and every 14 days thereafter during the duration of the exercise of that authority . '
( See ext of HR5122 http://thomas.loc.gov/cgi-bin/query/F?c109:6:./temp/~c109bW9vKy:e939907: http://www.govtrack.us/congress/bill.xpd?bill=h109-5122&tab=summary
These far - reaching provisions allow the Armed Forces to override the authority of civilian federal , state and local governments involved in disaster relief and public health .
It also grants the Military a mandate in civilian police functions .
Namely the legislation implies the militarization of law enforcement in the case of a national emergency .
" Catastrophic Emergency " and " Continuity of Government , " : The National Security and Homeland Security Presidential Directive NSPD 51/ HSPD 20
Coinciding with the passage of the John Warner Defense Authorization Act , a National Security Presidential Directive was issued in May 2007 , ( National Security and Homeland Security Presidential DirectiveNSPD 51/HSPD 20 ) .
NSPD 51 / HSPD 20 is a combined National Security Directive emanating from the White House and Homeland Security .
While it is formulated in relation to the domestic " war on terrorism " , it also includes provisions which allow for Martial Law in case of a natural disaster including a flu pandemic .
The thrust and emphasis of NSPD 51 , however , is different from that of Section 1076 of HR 5122 .
It defines the functions of the Department of Homeland Security in the case of a national emergency and its relationship to the White House and the Military .
It also provides the President with sweeping powers to declare a national emergency , without Congressional approval .
The directive establishes procedures for " Continuity of Government " ( COG ) in the case of a " Catastrophic Emergency " .
The latter is defined in NSPD 51 / HSPD 20 ( henceforth referred to as NSPD 51 ) , as " any incident , regardless of location , that results in extraordinary levels of mass casualties , damage , or disruption severely affecting the U.S. population , infrastructure , environment , economy , or government functions . "
" Continuity of Government , " or " COG , " is defined in NSPD 51 as " a coordinated effort within the Federal Government 's executive branch to ensure that National Essential Functions continue to be performed during a Catastrophic Emergency . "
The President shall lead the activities of the Federal Government for ensuring constitutional government .
In order to advise and assist the President in that function , the Assistant to the President for Homeland Security and Counter terrorism ( APHS / CT ) is hereby designated as the National Continuity Coordinator .
The National Continuity Coordinator , in coordination with the Assistant to the President for National Security Affairs ( APNSA ) , without exercising directive authority , shall coordinate the development and implementation of continuity policy for executive departments and agencies .
The Continuity Policy Coordination Committee ( CPCC ) , chaired by a Senior Director from the Homeland Security Council staff , designated by the National Continuity Coordinator , shall be the main day - to - day forum for such policy coordination .
( National Security and Homeland Security Presidential DirectiveNSPD 51/ HSPD 20 , emphasis added )
This Combined Directive NSPD /51 HSPD 20 grants unprecedented powers to the Presidency and the Department of Homeland Security , overriding the foundations of Constitutional government .
NSPD 51 allows the sitting president to declare a �national emergency � without Congressional approval
The adoption of NSPD 51 would lead to the de facto closing down of the Legislature and the militarization of justice and law enforcement .
NSPD 51 grants extraordinary Police State powers to the White House and Homeland Security ( DHS ) , in the event of a " Catastrophic Emergency " .
A flu pandemic or public health emergency is part of the terms of reference of NSPD 51 .
" Catastrophic Emergency " is broadly defined in NSPD 51 as " any incident , regardless of location , that results in extraordinary levels of mass casualties , damage , or disruption severely affecting the U.S. population , infrastructure , environment , economy , or government functions "
" The President shall lead the activities of the Federal Government for ensuring constitutional government .
In order to advise and assist the President in that function , the Assistant to the President for Homeland Security and Counter terrorism ( APHS / CT ) is hereby designated as the National Continuity Coordinator .
The National Continuity Coordinator , in coordination with the Assistant to the President for National Security Affairs ( APNSA ) , without exercising directive authority , shall coordinate the development and implementation of continuity policy for executive departments and agencies .
The Continuity Policy Coordination Committee ( CPCC ) , chaired by a Senior Director from the Homeland Security Council staff , designated by the National Continuity Coordinator , shall be the main day - to - day forum for such policy coordination .
( National Security and Homeland Security Presidential Directive NSPD 51 / HSPD 20 , emphasis added )
The directive acknowledges the overriding power of the military in the case of a national emergency :
The presidential directive " Shall not be construed to impair or otherwise affect ... the authority of the Secretary of Defense over the Department of Defense , including the chain of command for military forces from the President , to the Secretary of Defense , to the commander of military forces , or military command and control procedures " .
Since their enactment two years ago , neither the John Warner Defense Authorization
Act nor NSPD 51 have been the object of media debate or discussion .
NSPD 51 and / or the John Warner H.R.5122 could be invoked at short notice following the declaration of a national health emergency and a nationwide forced vaccination program .
The hidden agenda consists in using the threat of a pandemic and / or the plight of a natural disaster as a pretext to establish military rule , under the facade of a " functioning democracy " .
Vaccination : From H5N1 to H1N1
A nationwide flu vaccination program has been in the pipeline since 2005 .
According to the Wall Street Journal ( Oct 1 , 2005 ) , the Bush administration had asked Congress for an estimated $ 6 - 10 billion " to stockpile vaccines and antiviral medications as part of its plans to prepare the U.S. for a possible flu pandemic . "
A large part of this budget , namely 3.1 billion was used under the Bush administration to stockpile the antiviral drug oseltamivir ( Tamiflu ) , of which the intellectual property rights belong to Gilead Science Inc , a company headed by Don Rumsfeld prior to becoming Secretary of Defense under the Bush administration .
Consistent with its role as " lead agency " , more than half of the money earmarked by the Bush administration for the program was handed over to the Pentagon .
In other words , what we are dealing with is a process of militarization of the civilian public health budget .
Social sector budgets are now being transferred to the Department of Defense .
The money for a public health program is controlled by the Department of Defense , under the rules of DoD procurement .
" The US Senate voted [ September 3 , 2005 ] yesterday to provide $ 4 billion for antiviral drugs and other measures to prepare for a feared influenza pandemic , but whether the measure would clear Congress was uncertain .
The Senate attached the measure to a $ 440 billion defense - spending bill for 2006 , according to the Associated Press ( AP ) .
But the House included no flu money in its version of the defense bill , and a key senator said he would try to keep the funds out of the House - Senate compromise version .
The Senate is expected to vote on the overall bill next week .
Almost $ 3.1 billion of the money would be used to stockpile the antiviral drug oseltamivir ( Tamiflu ) , and the rest would go for global flu surveillance , development of vaccines , and state and local preparedness , according to a Reuters report .
The government currently has enough oseltamivir to treat a few million people , with a goal of acquiring enough to treat 20 million "

The threat of the H5N1 bird flu pandemic in 2005 resulted in multibillion dollar earnings for the pharmaceutical and biotech industry .
In this regard , a number of major pharmaceutical companies including GlaxoSmithKline , Sanofi-Aventis , California based Chiron Corp , BioCryst Pharmaceuticals Inc , Novavax and Wave Biotech , Swiss pharmaceutical giant Roche Holding , had already positioned themselves .
In 2005 , .a Maryland - based biotechnology company MedImmune which produces " an inhaled flu vaccine " had positioned itself to develop a vaccine against the H5N1 avian flu .
Although it had no expertise in the avian flu virus , one of the major actors in the vaccine business , on contract to the Pentagon , was Bioport , a company part owned by the Carlyle Group , closely linked to the Bush Cabinet with Bush Senior on its board of directors .
Forced Vaccination under a Public Health Emergency ?
Multibillion Financial Bonanza for the BioTech Conglomerates
The 2005 bird flu hoax was in many regards a dress rehearsal .
The 2009 H1N1 pandemic is a much larger multibillion dollar operation A select number of biotech and pharmaceutical companies have been involved in negotiations behind closed doors with the WHO and the US Administration .
Key agencies are the Atlanta based Center for Disease Control and the Food and Drug Administration ( FDA ) which have close ties to the pharmaceutical industry .
The conflicts of interest of these agencies is brought to light in Robert F. Kennedy Jr.'s detailed study entitled Vaccinations : Deadly Immunity , June 2005 :
" The story of how government health agencies colluded with Big Pharma to hide the risks of thimerosal from the public is a chilling case study of institutional arrogance , power and greed .
I was drawn into the controversy only reluctantly .
As an attorney and environmentalist who has spent years working on issues of mercury toxicity , I frequently met mothers of autistic children who were absolutely convinced that their kids had been injured by vaccines .
...
" The elementary grades are overwhelmed with children who have symptoms of neurological or immune - system damage , " Patti White , a school nurse , told the House Government Reform Committee in 1999 .
" Vaccines are supposed to be making us healthier ; however , in twenty - five years of nursing I have never seen so many damaged , sick kids .
Something very , very wrong is happening to our children . "
Robert F. Kennedy Jr , Vaccinations : Deadly Immunity , June 2005 .
The WHO is planning for the production of 4.9 billion dose , enough to inoculate a large share of the World 's population .
Big Pharma including Baxter , GlaxoSmithKline , Novartis , Sanofi-Aventis and AstraZeneca have signed procurement contracts with some 50 governments .
( Reuters , July 16 , 2009 ) .
For these companies , compulsory vaccination is a highly lucrative undertaking :
" The WHO has refused to release the Minutes of a key meeting of an advisory vaccine group " packed with executives from Baxter , Novartis and Sanofi " that recommended compulsory vaccinations in the USA , Europe and other countries against the artificial H1N1 " swine flu " virus this autumn .
In an email this morning , a WHO spokesperson claimed there are no Minutes of the meeting that took place on July 7th in which guidelines on the need for worldwide vaccinations that WH0 adopted this Monday were formulated and in which Baxter and other Pharma executives participated
Under the International Health Regulations , WHO guidelines have a binding character on all of WHO 's 194 signatory countries in the event of a pandemic emergency of the kind anticipated this autumn when the second more lethal wave of the H1N1 virus " which is bioengineered to resemble the Spanish flu virus " emerges .
In short : WHO has the authority to force everyone in those 194 countries to take a vaccine this fall at gunpoint , impose quarantines and restrict travel . "
( Jane Burgermeister , WHO moves forward in secrecy to accomplish forced vaccination and population agenda , Global Research , July 2009 ) .
On May 19th , the WHO Director General and senior officials met behind closed doors with the representatives of some 30 pharmaceutical companies .
" In a perfect world the planet 's leading pharmaceutical companies could produce 4.9 billion H1N1 swine flu vaccinations over the course of the next year .
This is the World Health Organization 's latest assessment .
WHO Director - General Dr. Margaret Chan met with 30 pharmaceutical companies on Tuesday and briefed reporters on a WHO plan to secure vaccinations for poor countries who lack sufficient infrastructure to fight a possible pandemic .
( Digital Journal , 19 May 2009 )
According to recent report in Business Week , " Wealthier countries such as the U.S. and Britain will pay just under $ 10 per dose , the same price for the seasonal flu vaccine .
Developing countries will pay a lower price , ( Business Week , July 2009 ) .
The WHO suggests that the 4.9 billion doses will not suffice and that a second inoculation will be required .
4,9 billion doses at about ten dollars ( $ 10.00 ) a shot and somewhat less in the developing countries , represents a windfall profit bonanza for Big Pharma of the order of 400 billion dollars in a single year .
And the WHO claims that one dose per person may not suffice ...
Dangerous Life Threatening Vaccine : Who owns the Patent ?
While the production has been entrusted to a select number of companies , it would appear that the intellectual property rights belong to Illinois based pharmaceutical giant Baxter .
Baxter is central in the negotiations between the US Administration and the World Health Organization ( WHO ) .
Moreover , " a full year before any reported case of the current alleged H1N1 " Baxter had filed for a patent for the H1N1 vaccine :
Baxter Vaccine Patent Application US 2009/0060950 A1 .
( See William Engdahl , Now legal immunity for swine flu vaccine makers , Global Research , July 2009 ) .
Their application : states :
“ the composition or vaccine comprises more than one antigen ... such as influenza A and influenza B in particular selected from of one or more of the human H1N1 , H2N2 , H3N2 , H5N1 , H7N7 , H1N2 , H9N2 , H7N2 , H7N3 , H10N7 subtypes , of the pig flu H1N1 , H1N2 , H3N1 and H3N2 subtypes , of the dog or horse flu H7N7 , H3N8 subtypes or of the avian H5N1 , H7N2 , H1N7 , H7N3 , H13N6 , H5N9 , H11N6 , H3N8 , H9N2 , H5N2 , H4N8 , H10N7 , H2N2 , H8N4 , H14N5 , H6N5 , H12N5 subtypes . "
The application further states , “ Suitable adjuvants can be selected from mineral gels , aluminium hydroxide , surface active substances , lysolecithin , pluronic polyols , polyanions or oil emulsions such as water in oil or oil in water , or a combination thereof .
Of course the selection of the adjuvant depends on the intended use .
E.g. toxicity may depend on the destined subject organism and can vary from no toxicity to high toxicity . "
With no legal liability , could it be that Baxter is preparing to sell hundreds of millions of doses containing highly toxic aluminium hydroxide as adjuvant ?

National Emergency Centers Establishment Act : H.R. 645
If Martial Law or a National emergency were to be adopted in the context of a Public Health emergency , what we would be dealing with is the " forced vaccination " of millions of people as well as the establishment of internment facilities for people who have been quarantined .
In this regard , it is worth noting that in January 2009 , a piece of legislation entitled the National Emergency Centers Establishment Act ( HR 645 ) was introduced in the US Congress .
The bill calls for the establishment of six national emergency centers in major regions in the US to be located on existing military installations , which could be used to quarantine people in the case of a public health emergency or forced vaccination program .
The bill goes far beyond previous legislation ( including H.R 5122 ) .
The stated purpose of the " national emergency centers " is to provide " temporary housing , medical , and humanitarian assistance to individuals and families dislocated due to an emergency or major disaster . "
In actuality , what we are dealing with are FEMA internment camps .
HR 645 states that the camps can be used to " meet other appropriate needs , as determined by the Secretary of Homeland Security . "
( Michel Chossudovsky , Preparing for Civil Unrest in America Legislation to Establish Internment Camps on US Military Bases , Global Research , March 2009 )
There has been virtually no press coverage of HR 645 , which is currently being discussed by several congressional committees .
These " civilian facilities " on US military bases are to be established in cooperation with the US Military .
Modeled on Guantanamo , what we are dealing with is the militarization of FEMA internment facilities .
Once a person is arrested and interned in a FEMA camp located on a military base , that person would in all likelihood , under a public health emergency , fall under the de facto jurisdiction of the Military : civilian justice and law enforcement including habeas corpus would no longer apply .
HR 645 could be used , were it to be adopted , in the case of public health emergency .
It obviously bears a direct relationship to the economic crisis and the likelihood of mass protests across America .
It constitutes a further move to militarize civilian law enforcement , repealing the Posse Comitatus Act .
In the words of Rep. Ron Paul :
" ... the fusion centers , militarized police , surveillance cameras and a domestic military command is not enough ...
Even though we know that detention facilities are already in place , they now want to legalize the construction of FEMA camps on military installations using the ever popular excuse that the facilities are for the purposes of a national emergency .
With the phony debt - based economy getting worse and worse by the day , the possibility of civil unrest is becoming a greater threat to the establishment .
One need only look at Iceland , Greece and other nations for what might happen in the United States next . "
( Daily Paul , September 2008 , emphasis added )
The proposed internment camps should be seen in relation to the broader process of militarization of civilian institutions .
The construction of internment camps predates the introduction of HR 645 ( Establishment of Emergency Centers ) in January 2009 .
" Military Civil Support " : The Role of US Northern Command in the Case of a Flu Pandemic
US Northern Command has a mandate to support and oversee civilian institutions in the case of a National Emergency .
In addition to defending the nation , U.S. Northern Command provides defense support of civil authorities in accordance with U.S. laws and as directed by the President or Secretary of Defense .
Military assistance is always in support of a lead federal agency , such as the Federal Emergency Management Agency ( FEMA ) .
Military civil support includes domestic disaster relief operations that occur during fires , hurricanes , floods , and earthquakes .
Support also includes counter - drug operations and consequence management assistance , such as would occur after a terrorist event employing a weapon of mass destruction .
Generally , an emergency must exceed the management capabilities of local , state and federal agencies before U.S. Northern Command becomes involved .
In providing civil support , the command operates through subordinate Joint Task Forces .
( See US Northcom website at http://www.northcom.mil/index.cfm?fuseaction=s.who_civil ) .
The Katrina and Rita hurricane disasters played a key role in shaping the role of US Northern Command in " military civil support " activities .
The emergency procedures were closely coordinated by US Northern Command out of the Peterson Air Force Base , together with Homeland Security , which oversees FEMA .
During Hurricane Rita ( September 2005 ) , US Northern Command Headquarters was directly in control of the movement of military personnel and hardware in the Gulf of Mexico , overriding , as in the case of Katrina , the actions of civilian bodies .
The entire operation was under the jurisdiction of the military rather than FEMA .
( Michel Chossudovsky , US Northern Command and Hurricane Rita , Global Research , September 24 , 2005 )
Northern Command would , as part of its mandate in the case of a national emergency , oversee a number of civilian functions .
In the words of Preident Bush at the height of the Rita hurricane , " the Government and the US military needed broader authority to help handle major domestic crises such as hurricanes . "
Homeland Security Secretary Michael Chertoff subsequently classified Hurricane Rita as an " incident of national significance , " which justified the activation of a so - called " National Response Plan " ( NRP ) .
( For further details , consult the complete document at http://www.dhs.gov/interweb/assetlibrary/NRPbaseplan.pdf
Within the broader framework of " Disaster Relief " , Northern Command has , in the course of the last two years , defined a mandate in the eventuality of a public health emergency or a flu pandemic .
The emphasis is on the militarization of public health whereby NORTHCOM would oversee the activities of civilian institutions involved in health related services
According Brig . Gen. Robert Felderman , deputy director of USNORTHCOM ’s Plans , Policy and Strategy Directorate : “ USNORTHCOM is the global synchronizer – the global coordinator – for pandemic influenza across the combatant commands ” ( emphasis added )
( See Gail Braymen , USNORTHCOM contributes pandemic flu contingency planning expertise to trilateral workshop , USNORTHCOM , April 14 , 2008 , See also USNORTHCOM .
Pandemic Influenza Chain Training ( U ) pdf )
“ Also , the United States in 1918 had the Spanish influenza .
We were the ones who had the largest response to [ a pandemic ] in more recent history .
So I discussed what we did then , what we expect to have happen now and the numbers that we would expect in a pandemic influenza ”
The potential number of fatalities in the United States in a modern pandemic influenza could reach nearly two million , according to Felderman .
Not only would the nation ’s economy suffer , but the Department of Defense would still have to be ready and able to protect and defend the country and provide support of civil authorities in disaster situations .
While virtually every aspect of society would be affected , “ the implications for Northern Command will be very significant . ”
“ [ A pandemic would have ] a huge economic impact , in addition to the defense - of - our - nation impact , ” Felderman said .
The United States is n’t alone in preparing for such a potential catastrophe .
( Gail Braymen , op cit )
It is worth noting that Northern Command ( USNORTHCOM ) has developed , over the past few years , a clearly defined mandate in the eventuality of a flu pandemic .
Also of relevance , was the repatriation of combat units from the war theater to assist US Northern Command in the case of a national emergency including a flu pandemic .
In the last months of the Bush administration , the Department of Defense ordered the recall of the 3rd Infantry 's 1st Brigade Combat Team from Iraq .
The BCT combat unit was attached to US Army North , the Army 's component of US Northern Command ( USNORTHCOM ) .
The 1st BCT and other combat units would be called upon to perform specific military functions in the case of a national emergency or natural disaster including a public health emergency :
" The Army Times reports that the 3rd Infantry ’s 1st Brigade Combat Team is returning from Iraq to defend the Homeland , as " an on - call federal response force for natural or manmade emergencies and disasters , including terrorist attacks . "
The BCT unit has been attached to US Army North , the Army 's component of US Northern Command ( USNORTHCOM ) .

Biochemical Techniques Take On Combinatorial Problems

Readers of Dr. Dobb's Journal are accustomed to solving mathematical problems using " computers " -- that is , boxes full of semiconductors , buses , RAM , and related gizmos .
Consequently , it 's hard to believe that a large class of difficult and intensely mathematical problems might be best solved not by pushing electrons through wires in a computer laboratory , but by mixing solutions in test tubes in a molecular - biology laboratory .
Yet that is exactly the prospect suggested by Leonard Adleman , who applied the laboratory tools of modern molecular biology to the bogeyman problems of computer science ( see " Molecular Computation of Solutions to Combinatorial Problems , " by Leonard M. Adleman , Science , November 11 , 1994 ) .
There is a class of computationally intractable problems known as " NP . "
Problems in this set include the well - known Traveling Salesman problem and problems such as the Hamiltonian Circuit , Bin Packing , Graph - 3 - colorability , Knapsack , and Generalized Instant Insanity ( remember the Parker Brothers puzzle ? ) problems .
Computer scientists and mathematicians have discovered many such instances of problems whose solution requires taking a ( possibly large ) number of objects and finding an arrangement that has a particular property or satisfies a requirement .
Given the solution , you can quickly verify that it solves the problem , but there is no known " fast " way to find the solution .
A simple example is the Knapsack Problem : From a given finite set of integers , find a subset whose sum is a given x .
Exhaustive search is a practical solution for small sets , but as the size of the set increases , the time required to find a solution increases faster than any power of the size .
However , testing a candidate subset is easy :
It requires no more additions than there are integers in the starting set .
To be admitted to the NP club , a problem must be proven equivalent to a problem already in NP .
" Equivalent " means , casually speaking , that any instance of the new problem can be easily transformed into an instance of some NP problem and vice versa .
This admission criterion guarantees that all problems in NP are about equally hard :
If a quick way were found to solve Traveling Salesman problems , for example , then someone with a tough instance of the Knapsack problem could transform it into an instance of the Traveling Salesman Problem , solve it , and transform the solution back into the answer to the Knapsack problem .
Thus , all members of NP stand or fall together .
Traditional estimates of these problems ' difficulty assume that the problem is attacked on a conventional computer .
The analysis of , say , a Knapsack problem might go something like this :
There are 100 integers in the whole set , so there are 2100 ( =1030 ) possible subsets .
If I have to examine 10 percent of these subsets , using a million computers , each of which can examine a million subsets per second , then it will take 1017 seconds , or three billion years .
In a dramatic departure from conventional thinking , Adleman attacked a problem in NP using techniques found in molecular biology laboratories .
( See the accompanying text box entitled " DNA Basics " for more background information . )
He synthesized DNA molecules that represent randomly guessed answers , then searched through a huge number of them to pick out any correct answer .
The number of guesses that can be tested with this approach is limited not by time and computing power , but by the number of DNA molecules you can handle .
Since a gram of DNA might contain 1018 smallish molecules , the millions of computers testing millions of subsets start looking puny in comparison .
Adleman solved the Directed Hamiltonian Path Problem : Given a map showing many cities and many one - way roads connecting cities , find the shortest itinerary that starts at City A , ends at City Z , and passes through every other city exactly once .
In Adleman 's approach , cities are represented by random " 20 - mers . "
That is , each city is assigned a sequence of 20 bases selected at random from the set { A , T , G , C} ; see Figure 1 .
Roads are represented by 20 - mers derived from the sequences of the cities they connect .
For example , a road from City J to City D would be represented by a 20 - mer whose first 10 bases are complementary to the first 10 bases of City J and whose last 10 bases are complementary to the last 10 bases of City D ; see Figure 2 .
An exception is made for roads starting at the starting city or ending at the ending city ( cities A and Z , in this example ) .
These roads are extended by an extra 10 bases , so as to contain the full 20 - base sequence complementary to the starting or ending city .
Using DNA - manipulation techniques developed by biologists , Adleman manufactured a bunch of " city " 20 - mers and a bunch of " road " 20 - mers , and mixed them all together in a pot .
Because complementary DNA strands tend to stick together , a typical Road JD 20 - mer will have its beginning half stuck to the beginning half of a City J 20 - mer , and its ending half stuck to the ending half of a City D 20 - mer ; see Figure 3 .
The other half of the City D 20 - mer will probably be stuck to some road that begins at City D , and so forth .
Next , Adleman added to this soup an enzyme that repairs " nicks " in DNA .
This enzyme finds the places where the ends of two road 20 - mers touch ( in the middle of a city 20 - mer ) and welds the two ends together .
( It also welds together the touching ends of city 20 - mers . )
The resulting DNA strands represent lists of roads that you can legally travel , called " itineraries . "
Most itineraries look nothing like the answer to the problem :
Some contain only a couple of roads , and some traverse one part of the map many times over without ever visiting some other part .
Still , there was a chance that one of these DNA strands might represent the solution to the Directed Hamiltonian Graph problem , and Adleman had to find it .
He knew the length of the desired molecule :
The number of roads taken must be one less than the number of cities on the map .
Molecular biologists routinely use electrophoresis to separate DNA molecules by length :
When an electric field pushes DNA molecules through a gel , longer molecules move more slowly .
Adleman cut out the part of the gel containing strands of the desired length , extracted the DNA from the gel , and threw away everything else .
It was also obvious that all the molecules that do n't pass through a given city could be discarded .
Adleman did this using " City J " 20 - mers attached to magnetic beads .
These beads were mixed with the DNA from the gel , and time was allowed for itineraries that pass through City J to stick to the complementary sequence on the beads .
He fished them out with a magnet and discarded everything else .
By warming and changing the salinity of the solution , he unstuck the itinerary strands from the beads , giving a solution of right - sized itineraries that pass through City J .
Repeating this process for every city on the map leaves you with ( if anything ) an itinerary with exactly the required properties :
It passes through every city ; it can't pass through any city twice , because it 's not long enough to hold the extra road ; and the special handling of roads starting and ending at cities A and Z guarantees that City A must be first and City Z , last in the itinerary .
Thus , if there 's a molecule there , it 's the answer .
A technique called the " Polymerase Chain Reaction " ( PCR ) can be used to duplicate many million - fold a single , special DNA sequence hidden in a soup of other DNA .
PCR requires only that you know the sequence of the first several and last several bases of the sequence to be duplicated .
Since you know the first 20 bases of the desired itinerary ( because it starts at City A ) and the last 20 bases ( complementary to City Z ) , you can use PCR to make an abundance of the desired strand .
To find where City J appears in the itinerary , PCR duplicates just the sequence from City A to City J , and the size of the resulting strands is measured by electrophoresis .
Computer science is full of NP problems ; usually , they relate to optimization .
Typically , these problems need to be solved in seconds , and approximate solutions are usually acceptable .
It 's hard to imagine that very many of these problems would warrant interfacing a computer to an " NP coprocessor " with pumps , reagents , glassware , heaters , and gels .
The small problem ( a map with seven cities ) on which Adleman demonstrated this technique took a week of lab work , and even though a substantially larger problem probably would n't take appreciably longer and the procedure could be automated to speed it up by a couple orders of magnitude , this technique seems destined for use on large , nonurgent problems with very valuable answers .
Where are such problems found ?
Cryptology is one place .
( It 's no coincidence that Adleman is the " A " in the RSA public - key encryption algorithm . )
For decades , cryptologists have been mining NP for problems around which ciphers might be built .
The best pedigree for a cryptographic protocol is proof that breaking it is equivalent to solving some general problem in NP .
But Adleman has knocked off the rails the traditional calculus of security that applies to these systems , and arguments that once postulated processors and microseconds may soon revolve around gallons of vat capacity .

DNA Basics
Deoxyribonucleic acid ( DNA ) is a long , thin , chain - like molecule made by connecting smaller molecules called " bases " ( see Figure 4 ) .
Four different bases -- typically called A , T , C , and G - - occur .
The number of bases in a DNA molecule can range from a mere handful to tens of millions .
A DNA molecule can be specified by giving its sequence of bases in the order in which they appear , such as " ATCCATTAG .... "
Any sequence of bases is possible .
There is directionality in a DNA strand , so the molecule AAAAATTTTT is not just TTTTTAAAAA viewed upside - down .
The A bases have a gentle attraction for the T bases , and the C bases for the G bases , such that two DNA molecules whose sequences " fit together " ( see Figure 5 ) will tend to stick together .
( This is the famous " double helix " configuration , though I ignore the helicity in my diagrams . )
Two DNA sequences are called " complementary " if each equals the other in reverse order with As , Ts , Cs , and Gs replaced by Ts , As , Gs , and Cs , respectively .
Over the past few decades , molecular biologists have discovered enzymes ( large protein molecules that occur in cells ) that perform such functions as cutting DNA molecules where certain sequences occur , assembling DNA molecules complementary to existing DNA molecules , linking separate DNA molecules into longer molecules , and more .
These enzymes are now routinely harvested from bacteria and used in molecular - biology laboratories .
The typical cell in your body contains around 7 billion base pairs of DNA , with a total length of about 2 meters -- one meter from each parent .
This DNA occurs in 46 pieces called " chromosomes , " and constitutes a vast library of recipes used in conducting the business of a cell .
The DNA you got from each of your parents is thought to contain recipes for around 100,000 different proteins .
A protein is a string of amino acids selected from a suite of 20 , and the recipe for a protein is simply an ordered list of amino acids .
Three consecutive DNA bases specify one amino acid in the protein , and the translation from DNA triplets to amino acids is done very tidily using a lookup table that also contains " end- of - protein " triplets .
The replication of DNA ( for dividing cells ) and its translation into proteins are performed by complex proteins built ( naturally ) from recipes encoded in the DNA .
A large part of the business of your body is carried out by proteins , and much of the rest is carried out by molecules built by proteins .
Multiplying the estimated 100,000 protein recipes ( genes ) by the typical length of a gene ( a few thousand base pairs ) gives a few hundred million - - a small fraction of the total amount of DNA in the cell .
It is presently unknown what function , if any , is served by all that extra DNA , but much of it consists of sequences that are stylistically different from protein recipes .

If Amazon.com ’s censoring of books concerning sexuality was n’t bad enough , Google ’s spokeswoman announced today that GoogleAds has “ decided to disallow ads for abortion services , such as , abortion clinics , in the following markets : Germany , Poland , Hong Kong , Taiwan , Singapore , Malaysia , Philippines , Indonesia , Argentina , Brazil , Mexico , Peru , Italy , and Spain . ”
That ’s quite the list !
GoogleAds ’ spokeswomen believes she is being fair , just , representative of her clientele .
She writes , “ We decided to amend our policy , creating a level playing field and enabling religious associations to place ads on abortion in a factual way . ”
So while religious associations are allowed to provide concocted factual accounts of abortion , no clinic is allowed to advertise their conselling services , which , for once , can do some good by providing a safe space for women to learn about abortion , other options available to her , and sound medical advice .
I am still riled up about Amazon.com removing “ adult ” books from their rankings –not the least because “ adult ” is not - so - subtle code for LGBT and romance books .
Amazon.com put on a face of goodwill , too , much like GoogleAds .
Meta Writer , who has created a page that lists all of Amazon ’s “ banned books , ” posts a letter he received from Amazon.com
In consideration of our entire customer base , we exclude “ adult ” material from appearing in some searches and best seller lists .
Since these lists are generated using sales ranks , adult materials must also be excluded from that feature .
Hence , if you have further questions , kindly write back to us .

But we did have water and darned near steady tropical winds .
So we rigged up — by the hundreds — a simple , inexpensive and practical washer that was directly powered by the breeze .
Build a Cheap Washing Machine
This straightforward machine was nothing but a four - bladed wooden propeller bolted to a pipe which , in turn , was connected to a simple set of swivel joints .
( Click " Enlarge Image " to see a blown - up version of the diagram to this machine . )
As the wind blew and the pipe turned and the joints rotated , they moved a plunger ( which was just a length of conduit or broomstick with a round board bolted to its bottom ) up and down inside a chopped - off 55 - gallon drum .
Some of the fellows who had nothing better to do and who were stationed in areas where dirt , bugs or other droppings could fall into their washers fancied their machines up with tops .
These covers were usually made in two pieces from plywood or sheet metal and either just sat on the open end of the drum or were hinged to the side of the barrel so that they could be flopped back when the washers were loaded and unloaded .

Operation of the wind - powered machines was extremely uncomplicated , You just tossed in your grimy uniforms , poured in enough water to cover them , added soap , fared the sawhorse mounted prop into the breeze and went about your business .
As the wind blew , the agitator churned up and down .
And when you returned a couple of hours later , you had clean clothes ready for rinsing .
Some of the folks now trying to homestead out beyond the powerlines might want to try reviving the idea today .
Against a tough Honduras side and a crowd urging their rivals on , the USA found the going more difficult , but eventually prevailed in a 2 - 0 win .
By Kyle McCarthy
WASHINGTON , D.C. – Santino Quaranta had waited for this day for a long time .
It was worth the wait .
Quaranta scored his first international goal in the 75th minute in front of his home fans as the United States defeated Honduras 2 - 0 at R.F.K .
Stadium to all but seal top spot in Group B .
Brian Ching added the second four minutes later as the United States benefited from the second half insertion of Benny Feilhaber and Charlie Davies to spark itself to the victory it needed to ensure an easier path to the semifinals .
First Half
Neither side really matched the intensity of the crowd in the opening stages as most of the play came and went through midfield without any cutting thrust .
Honduras probably started the better of the two sides , but the Americans were the first to truly carve open a chance on 15 minutes .
Tidy midfield play allowed Robbie Rogers to steam into the left side of the penalty area and pull a cross back towards the top of the penalty area .
Santino Quaranta latched onto it , but could only do so with a meager diving header that he directed wide .
As the United States preferred the more intricate moves , Honduras looked to play the ball over the top to exploit their pace advantage .
Walter Martinez nearly nipped in after 19 minutes , but Troy Perkins responded quickly off his line to snuff out the danger .
Plucky play from Kyle Beckerman kept a faltering attack alive soon afterwards .
Beckerman did one better by regaining his balance and slipping a pass through for Brian Ching , but Ching could n't get a handle on the deft pass and let the chance go begging from eight yards .
If Ching could have converted , Martinez definitely should have on 30 minutes .
Martinez somehow remained onside and latched onto a long ball behind the U.S. defense .
Instead of opting for the exposed far post , Martinez tried for the near post and could only find side netting .
By now , the match had perked up considerably from a ragged start and the Americans carved out their own gilt - edged chance minutes later .
Heath Pearce overlapped the active Robbie Rogers on the left and swung a dangerous ball into the penalty area .
Freddy Adu had all the space and time in the world to pick a spot with his header , but could only direct his header straight into Donis Escober 's grateful arms .
Second Half
After a frantic end to the first half , the opening stages of the second stanza settled considerably as a Briang Ching side - volley over the bar from a half chance marked the only action in anger .
Honduras continued to threaten on the break .
Carlos Costly picked the ball off Martinez 's foot as the two Hondurans broke out .
Costly surged into the penalty area only for Chad Marshall to slide in with a fine tackle to snuff out the danger .
U.S. head coach Bob Bradley sent Benny Feilhaber and Charlie Davies on with 25 minutes to play in an attempt to spark some life into the offense .
Davies nearly did so on 71 minutes , albeit through a route that evoked memories of Carlos Hermosillo in Foxboro some years ago rather than a direct path towards goal .
Escober dallied too long on the ball and Davies blocked his attempted clearance .
Escober hurriedly rushed back to ensure the scuffed attempt did n't cross the line .
Quaranta wrote all of the headlines with his fine first - time strike with a quarter of an hour to play .
Beautiful buildup play with touches from Rogers , Feilhaber , Ching and Davies worked the ball from left to right with Davies deftly laying off into space for Quaranta to slide home .
Ching made the points safe four minutes later when Feilhaber played a free kick quickly out to Steve Cherundolo on the right side .
Cherundolo 's cross found the poorly marked Ching in the middle and the target forward directed his header home .
FRIDAY , Aug. 21 , 2009 ( HealthDay News ) -- Marijuana may buffer the brain against the damages of binge drinking , a new study suggests .
Researchers from the University of California , San Diego , used high - tech scans to compare microscopic changes in brain white matter in teens aged 16 to 19 who were divided into three groups : binge drinkers ( boys who consume five or more drinks at one sitting , and girls who have four or more drinks ) ; binge drinkers who also smoked marijuana ; and a control group with little or no experience with either alcohol or drugs .
As expected , the binge drinkers showed signs of white matter damage in all eight brain regions examined by the researchers .
But the binge drinkers / marijuana users had less damage in seven out of the eight brain regions than the binge drinkers did .
And compared to the control group , the binge drinkers / marijuana users had more white matter damage in only three regions .
The researchers wrote that brain white matter tracts were " more coherent in adolescents who binge drink and use marijuana than in adolescents who report only binge drinking . "
They said it 's " possible that marijuana may have some neuroprotective properties in mitigating alcohol - related oxidative stress or excitotoxic cell death . "
The study appears in the current issue of the journal Neurotoxicology and Teratology .
" This study suggests that not only is marijuana safer than alcohol , it may actually protect against some of the damage that booze causes , " Steve Fox , director of state campaigns for the Marijuana Policy Project , said in a news release from the project .
" It 's far better for teens not to drink or smoke marijuana , but our nation 's leaders send a dangerous message by defending laws that encourage the use of alcohol over marijuana , " he added .

Never mind swine flu , these Caribbean pigs are in the swim
Their species has spread a virus that is sparking panic around the world .
But any thoughts of swine flu is water off a pig's back to these Caribbean creatures .
These feral pigs are in the swim and hugely popular with locals and tourists when they take a daily turn in the crystal clear sea .
Bay of pigs : A pig cools down off the island of Big Major Spot in the Bahamas
Underwater photographer Eric Cheng stumbled across the unusual residents during a diving expedition .
' We were in the southern Bahamas to photograph oceanic white - tip sharks , ' says the 33 - year - old .
' Our captain , Jim Abernethy , heard there were pigs on Big Major so we decided to go and check it out .
' Upon approaching the white sandy beach , it is easy to spot the pigs - both pink and dark brown - lying in the sand .
' I 'm not sure how these domestic pigs ( gone feral ) came to live on this particular beach in the Bahamas , but they are well - known to locals , who have been feeding them for years . '
Making a splash :
The playful pigs are feral but are fed by locals to ensure they stay on ' Pig Beach '
Mr Cheng added : ' Because locals bring food , the pigs will run into the water and actually swim out to the oncoming boats , as if to greet them individually .
It is strange enough to see pigs laying around on tropical beaches of white sand , but to see them then charge into the water to greet oncoming boats is just bizarre . '
Spending several hours photographing and playing with the pigs , Mr Cheng and his team even managed to join them for a swim .
Give us a wave :
The swine are a hit with locals and tourists who love to see them swim each day
' Nadine Umbscheiden , one of the photographers was so at ease with them that she managed to swim with them , ' said Mr Cheng .
' We dubbed her the " pig whisperer " because she was so good at getting the pigs to swim to our cameras !'
Mr Cheng is the editor and publisher of Wetpixel.com , and is technical advisor and photographer for Sea Shepherd Conservation Society .

I want to start this off by saying I have nothing but love for RIM the company .
Probably my favorite tech corporation in the world , they ’ve created an incredibly unique product that practically replaces the need for drugs for most people .
What ’s even more fascinating , however , is how RIM ( to the pleasant surprise of a lot of us early users ) has managed to take a corporate - focused product and service and blow down doors in the consumer world .
From the BlackBerry 7100 , the first consumer - oriented device , to the eye - catching BlackBerry Tour ( it ’s business through and through , yet it will be an incredibly popular consumer phone on Verizon and Sprint ) , it ’s clear that RIM has done everything right to this day .
So , what ’s the problem you ’re asking ?
They have probably the best back - end infrastructure for mobile communication on the planet , awesome phones that can go head - to - head with high - end smartphones , consumer marketing , a huge consumer fanbase , and practically every businessman ( or woman ) has one on their hip .
One word is where RIM fails so miserably it is n’t even imaginable : software .
You have to look at the big picture here … for what RIM is working with ( an incredibly miserable Java OS with so much security and encryption and smoke - blowing APIs ) they ’ve hit the jackpot .
Their OS architecture is fantastic , their use of security is what makes them so trustworthy .
But , as each handset release comes closer and closer , people start to see the bigger picture .
And that ’s the fact that RIM ’s OS is more than antiquated , it ’s borderline laughable .
But it works , you ’re thinking , so what ’s wrong ?
I ’ve been saying this for years , but it was n’t designed to do anything the BlackBerry does now .
Imagine scotch taping car parts to a 200 hp engine and see how far that gets you .
Obviously , it ’s just a viciously rough metaphor , but we believe a correct one .
There ’s so many limitations to RIM ’s OS , and even RIM ’s data network that it offsets all the wonderful things they ’ve managed to accomplish .
Remember when people were so excited over leaked shots of OS 4.6 and I said somewhere it was just a theme ?
Well , was I wrong ?
Oh , look !
OS 5.0 !
What changed ?
99 % nothing .
Some functionality is added here and there , but the mobile phone landscape has changed so drastically in the last two years , that RIM , admittedly known to planning “ three years out ” looks to be unable to see the proper direction to head .
You can throw $ 1,000,000,000 at developers but you wo n’t get any if your OS , tools , and documentation are so bad , and that ’s really in the end a lot of what I ’m getting at .
I was laying in bed at around 3 AM early one morning recently , looking through the iPhone App Store and I came across EA ’s Tiger Woods Golf .
$ 6.99 , why not ?
Wait , it ’s 150 MB ?
Wow , it must be good .
I clicked purchase and literally 4 minutes later , Tiger Woods was installed and up on my screen .
Granted I was on a high - speed Wi -Fi connection , but it made me realize more than ever that RIM has the most uphill battle of their lifetimes .
When a BlackBerry application over 500k is considered “ large ” , something ’s wrong .
When TweetGenius is one of the first BlackBerry applications to do fun , unique things like transparent overlays , consistent shortcuts , and a straight forward UI , something is wrong .
The reason why this is so frustrating to me and I ’m guessing many is because RIM literally almost has it all .
They ’ve got it !
They are 90 % there but that last 10 % has become the most important .
If you take Apple for example , and see their shortcomings , and then what they ’ve done to fix them , it ’s remarkable .
It ’s a completely different DNA than RIM ’s but it ’s working .
In two years Apple has practically matched Research In Motion in almost every consumer area while having the most advanced mobile operating system with the most advanced mobile SDK on the planet .
If Apple can do this in just two years and RIM has stood still , no one thinks that ’s a problem ?
The reason RIM works is because it ’s the entire package , if you will .
Hardware , software , infrastructure , corporate integration , security , etc .
People want simplicity , ease of use , but more than ever they want more than they need .
Stupider people are smarter and expect more , smarter people are stupider and expect more .
RIM delivers the same tired package in new hardware and people are starting to catch on .
App World ?
Seriously ?
From every single developer I ’ve spoke to , it ’s a non-starter .
It basically does n’t exist to them in terms of a sales channel — it ’s practically like 1 % if that .
What consumers do n’t do is look forward .
They look at what ’s put in front of them .
It ’s the exact opposite for the manufacturer and thus why it ’s so difficult .
Look back two or three years and the Bold and Storm might seem incredibly innovative , consumer - focused , and sure to be hot sellers .
And they were and are , but look ahead three years and tell me point blank you have confidence that RIM knows how to steer this ship .
I do n’t , and that ’s being incredibly honest .
It ’s not me being negative , it ’s objectively looking at the landscape and evaluating things .
I want RIM to succeed , I want RIM to make kick ass products .
I ’m just frustrated that RIM is going through hardware like it ’s nobody ’s business yet fails to deliver on the things that everyone wants .
Screw business people , screw consumers , everyone wants a WebKit - based browser .
It ’s inexcusable RIM does n’t get it .
It ’s inexcusable that people put up with a 2003 operating system with so many limitations and restrictions it would make Ahmadinejad jealous .
I do n’t think RIM is going anywhere , they as a company are incredibly successful , but once they start to lose the consumer market which they worked so hard to get , it ’s a downward shift .
Here ’s a list of RIM ’s models followed by Apple ’s in the last 3 years :
RIM : 8110 , 8120 , 8130 , 8800 , 8820 , 8830 , 8300 , 8310 , 8320 , 8330 , 8220 , 8230 , 8900 , 9000 , 9500 , 9530 , 9630 .
Apple : iPhone , iPhone 3G , iPhone 3GS .
There ’s a good and bad part with knowing things in advance .
For instance , people might hold off on purchasing a new BlackBerry if they know a newer and better one is being released in a couple months , and this hurts a company ’s current product cycle .
On the other hand , if someone on Verizon sees a Tour being released two months from now , they might rethink jumping ship or switching to a different device on Verizon .
And the cycle continues .
Looking at RIM ’s upcoming products for the next 6 - 12 months is simply a rehash of current limitations and shortcoming in smaller and sexier packages .
The BlackBerry 9020 ?
It ’s a Bold in a smaller , sexier package .
Nothing else is different .
The BlackBerry Storm 2 ?
It ’s the same device with maybe improved screen tech .
The BlackBerry Magnum ?
As hot as a hybrid touch screen / QWERTY device would be , it ’s still a BlackBerry that can’t pull up a webpage to save its life or play a real game or have any sort of desktop - class application running .
These things wo n’t change , the core OS has n’t changed , and RIM has had no reason to change it .
Why mess with success , right ?
Well , if you happen to be Research In Motion , you might have to start changing things up or newer and better operating systems like the iPhone , webOS , and Android are going to eat their lunch and their applications , too .
I ’m fortunate enough to be able to have every phone I want on every carrier and that gives a person an incredible amount of clarity when picking the superior products .
I use an iPhone 3GS and a BlackBerry Bold everyday , both on AT&T .
But to tell you the truth , in the past when people ask me what device would I choose if I had to only pick one , it would hurt my brain .
There was just no way to choose .
But unfortunately or fortunately , that decision has become clearer and clearer .
I do n’t think I ’ll ever give up my BlackBerry , I ’m pretty sure you ’ll always find one on my hip in an OEM RIM leather holster , ( yes , holsters are cool as shit ) but when me of all people starts truly questioning how a company as successful and brilliant as RIM is going to keep up with the next 2 - 3 years , you ’ve got a big , big issue .
I ’ll close by saying that the market is still wide open and this does n’t mean RIM is or ever will go anywhere .
It ’s just something to keep an eye on and see how the best to ever do it will react to competitors ’ advances , innovations , and of course , their software .

米 Lifehacker読 者 のBernard Sandbergさんによると、YouTubeなどの動画サイトで10秒ごとに動画がフリーズするのは、Firefox2.0以降に搭載されているセッション復元機能が原因だとか。Firefoxのデフォルト値では開いているタブを10秒ごとに保存する設定になっているそうで、多くのタブを一度に開いているとより動画が固まりやすいそうです。
では、これを解消するためにはどうすればよいのでしょう？
答えはシンプル。セッション復元のための保存のインターバルを長くすること。具体的な方法としては、アドレスバーで｢about:config｣と入力しEnterキーを押すと、フィルターボックスが表示されますので、さらにフィルターボックスに｢browser.sessionstore.interval｣と入力しましょう。すると｢10000（" 10秒に保存する"
の意）｣が表示されるはず。この数値を5分ごとの保存とするならば｢300000｣、2分なら｢120000｣など、任意の数字に変更すればOK。
すでにおわかりのとおり、この数値を大きくすればするほど、セッション復元のための保存のインターバルが長くなるので、Firefoxの不正終了に備えるという観点ではあまり大きな数値を設定しないほうがよいかもしれません。この記事によると｢セーフティ志向なら2分くらいが適当｣とのことですよ。いずれにしろシンプルな方法なので、動画サイトのノロノロにイライラさせられている方は一度お試しを。

Despite BitTorrent being the leading file - sharing protocol for several years already , Limewire is still the most installed P2P application on the market .
Even though most of Limewire 's users only use the Gnutella network , the application has completely overhauled its BitTorrent implementation .
In 2008 LimeWire was the most installed P2P application with an impressive market - share of 37 % , compared to 14 % for runner - up uTorrent .
Although Limewire is primarily a Gnutella - based client it also supports BitTorrent downloads .
Although we can safely say that most LimeWire users do n’t use the application just for its BitTorrent support , LimeWire could not ignore the popularity of BitTorrent and had no other option than to implement the most used file - sharing protocol back in 2006 .
Up until today , LimeWire ’s BitTorrent functionality has been rather limited , especially compared to the full - featured BitTorrent clients such as uTorrent , Transmission and Vuze .
However , this is all about to change according to the LimeWire team .
LimeWire ’s lead developer Sam Berlin told TorrentFreak that they ’ve done a complete overhaul of their BitTorrent implementation .
The newest release is already available in Beta and now uses Arvid Norberg ’s Libtorrent under the hood , which is a significant improvement .
With the implementation of Libtorrent – which is also used by BitTorrent clients such as Deluge , Halite and Miro – Limewire now supports Mainline DHT , UDP tracking , IPv6 , HTTP seeding , local peer discovery and uTorrent ’s peer exchange
With Libtorrent LimeWire definitely made a step in the right direction that will benefit those who use the application to occasionally download torrents .
True to LimeWire ’s “ ease of use ” standards there are very few BitTorrent options to configure , meaning that most new features are simply enabled and ca n’t be turned off .
Sam Berlin told TorrentFreak that the LimeWire team has no idea how many of their users use the application to download torrents .
In a BitTorrent client survey we conducted of 137,797 peers across various swarms only 43 of them were using LimeWire .
They must be delighted at the news .
Marijuana No Longer Focus of Anti-Drug Campaigns
CBS News Examination Finds Prescription Drugs Are Seen as Bigger Threat Than Marijuana by Government , Non-Profit Groups
[ Editor ’s note : Hallelujah ! ]
By Elizabeth Sprague
Over the last several years , without many people realizing it , the U.S. government has changed the focus of its anti-drug efforts , deemphasizing marijuana in favor of prescription drugs .
A CBS News survey of government and nonprofit anti-drug groups has found a retreat from anti-marijuana campaigns over the past several years as prescription and over the counter drug abuse has grown amongst teens .
In fact , the Partnership for a Drug Free America , the nation ’s largest creator of anti-drug messages , has n’t produced a single anti-marijuana public service advertisement since 2005 .
The change comes as a result of the decline in marijuana use amongst teens , and growing worry over the abuse of prescription drugs .
Marijuana use has been declining for 10 years and past - month use is down 25 percent since 2001 according to the largest tracking study in the U.S. , “ Monitoring the Future ” by the University of Michigan .
Meanwhile prescription drug abuse has held steady over the past five years according to the Partnership for a Drug - Free America , with nearly one in five teens ( 19 percent ) abusing prescription medications to get high .
“ There is a new threat in town , ” Robert Dennisoton of the Office of National Drug Control Policy said .
The concern about pills has been highlighted by a string of high profile deaths like that of Heath Ledger , Anna Nicole Smith , and possibly Michael Jackson — all tied to the abuse of legal prescription drugs .
In an effort to spread awareness about the dangers of the misuse of prescription drugs , the Partnership for a Drug - Free America even refers to young people today as “ Generation Rx ” in TV advertisements that point to the dangers of misuse of those drugs .
“ For this generation , high prevalence of prescription drug abuse was kicking in … there was a dawning , and a number of us began to feel that we need to do something about it , ” said Sean Clark , executive vice president with the Partnership for a Drug - Free America .
The Office of National Drug Control Policy , the government ’s drug policy wing , now dedicates all of its campaign resources directed at parents – some $ 14 million dollars since 2008 – to the abuse of prescription and over the counter drugs .
“ The issue of prescription drug abuse , which the Office of National Drug Control Policy has been shouting about from the rooftops , it is a significant problem in this country , ” National Drug Control Policy Director Gil Kerlikowske said on “ The Early Show ” last week .
Advocates for marijuana legalization argue that the shift from anti-marijuana to anti-pill messages has come at least in large part because prescription and over the counter medicines are far more deadly than marijuana .
“ While it is the most widely used illicit drug , it is much less dangerous than prescription drugs , ” said Bruce Mirken of the Marijuana Policy Project , a group that supports marijuana legalization .
“ The government is talking about the dangers of acetaminophen – this stuff is given out like candy and can kill , ” he said .
“ When you put it in that context , marijuana almost looks benign . ”
The addictiveness of marijuana – or lack thereof – compared to other drugs is also cited by supporters .
“ The bottom line is the Opiates and Stimulates are much more addictive than marijuana , those that try it are likely to return to them after first use . ” said Mitch Earleywine , associate professor of psychology at the State University of New York .
“ Maybe 9 percent of marijuana users develop problems but 14 - 23 percent of prescription drug abusers end up saying ca n’t quit or report withdrawal when they want to stop . ”
Advocates also point to recently - released data obtained by the Web site ProCon.org which indicates that prescription drugs are responsible for far more deaths than marijuana .
The report compared data on deaths due to marijuana with FDA - approved medications .
It found that the approved drugs — which included anti-psychotics , Attention Deficit Disorder medications , painkillers and other prescription drugs — were suspected as the primary cause of 10,008 deaths and as a secondary cause in 1,679 more .
Marijuana , on the other hand , was the primary suspect in zero deaths and a suspected secondary factor in 279 deaths .
Another report recently issued by the Florida Department of Law Enforcement indicated that prescription drugs caused more deaths than illicit drugs – even including alcohol - related automobile accidents .
Prescription drugs were the cause of more than 25 percent of drug related deaths in the state .
Marijuana was not listed as a cause of death last year in Florida .
There are now more new abusers of prescription drugs each year than there are abusers of marijuana , according to the National Survey on Drug Use and Health from the Department of Health and Human Services .
About 2.15 million people started using prescription pain relievers to get high in 2007 , while 2.09 million people started using marijuana that year .

Many people still hold that converting naturally unruly children into socialized adults requires a certain amount of parental abuse .
" Spare the rod and spoil the child . "
" If people do n't fear punishment , they wo n't behave . "
Psychologist George Madoff reported in Moral Politics : how liberals and conservatives think ( 2002 ) , that this mindset is well correlated with political conservatism .
Its close corollary is the conviction that parental harshness produces the toughness needed to survive in a very harsh world .
Now , thanks to developments in neuro - psychology , both of these delusions can be countered with powerful empirical evidence in addition to rational , humane argument .
Real strength means being able to deal with a wide variety of threats and stressors , cooley .
People are most competent , are least weak , when not ruled by emotions at a time of crisis .
This is what psychologists call self - regulation .
Louis Cozolino , in The Neuroscience of Human Relationships : attachment and the developing social brain ( 2009 ) presents rapidly expanding evidence of how the achievement of self - regulation occurs within our brains .
Simply stated , in order for us not to be dominated by the powerful fear based emotions triggered by a perceived threat , the left - brain part of our frontal cortex must gain ascendance over the right - brain part of our amygdala , the fear center of our limbic system .
The frontal cortex , evolutionarily younger than the limbic system , and the even older and more reactive " reptilian " brain stem , is also far less rigid than either .
The cortex 's plasticity has allowed it to strengthen itself , and as a result to become increasingly adept over millennia at modifying our emotional responses to potential threats .
Under extreme conditions amygdala and brainstem can still over - ride and overwhelm all efforts at rational temporizing .
The cortex 's potential for growth and development is a genetic given , but the strengthening process itself , the ascendance of self - regulation , occurs by means of a special kind of interpersonal relationship .
This is the relationship of mother - child attachment .
It is also , though to a lesser degree , the relationship of learners to other socializers : therapists , mentors , and teachers throughout our lifespan .
To a vastly greater degree than the concept socialization implied before the explosion of neurobiological research over the last several decades , our brains are the product of these social relationships
In The Developing Mind ( 1999 ) , Daniel Siegel tells us how neuro - psychologists infer self - regulation to occur .
One 's first socializer , one 's mother ordinarily and ideally , is genetically equipped and powerfully driven to resonate with her infant .
Like one violinist mimicking another , playing the same chords in the same sequence , tempo and volume , she perfectly mirrors her child .
Later in life , as cognitive educational psychologist Carl Pickhardt tells us in Stop the Screaming : How to Turn Angry Conflict With Your Child into Positive Communication ( 2009 ) , parents who wish to stay connected with their adolescents learn to " dance with them . "
This means accepting the flow of their interaction with the world , however bizarre .
Psychotherapists operate similarly with adult patients .
Only through the achievement of inter-personal resonance can a socializer 's wisdom transfer to the brain of a learner .
Learning occurs not by criticism , not by threat but by example .
It occurs when a socializer subtly modifies the qualities of her resonance with a learner - calms the rhythm of the dance , incrementally -- and the learner integrates these changes .
New neurons are added to his brain which enhance his growing powers of self - regulation .
The partnership between the learner 's own cortex and amygdala shifts from lopsided to the right , to lopsided to the left .
Ideally .
How does corporal punishment fit into this empirical , increasingly validated theory of normal social development ?
A parent striking a child , any socializer striking any learner , of any age , however " benevolently , " short circuits interpersonal resonance - disconnects the dancers .
Without this resonance , this dance , self - regulation cannot flourish .
Hitting , and make no mistake , spanking , however gently , is still hitting , may produce people tough on the outside ; but cognitively - emotionally the effect is crippling .
One may wonder why Western conservative tradition holds this practice in such high esteem .
In Born to Be Good : the science of a meaningful life ( 2009 ) , Dacher Keltner comments upon early Puritan 's stress on punishment , disapproval of parent - child hugging and kissing and proscriptions against adults dancing and singing .
These social controls undermined brains ' release of chemicals which studies now show enhance our motivation to form strong , caring communities .
Circumspectly , he does not over - reach his data and speculate that oligarchs may long have understood how disrupting connectedness produced more malleable citizenries .
But his own research , and that of his colleagues , leaves this question hanging provocatively .
Many conservatives argue , of course , that the world is not ideal .
Most parents are poor socializers
Better a citizen who has learned to fear the consequences of improper behavior than one un - spanked , but not self - regulating either .
Of course this way lies hopelessness and despair .
Might as well feed kids heroin early on because they probably wo n't be able to cope with life anyway .
The potential for a better world may well inhere in healthier parent - child relations .
Perhaps nothing more clearly differentiates liberals and conservatives than that conservatives dwell on punishment , while liberals prefer to dance .
In an era of changing climate and sinking economies , Malthusian limits to growth are back — and squeezing us painfully .
Whereas more people once meant more ingenuity , more talent and more innovation , today it just seems to mean less for each .
Less water for every cattle herder in the Horn of Africa .
( The United Nations projects there will be more than four billion people living in nations defined as water - scarce or water - stressed by 2050 , up from half a billion in 1995 . )
Less land for every farmer already tilling slopes so steep they risk killing themselves by falling off their fields .
( At a bit less than six tenths of an acre , global per capita cropland today is little more than half of what it was in 1961 , and more than 900 million people are hungry . )
Less capacity in the atmosphere to accept the heat - trapping gases that could fry the planet for centuries to come .
Scarcer and higher - priced energy and food .
And if the world ’s economy does not bounce back to its glory days , less credit and fewer jobs .
It ’s not surprising that this kind of predicament brings back an old sore topic : human population and whether to do anything about it .
Let ’s concede up front that nothing short of a catastrophic population crash ( think of the film Children of Men , set in a world without children ) would make much difference to climate change , water scarcity or land shortages over the next decade or so .
There are 6.8 billion of us today , and more are on the way .
To make a dent in these problems in the short term without throwing anyone overboard , we will need to radically reduce individuals ’ footprint on the environment through improvements in technology and possibly wrenching changes in lifestyle .
But until the world ’s population stops growing , there will be no end to the need to squeeze individuals ’ consumption of fossil fuels and other natural resources .
A close look at this problem is sobering : short of catastrophic leaps in the death rate or unwanted crashes in fertility , the world ’s population is all but certain to grow by at least one billion to two billion people .
The low - consuming billions of the developing world would love to consume as Americans do , with similar disregard for the environment — and they have as much of a right to do so .
These facts suggest that the coming ecological impact will be of a scale that we will simply have to manage and adapt to as best we can .
Population growth constantly pushes the consequences of any level of individual consumption to a higher plateau , and reductions in individual consumption can always be overwhelmed by increases in population .
The simple reality is that acting on both , consistently and simultaneously , is the key to long - term environmental sustainability .
The sustainability benefits of level or falling human numbers are too powerful to ignore for long .
In the U.S. , this discussion remains muted all the same .
Population concerns may lurk within the public anger over illegal immigration or over the unwed California mother of octuplets earlier this year .
But to the extent that the news media address domestic population growth at all , it is through euphemisms such as “ sprawl ” ( the theoretical culprit in pollution of the Chesapeake Bay , for example ) or the economy ( the theoretical driver of increased greenhouse gas emissions ) .
You are more likely to read about population growth in a letter to the editor than in a news story or editorial .
When President - elect Barack Obama pledged in late 2008 to bring U.S. carbon dioxide emissions to their 1990 levels by 2020 , environmentalists struggled to swallow their dismay .
The European Union , after all , had committed itself to 20 percent reductions from 1990 levels .
But on a per capita basis , President Obama ’s pledge was somewhat more ambitious than the E.U. ’s was .
Because of much more rapid population growth than in the E.U. , Americans would be cutting their individual emissions by 26 percent under his plan and Europeans by 25 percent under theirs .
Any pledges to lower emissions by a uniform percentage among industrial countries will be much harder for the U.S. to achieve , simply because it is gaining people so fast through immigra­tion and a birthrate that is higher than average for a developed nation .
The bitterness of the immigration debate has helped keep U.S. population growth off - limits in the national conversation .
In industrial countries outside of North America , however , population is creeping back into public and even political consciousness .
In the U.K. , an all - party parliamentary panel issued a report called “ Return of the Population Growth Factor ” and called for stronger efforts to slow that growth .
And the concern in the U.K. is not just about the people “ over there ” in developing countries .
In early 2009 Jonathon Porritt , chair of the government ’s Sustainable Development Commission , whacked a hornet ’s nest by calling parents of more than two children “ irresponsible ” and blasting mainstream environmental groups for “ betraying ” their members by fearing to call for small families .
“ It is the ghost at the table , ” Porritt said of population in an interview with the Daily Telegraph , a London broadsheet .
Blog comments on his remarks , most of them supportive , soared into the thousands .
Meanwhile , in Australia , as summer temperatures hovered near 117 degrees Fahrenheit ( 47 degrees Celsius ) and murderous flames converted forests into carbon dioxide , a new book entitled Overloading Australia : How Governments and Media Dither and Deny on Population issued an unusual ecological battle cry : ignore all admonitions to conserve the country ’s
increasingly scarce water supplies until the government eliminates “ baby bonuses ” in the tax code and clamps down on immigration .
A former premier of New South Wales spoke at the book ’s launch .
With comments such as these gaining attention — and in some circles , approval — are environmentalists and eventually policy makers likely to renew the decades - old call for “ population control ” ?
Would they be wise to do so ?
A Number of Us
Two big questions present themselves as population reemerges from the shadows :
Can any feasible downshift in population growth actually put the environment on a more sustainable path ?
And if so , are there measures that the public and policy makers would support that could actually bring about such a change ?
Nature , of course , could n’t care less how many of us there are .
What matters to the environment are the sums of human pulls and pushes , the extractions of resources and the injections of wastes .
When these exceed key tipping points , nature and its systems can change quickly and dramatically .
But the magnitudes of environmental impacts stem not just from our numbers but also from behaviors we learn from our parents and cultures .
Broadly speaking , if population is the number of us , then consumption is the way each of us behaves .
In this unequal world , the behavior of a dozen people in one place sometimes has more environmental impact than does that of a few hundred somewhere else .
Consider how these principles relate to global warming .
The greenhouse gases already released into the atmosphere are likely to bring us quite close to the 3.6 degree F ( two degree C ) increase from the preindustrial global temperature average that many scientists see as the best - guess threshold of potential climate catastrophe .
Already the earth is experiencing harsher droughts , fiercer storms and higher sea levels .
If the scientists are right , these impacts will worsen for decades or centuries .
Indeed , even if we ended all emissions tomorrow , additional warming is on the way thanks to the momentum built into the earth ’s intricate climate system .
( The oceans , for example , have yet to come into equilibrium with the extra heat - trapping capacity of the atmosphere .
As the oceans continue to warm , so will the land around them . )
Our species ’ demographic growth since its birth in Africa 200,000 years ago clearly contributed to this crisis .
If world population had stayed stable at roughly 300 million people — a number that demographers believe characterized humanity from the birth of Christ to A.D. 1000 and that equals the population of just the U.S. today — there would not be enough of us to have the effect of relocating the coastlines even if we all drove Hummers .
But instead we kept growing our numbers , which are projected to reach 9.1 billion by midcentury .
Humanity ’s consumption behaviors consequently did and do matter , and in this arena , all people have not been created equal .
Greenhouse gas release has been linked overwhelmingly , at least up until recently , to the high - consumption habits of the industrial nations .
As a result , in an ethical outrage as big as all outdoors , the coming shifts in climate and sea level will most harm the world ’s poor , who are least responsible for the atmosphere ’s composition , and will least harm the wealthy , who bear the biggest responsibility .
All - Consuming Passions
What part can the size of the human race play in finding a happy ending to this morality play ?
Population scenarios cannot directly address the inequity in emissions patterns — but they are far from unimportant .
Countries with the highest emissions per capita tend to have smaller families on average , whereas those with low emissions per capita tend to have larger ones .
Americans , for example , consumed 8.6 tons of oil or its commercial energy equivalent per capita in 2007 , according to data kept by British Petroleum ; Indians consumed just 0.4 ton per capita .
( These figures somewhat distort the gap because they exclude biomass and other noncommercial forms of energy , for which data are unreliable . )
So while India gained 17 million people in that year and the U.S. gained three million , by this simplified math the U.S. growth in population counted for the equivalent of an additional 25.6 million tons of oil consumed , whereas India ’s much greater growth counted for only 6.6 million additional tons .
With such large disparities , the climate would be better served if the Americans emulated Indian consumption than if India emulated U.S. population .
End of story ?
For a variety of reasons , not quite .
Population is not a contrasting force to consumption but something very close to its parent .
Alone , each of us has no significant impact on the planet , even when our collective behavior overwhelms its natural processes .
Historically , population has grown fastest when per capita consumption is modest .
Later , consumption tends to explode on the base of a population that is large , but it is by then growing more slowly .
Throughout the 19th century , the U.S. population grew at rates typical of Africa today .
That century of rapid growth helped to make 21st - century America ( with 307 million people now ) a consumption behemoth .
The same one - two punch of population growth followed by consumption growth is now occurring in China ( 1.34 billion people ) and India ( 1.2 billion ) .
Per capita commercial energy use has been growing so rapidly in both countries ( or at least it was through 2007 on the eve of the economic meltdown ) that if the trends continue unabated the typical Chinese will outconsume the typical American before 2040 , with Indians surpassing Americans by 2080 .
Population and consumption thus feed on each other ’s growth to expand humans ’ environmental footprint exponentially over time .
Moreover , because every human being consumes and disposes of multiple natural resources , a birth that does not occur averts consumption impacts in every direction .
A person reducing her carbon footprint , conversely , does not automatically use less water .
A wind turbine displaces coal - fired electricity but hardly prevents the depletion of forests ( now disappearing in the tropics at the rate of one Kentucky - size swath a year ) or fisheries ( at current depletion rates facing exhaustion by the middle of the century ) .
But unlike wind turbines , humans reproduce themselves .
So every smaller generation means that the multipliers of consumption linked to population also shrink on into the future .
Because most environmental challenges emerge on scales of decades and centuries , population growth packs a long - term ­wallop .
With respect to saving the planet , over a few short years it is hard for smaller families to beat sharp reductions in per capita consumption .
Since the early 1990s , however , published calculations have demonstrated that slower population growth over decades yields significant reductions of greenhouse gas emissions even in countries where per capita fossil - fuel consumption is modest .
Slower population growth that leads to eight billion people in 2050 rather than to the currently projected 9.1 billion would save one billion to two billion tons of carbon annually by 2050 , according to estimates by climate scientist Brian O’Neill of the National Center for Atmospheric Research and his colleagues .
The subsequent savings in emissions would grow year by year ever afterward — while the billion - plus fewer people would need less land , forest products , water , fish and other foodstuffs .
Those improvements still would not be enough on their own to avert significant climate change .
Other similar billion - ton savings in emissions ( what Princeton University professors Stephen Pacala and Robert Socolow have dubbed “ stabilization wedges ” ) are desperately needed and can come only from reduction in fossil - fuel consumption through energy efficiency , low - carbon technologies and changes in way of life .
If two billion automobiles getting 30 miles per gallon traveled only 5,000 miles a year instead of 10,000 , that change would save another billion tons of carbon emissions .
So would replacing coal - fired power plants that produce 1.4 trillion watts of electricity with equivalent plants burning natural gas .
But without a population that stops growing , comparable technology improvements or lifestyle downshifts will be needed indefinitely to keep greenhouse gas emissions sustainable .
The complications that population growth poses to every environmental problem are not to be dismissed .
In fact , they are accepted and understood best by the governments of poorer countries , where the impacts of dense and rapidly growing populations are most obvious .
During the past few years , most of the reports that developing countries have filed with the U.N. on how they plan to adapt to climate change mention population growth as a complicating factor .
Instruments of Policy
A commonsense strategy for dealing with rising environmental risk would be to probe every reasonable opportunity for shifting to sustainability as quickly , easily and inexpensively as possible .
No single energy strategy — whether nuclear , efficiency , wind , solar or geothermal — shows much promise on its own for eliminating the release of carbon dioxide into the air .
Obstacles such as high up - front costs hamper most of those energy strategies even as part of a collective fix for the climate problem .
No single change in land use will turn soils and plants into net absorbers of heat - trapping gases .
Without technological breakthroughs in energy or land use , only higher prices for fossil fuels show much potential for edging down per capita emissions — a “ solution ” that policy makers have yet to grapple with effectively .
Given the long - term contribution that a turnaround in population growth could make in easing our most recalcitrant challenges , why does n’t the idea get more respect and attention ?
Politicians ’ apathy toward long - term solutions is part of the answer .
But the more obvious reason is the discomfort most of us feel in grappling with the topics of sex , contraception , abortion , immigration and family sizes that differ by ethnicity and income .
What in the population mix is not a hot button ?
Especially when the word “ control ” is added , and when the world ’s biggest religions have fruitful multiplication embedded in their philosophical DNA .
And so critics from left , right and the intellectual center gang up on the handful of environmentalists and other activists who try to get population into national and global discussions .
Yet newly released population data from the U.N. show that developed countries , from the U.S. to Spain , have been experiencing ( at least up through the beginnings of the economic crisis in 2008 ) , if not baby booms , at least reproductive “ rat - a - tat - tats . ”
For the first time since the 1970s , the average number of children born to U.S. women has topped 2.1 — the number at which parents replace themselves in the populations of developed and many developing countries .
Even if net immigration ended tomorrow , continuation of that fertility rate would guarantee further growth in U.S. population for decades to come .
Those who do consider population to be a key to the problem typically say little about which policies would spare the planet many more billions of people .
Should we restructure tax rates to favor small families ?
Propagandize the benefits of small families for the planet ?
Reward family - planning workers for clients they have sterilized ?
Each of those steps alone or in combination might help bend birthrates downward for a time , but none has proved to affect demographic trends over the long term or , critically , to gain and keep public support .
When the government of India rewarded health workers for meeting sterilization quotas in 1976 , the zeal of some of them for wielding scalpels regardless of their patients ’ wishes contributed to the downfall of Indira Gandhi ’s government in 1977 .
And how can we reduce consumption ?
Ideas such as cap - and - trade plans for limiting greenhouse gas emissions and allowing companies to trade emission rights are based on the same principle : raise the price of what harms the environment to reduce consumption of it .
Beyond the consumption cuts , however , such schemes do n’t have much to recommend them .
Governments can also eliminate subsidies of polluting behavior , an approach that is more palatable — except to the often powerful interests that benefit from the subsidies .
Or governments can subsidize low consumption through tax deductions and credits , but the funds to do so on the needed scale will likely be increasingly scarce .
The Zen of Population
Mostly ignored in the environmental debates about population and consumption is that nearly all the world ’s nations agreed to an altogether different approach to the problem of growth 15 years ago , one that bases positive demographic outcomes on decisions individuals make in their own self - interest .
( If only something comparable could be imagined to shrink consumption . )
The strategy that 179 nations signed onto at a U.N. conference in Cairo in 1994 was : forget population control and instead help every woman bear a child in good health when she wants one .
That approach , which powerfully supports reproductive liberty , might sound counterintuitive for shrinking population growth , like handing a teenager the keys to the family car without so much as a lecture .
But the evidence suggests that what women want — and have always wanted — is not so much to have more children as to have more for a smaller number of children they can reliably raise to healthy adulthood .
Women left to their own devices , contraceptive or otherwise , would collectively “ control ” population while acting on their own intentions .
More than 200 million women in developing countries are sexually active without effective modern contraception even though they do not want to be pregnant anytime soon , according to the Guttmacher Institute , a reproductive health research group .
By the best estimates , some 80 million pregnancies around the world are unintended .
Although the numbers are n’t strictly comparable — many unplanned pregnancies end in abortion — the unintended pregnancies exceed the 78 million by which world population grows every year .
In the U.S. , which is well informed and spends nearly 20 cents per dollar of economic activity on health care , nearly one out of every two pregnancies is unintended .
That proportion has not changed much for decades .
In every nation , rich and poor , in which a choice of contraceptives is available and is backed up by reasonably accessible safe abortion for when contraception fails , women have two or fewer children .
Furthermore , educating girls reduces birthrates .
Worldwide , according to a calculation provided for this article by demographers at the International Institute for Applied Systems Analysis in Austria , women with no schooling have an average of 4.5 children , whereas those with a few years of primary school have just three .
Women who complete one or two years of secondary school have an average of 1.9 children apiece — a figure that over time leads to a decreasing population .
With one or two years of college , the average childbearing rate falls even further , to 1.7 .
And when women enter the workforce , start businesses , inherit assets and otherwise interact with men on an equal footing , their desire for more than a couple of children fades even more dramatically .
True , old - style population control seems to have helped slow population growth in China .
The country ’s leaders brag that their one - child policy has spared the world ’s climate 300 million greenhouse gas emitters , the population equivalent of a U.S. that never happened .
But most of the drop in Chinese fertility occurred before that coercive policy went into effect in 1979 , as the government brought women by the millions into farm and industry collectives and provided them with the family planning they needed to stay on the job .
Many developing countries — from Thailand and Colombia to Iran — have experienced comparable declines in family size by getting better family - planning services and educational opportunities to more women and girls in more places .
With President Obama in the White House and Democrats dominant in Congress , the signs are good that the U.S. will support the kind of development abroad and reproductive health at home most likely to encourage slower population growth .
Like almost all politicians , however , Obama never mentions population or the way it bridges problems from health and education all the way to food , energy security and climate change .
Bringing population back into the public conversation is risky , but the world has come a long way in understanding that the subject is only one part of most of today ’s problems and that “ population control ” ca n’t really control population .
Handing control of their lives and their bodies to women — the right thing to do for countless other reasons — can .
There is no reason to fear the discussion .

The Sagittarius A* supermassive black hole , as seen by the Chandra X-ray Observatory .
Nobody has yet seen the black hole directly NASA
LIKE a giant pale blue eye , the Earth stares at the centre of our galaxy .
Through the glare and the fog it is trying to catch a glimpse of an indistinct something 30,000 light years away .
Over there , within the sparkling starscape of the galaxy ’s core … no , not those giant suns or those colliding gas clouds ; not the gamma-ray glow of annihilating antimatter .
No , right there in the very centre , inside that swirling nebula of doomed matter , could that be just a hint of a shadow ?
Latest news :
First ever real image of a black hole revealed
The shadow we ’re straining to see is that of a monstrous black hole , a place where gravity rules supreme , swallowing light and stretching the fabric of space to breaking point .
Black holes are perhaps the most outrageous prediction of science , and even though we can paint fine theoretical pictures of them and point to evidence for many objects that seem to be black hole - ish , nobody has ever actually seen one .
All that could change in the next few months .
Astronomers are working to tie together a network of microwave telescopes across the planet to make a single instrument with the most acute vision yet .
They will turn this giant eye towards what they believe is a supermassive black hole at the centre of our galaxy , code name Sagittarius A* ( see image , above ) .
Even part - built , the microwave eye has already produced a hazy picture of Sagittarius A*. Last September , a …
It ’s hard to avoid hearing about all the health benefits of antioxidants : they prevent cancer , protect the cardiovascular system , enhance the immune system , reduce the risk of stroke ... and the list goes on .
Science journals are peppered with reports on the effects of antioxidants , methods of optimizing their levels in cooked , processed , and engineered foods , and boosting their levels in produce like apples .
From the large volume of research , it ’s clear that antioxidants do promote health , but a number of research groups have also described instances where antioxidants could be detrimental to health .
These instances mostly involve cancerous cells .
Research groups have observed that increasing antioxidant capacity is associated with greater growth of breast cancer metastases in the brain .
Researchers have questioned whether supplemental antioxidant use should be avoided during chemo and radiation therapy , as antioxidants appear to assist the abnormal overgrowth of cells in patients at risk to damaging chemicals , including those delivered by smoking , alcohol use , chemotherapy , or radiation treatments .
Antioxidants , evidently , are not exclusive to the type of cells that they assist .
To better understand how antioxidants may promote tumors , researchers from Harvard , Johns Hopkins University , and the University of Notre Dame teamed up to take a deep look at their influence on tumor cell survival .
Zachary Schafer , the lead researcher , focused on epithelial cells , the most common source of cancers .
Normally , epithelial cells die once they become displaced from the extracellular matrix , the mesh of proteins that supports and structures tissues .
Tumor cells , in contrast , can detach from the extracellular matrix and proceed to multiply in the lumen between tissues .
Somehow , the tumor cells find ways to survive on their own .
When Schafer and his colleagues examined the function of the extracellular matrix , they discovered that , in addition to its other roles , it regulated cellular metabolism .
Detached mammary epithelial cells lost the ability to take up glucose , meaning less of it could be used to produce ATP , the cell 's primary energy source .
Furthermore , displacement from the extracellular matrix led to a considerable increase in the levels of reactive oxygen species and a corresponding decrease in glutathione , an antioxidant produced by cells .
The combination of ATP reduction and increased reactive oxygen species make it difficult for cells to survive independtly .
The authors were able to block the negative effects of matrix detachment when they expressed a cancer - promoting oncogene ( ERBB2 ) in the epithelial cells .
ERBB2 expression restored the cells ' ability to take up glucose and reduced the levels of reactive oxygen species .
So once again , the cells were able to produce ATP .
The connection between reactive oxygen species and ATP levels intrigued the researchers .
They decided to treat detached cells with antioxidants to see if that alone would help the cells survive .
They found that treating matrix - free cells with Trolox ( a derivative of Vitamin E ) or N - acetyl - L -cysteine ( a widely used antioxidant ) decreased reductive oxygen species , as expected .
But it also enhanced ATP levels in a manner that is entirely different from the action of oncogenes .
Instead of restoring the cells ' ability to take up glucose , antioxidants enhanced fatty acid oxidation , which is another metabolic method of generating ATP .
By delving into the biological basis by which antioxidants and oncogenes aid epithelial cell survival , Schafer and his collaborators have found that the two factors restore ATP production by different mechanisms .
In the process , they also discovered that , while antioxidants protect our genetic material from mutations , they also support tumorgenesis by correcting metabolic problems .
These dichotomous activities show us , once again , that biological processes are intricately interwoven , making it extremely difficult to strictly control the effects of any substance that we take .

Ratings agency Standard & Poors has managed a stunt which to my knowledge has no precedent in the history of the dark art of ratings .
It downgraded some not all that highly structured commercial mortgage bonds last week to an eyepopping degree , from AAA to BBB - , just this side of being junk .
Then they restored them to AAA this week .
And the reason was not some semi-defensible “ the dog ate my homework ” , like someone external had given them erroneous information that got plugged into their methodology .
No , they had implemented a new model , it gave garbage results , and somehow no one inside the firm noticed the massive downgrades that resulted and bothered to check to see if there might be an error in the model .
No , they published and then got customer howls .
Now this only involved three bonds , but this happening at all is quite an impressive feat .
From Blooomberg :
Standard & Poor ’s backtracked on ratings cuts issued last week and raised the ranking on commercial mortgage - backed debt from three bonds sold in 2007 .
The securities , restored to top - ranked status , had been downgraded as recently as last week , making them ineligible for the Federal Reserve ’s Term Asset - Backed Securities Loan Facility to jumpstart lending .
S&P lowered the ratings on a class of a commercial mortgage - backed bond offering from AAA to BBB - , the lowest investment - grade ranking , on July 14 .
The New York - based rating company reversed the cut today , S&P said in a statement .
In a related report , S&P said it adjusted assumptions on the timing of projected losses on the mortgages .
“ It is a stunning reversal and certainly raises questions concerning the robustness of their revised model , ” said Christopher Sullivan , chief investment officer at United Nations Federal Credit Union in New York .
“ It may engender further uncertainty with respect to ratings outlooks . ”

CLIMATE BILL SPELLS “ SKYROCKETING ” ENERGY RATES , UNEMPLOYMENT , LESS FREEDOM

WASHINGTON – It was close , but late Friday , June 26 , the U.S. House of Representatives passed the highly controversial H.R. 2998 ( originally H.R. 2454 ) : The American Clean Energy and Security Act ( ACES ) -- called informally the “ Waxman - Markey Global Warming Bill ” after its cosponsors Henry Waxman , Calif. , and Ed Markey , Mass. , both Democrats .
The bill now awaits action by the Senate .
This was the first time either house of Congress had approved legislation designed to curb “ greenhouse gases ” that many believe contribute to “ global warming ” and climate change .
The vote was 212-219 .
Forty - four Democrats voted No , and without the Yes-votes of eight Republicans it would have gone down in defeat .
President Obama hailed the historic passage , as did House Speaker Nancy Pelosi , D - Calif. , who led the charge in ramming the bill through the House , determined to secure approval by July 4 .
“ We passed transformational legislation , which will take us into the future , ” Pelosi boasted at a press conference following the roll call .
And in a derisive slap at the grassroots opposition that bombarded congressional offices with emails , faxes and phone calls , she declared : “ For some it was a difficult vote because the agents of the status quo were out there full force , jamming the lines in their districts and here [ in D.C. ] , but [ the representatives ] withstood that . ”
It would definitely be “ transformational . ”
Waxman - Markey is arguably the most sweeping , far - reaching measure Congress has ever considered in terms of its impact on the U.S. economy , industry and standard of living – and the most costly .
House Republican leader John Boehner of Ohio called it “ the biggest job - killing bill that has ever been on the floor of the House of Representatives . ”
Myron Ebell , Director of Global Warming and International Environmental Policy at the Competitive Enterprise Institute ( CEI ) , describes it as “ a massive tax hike that would vastly expand the federal government ’s power over the economy .
Indeed , [ Waxman - Markey ] would be the largest tax increase in world history , [ would ] transfer vast wealth from consumers to big - business special interests .
“ And it would put Washington in charge of people ’s lives in a way not seen since the Second World War – which was the last time Americans needed ration coupons to buy gasoline , food and other commodities , ” he warned .
Yet despite its magnitude , the Democrat - controlled House voted to allow just three hours of debate for the bill itself , plus half an hour for a 309 - page Manager ’s Amendment ( H.R. 2998 ) by Waxman that was dropped in the hopper at 3 a.m. that morning .
Nobody had read the entire measure , let alone the amendment , when they voted : copies were n’t even available .
Moreover , it had grown from about 950 pages to an eyeball - glazing 1,510 in the five days before the vote ( that ’s including the amendment ) .
“ Unfortunately , this is the New World Order , ” said Andrew Moylan , Director of Government Affairs at the National Taxpayers Union ( NTU ) .
“ Where we have bills that are written in secret , are debated in no time at all , get passed into law – and we find out what little cookies are in there for us after the fact . ”
( For lists of some of the hundreds of “ cookies ” in the Manager ’s Amendment click here and here . )
The High Cost of Going Green
The goal of Waxman - Markey is to decrease the level of carbon dioxide and five other “ greenhouse gases ” in the atmosphere .
These gases occur naturally ( CO2 , in particular , is necessary for plant life ) , but levels are said to be increased by the burning of carbon - based fossil fuels ( oil , coal and natural gas ) during energy production that provides 85 percent of U.S. electricity .
That increase is alleged to contribute to “ global warming ” – though this is widely disputed , as is the theory that there ’s any global warming at all .
Contrary to claims of Waxman - Markey supporters , such as former Vice President Al Gore , the scientific community is divided over whether there is global warming and if there is , what causes it and what to do about it .
[ Read : " Global Warming Challenged " by Willian Hunt ]
The bill mandates that 20 percent of U.S. electricity comes from “ renewable ” sources .
Electric and gas utilities , refineries , cement plants , steel foundries and other companies would be required to lower the amount of CO2 emitted from their smokestacks 17 percent below 2005 levels by 2020 , and down to 83 percent below 2005 levels by 2050 .
This will be done through an elaborate permitting process called cap - and - trade that requires companies to have one emission permit – in effect , a ration coupon -- for every ton of CO2 emitted from their smokestacks .
The government will set a cap for the maximum amount of CO2 emission , and ratchet the cap down over time -- in theory , forcing companies to invest in lower - carbon technologies such as wind and solar .
Critics predict huge hikes in the cost of lighting , heating , air cooling , and transportation – any activity that depends on electricity or gasoline – plus increases in the price of food and consumer goods and serious unemployment .
Overall costs are estimated to range anywhere from $ 2 trillion to $ 9 trillion .
“ We ’re talking about adding hundreds of billions of dollars per year in added costs to energy , ” Moylan told NewsWithViews .
“ That ’s something that people are not going to have a choice about if they want to keep the lights on , drive to work and get the kids to school . ”
Just before the vote the Congressional Budget Office released figures purporting to show that the cost to the average household would be only $ 175 a year by 2020 .
An earlier estimate by CBO had set the tab at $ 1,600 a year .
Except for this conveniently released report by the CBO , there are virtually no one is claiming that Waxman - Markey is going to be cheap – not even the president for whom it ’s a top priority measure .
Obama : “ Electricity Rates Will Skyrocket ”
In a famous interview with editors of the San Francisco Chronicle ( Jan. 17 , 2008 ) , then - Senator Obama admitted the price of electricity would go up .
Way up .
In his words :
“ Under my plan of a cap - and - trade system , electricity rates would necessarily skyrocket … because I ’m capping greenhouse gases -- coal power plants , natural gas , you name it -- whatever the plants were , whatever the industry was , they would have to retrofit their operations .
That will cost money ; they will pass that [ cost ] on to consumers . ”
Obama further explained how it would be necessary to persuade the American people that although there would be “ some increase ” in electricity rates , “ over the long term -- because of combinations of more efficient energy usage , and changing light bulbs , more efficient appliances , but also technology in proving how we can produce clean energy -- the economy will benefit . ”
He did not promise that rates would eventually come down or even that it would be possible to develop the necessary technology .
He only said that the economy would “ benefit ” and the argument must be made “ persuasively enough ” for Americans to accept the plan .
At the Heritage Foundation ’s Center for Data Analysis , researchers crunched numbers and came up with some specifics about the first 23 years of a project that ’s planned to go on for the next 90 years .
According to Heritage findings , under Waxman - Markey the cost of electricity will soar 90 percent between 2012 and 2035 ; gasoline prices will rise 58 percent ; and residential natural gas , 55 percent .
A family of four can expect its annual energy bill to be raised by $ 1,241 .
( Figures are adjusted for inflation , and assume a 36 percent cut in energy use by consumers trying to adjust to escalating costs . )
That $ 1,241 yearly energy bill is just the direct increase in energy prices .
As energy prices go up , the costs of making consumer goods will follow and businesses will pass these along in the form of higher prices .
From the Heritage Foundation 's analysis :
“ As the higher production costs ripple through the economy , household pocketbooks get hit again and again .
When all the direct and indirect energy tax impacts have been added up , family - of - four costs will rise by $ 2,979 per year on the average over the 2023 - 2035 timeframe .
In 2035 alone , the cost is $ 4,609 . ”
With the slowing of the economy , unemployment will go up on average 1,145,000 a year in lost jobs , with peak years seeing unemployment of over 2.4 million jobs gone .
Then there ’s the national debt : “ By 2035 Waxman - Markey will have driven the national debt 26 percent above what it would be without the legislation , and that represents an additional $ 28,728 per person , or $ 114,915 for a family of four . ”
Energy Rationing Ahead ?
Steve Milloy , co-director of the Free Enterprise Project at the National Center for Public Policy Research and publisher of JunkScience.com , foresees a particularly bleak future of contrived shortages , a higher cost of living , and less personal freedom .
“ Worse than the increased cost of energy , perhaps , is that the Waxman - Markey bill will essentially result in artificial limits on energy production and , ultimately , electricity rationing , ” Milloy predicts .
“ The bill will create a permanent energy crisis . ”
This will necessarily lead to restrictions on personal activities .
“ A nation ’s standard of living is ultimately based upon the use of energy , be it for work or play , ” writes naturalist William Hunt , in a piece for NewsWithViews .
Cooking , heating one ’s house , mowing the lawn , cooking , driving to the grocery store , going to the beach on the weekend – “ All of these represent freedoms , both nationally and personally .
The ability to get into a car and drive is an incredible freedom that most of the world does not have , ” Hunt observes .
If the price of gasoline is artificially increased 58 percent , low - income families and individuals would be hard - pressed to pay for it and forced to change their driving habits , perhaps giving up driving altogether .
“ These , and indeed all other measures suggested by politicians , regulators and NGOs to deal with global warming [ cap and trade , carbon taxes ] are about controlling what you do with your life by controlling energy , ” says Hunt .
“ All such things do is to raise the price consumers have to pay for basic needs .
They harm the poor most of all by hitting them by raising the costs for basic costs like heat , light , water , sewer , food , gasoline for commuting to work , and every consumer good — clothes , soap , cars , everything . ”
Waxman - Markey vs. the Laws of Thermodynamics
“ What they ’re doing is raising the cost of traditional energy so high that it would be feasible to invest in alternate technologies , ” says Andrew Moylan .
“ Today , alternative technologies – as great as they may seem to people – are very expensive .
It ’s not that people desperately want to destroy the environment that they ’re not investing in them .
They do n’t invest in them because they ’re extremely expensive .
So if you raise the cost of traditional energy so high that it makes other technologies more palatable in terms of cost , there ’s going to be more investment in those . ”
Whether these will work or not is another question .
Keith Rattie , CEO of Utah - based Questar Corp. , is one of the many global - warming skeptics who does n’t think they will , and he explained why in a talk he gave to the graduating class of Utah Valley University this April .
Said Rattie : “ Why has my generation failed to develop wind and solar ?
Because our energy choices are ruthlessly ruled , not by political judgments , but by the immutable laws of thermodynamics .
In engineer - speak , turning diffused sources of energy such as photons in sunlight or the kinetic energy in wind requires massive investment to concentrate that energy into a form that ’s usable on any meaningful scale .
“ What ’s more , the wind does n’t always blow and the sun does n’t always shine .
Unless or until there ’s a major breakthrough in high - density electricity storage – a problem that has confounded scientists for more than 100 years – wind and solar can never be relied upon to provide base load power . ”
The Fundamental Question
And in the end , will it be worth it ?
“ That ’s the issue , ” said Moylan .
“ I ’m no climate expert , but the folks who are say that even if everything goes according to their plan – which is unlikely – global temperatures might be reduced by one - tenth of one degree by the year 2050 .

Enter Your E - Mail Address :
“ I guess that ’s the fundamental question :
Is one - tenth of one degree reduction in temperature under the best of circumstances worth $ 2 trillion in costs ?
I would say no .
I would hope that most rational people say the answer is no .
But it seems symbolism has been elevated above science in the debate . ”

Actually , I heard that Gore and his aids overheard someone , maybe even W. , threatening Gore 's life , when he retracted his concession over the phone .
I briefly counter protested the VP mansion brown shirts myself and met the amazing local legend lone Nazi pedophile Vatican embassy protester across the street .
The coincidence is a divine warning , because our fascist MSM has kept Americans completely ignorant of the Vatican 's massively treasonous and genocidal support of Nazis before , during and after WWII .
Google Vatican bank claims for jaw - dropping revelations .
I spoke with Vatican protester , John Wojnowski , for a few hours , and he told me Italy was overrun with fascist priests after WWII .
We shared our puzzle pieces on Catholic fascism , and he agreed the ban on abortion and family planning was to keep pedophile priests supplied with fresh victims like himself .
The Vatican endorsed Catholic Hitler because he stiffened abortion and contraception penalties .
Americans have several options that most people are too nice and timid to try .
But here it goes : use their same tactics against them .
This means picketing Catholic churches and the homes of adulterous mother - and doctor - killers Randall Terry , Erik Prince and Bill O'Reilly about their pedophilia , adultery , mother - killing and Nazi ties .
Pester their wives and children too to turn them against each other .
Picket and boycott MSM and their advertisers for not exposing the Nazi and pedophile motivations behind anti-abortionists .
Pester Hollywood to make feature films of " Unholy Trinity " by Mark Aarons and John Loftus , the nasty private lives of Erik Prince , Randall Terry , Newt Gingrich , the Bushes , etc. Educate women about childbirth 's bankrupting , divorce - causing and sometimes lethal complication like fistulas and cancer .
We should steal tea bagging from them by counter protesting their hypocritical caffeinated tea ABORTIONS !

Brad , everyone , I think these Brown Shirts at the meetings and spamming their invective here are actually working with Obama and the Blue Dogs [ and , of course , the people paying for their campaigns ] to get a bill that is little more than mandatory health insurance and the government decides who can't afford it .
Believe me , you do n't want the government deciding what you can afford .
They give you a food allowance equal to a sack of rice and a sack of beans every month and make sure that if you can still have a roof over your head it is in a slum or it 's better described as a tent .
And that was back when times were much better , when the economy was hale and the liberals were in charge of Congress .
Do n't go crazy calling them racists and bubbas and stupid hicks who vote against their own best interests .
That 's only making you feel better about yourself and not getting any problems addressed .
This is a very well - funded and serious attack on the American people by plutocrats ... by the very above - the - law elite they had in Italy and Germany and now the United States .
Please .
Get serious this time .

Calling ordinary Americans , who really have no party preference or affiliation a right wing mob , and Nazi brown shirts is another Marxist tactic , and we are seeing the worst of what that can be right now .
To call these people unamerican is simply wrong ; these people are as American as American gets .
When the Democratic Socialist have the same behavior , by them it is deemed reasonable .
And when they do it , it is organized .
These angry people are not organized .
They are operating as individuals , and the government is going crazy trying to malign them as belonging to some antiamerican neonazi mob .
They have had it with Obama and his Socialist / Communist lies .
They are angry about the notion of socialized health care , and so am I .
We the people are paying for it .
Why can't we keep the freedom to make our own choices .
We are angry about the fact that illegal immigrants will be given free medical care , and I say free because most have n't paid one nickel into the system .
We will pay trillions for this system , the level of care for real , taxpaying citizens will go down , Medical organizations profits will go up , and the government will have another layered system of total control and will decide , literally , who lives and dies .
Do n't buy into the governments hype and lies .
Many democrats understand what they are up to and they are against it too .
It seems they are trying to fan the flames of civil unrest and get the people trying to fight each other .
Let the Communists that have taken over our government know that we know what they are up to , and just say NO !

Where do you think Obama 's million man civillian army will come from ?
They will be recruited from the ghettos and barrios of America .
They will be well fed and taken care of by our now Communist government , while the evil , racist white Americans who now have no job , no money and for many no home will be treated like the Jews of Nazi Germany .
They will be little more that the new and improved , and greatly enlarged black panthers , and the brown berets on steroids .

Mike , maybe you should actually read this article which is from one of your former psychophants .
You apparently missed his point altogether .
I have 2 questions

2 . Does the healthcare / health insurance industry in any way support Freedomworks ?

In watching this effort to simultaneously shut - down one of the oldest forms of American democracy --- the town hall meeting , while both spreading disinformation over the public airwaves while excluding meaningful discussion from single - payer advocates , I am reminded of the definition of " American fascists " provided by former VP Henry Wallace in an April 1944 New York Times op - ed : The American fascist would prefer not to use violence .
His method is to poison the channels of information .
With a fascist the problem is never how best to present the truth but how best to use the news to deceive the public into giving the fascist and his group more money and more power .
They claim to be superpatriots , but they would destroy every liberty guaranteed by the Constitution .
They demand free enterprise but are the spokesmen for monopoly and vested interest .
Their final objective toward which all their deceit is directed is to capture political power so that , using the power of the state and the power of the market simultaneously , they may keep the common man in eternal subjugation .
The hard - right of the Republican party and their corporate sponsors are " American fascists " as defined by Wallace .

Thank you , cann4ing , for the quote .
It hits the nail on the head ( Fox News comes to mind ) .
The United States has for years been in this internal war of dis-information .
I 'm 56 years old and I do n't think I 've ever seen the American version version of the brown - shirts become such a dominant force in disrupting the national debate on any issue as we 're seeing them now in their so far sucessful attempts at disrupting town hall meetings .
I 've never felt so compelled to get involved to save my country from these Fascists .

Comment # 11 ... Agent 99 99 may be on to something ... I 've been around long enough to know that when there is raucous noise and acrimony in the atmosphere around government .
It 's usually to distract the public 's attention from other matters ...
The Whitehouse could have shut down these teabaggin ' , town hall rioters from the start ... if they wanted to .
They could have pulled the GOP lever pullers aside and squashed this ignorant uprising in it 's sleep .
Political deals and considerations and made like that all the time .
Why has n't this been chilled out yet ?
Because it 's something for the bought out main stream media to focus on , it 's keeping the sheeple 's attention ... while we 're being robbed blind and led down the garden path by fascists .
These numbnuts town hall lackies do n't realize they 're actually serving Obama and the corporate fascists who run him ....
Let the corporate backed riot mentality give Obama an excuse for doing NOTHING for the people ...
Actually it 's a stunningly clever tactic ... cynical to the extreme ... but hey ; they 've had centuries to perfect their game .

Tx , BH , I got hip to the depth , breadth , extent of their cynicism back in aught six , when they took impeachment off the table and decided to keep funding Iraq so as to make * keep looking as bad as possible , looking forward to the blowout last November .
That 's [ '06 ] when I finally ran down to the registrar 's office and demanded to be un-Democratted instanter , after being a Democrat from before I was even old enough to vote .
For decades I 'd been saying that I was only a Democrat because we are at least not so cruel to the downtrodden , and then I had to even nix that terminology because life experience was teaching me that conservatives are almost always there for the downtrodden and imperiled on the up close and personal level , where liberals just flat out are n't , preferring to yell that the state should be handling it and calling the police instead of helping some poor crazy - person or homeless guy who shows up in their sphere .
I just had to settle for Democrats talking nicer ... but 2006 just scraped off all the scales left on my eyeballs and , no two ways about it , they are fucking us just as avidly as the Republicans .
Republicans prefer to make up stupid lies to dupe the public , and Democrats prefer to use noble theatrical lies to dupe the public , and both strategies arc toward the identical ends .
A third party [ aka a second party ] is no cure .
They have a lock on it .
This is a fascist country , and no one will allow that to be peacefully changed .
We are not getting our country back .

Intro
So now that everyone has their lard rendered let ’s make some shortbread .
Wait .
What ?!
You have n’t rendered your lard yet ?
I understand .
Some people are less than thrilled to be fondling pig fat .
If you have n’t gotten around to producing your own batch of the white gold then do yourself a favor – make some bacon .
Enjoy said bacon .
Maybe even make some bacon caramels .
Or a BLT since there is no better time to bite into a tomato so sweet it ’s as if the sun itself has been feeding the ruby orbes spoonfuls of sugar .
But whatever you do do not throw out your bacon fat .
Nothing goes to waste – especially not the salty , smoky and creamy drippings that come from cooking bacon .
Use the fat to cook your eggs , butter your toast with it , grab and spoon and eat it – well , not really – that ’s gross .
Make shortbread with it .
The other night I had a vision – covered in sugar .
Inspiration for a new dessert hit and I listened then immediately set out to make my dreams a reality .
Before all my crazy lard rendering experiments I thought about the possibility of baking with bacon fat .
I imagined the slightly salty and savory flavor would be an intriguing complement to caramel , maple , molasses and cream .
What manifested from that thought was a slight modification of David Lebovitz ’s Salted Butter Caramel Ice Cream and tender shortbread infused with bacon fat .
A grown up ice cream sandwich .
And even though they are messier than my 1 year old at meal times the taste was as exciting as the dream that inspired its birth .
The bacon flavor was subtle – just enough to let you know something was unique about these cookies .
Enough to make the complexity of the ice cream scream even louder and enough to calm the sweetness so that eating multiple ice cream sandwiches is highly possible .
On their own these cookies are fantastic .
Yielding a tenderness only possible with ample fat .
The secret ingredient will have your tasters questioning your sanity but one bite later they ’ll be eating their words – and all of your cookies so watch out for that .
In these penny pinching times do your part – do n’t waste anything – including your bacon fat .
Make cookies with it .
Bacon Fat Shortbread Cookies
adapted from epicurious.com
3/4 cup butter , room temperature
3/4 cup bacon fat , room temperature ( if you did render lard you can also use that – and good for you ! )
1 cup sugar
1/3 cup brown sugar
2 tsp. salt
3 egg yolks
2 tbl. vanilla extract
3 3/4 cup All - Purpose flour
* This recipe makes a LOT of cookies .
Feel free to cut the recipe in half or wrap some of the dough very well and freeze .
Should last at least 1 month .
In a medium bowl combine the butter , bacon fat , sugars and salt and cream until well blended or about 2 minutes .
Add the egg yolks one at a time , making sure each yolk is well incorporated before moving on to the next .
Stir in the vanilla .
Add the flour and mix until just combined .
Roll the dough into a log ( or multiple logs as this makes a hefty amount of dough ) on wax or parchment paper .
Refrigerate until firm .
If you plan to use the dough for ice cream sandwiches make sure the log is big enough to produce cookies large enough to hold plenty of ice cream .
My cookies were about 3 - 4 inches wide .
When ready to bake pre-heat your oven to 325 * .
Carefully slice the cookies 1/4 - inch thick .
Arrange on a parchment lined sheet tray and bake for 10 - 15 minutes or until the edges are golden .
* If you can find some or have it on hand try replacing some of the sugar with Maple sugar .
I ’m sure it would be completely fantastic .
David Lebovitz ’s Salted Butter Caramel Ice Cream
* I added replaced half of the sugar with brown sugar in the ice cream custard .
* I added 2 tbl .
Maple Syrup to the Caramel Praline mix-in .
This ice cream is incredibly rich .
The best homemade ice cream I have ever made – and I ’ve made more than one should be allowed in a lifetime .
The key to its rich and unique flavor is to get a deep dark color when carmelizing the sugar .
David Lebovitz is a sugar genius .
His instructions and photos hold your hand every step of the way .

From a press release
Writers and freedom of speech campaigners today expressed relief that the Government has finally relented , and agreed to abolish the offences of seditious libel and criminal defamation .
The Ministry of Justice ’s move comes after a long campaign by free speech organisations , their advocates , and opposition politicians .
The laws , which date from the time of the Star Chamber , made criticism of the Monarch or the Government a criminal offence , and were used to silence political dissent .
Like the law of blasphemy , they fell out of use in the twentieth century – but their existence in the UK does no favours to the right to free expression worldwide .
In March this year , campaigning groups English PEN , Index on Censorship and Article 19 urged the government to abolish these offences .
Amendments to the Coroners & Justice Bill were tabled in the House of Commons by Dr Evan Harris MP , and then again in the House of Lords by Lord Lester of Herne Hill , before the Government eventually accepted the case for abolition and promised to get rid of the laws themselves .
The proposed removal of these offences in the UK clears a path for campaigners to argue for their abolition overseas .
Bringing the issue to debate , Lord Lester of Herne Hill said :
Across Europe and the Commonwealth , similar offences exist and are used to suppress political criticism and dissent .
If our Parliament takes this step , it will be an example elsewhere and might also encourage the European Court of Human Rights to adopt a robust position in reviewing such laws and their operation .
Lisa Appignanesi , President of English PEN , said :
Thomas Paine would be pleased to know that 217 years after his conviction for seditious libel , the law which criminalized his ground - breaking Rights of Man , is at last poised to be repealed .
The debate in the Lords on 9th July , led by Lord Lester and following on Evan Harris ’ amendment in the Commons , marks an historic moment in our right to speak and think freely .
Criminal libel has no place in a vibrant democracy .
Dr Evan Harris MP ( Lib Dem ) , who first tabled the repeal amendments in the House of Commons said
It may be decades late in coming , but the acceptance by the Government that our retention of these repressive laws causes much more harm than good is welcome .
The UK must set an example to the world in getting rid of anti-speech offences .
The common law of seditious libel prohibits all writings and other utterances which tend to bring about hatred or contempt for the king , the Government or the constitution as by law established .
Sedition consists of any act done or word spoken or written and published which has a seditious tendency , and done or spoken or written and published with a seditious intent .
Lord Anthony Lester of Herne Hill tabled two amendments ( 177 and 178 ) to the Coroners & Justice Bill , which would remove the laws of seditious libel and criminal defamation from the statue books .
Following the statement by Lord Bach , the government will insert similar amendments at the report stage of the Bill .

Many of the largest for - profit schools are boosting their enrollment during these economic times because they are making more loans directly to cash - strapped students .
Even though , they recognize many of the loans will probably never be repaid for the amounts that were borrowed .
However , the schools still make money and profit because they increase their enrollment , which brings tuition dollars that are subsidized by the government to the schools .
Some schools that have seen their enrollment significantly increase are the University of Phoenix , Westwood College , and ITT .
ITT has seen new enrollments rise by 33 percent and seen profits increase 50 percent from last year .
Many of the students at these schools finance their education through tuition grants from the government and take out loans for the rest of their costs .
However , with the economic difficulty , it has become more difficult for students to get bank loans , so schools have stepped up and are extending credit to students .
In some cases students are getting better terms , but many have taken loans that are worse .
Students need to check around and make sure they are taking the best loan .
Go over it thoroughly and understand everything before you sign it .
For - profit schools have seen the proportion of students borrowing at least $ 40,000 nearly triple to 30 percent .
These schools are also showing that 43 percent of students took out private loans in 2007 - 08 .
College can be expensive , and students need to prepare for that .
Despite the expense , students are returning to school because they have either been laid off from work or have decided to take advantage of increased government aid .
Education is never something that invidividuals resent having .
They understand that despite the time , energy , and money it took to earn a degree , it was a wise investment in their future .
LOS ANGELES - Hundreds gathered to honour David Carradine at a sprawling hillside cemetery on Saturday during a funeral that was attended by family , former co-stars and other Hollywood friends .
The invitation - only services were held indoors at the Hall of Liberty at Forest Lawn - Hollywood Hills , a 400 - acre cemetery laid out adjacent to Los Angeles ' Griffith Park .
Mostly gloomy skies prevailed outside , with cold blasts of wind sweeping across the cemetery .
The funeral lasted more than two hours and as more than 400 mourners left , clouds parted in the west offering a magnificent sunset .
Guests gathered and hugged outside the hall , where security ensured only invited guests gained entry .
They gathered more than a week after Carradine , 72 , was found hanging in a Bangkok hotel room on June 4 .
Thai authorities continue to investigate his death .
A statement released Thursday by a private pathologist said suicide had been ruled out as a cause of death .
Carradine 's family stayed out of sight from a small group of reporters and cameras .
His burial was private .
Brothers Keith and Robert Carradine asked for privacy and understanding while the family mourned in a statement released on Thursday .
Keith Carradine briefly appeared outside before the service and greeted some people before heading back inside .
Among the hundreds of guests were numerous actors , including Michael Madsen , Jane Seymour , Tom Selleck , Frances Fisher , Daryl Hannah , Lucy Liu , Edward James Olmos , Ali Larter , and James Cromwell .
Rob Schneider also attended , carrying a basket of flowers .
Madsen and Liu both starred alongside Carradine in Quentin Tarantino 's two - part " Kill Bill " saga .
Carradine married his fifth wife , Annie Bierman , at Madsen 's home in 2004 .
Carradine is perhaps best known for his role as Kwai Chang Caine on three seasons of the 1970s hit show " Kung Fu . "
His role in popular culture was cemented by the time he left the show after three seasons in 1975 .
He later went on to star in the cult flick " Death Race 2000 " and in Ingmar Bergman 's " The Serpent 's Egg " in 1977 , but by the 1980s his career arc had moved to lower - budget fare .
He continued to foster interests in Asian herbs , exercise and philosophy , and made instructional videos on tai chi and other martial arts .
Tarantino 's " Kill Bill " films offered Carradine a career resurgence .
His role as the titular character earned Carradine a Golden Globe nomination for best supporting actor for his role in " Kill Bill -- Vol. 2 . "
Carradine 's father , John , was a character actor whose 50 - year stage and screen career began during Hollywood 's early years .
Some mourners on Saturday opted for bits of Western flair , with some sporting cowboy boots and hats and turquoise jewellery .
Keith Carradine wore a bolo tie .
Programs handed out to guests included a photo of a smiling Carradine in a tuxedo on the cover and sketch of the actor on the back , above lyrics to " Midnight Rider " by The Allman Brothers Band .
The program indicated several remembrances by Carradine 's family and song selections that included The Beatles ' " Let It Be " and Ludwig von Beethoven 's " Requiem for a Fallen Hero . "
Solar Blimp to Fly from NYC to Paris , Rests on Land or Water
July 28th , 2009 by Bryan Nelson
A Spanish company called Turtle Airships is working on plans to build a luxurious solar - powered blimp which can take passengers from New York to Paris .
Perhaps the only thing cooler than being powered by lightweight photovoltaic cells , this airship is also designed to rest on land or water .
The first blimp prototype will be propelled in two nontraditional ways .
The outside of the ship will be covered with Cadmium - Indium - Germanium ( CIG ) photovoltaic cells , picked for their their light weight .
The cells should generate enough power to move the blimp at around 40 mph in average conditions , or at around 70 horsepower .
Meanwhile , a diesel drivetrain will generate the rest of the power , and ideally the designers will look to an adapted hybrid electric model for that .
And because blimps fly at low altitudes , they do n’t have to deal with problems that plague diesel engines at elevations over 30,000 ft .
The only thing currently keeping this visionary project from flying is funding .
But Turtle Airships hopes that will change after the completion of a genuine prototype that will demonstrate the project ’s viability to funders .
“ Our goal in flying this remote control model is to get some video of it onto the Web and hopefully attract some financing that will enable us to move on from there to a genuine , manned , demonstration model of a Turtle Airship , ” said one spokesperson .
The folks at Turtle Airships do n’t like calling their aircraft a ‘ blimp ’ : “ It is a rigid shelled , amphibious , solar powered , all weather , FAST aircraft that is lifted by helium , but it is not a blimp . ”
Even so : it ’s a blimp .
Though that does n’t take anything away from the ingenuity of its design .
Their idea is certainly not one short on vision .
And who would n’t want to take a transatlantic ride on a flying luxury cruise ship powered by sunshine ?
Nasty memories of the Hindenburg aside , it may not be long before passengers are flying comfortably from New York to Paris– and beyond– aboard Turtle Airships .

PLoS Medicine and the New York Times victorious in court ; Public will have access to ghostwriting documents
A duo of standard - setting publications has achieved a stunning success in the battle to end industry tampering of medical literature .
Fifteen hundred documents that contain unprecedented detail on how articles highlighting specific marketing messages are strategically placed in the medical literature were released last weekend to PLoS Medicine and the New York Times .
The two publications , acting as “ intervenors ” in litigation against menopausal hormone manufacturers by women who developed breast cancer while taking hormones , argued that documents proving ghostwriting that were placed under seal should be made available to the public .
As PLoS Medicine Chief Editor Ginny Barbour stated in the motion , ghostwriting “ gives corporate research a veneer of independence and credibility ” and may “ substantially distort the scientific record ” ; “ threaten[ing ] the validity and credibility of medical knowledge . ”
U.S. District Judge William Wilson , in Little Rock , Arkansas , granted the motion to make discovery materials public on July 25 , 2009 .
While ghostwriters for celebrity autobiographies may do readers a service by rendering a non-writer ’s story readable , the ghostwriters who haunt medical journals represent the views of product manufacturers rather than the academic “ authors ” whose names decorate the articles .
The newly exposed documents include correspondence among academic faculty , freelance writers , ‘ medical education ’ companies and Wyeth , and include records of payment to ghostwriters and ghostwriting firms .
This treasure trove details the blow - by - blow process by which marketing messages were inserted into articles in the medical literature to promote unproven benefits of Premarin and Prempro while trivializing the risk of breast cancer .
Competing interest statement : Adriane Fugh - Berman has been a paid expert witness on behalf of plaintiffs in the multidistrict litigation against hormone manufacturers referred to in this piece .
Read the New York Times story which was published on Wednesday , 5th August and the related documents detailing Wyeth ’s use of ghostwriters .
An earlier post on Speaking of Medicine outlines the successful intervention in the court case and provides the press release from Public Justice , the law firm representing PLoS Medicine in the case .

SANA'A , Yemen ( CNN ) --
It is midday and girls are flooding out of school , but Nujood Ali is not among them .
Nujood Ali today is angry and skips school but is still relieved her defiance paid off .
We find her at the family 's two - room house in an impoverished suburb of the city where Nujood is angry , combative and yelling .
Tension surrounds the home like a noose .
After much arguing with family members , Nujood finally grabs her veil and agrees to sit down with CNN .
Her presence is grudging , although CNN had got permission in advance to see how the girl who rocked a nation by demanding a divorce was shaping up .
Nujood is very different from the girl we first met nearly two years ago .
Then , there was no doubt the 10 - year - old was every inch a child .
She was the very portrait of innocence : A shy smile , a playful nature and a whimsical giggle .
That picture was very much at odds with the brutal story of abuse she endured as a child bride who fought for a divorce and is now still fighting .
Watch Nujood tell her story to CNN on World 's Untold Stories »
Nujood says she remains relieved and gratified that her act of defiance -- which led to appearances at awards shows and on TV -- had paid off .

The story was supposed to end with the divorce and an innocent but determined girl allowed to fully embrace the childhood she fought so hard to keep .
Instead , there has been no fairytale ending for Nujood .
There was , though , a stunning transformation .
Nujood went from being a victim and child bride to a portrait of courage and triumph .
Her inspirational story was told and re-told around the world , but at home all was not well .
In the fall of 2008 Nujood was recognized as Glamour Magazine 's Woman of the Year , alongside some of the world 's most impressive women .
She even attended the ceremony in New York and was applauded by women from Hillary Clinton to Nicole Kidman .
There is a tell - all book which is to be published in more than 20 languages , and the author says Nujood will receive a good portion of the royalties .
Nujood 's strength was celebrated by complete strangers .
But what did all the fame do for the one person it was meant to transform ?
" There is no change at all since going on television .
I hoped there was someone to help us , but we did n't find anyone to help us .
It has n't changed a thing .
They said they were going to help me and no one has helped me .
I wish I had never spoken to the media , " Nujood says bitterly .
There was never going to be a fortune .
Generous people have donated thousands so Nujood could go to a private school , but she refuses to attend , according to Shada Nasser , the human rights lawyer who took on the child 's divorce case .
" I know Nujood was absent from the school .
I spoke with her father and her family .
And I ask them to control her and ask her to go every day to school .
But they said , ' You know we do n't have the money for the transportation .
Do n't have the money for the food , ' " says Nasser .
She believes Nujood is being victimized by her own family because they believe Nujood 's fame should bring them fortune .
Nujood 's parents say they 've received nothing , and in the meantime Nujood stews wondering out loud how everything turned out this way .
" I was happy I got divorced but I 'm sad about the way it turned out after I went on television , " she said adding that she feels like an outcast even among her family and friends .
Nujood was pulled out of school in early 2008 and married off by her own parents to a man she says was old and ugly .
And yet , as a wife , Nujood was spared nothing .
" I did n't want to sleep with him but he forced me to , he hit me , insulted me " said Nujood .
She said being married and living as a wife at such a young age was sheer torture .
Nujood described how she was beaten and raped and how , after just a few weeks of marriage , she turned to her family to try to escape the arrangement .
But her parents told her they could not protect her , that she belonged to her husband now and had to accept her fate .
CNN tried to obtain comment from Nujood 's husband and his family but they declined .
Nujood 's parents , like many others in Yemen , struck a social bargain .
More than half of all young Yemeni girls are married off before the age of 18 , many times to older men , some with more than one wife .
It means the girls are no longer a financial or moral burden to their parents .
But Nujood 's parents say they did not expect Nujood 's new husband to demand sex from his child bride .
To escape , Nujood hailed a taxi -- for the first time in her life -- to get across town to the central courthouse where she sat on a bench and demanded to see a judge .
After several hours , a judge finally went to see her .
" And he asked me , ' what do you want ' and I said ' I want a divorce ' and he said ' you 're married ? '
And I said ' yes . ' " says Nujood .
Nujood 's father and husband were arrested until the divorce hearing , and Nujood was put in the care of Nasser .
Indeed , it seems the judge had heard enough of the abuse to agree with Nujood that she should get her divorce .
But based on the principles of Shariah law , her husband was compensated , not prosecuted .
Nujood was ordered to pay him more than $ 200 -- a huge amount in a country where the United Nations Development Programme says 15.7 percent of the population lives on less than $ 1 a day .
Khadije Al Salame is working to help Nujood get her life back .
Now a Yemeni diplomat , 30 years ago she too was a child bride .
But when she left her husband , she did not have to endure the publicity that now haunts Nujood .
She said : " It 's good to talk about Nujood and to have her story come out , but the problem is it 's too much pressure on her .
" She does n't understand what 's going on .
She 's a little girl and we have to understand as a media people that we should leave her alone now .
If we really love Nujood then we should just let her go to school and continue with her life , because education is the most important thing for her . "
To get her divorce , Nujood showed a character and strength not easily expressed by women in Yemen , let alone a 10 - year - old child bride .
But she will need to muster all that strength and more if she 's to finally reclaim her life .
Nujood told us she thought the divorce would be the end of her struggle and she 's still angry that it turned out to be just the beginning .

Mock not .
As the regime shut down other forms of communication , Twitter survived .
With some remarkable results .
Those rooftop chants that were becoming deafening in Tehran ?
A few hours ago , this concept of resistance was spread by a twitter message .
Here 's the Twitter from a Moussavi supporter :
ALL internet & mobile networks are cut .
We ask everyone in Tehran to go onto their rooftops and shout ALAHO AKBAR in protest # IranElection
That a new information technology could be improvised for this purpose so swiftly is a sign of the times .
It reveals in Iran what the Obama campaign revealed in the United States .
You can not stop people any longer .
You can not control them any longer .
They can bypass your established media ; they can broadcast to one another ; they can organize as never before .
It 's increasingly clear that Ahmadinejad and the old guard mullahs were caught off - guard by this technology and how it helped galvanize the opposition movement in the last few weeks .
That 's why they did n't see what those of us surgically attached to modems could spot a mile away : something was happening in Iran .
If Drum is right , the mullahs believed their own propaganda about victory until reality hit them so hard so fast , they miscalculated badly and over - reached .

Ever since her resignation announcement , soon to be former Alaska governor Sarah Palin has been waxing philosophically on her Twitter account , where today ’s attempt at depth was a quote that she attributed to Plato , only it was never uttered by Plato , but instead comes from 1670 gentleman ’s etiquette guide .
When Palin and Plato collide , the results are n’t pretty .
Palin tweeted , “ So AK kids : take time to take your parents fishing : “ You learn more about a person in an hour of play than in a year of conversation ” - Plato ” According to Think Progress , this quote is often wrongly attributed to Plato .
It really belongs to Richard Lindgard .
The correct quote is , “ Take heed of playing often or deep at Dice and Games of Chance , for that is more chargeable than the seven deadly sins ;
Yet you may allow your self a certain easie Sum to spend at Play , to gratifie Friends , and pass over the Winter Nights , and that will make you indifferent for the Event .
If you would read a man ’s Disposition , see him Game , you will then learn more of him in one hour , than in seven Years Conversation , and little Wagers will try him as soon as great Stakes , for then he is off his Guard . ”

As you can see , the Palinization of the quote is not quite the same thing .
The quote itself does not mean that you get to know people better at play , but that you learn more about a person ’s character while gambling with them , then you would in seven years of conversation .
It is a terrible thing when intellectual light weights dabble in philosophy .
Anyone who seriously studies philosophy will tell you that Plato is n’t exactly light coffee table reading , but Palin seems to have gotten her dose of the great western philosopher via the pop culture bastardization of his works in various self help books .
It would appear that Palin is using her Twitter page to display her depth and intellectual side .
If this is her mission , then she is crashing and burning .
( CNN ) --
The search continued Tuesday for as many as 67 people missing after a boat carrying about 200 Haitians capsized , the U.S. Coast Guard said .
The U.S. Coast Guard intercepted this crowded boat last week and repatriated its occupants to Haiti .
The boat overturned Monday off Turks and Caicos , a British territory about 550 miles southeast of Miami , Florida .
Searchers aboard boats and aircraft have rescued 118 passengers and found 15 bodies , said Petty Officer Jennifer Johnson , a Coast Guard spokeswoman , on Tuesday morning .
The Coast Guard described the boat 's occupants as migrants from Haiti .
The overcrowded vessel was believed to have set sail from the Haitian port of Cap Haitien , the Turks and Caicos Sun newspaper reported .
The search resumed at dawn Tuesday after being suspended because of darkness Monday night , Johnson said .
The Coast Guard is contributing one boat , the 210 - foot cutter Valiant , and three aircraft to the search , Johnson said .
The aircraft are a Falcon jet out of Miami , an HH - 60 helicopter and a slow - flying C - 130 cargo plane out of Clearwater , Florida .

" If the weather and conditions are right , [ the C - 130 ] can fly really low , " Johnson said .
" It makes a fantastic search aircraft . "
Turks and Caicos authorities are using small boats in the search , she said .
About 70 people were plucked Monday from a reef near the island group , authorities said .
Four other bodies were found , though it was unclear which authorities located them .
A nurse at Myrtle Rigby Hospital in the Turks and Caicos said that about 70 people were brought there , including four who had died .
Five people were admitted to the hospital , and the others had minor injuries , the nurse said .
The Coast Guard said it intercepted another " grossly overloaded " boat , with 124 Haitians aboard , late last week in the same region .
Those migrants were returned to Cap Haitien on Monday .
Overloaded vessels can quickly lose stability and capsize , sending migrants into the water , a Coast Guard release said .

Novell is making it easier for Linux users to use content developed with Microsoft 's Silverlight media framework .
The company today rolled out a new milestone release of Moonlight , its effort to bring Silverlight to Linux .
The new Moonlight 2.0 beta adds critical new security and performance features to the release as it tracks Microsoft 's ongoing development of Silverlight for Windows version 2 and 3 .
Moonlight 1.0 officially debuted in February , while the first Moonlight 2 preview went public in May .
With the Moonlight 2 beta , Novell is now declaring the release to be feature - complete , and the software now enters a bug - hunting and stability phase ahead of a general release .
" We 're pleased that we 've got this release only nine months after Microsoft Silverlight 2.0 went public , so we 're not lagging that far behind , " Miguel De Icaza , Novell Moonlight 's project leader , told InternetNews.com .
" We 're feature - complete , and that means we pass all the Microsoft tests that they gave us -- those are tests for the graphical and audio components .
We 're coming out with this in beta , because this is the first time we 're doing a broad release of Moonlight 2 and we 're sure we 'll run into bugs . "
De Icaza added that he expects the bug - testing period to last two months , so a final Moonlight 2 will be available by the time of Microsoft 's Professional Developers Conference ( PDC ) in November .
One of the biggest items added to Moonlight 2 beta since its May preview is a security - verification check to ensure that unauthorized code wo n't run .
" The verifier is the piece that ensures when you download a piece of code , that code wo n't do something illegal , " De Icaza said .
The new verifier technology will also make its way upstream to Mono , Novell 's effort to create a Microsoft .NET implementation on Linux , De Icaza said .
Microsoft 's proprietary codecs
A key element of the Silverlight framework is its ability to handle high - quality video and audio codecs .
Thanks to a deal worked out between Microsoft and Novell , Moonlight includes the Microsoft Media Pack , which is a set of proprietary codecs that Microsoft is making available to Moonlight users , free of charge .
As a result , the codecs installed through Moonlight are actually licensed by Microsoft , which in turn has licensed the video and codecs technology from its respective patent holders .
" Novell is not actually paying Microsoft for the codecs , and in a manner of speaking , Microsoft is footing the bill for the codecs , " De Icaza said .
" That being said , if people really do n't want to use the binary codecs from Microsoft and they feel they do n't need the license for the codecs , Moonlight can be compiled directly by end users , and users could choose to find an open source implementation of those codecs . "
While proprietary codecs are part of Moonlight 2 , Microsoft 's Silverlight 3 includes some changes that make it more compatible with open source media codecs .
" In Silverlight 3 , Microsoft added a fully pluggable media framework , " De Icaza said .
" So you could write a hook for open source Ogg Vorbis codec or other codecs .
In Moonlight 2 , we 've already gone ahead and implemented the Silverlight 3 pluggable approach .
So technically , Moonlight 2 is not a one - to - one match with Silverlight 2 , it 's somewhere in between Silverlight 2 and 3 . "
Microsoft released Silverlight 3 in July .
As for when Moonlight 3 will hit development , De Icaza expects that the first Moonlight 3 preview will available by the time of Microsoft's PDC , just as Moonlight 2 hit general availability .
Arnold Schwarzenegger in his prime with a wig - wearin ’ female friend Joyce Gibson ( AKA Alexis Love in the porn world ) , circa 1970s .
.
Say what you will about Arnold– he ’s always spoken his mind , whether people can handle it or not .
Remember the 1977 interview with Oui magazine ?
I ca n’t print it here , man .
Crazy , crazy stuff .
The guy ’s an animal .
Schwarzenegger learned early on that if you ’re beautiful , charismatic and powerful – you can say or do just about anything , with a big cheesy smile on your face .
All that aside , he ’s an icon who put bodybuilding on mainstream America ’s map .
Yes , there were definitely others before him– but Arnold took it beyond just sport & physical fitness .
He made it sexy and entertaining like no one else .

.
Pumping Iron is an absolute pop culture classic ( video after the jump ) .
You get to witness the world of bodybuilding arguably at it ’s peak– with all the twisted and intense– competitiveness , silliness and drama that sums up our human nature .
At times these brutes are fierce , and other times they ’re like primping girls at a beauty pageant vainly craving recognition– only much bigger .
And do n’t forget , this is a sport that comes with a lot of pain & sacrifice .
You have to credit them for the years of dedication and intense training – whether it ’s your thing or not .
Bodybuilding legends – Arnold Schwarzenegger and Franco Columbo
.
Arnold is such a friggin ’ peacock in this film– it ’s pure hedonist pleasure to watch .
He was the man , and no one questioned it .
There were guys with better physiques , more muscular , had better arms , chest , whatever – but Schwarzenegger was the total package , and a charismatic and commanding on at that .
This movie put him on the map , and definitely launched his celebrity success and film career .
A
Franco Columbo and Arnold Schwarzenegger before facing off– can you feel the tension ?
.
There are other legends featured as well who ’ve had varying levels of stardom .
There ’s poor little Franco Columbo who wanted out from under Arnold ’s shadow so badly .
They were friends , but even still– the tension between them was enough to make you queasy .
I have fond memories of Franco in the old “ strong man ” comptetitions .
As a kid , there ’s nothing better than watching humungous guys with funny names tow buses and and carry small cars across the finish line with veins the size of rope bulging from every part of their bodies .
Big Lou Ferrigno , of Incredible Hulk fame , felt pretty green on the big - time circuit– his Italian Brooklynite Dad was such a strong influence on his kid , and towed him around like the prize bull with a ring through its nose .
I ’ve always liked Lou , it ’s hard not to .

Post by ILO on 07/20/09 at 3:55 pm
All families are weird in their own ways , but my parents were weird in a perhaps more uncommon way than most : neither of them was , in any meaningful way , parented .
The Man of Concrete 's parents were alcoholic brawlers who spent most of his childhood in jail ; he and his sister fell through the cracks and he , at the age of 8 , had to become the parent of his 10 year old sister .
Even younger than that , Mom 's parents sold her into a life of domestic slavery and ( I strongly suspect ) sexual abuse .
I mention this not to elicit sympathy or disgust , but to elicit curiosity about one fact : this means they came to parenting about as close toas it is possible to come .
Parenting was entirely theoretical to them , something they'd heard about from other people , something they 'd seen in movies , something they 'd read about in books , but not something that either of them had experienced themselves .
And so they made some ...... decisions about how they would parent their children , decisions that gave relatively - crazy me and my relatively - sane sister both interesting advantages that almost nobody else has , and also interesting disadvantages that almost nobody else can identify with .
For now , though , I want to concentrate on one of the advantages .
( Or , well , at leastconsider it an advantage . )
It came up in conversation the other night when I finally got a chance to showandmost of one of my favorite documentaries of all time , Mark Achbar 's and Jennifer Abbott 's 2003
And when we got to chapter ( PDF ) 11 , " Basic Training , " on the subject of the use of child psychologists as consultants to the advertising industry , specifically about training children to nag their parents into buying things that the parents do n't want to buy , that I turned to , the only person in the room who had actually raised children that age .
And in the course of that conversation , I was very vividly reminded of just how special The Man of Concrete really was , because I have yet to meet anybody else who was parented in the same way on this exact issue .
You see , it started with one flatly simple rule : there was only one 100 % certain and reliable way for either my sister or myself to flatly guarantee that we would not get something , and that was to ask for it more than once .
Period .
And Dad made very nearly absolutely 100 % certain that there were to be no exceptions to this .
We were raised from a very early age to understand that we were going to be held to a higher standard than inferior people were .
We were told that there are people who nag other people into giving them their way -- bad people .
Inferior people .
People too stupid to win their argument any other way .
People not like me and my sister .
And , we were told , there are people who give in when they 're nagged , who give people what they want against their will , coerced by the nagging -- bad people .
Inferior people .
People too stupid to insist that an argument be rational instead of merely repeated , people too weak willed to stand up for themselves , people so averse to pain that they 'd set themselves up for future blackmail - by - nagging by setting a bad precedent , by giving in .
People not like our parents .
Twice , exactly twice , per year we were allowed to ask for things : we were allowed to ask for one reasonably - priced item for our birthdays , and we were allowed to ask for a list of a certain number of things ( I forget how many ) plus a short list of alternates or fall - back choices for Christmas .
We were asked what we wanted for our birthdays about a month out .
We were asked what we wanted for Christmas when the Sears " Wish Book " Christmas toy - advertising circular came out .
Any other time ?
We learned , and learned the hard way , that it was n't even smart to ask for somethinglet alone twice .
My parents were quite generous people ( considering the gaping top - secret hole in the budget they had ) , and not just to my sister and to me but to everybody in their lives .
But you never , ever got what you nagged for , and were pretty unlikely to get things you just asked for if they thought that you were trying to emotionally manipulate them into buying it .
Instead , we were given an allowance , a moderately generous allowance by the standard of the working - class neighborhood we lived in , and told that that was the family 's maximum possible affordable budget for indulgences for each of us : all of our toys except birthday and Christmas toys , all of our candy except Christmas candy , had to come out of that money .
We could spend it however we wanted , but we both learned , very early ( I want to say no later than age 5 ) and very thoroughly , that when it was gone , there just plain was no more .
( In later years , that rule very slightly relaxed , but only slightly : we were allowed to borrow against future allowances .
But only under very narrow circumstances : we had to demonstrate , with documentation , that we needed the money now because what we wanted to buy was only going to be available for a limited time or because the price was going to go up between now and when we could save up the money .
And until we 'd paid off those loans , there just plain was no allowance .
The only way we could get money above what was budgeted for allowance was by doing very specific chores , and the only chores that counted towards that were chores that my parents were going to have to pay someone else to do .
Failing that , it was up to us to do chores for any other family who was willing to pay us .
To get more money that was budgeted to us , we had to either save the family money or we had to bring money in from outside the family .
Period .
No exceptions .
Not for any reason .
Not at any age . ) I also remember quite clearly that the first time my sister or I bought something based on a TV ad and it sucked , it was treated as a teachable moment .
The first time I complained that the toy I bought was n't nearly as cool as the TV made it look , a Very Big Deal was made out of it , both parents involved , to make 100 % sure that this stayed memorable to me , and it still is 40 + years later .
They both wanted me to see , and understand , and remember , two very important things .
First of all , they wanted me to understand what personal failing , what personal sin I had committed : I had let the TV nag me into buying it .
They reminded me just how many times I 'd seen that commercial before I bought the toy , how I had n't bought the toy just because I saw it and thought it was cool , but because somebody else had yelled and played manipulative emotional tricks on me until my resistance was worn down .
I was told not to feel too bad for falling for it this once , since I was only a kid and some lessons you have to learn the hard way , but to always remember from now on : this is what happens when you let someone nag you into doing something , you always regret giving in .
And secondly , and just as importantly , they made me repeat back the implied and explicit claims that the commercials had made for this particular toy , what the commercial had lead me to believe that the toy would do for me .
And then they asked me , in minute and extensive detail , claim by claim , whether or not the toy had delivered on its promises .
I remember becoming very emotionally agitated , I remember really intense cognitive dissonance , I remember really wanting to blame myself for obviously having remembered the TV commercial wrong , and then I finally broke through : " you mean theyto me ? "
Yes , Brad , both of them said , in a voice that brooked no contradiction and in a tone that made it clear that what they were telling me wasfor me to remember : people who are trying to sell you things willto you .
I remember asking them , " How can they get away with that ?
I get in trouble when I get caught telling a lie !
Why do n't they ? "
Four decades later , after two and a half decades of studying business law , consumer protection law , and free speech law , I still think that that 's an interesting question .
But the sense of personal betrayal was intense and lasting .
I learned , over the decades since then , that if you ask a salesman , in any venue , " does your product do ( fill in the blank ) ? " he or she answers the question 100 % truthfully -- but not the question you asked .
The question they hear is , " do you want me to buy your product ? " and the answer to that question is always yes .
It 's just like when you catch a child with their hand in the cookie jar and ask them , with the crumbs still on their fingers , if they stole a cookie .
They always answer truthfully the question that they hear : " do you want to be punished ?
" These were emotionally painful lessons .
When my sister got old enough to get her own allowance and I saw her falling for TV commercials , I tried to spare her this pain .
But no , my parents were right : you can't be told these things .
You have to learn them yourself .
But once I had that taste of it , Dad also regularly went way out of his way to remind me that ( in particular ) Television advertising is expensive .
That cost gets built into the product 's price tag .
Which absolutely guarantees that somewhere out there , and your friends will probably tell you where if you ask , and if not , it 's up to you to do the research and find it : somewhere out there is someone who sells a product that 's just as good , and it costs half as much , because they 're not spending untold millions of dollars per year on TV advertising .
Only inferior people let themselves get nagged and otherwise fooled into paying twice as much for the same product .
( He also unambiguously felt the same way about enclosed shopping malls , pointing out quite accurately that mall rent is twice what strip - mall rent or free - standing store rent is , and you pay the difference there , too .
I 've run into rare exceptions to this , chains where the national headquarters sets the same price for both free - standing stores and mall stores , but it was still a good rule of thumb . )
Hewanted me to understand , and reminded me often , that there areany gooddeals on television .
Any time I brought one up , whether some mutual fund or brokerage , or some franchise deal , or whatever , Dad would invariably ask two questions .
" First of all , Brad , why would they tell They do n't know you .
They do n't care if you make any money or not .
If they knew of a good deal , they 'd tell their friends ; they sure as heck would n't tell you .
And secondly , Brad , if it 's such a smart thing to invest money in ?
Why are they investingmoney in TV ads instead of in that ?
" I 've had it explained to me , in painstaking detail by several people who care about me , that the anti-nagging indoctrination my sister and I received as children isthat it produces behavior in us that no corporation or its employees know how to deal with , behavior that strikes them as anti-social , defiant , self - harming , and counter - productive .
And it probably does .
But I 'll say this : it also made us bothhard to cheat or to rob .
I think this 'd be a much better world if more people had grown up with parents as relentlessly and ruthlessly anti-nagging as the Man of Concrete and his wife were , and I constantly feel sorry for people who fall for scam after scam because their parents did n't teach them the real , important , facts of life .
CINCINNATI , Aug. 25 ( UPI ) -- A Cincinnati police officer is being investigated for using a Taser on the passenger in a car stopped after a collision , police said Monday .
Officer Anthony Plummer was charged with using the Taser on Celeste Thomas , 26 , while she was on her knees with her hands in the air .
Policy dictates a Taser should only be used if a suspect is resisting arrest or has assaulted the officer , The Cincinnati Enquirer reported Monday .

" A preliminary review shows he is not in compliance with our standards and he is being investigated for unnecessary and excessive use of force , " Police Chief Thomas Streicher said .
Plummer 's police powers were revoked during the internal investigation , the Enquirer said .
He has had use - of - force complaints against him several times , resulting in a suspension and two reprimands .
He was once fired from the force , but was reinstated after an appeal .
Thomas is a daughter of City Councilman Cecil Thomas , a former police officer who heads the council 's law and safety committee .
Ever needed to lock the deadbolt behind you but did n't have a key to the door ?
Admittedly , this is n't a problem you 'll get into every day , but Instructables user Hextor has a clever solution should you ever find yourself in this situation .

How did he come to it ?
Long story short , I was brand new in my office , they had n't given me [ an ] office key yet , and I was the last one in the office .
[ I either had to ] wait 4 hours for a coworker to return or find a way to lock the door .
Jump a few years into the future , and I just recently found myself in the same circumstance , last one in the office with my wife 's car ( and keys ) so I had no office key .

With a little help from some packing tape , the second time around Hextor was on his way in 5 minutes .
Just affix the tape to your deadbolt lever on the inside of the door , fold it around the door , close the door , pull the tape , and voilà — you 've locked the deadbolt .
Simple enough , but clever nonetheless .

To those fragments of illumination we can now add “ Conquest of the Useless , ” a compilation of Herzog ’s journals from June 1979 to November 1981 , translated by Krishna Winston .
( It was first published in Germany in 2004 . )
In the preface , Herzog warns us that the entries we ’re about to read do not represent “ reports on the actual filming ” but rather “ inner landscapes , born of the delirium of the jungle . ”
Cinephiles may groan , as I did , upon discovering that he means it .
Anyone hoping for a definitive or even comprehensible account of the making and near unmaking of “ Fitzcarraldo ” is going to be sorely disappointed by the unadorned , barely annotated materials presented here .

As the curtain rises , we find Herzog at the home of Francis Ford Coppola , where he is staying while he races to finish the script .
It feels appropriate , since Coppola ’s own journey into jungle madness , “ Apocalypse Now , ” has just made its debut at Cannes .
We anticipate a moment of baton passing , one world - class filmmaker handing some sort of cursed amulet of obsession to the next .
It does n’t come .
“ Apocalypse Now ” is never mentioned .
Nor do we find out what Coppola ’s role , if any , in the future of “ Fitzcarraldo ” was intended to be .
Nor do we learn what exactly has brought Herzog to his doorstep .
It never gets easier .
Important figures arrive , then vanish , sometimes identified by first names only , their jobs , roles and relationships to Herzog mentioned only in passing a hundred pages later , or never .
A book that cries out for interstitial explanations offers almost none , and the few that do appear only make matters worse .
“ Eight months expunged , as if I wished they had never happened , ” Herzog interjects after an October 1979 entry .
“ A year of catastrophes , personal and related to my work . ”
Two paragraphs later , we pick up in July 1980 , with no further light shed on those work - related catastrophes , although they presumably had some bearing on the story we ’re vainly attempting to piece together .
We realize things are going wrong with Robards only when Herzog abruptly refers to the actor ’s “ appalling inner emptiness ” ( which he seems to have diagnosed after Robards told him he did n’t want anyone shooting at him ) .
And we sense his admiration for Jagger , who works uncomplainingly , photographs Jerry Hall in rain - forest chic for Voguein his spare time and remains game even when a monkey bites him .
But the diaries rarely record a specific conversation , dispute or personal encounter .
Nature enthralls Herzog ; people , less so .
There is an awful lot about cows , dogs , lizards , moths and fist - size tarantulas , and anyone who has seen Herzog ’s recent documentaries “ Grizzly Man ” and “ Encounters at the End of the World ” will recognize his singular ability to evoke the beauty and ruthless savagery of the natural world .
But more workaday concerns only hum distantly in his head .
“ I went through the daily reports , ” he writes , “ and was devastated to see how little we have accomplished . ”
Absorbed as he is by thoughts of beetles and ostriches , that news , almost two years into his labors , actually surprises him .
But the befogged internal swirl of Herzog ’s mind becomes an improbably apt vantage point from which to view the history of “ Fitzcarraldo . ”
For all his maddening opacity ( “ Time is tugging at me like an elephant , and the dogs are tugging at my heart ” ) , Herzog renders a vivid portrait of himself as an artist hypnotized by his own determined imagination .
Occasionally he leaves the jungle , but he never really leaves it behind .
He stops in New York in December 1980 , anthropologically observing the dazed mourners in Central Park after John Lennon ’s death while fretting about unsigned contracts .
In England , he visits the set of “ The Shining ” and meets Stanley Kubrick , but the two men , each trapped in his own nightmarish production , do n’t really connect .
Back in Peru , he gets a telegram from Munich warning that his mother may die .
Someone steals his under­wear .
He records all this with the same benumbed neutrality .
Nothing reaches him — not other people , not the punishing weather or tribal hostilities or delays , not even his notoriously loony star .
( “ No one will ever know what it cost me to prop him up , fill him with substance and give form to his hysteria , ” Herzog writes of Kinski , concealing the full story even from his diary . )
The room was , in the French description , a “ simple . ” I had a desk , a bed , a sink , mismatched hangers and a single window that let in some welcome daylight .
The only towels were hand towels , and the shower was down the hall , in a locked , windowless closet whose key I had to request at the front desk .
It was bad , but neither hilariously bad nor charmingly bad .
At least I was well situated , around the corner from the Colonel Fabien Métro stop and walking distance from other neighborhoods .
Because of this , I spent little time in Belleville .
Instead , as always seems to happen , I wound up wandering the Marais , the former Jewish quarter that straddles the Third and Fourth Arrondissements and has , in the past 15 years , become home to innumerable galleries and fashionable boutiques .
It ’s also one of the few neighborhoods relatively untouched by Haussmannian urban planning .
The streets remain narrow and chaotic , and feel more so because of the masses of tourists bumbling about .
But though it now defines the beaten path , the Marais still holds , if not secrets , then overlooked  and inexpensive  delights .
Chief among them is the Carnavalet , one of 14 free museums run by the city , this one focusing on the history of Paris itself .
In a conjoined pair of opulent 16th - and 17th - century mansions , dozens of exhibitions track the city ’s evolution , from prehistory ( represented by fossilized canoes ) to the Middle Ages to relatively modern times ( a niche containing Proust ’s bedchamber ) .
I was captivated by an 1890 painting of the Canal St. - Martin , looking almost as it does today , mirroring the lights of buildings at night , but also by a 16th - century painting of an anti-Henri IV march by soldiers and priests at the Place de Grève .
All around them , everyday city life thrives  men cut wood , repair boats and fight over a pig .
AS I visited museums , I even tried skipping lunch à la Hemingway , who claimed fasting helped him concentrate on the Cézannes in the Musée du Luxembourg  “ to see truly how he made landscapes . ”
My hunger , meanwhile , let me focus not on Cézanne but on the Museum of Hunting and Nature , free the first Sunday of every month .
( The Louvre , the Musée d’Orsay and others offer the same deal , which President Obama took advantage of at the Pompidou . )
My stomach empty , I explored this strange collection of taxidermied animals , read arcane lore ( in late medieval France , I learned , deer had to be hunted nobly , but you could catch wolves deviously ) and admired works of contemporary art  like a Jeff Koons puppy  among the stuffed relics .
Two nights in the garret , however , was enough  I was ready to upgrade my Paris life .
I moved into the Hôtel des Arts Bastille , a fine old seven - story building with a mansard roof , Juliet balconies , an elevator and , what I was most excited by , ensuite bathrooms .
I ’d found it through Kayak.com and picked it for its looks ( rooms with jaunty orange highlights ) , location ( close enough to Bastille to be accessible , but far enough from the noisy bars ) and , above all , its price : 60 euros a night , if I booked for three nights .
Compared with the Hipotel , it felt like a five - star .
After checking in , I cracked open the tall double windows that looked down on the quiet street and breathed deeply .
The air did not smell like a toilet .
There was no hammering from next door .
There was absolutely nothing wrong with this place  but maybe nothing truly special , either .
Once I settled into these plusher surroundings , I felt ready to indulge in a slightly better life .
The sandwiches au jambon I ’d been buying for a few euros from nameless street vendors were great , as were the half - dozen fines de claire oysters I ’d consumed at a stand outside the Montgallet Métro ( 8 euros , including bread , butter and wine ) , but I ’d been dying for a traditional French bistro meal .

BitTorrent file sharing suffered another setback on a global scale Wednesday when a Dutch court ordered Pirate Bay rival , Mininova , to remove all its copyrighted works or face millions of dollars in fines .
The decision by the Utrecht District Court comes a day ahead of the planned sale of The Pirate Bay to a Swedish software concern that hopes to transform the world 's most notorious BitTorrent tracker into a pay - to - play site for content .
It was the second legal setback for the illicit file sharing scene since April , when the founders of The Pirate Bay were found guilty of facilitating copyright infringement and ordered to spend a year each in prison pending appeal .
The ruling against Mininova and its millions of users is likely to bolster content owners ' resolve to use the courts to protect their interests .
Mininova was seen by many as an alternative to The Pirate Bay .
But recently , under legal threats Mininova began removing content upon receiving takedown notices .
The lawsuit against Mininova by Stichting Brein , a Dutch copyright group , also underscores that Europe , once viewed as a copyright scofflaw haven , is no longer tolerating rampant copyright infringement on such a massive scale .
The case is also important because , with last year 's death of TorrentSpy , there are no U.S. torrent trackers even though the U.S. courts have never ruled squarely on the merits whether hosting a BitTorrent tracker or index is unlawful .
Testing those boundaries is isoHunt , a Canadian index being sued by the Motion Picture Association of America in a Los Angeles federal court .
That case has been pending nearly three years .
IsoHunt , another popular alternative to the The Pirate Bay , removes several hundred listings from its BitTorrent index each week upon requests from copyright owners .
Mininova co-founder Erik Dubbelboer said in an e-mailed statement to Threat Level that the site 's operators were surprised by the decision , given that Mininova removes content upon request .
" We are obviously not satisfied with this ruling .
The result of this ruling for Mininova is that we have to re-evaluate our business operations .
At this time , we cannot determine what this will actually entail or imply .
We will have to examine the verdict thoroughly first .
We are considering to appeal this judgment . "

The Mitchell Brothers family , which pushed all things X - rated into San Francisco 's social consciousness and was later rocked by fratricide , has recorded a tragic new chapter with the arrest of the son of one of the porn kings on charges of bludgeoning to death the mother of his young daughter .
James Raphael Mitchell of Pittsburg , the 27 - year - old son of Jim Mitchell , allegedly beat Danielle Keller to death with a baseball bat Sunday evening at the home she shared with her mother in Novato , then fled with the couple 's daughter - who turned 1 year old that day .
With police around the state hunting for him , Mitchell was arrested just before midnight after he pulled off Interstate 80 in Citrus Heights ( Sacramento County ) .
His daughter , Samantha Mitchell , was unharmed .
Keller , 29 , was found dead in her backyard just before 7 p.m. Sunday .
A blood - soaked bat was found nearby , police said .
In addition to being Samantha 's birthday , Sunday was the second anniversary of the death of Jim Mitchell , who served prison time for killing his brother and longtime business partner , Artie Mitchell .
" It 's kind of madness here , " said Terence Hallinan , the former San Francisco district attorney who knew Jim Mitchell and is representing his son .
" Nothing really makes sense . "
Trying to make a break
Keller 's mother , Claudia Stevens , described her daughter as a dedicated mother who had decided to make a clean break from James Mitchell after two years of what she called abusive behavior .
" Thank God they caught him so he can be held accountable , " Stevens said .
Mitchell was booked on suspicion of murder , child abduction and other charges .
He is being held without bail and is scheduled to be arraigned at 1:30 p.m. today in Marin County Superior Court .
Keller met Mitchell at a San Francisco nightclub , Stevens said , and they quickly became a couple .
Within a few months , Keller was pregnant .
The couple bought a home in Pittsburg , but Keller moved back in with her mother several months ago and filed a restraining order against Mitchell after a series of frightening incidents , Stevens said .
Keller had sole custody of the couple 's daughter .
Stevens said Mitchell had violated the order once before , briefly holding her and her daughter hostage at the Novato home about a month ago .
Police said that case had been forwarded to prosecutors .
Keller had been receiving counseling at Marin Abused Women 's Services and joined the Novato Mothers Club while she looked for a job , her mother said .
' He was bad news '
" She was moving on , " said Gina Stahl - Ricco , 29 , who went to Novato High School with Keller and babysat Samantha .
" She knew he was bad news , and she was afraid of him .
But she never expected this .
You do n't think that could happen with someone you once loved . "
Stevens said she will raise Samantha .
James Mitchell 's mother , Mary , said he had been distraught over not being able to see his daughter and had been enrolled in court - ordered anger - management classes .
" He was trying to be a good father , and he loved his child so much , " she said .
" He did n't want to lose her , and that 's part of why it happened .
" He was dangerous for one moment , and he went too far . "
James Mitchell is listed on jail records as a theater owner .
An employee of the Mitchell Brothers O'Farrell Theatre , the San Francisco porn venue founded in 1969 by Jim and Artie Mitchell , said James Mitchell was a beneficiary of a trust that owns the theater .
The Mitchell brothers produced a string of pornographic movies , including " Behind the Green Door , " featuring Marilyn Chambers in 1972 .
But their outlandish partnership - recounted in books and a television movie - came to a tragic end .
Father 's conviction , death
Jim Mitchell was convicted of manslaughter and served three years in prison for kicking down the door of his brother 's Corte Madera home in February 1991 and shooting him to death .
He said that he had intended to confront Artie Mitchell over drug and alcohol abuse and that the situation had spun out of control .
Jim Mitchell died of a heart attack in July 2007 at his ranch in western Sonoma County at age 63 .
About 300 mourners came to his funeral , including former San Francisco Mayor Willie Brown .
James
Mitchell took his father 's killing of his uncle hard , his mother said .
" I had him in therapy for years , " she said .
" That was a horrible , horrible event in his life . "
Rogers Wireless said Tuesday it has begun rolling out a wireless network with top download speeds nearly three times as fast as its current network .
The mobile phone division of Rogers Communications Inc. said deployment of a network using high speed packet access plus ( HSPA + ) wireless technology has begun in the Greater Toronto Area and will expand to other regions across the country .
Rogers said the new network would improve the top download speeds to mobile phones from a maximum of 7.2 Mbps under the company 's current HSPA network to 21 Mbps .
Rogers said it is the first wireless company in North America to launch an HSPA + network and only the sixth to do so worldwide .
" The super - charged data speeds achieved with Rogers ' 21 Mbps upgrade will enable us to support more customers with the most innovative mobile services well into the future , while our customers will experience mobile broadband at speeds like what they experience at home and at work , " said Rogers Wireless president Rob Bruce .
The upgrade announcement comes as the company 's main two competitors — BCE Inc. and Telus Inc. — work to upgrade their networks to add HSPA wireless technology .
Last fall , Bell and Telus announced they would work together to overlay their existing wireless networks with HSPA , a cellular technology more popular around the world and one Rogers has been using since 2005 .
Carriers move towards next - generation networks
Bell and Telus currently use a communications standard known code division multiple access ( CDMA ) for their networks .
While CDMA technology is common in North America , most of the rest of the world uses the rival Global System for Mobile Communications ( GSM ) — of which HSPA technology is one version .
Rogers has had a tactical advantage in the Canadian wireless market over Bell and Telus because some cellphones , including Apple Inc. 's iPhone and Research in Motion 's BlackBerry Bold , are made for the GSM standard and are not compatible with CDMA .
New wireless entrants Globalive and Quebecor have both said they also plan to roll out GSM / HSPA networks when they launch in the next year , while DAVE Wireless , another new entrant , said it plans to launch the more advanced HSPA + network .
HSPA + is an improvement over HSPA and is also seen as a stepping stone to the adoption of fourth - generation Long Term Evolution ( LTE ) technology , a developing global standard for even more advanced phone capabilities and much faster speeds than currently available .
Building an LTE network is also the eventual goal of Bell and Telus and their network upgrade .
The technology behind the global standard has also become an issue nationally with Sweden 's LM Ericsson bidding for some of Nortel Network 's advanced wireless communications technology .
Over the weekend , Ericsson emerged as the victor in the auction of Nortel 's wireless business with a bid of $ 1.13 billion US , giving the company access to Nortel 's LTE , or long - term evolution , mobile technology .
Ontario Finance Minister Dwight Duncan said the LTE was partly funded with Canadian taxpayer money , and said he does n't want it going to a foreign company .
As I mentioned in Why corehackers Matters , the ability to fork and modify your own version of bleadperl -- and perhaps get it merged back into Chip 's staging tree -- opens a lot of room for experimentation .
I alluded to a minor feature branch I 've worked on for a couple of days : unilaterally enabling strict for all code not run through -e .
This is available from my strict_by_default bleadperl tree on GitHub .
You 're welcome to download it , play with it , fork it , submit patches , or do whatever you want .
If Perl is a Shinto shrine , forking is an act of love ... provided there 's a merge sometime in the future .
Playing with strictperl
To build strictperl , first clone my bleadperl tree from GitHub .
Check out the strict_by_default branch :
$ git clone git://github.com/chromatic/perl.git $ cd perl $ git checkout origin/strict_by_default
Then configure and build Perl as normal :
$ sh Configure - de - Dusedevel $ make
This will build the familiar perl binary .
Now build strictperl :
$ make strictperl
This will build a separate binary named strictperl .
If I 've written the code ( and especially the Makefile rules ) correctly , these will be two completely separate binaries with different behaviors :
$ ./ perl -e ' print $ c ' # no error $ ./ strictperl -e ' print $ c ' # no error $ echo ' print $ c ' > printc.pl $ ./ perl printc.pl # no error $ ./ strictperl printc.pl Global symbol " $ c " requires explicit package name at printc.pl line 1 . Execution of printc.pl aborted due to compilation errors .
You can use strictperl in place of regular perl any place you like ... except that several core modules are not strict safe .
In particular , Exporter and vars are the first two problematic core libraries .
Similarly , any module which does not use strict may have strictness errors when running under strictperl .
I do n't think that 's a bad thing , however ; think of it as an opportunity to make lots of code strict safe even if it does n't use strict right now .
( You could argue " Why in the world would you ever want to touch all of that code for no benefit ? "
You can also argue why you 'd want to make your C code lint - safe , or run Perl : : Critic on a codebase . )
These " errors " may not be errors in practice , but if we evaluate them all , we can note declaratively in our source code that we 've considered each one carefully and avoid further potential maintenance problems .
Right now strictperl is an experiment and a tool to help us identify these situations .
Patches and pull requests very welcome to help patch up the core modules for strict safety .
How it Works
strictperl works by changing the default hintset of nextstate nodes in the Perl 5 optree .
Do n't be scared .
The implementation is slightly ugly ( thanks to the way strict itself works ) , but it 's much less invasive or difficult than rewriting optrees as something like Devel : : Declare must do .
If you look in the strict pragma , you 'll see several auspicious lines :
my %bitmask = ( refs => 0x00000002 , subs => 0x00000200 , vars => 0x00000400 ) ; # ... sub import { shift ; $ ^H |= @_ ? bits (@_ ) : $ default_bits ; }
This code ORs together a bitmask of all of the strict features you 've requested and toggles them on in the magic $ ^H pseudo global variable .
These constants correspond to three constants # define d in perl.h :
#define HINT_STRICT_REFS
0x00000002 /* strict pragma */ /* ... */ #define HINT_STRICT_SUBS
0x00000200 /* strict pragma */ #define HINT_STRICT_VARS
0x00000400 /* strict pragma */
These hints are part of a particular type of node in the optree called a COP ( control op , I presume ) .
These are always nodes of type nextstate ; you see them often when you use B:: Concise , for example :
$ perl - MO=Concise print " Hello , world ! " 6 < @ > leave [ 1 ref ] vKP / REFC ->( end ) 1 < 0 > enter ->2 2 <;> nextstate ( main 1 -:1 ) v:{ ->3 5 <@ > print vK ->6 3 < 0 > pushmark s ->4 4 <$> const [ PV " Hello , world ! " ] s ->5 - syntax OK
Each COP contains information about the package and line number of the Perl code the next ops represent , as well as hint information such as which strict pragma features are in effect .
( They contain more information as well . )
When you modify the hints through $ ^H , you modify the flags in the previously - executed nextstate op .
( If you 're very curious , see the cop_hints member of the cop struct in cop.h .
There 's a complicating factor .
nextstate hints nest in a similar way that lexical scopes nest .
If you enable strict in an outer scope , its effect remains in place in inner scopes unless they explicitly disable it .
That 's actually fortunate , in this case .
I knew that enabling strict meant setting the appropriate hints flags when building COP nodes in the optree .
That meant modifying Perl 's parser .
My original approach was to modify the function used to create new COP nodes , a function named newSTATEOP .
That 's where I discovered the pseudo - inheritance scheme which allows strict nesting .
( I admit that I do n't understand all of its implications ) .
After a couple of blind alleys , I realized that the only way to enable strict pervasively was to find the creation point of the parentmost COP node in the optree and set these hint flags there .
Perl 5 uses a top - down parser ; it starts by matching the most general rule and descending into subrules to try to build a whole program .
The topmost rule is prog ; a program matches the progstart and lineseq rules .
progstart is simple :
progstart : { PL_parser ->expect = XSTATE ; $ $ = block_start ( TRUE ) ; } ;
You can ignore the contents of this rule .
The important point is that this is the first rule matched in a program -- a file , actually .
There 's one more piece of the puzzle .
If you look in the implementation of the newSTATEOP function , you 'll see that it uses a globalish ( interpreter - local , anyhow ) variable PL_hints to set the hints flags on the newly - created COP :
CopHINTS_set ( cop , PL_hints ) ;
Thus my patch is very simple ; progstart now reads :
progstart : { PL_hints |= PL_e_script ?
DEFAULT_CLI_HINTS : DEFAULT_PROGRAM_HINTS ; PL_parser ->expect = XSTATE ; $ $ = block_start ( TRUE ) ; } ;
PL_e_script is another interpreter - local variable which contains the text of code run with -e .
It 's empty unless the invoking command line used the -e flag .
DEFAULT_CLI_HINTS and DEFAULT_PROGRAM_HINTS
are new constants I added to perl.h :
/* which hints are in $ ^H by default */ #define DEFAULT_CLI_HINTS
0 #ifdef STRICTPERL # define DEFAULT_PROGRAM_HINTS
\ HINT_STRICT_REFS | HINT_STRICT_VARS
| HINT_STRICT_SUBS
#else # define DEFAULT_PROGRAM_HINTS
0 #endif
I made them conditional on the STRICTPERL symbol for one specific reason : the compilation rules I added to the Makefile to build strictperl define - DSTRICTPERL and rebuild the Perl 5 parser .
Thus the DEFAULT_PROGRAM_HINTS constant enables all strictures only when building strictperl .
( Yes , cautious Makefile hackers , those rules clean up after themselves so that the relevant files always get rebuilt when building strictperl and get removed after building strictperl so that any subsequent non- strictperl builds do not use object files with the wrong constants defined . )
The hardest part of this whole process was getting the Makefile rules right .
I 'm not quite sure they 're cross - platform enough , but they work with my testing .
The Value of strictperl
Was this process worthwhile ?
It was entertaining .
It gave me the chance to write code to implement a feature I believe is worth considering .
It helped me understand the optree in a bit more detail .
It gave me a good opportunity to explain some of that here .
Perhaps the best result of this process is that we now do have a Perl with strictures enabled by default .
We can experiment with that to see how writing code works in this case .
Admittedly there 's a lot of work necessary to make core libraries play nicely with strictperl , but we can do that in pieces because this is an optional feature you have to enable by default , one which does not interfere with regular perl .
Those are the kinds of experiments I want to encourage .
The Swedes are coming .
As Europe lurches to the right amid financial and climate meltdown , a horde of cool - headed Nordic warriors are riding to the rescue .
Sweden 's EU presidency from 1 July will be greeted as a breath of fresh air after the Czech leadership , what with the latter 's antics on climate change and arousal chez Berlusconi .
What the EU needs is a whiff of sense and reason .
And who better to provide it than the social - minded , climate - conscious Swedes ?
Sweden still sets hearts racing across Europe .
The " Swedish model " might bring up thoughts of a nubile blonde rather than a strong social state , but it is in the latter incarnation that my home country stirs the passions of left - leaning Europeans .
Whatever Sweden does must be right , or so reason progressive politicians and Guardian journalists – not to mention scores of Swedes .
But beyond this blue - eyed vision lurks a darker reality .
Sweden 's conservative coalition government has stood still as the financial crisis has engulfed the country .
Jobs , social services and healthcare are eroding .
The Sweden Democrats – the equivalent of the BNP – are on the rise .
The social state is failing .
The Swedish dream is no more .
Swedes were roused from this dream with the 1986 assassination of prime minister Olof Palme .
Palme might have left behind " a country where no one was poor and no one had room for optimism " as Andrew Brown puts it , but it was Sweden 's homemade financial meltdown of the 1990s that finally killed off the dream .
Poverty was added to the pessimism .
Savage cuts hit schools , unemployment rocketed , the krona sank – leaving the social system in a disarray from which it has not recovered .
The conservative government at the time has lately been praised worldwide for its handling of the crisis .
Actually the bankers were rewarded , not punished , while the rest of the country is still reeling from the cuts , selloffs and dashed dreams the crisis provoked .
But the idea of a well - oiled Swedish model insulated from the shockwaves of capitalism runs on like a Volvo .
The reality , like troubled , Ford - owned Volvo itself , is more globalised and gloomy than that .
Take healthcare .
Swedes do not enjoy free public care : it costs to see a GP .
That is , if you manage to see one .
Queues are long and scandals rack the system .
Psychiatric care , the source of many such scandals , has a near - medieval penchant for authoritarianism with few European equivalents .
People are locked up for months for not taking medicine , given no therapy , and spat out of the system into despair and destitution .
The mentally ill die in wards and in outpatient isolation .
And they do not even have charities to turn to because state - run healthcare is supposed to work : this is Sweden , after all .
Those who do enjoy Sweden 's second - rate public services are lucky .
Undocumented migrants , who lack a " personal number " , are barred from day - to - day healthcare .
Foreigners do not fit easily into a social system built on the postwar notion of the folkhem , or people 's home , whose rightful inhabitants are the native Swedes .
Despite the xenophobic right 's lack of electoral success , Sweden is divided between those inside the system and those outside it – including the asylum seekers now deported en masse to Iraq .
But migrants should be happy to be here .
This is Sweden , after all .
Even being in the system is less rewarding than it was .
Unemployment benefits are falling behind those of other countries , and access to social security involves Big Brother - style controls most Europeans would abhor .
The state 's iron grip remains even as the care that used to go with it has gone .
Swedes might lack Britain 's profusion of CCTVs , but their lives are scrutinised by an armada of bureaucrats .
A new law lets authorities tap all phone and internet traffic crossing the borders .
Norwegian lawyers have sued over privacy infringement , leaving the prime minister perplexed – because in Sweden , the state is there to help us .
Just as Sweden was in the vanguard of postwar social democracy , it has since the 1990s become a neoliberal experiment .
The experiment has failed , though this fails to register in Sweden itself .
No waves rock the stagnant pools of officialdom : strikes are almost unheard of and the tabloids are too busy flogging diet tips to bother .
The Swedes can not let go of their belief in the system .
Nor can many on the European left .
Admittedly , Sweden might seem a haven of tranquillity compared with other European states .
But in the hunt for a humane social model , Sweden no longer provides the blueprint .
Europe 's progressives will have to construct something new .
But to do that , those who let their minds drift northwards for inspiration first have to wake up : the Swedish dream is over .
Yesterday ( Monday , July 27 , 2009 ) evening at 6:30 , taking 40 minutes , around 3,000 police ( out of a total of 9,000 cops surrounding the factory ) and the fire department conducted a coordinated drill to simulate a " safe " retaking of the factory .
But in the process , cops inched closer to the factory , securing positions within 30 meters of the paint department .
A SWAT team of 50 cops also participated .
*** Update Tuesday , July 28 , 2009 ***
The latest report from strike supporters say there are 785 workers in the factory , made up of both those regular workers who are being laid off as well as casualized workers who joined the struggle in solidarity .
Official document showing police coordination with hired thugs and scabs to retake the factory :
Members of the Korean Democratic Labor Party ( KDLP ) came in the morning to support the factory occupation , bringing water for the strikers .
In approaching the factory gates , they scuffled with Ssangyong employees .
In solidarity , they are conducting a sit -in at the factory gates until the water is delivered to the strikers occupying the factory .
Water bottles scattered by company goons :
The strikers in the factory have continued to demand a non-militarized area in the factory to resume the promised negotiations .
Management has not responded ; the company continues to be under court receivership , because of the litigation of its creditors .
Because of the court 's authority over the situation , management is able to use this as an excuse to refuse negotiations .
The Korean state and the Shanghai Automotive Industry Corporation ( SAIC ) , which owns 51 % of the company , while being responsible for resolution also refuse to treat it as a labor dispute .
*** Monday , July 27 , Report ***
Coordinated drill of cops and fire department :
As part of the drill , 2 helicopters poured large amounts of liquid teargas on the roof of the factory :
Pigs securing positions closer to the occupied factory :
Water canon truck at front of assault sprays water as part of drill :
Cops behind portable shield structures get closer to striker barricade blocking passage between factory buildings :
After drill finished , family members shout encouragement to strikers :
The strikers also stated that they are not returning slingshot fire coming from the non-striking workers who are company loyalists ( " kasudae " ) , many of whom are in offensive positions on roofs near the paint department .
They refused to attack them back because they are also workers , however much they hate them as scabs and betrayers .
The International Labor Organization formally requested that the South Korean government stop the police violence and enter into negotiations for a peaceable settlement of the dispute .
The government labor minister has stated that the factory occupiers are not fighting for their jobs or workers rights , but are instead engaged in a battle to further their " political ideology . "
This is typical of the state 's demonization of strikers as being manipulated by subversive elements not involved in the Ssangyong situation .
Apple said third - quarter sales rose to $ 8.34 billion , up from $ 7.46 bilion a year ago , due in part to strong sales of the iPhone .
Net income rose to $ 1.23 billion , up from $ 1.07 billion .
However , the company said iPod shipments fell 7 % to 10.2 million .
During the call , Apple executives talked about the iPhone shortage , their dislike of netbooks and how the iPhone is cannibalizing the iPod .

I watch a video like this - thoughtful doctors pointing out the pressing need for health care reform - and I just have to shake my head at the travesty we have instead .
I 'm especially furious at the obstructionist role taken by the Blue Dogs , the quasi-Democrats .
The thing is , the Blue Dogs are not negotiating in good faith - that is , they are not trying to improve health care - or people 's lives , unless that person is an insurance company lobbyist .
It 's about money and influence , and how much they 're willing to do to get it and keep it .
Nice to see prostitution pays off !
On June 19 , Rep . Mike Ross of Arkansas made clear that he and a group of other conservative Democrats known as the Blue Dogs were increasingly unhappy with the direction that health - care legislation was taking in the House .
" The committees ' draft falls short , " the former pharmacy owner said in a statement that day , citing , among other things , provisions that major health - care companies also strongly oppose .
Five days later , Ross was the guest of honor at a special " health - care industry reception , " one of at least seven fundraisers for the Arkansas lawmaker held by health - care companies or their lobbyists this year , according to publicly available invitations .
The roiling debate about health - care reform has been a boon to the political fortunes of Ross and 51 other members of the Blue Dog Coalition , who have become key brokers in shaping legislation in the House .
Objections from the group resulted in a compromise bill announced this week that includes higher payments for rural providers and softens a public insurance option that industry groups object to .
The deal also would allow states to set up nonprofit cooperatives to offer coverage , a Republican - generated idea that insurers favor as an alternative to a public insurance option .
At the same time , the group has set a record pace for fundraising this year through its political action committee , surpassing other congressional leadership PACs in collecting more than $ 1.1 million through June .
More than half the money came from the health - care , insurance and financial services industries , marking a notable surge in donations from those sectors compared with earlier years , according to an analysis by the Center for Public Integrity .
A look at career contribution patterns also shows that typical Blue Dogs receive significantly more money -- about 25 percent -- from the health - care and insurance sectors than other Democrats , putting them closer to Republicans in attracting industry support .
Most of the major corporations and trade groups in those sectors are regular contributors to the Blue Dog PAC .
They include drugmakers such as Pfizer and Novartis ; insurers such as WellPoint and Northwestern Mutual Life ; and industry organizations such as America 's Health Insurance Plans .
The American Medical Association also has been one of the top contributors to individual Blue Dog members over the past 20 years .
Many liberal Democrats and advocates of health - care reform were angry about the compromise bill and view the Blue Dogs as being too cozy with drugmakers , hospitals and insurers , and they argue that the conservative Democrats should be more supportive of the agenda set by President Obama and Democratic leaders .
" The Blue Dogs are carrying water for the industry instead of their constituents , " said Richard Kirsch , national campaign manager for Health Care for America Now , a liberal pro-reform group .
" In effect , the Blue Dogs and the Republicans are taking positions that are closer all the time and further away from what most Americans want . "
The Khrushchev Connection Who Ordered the Construction of the Berlin Wall ?

" Hawaii 's illegal use of electronic voting machines and the illegal transmission of vote results over the Internet " has been halted , following a decision from Judge Joseph E. Cardoza , who issued an injunction last night , according to Disappeared News .
As Larry Gellar reports from our 50th state ...
The suit ( Babson v. Cronin , Civ No. 08-1-0115 ( 3 ) ) was brought by attorney Lance Collins on behalf of five citizens of Maui against Hawaii ’s Chief Elections Officer ( see background on Disappeared News in these articles ) .
The suit challenged three aspects of the voting process , according to attorney Collins :
1 . The use of electronic voting machines was not adopted through lawful rulemaking in accordance with the Hawai'i Administrative Procedure Act ( HAPA ) .
2 . The use of the Internet and / or telephone lines to transmit vote counts was not adopted through lawful rulemaking ( HAPA ) .
3 . The use of the Internet and / or telephone lines to transmit vote counts is not allowed under current state law .
...
An administrative hearing officer last year , in a ruling that was “ extremely critical of Kevin Cronin , the state 's chief elections officer ” ( Honolulu Advertiser , Voting - machine deal in jeopardy , 8/10/2008 ) , found that the Office of Elections acted in bad faith in awarding the contract for voting computers to Hart .
The contract was to be cancelled at the end of the year .
This new ruling by Judge Cardoza adds that the machines were used in a way that is contrary to Hawaii law .
Currently I am at the Melbourne Writers Festival and thus I am fielding many questions about writing and publishing .
I noticed again that many of the questions unpublished writers ask are coming at it from the wrong end of the stick .
Ally Carter calls this asking the wrong questions .
For instance , after yesterday ’s event an adult came up to me and explained that they are an aspiring writer working on their first novel .
They said they wanted my advice but the questions they asked really confused me :
What ’s the best way to get started writing fan fiction ?
How do you build up a following ?
Should I be using wordpress , livejournal or blogger ?
It took me awhile to realise what was going on .
They wanted to know what to do to get a publisher ’s attention .
And they had decided the best way to do that was to reverse engineer other writers ’ successes .
Two of their favourite writers had started out as fan fiction writers and developed big followings .
Another of their favourites was a blogger who had sold a novel they had first posted on their website .
The problem with that plan is that there only a handful of writers in the entire world who got published that way .
You ’d be better off buying lottery tickets .
Besides which , none of those writers did it on purpose .
They wrote fanfic because they loved it .
They blogged for the same reason .
Because they loved it and were good at it they developed a following .
None of them blogged and wrote fanfic in order to develop a following .
I stood there , mouth agape , trying to figure out how to respond to these wrong questions .
Should I tell this aspiring writer that they had the cart so far in front of the horse that the two were never going to meet ?
Instead I asked AW a question :
Justine : “ How many novels have you written ? ” Aspiring Writer : Silence .
Justine : “ Have you written one novel ? ” AW : “ Well , um , I ’m halfway into my first one . ”
Justine : “ You do n’t have a finished draft ? ” AW : “ No . ”
I told the AW about how I started at least twenty novels before I finally finished one .
I did not sell the first novel I completed .
Or my second .
I sold my third novel .
I know many , many writers who sold their fifth , eight , or twentieth novel first .
The majority of published writers did not sell the first novels they wrote .
I explained how bad it is for you to start thinking about marketing and promotion before you ’ve even learned whether you can finish a novel .
It will do your head in .
It ’s bad enough angsting about all that stuff when you do have published novels .
I think I got through to AW .
I think I finally know how to get other wrong question asking aspiring writers back on to right questions .
From now on I am going to ask them how many novels they ’ve written .
Sevilla 's top scorer Luis Fabiano will miss the King 's Cup final against Atletico Madrid after failing to recover from a thigh muscle injury in time , the Spanish club said on Monday .
The 29 - year - old picked up the injury while warming up for Sevilla 's game at Almeria on Saturday and while his absence will be a big blow for his club he said fans of Brazil need not worry about his fitness .
" I 'm relaxed , and Brazilian fans can also stay calm because I 'll be 100 percent at the World Cup , " he said in a statement .
Story continues below advertisement
Fabiano is a key figure in Brazil 's plans for South Africa , and although he was making a good recovery , they demanded he was released to join up with the rest of Dunga 's squad , Sevilla said on their website ( www.sevillafc.es).
Sevilla will also be without Spain striker Alvaro Negredo , who was sent off during the 3 - 2 victory over Almeria for protesting a decision .
Negredo's third straight red card of the season will not have done his chances of making Vicente del Bosque 's final 23 - man squad for South Africa any good .
Both Atletico and Sevilla have had to request permission for World Cup - bound players to be released for the Cup final at the Nou Camp , because of the date chosen by the Spanish football federation for the event .
National teams take priority this week , unless a side is playing in the Champions League final , and Atletico have also been sweating over the availability of some of their top players .
Argentina have given permission for striker Sergio Aguero to play , but Atletico are still awaiting confirmation from Portugal with regards to midfielders Simao and Tiago , and from Uruguay for top scorer Diego Forlan , the club said in a statement .
All three have been included in Quique Sanchez Flores 's squad .
Story continues below advertisement
After undergoing treatment on his injury , Fabiano will join the Brazil squad in Curitiba on Friday .
" I will have intensive treatment in the coming days and I 'm sure I 'll be fine for the Brazilian national team on Friday , " he said .
" I 'm disappointed ... but I 'm going with a clear conscience because I gave my best for the club this season and just did not go to the game because it was vetoed by the medical department . "
The Hungarian Grand Prix was Nelson Piquet Jnr ’s last start for Renault , according to sources at the team .
His replacement has not been officially confirmed but is expected to be Renault Development driver Romain Grosjean .
Piquet ’s replacement will either race at Valencia or Spa - Francorchamps , depending on whether the team ’s appeal against its ban is successful .
Grosjean , currently second in GP2 , drove for the team in one of their allocated straight - line tests this week ( Pics on Britson Pole ) .
As discussed here earlier today , Piquet ’s future at the team has been in doubt for some time .
Indeed many were surprised when he was given a second season with the team .
He is the second of the rookies of 2008 to be dropped by his team within the space of a month .
Fellow 2008 debutante Sebastien Bourdais had his Toro Rosso contract terminated after the German Grand Prix .
Promoting Grosjean would continue Renault ’s practice of elevating young drivers to their squad via GP2 .
Heikki Kovalainen was the first , being placed in the squad in 2007 .
After a shaky start he soon began out - performing Giancarlo Fisichella and brilliantly held off Kimi Raikkonen for second in the pouring rain at Fuji .
But nonetheless he was dropped to make way for Piquet along with Fernando Alonso .
Piquet who , like Kovalainen , was a GP2 championship runner - up , scored one podium finish last year in somewhat fortuitous circumstances at the Hockenheimring .
He insists the gap between himself and Alonso is at least partly explained by his team mate getting better equipment .
Grosjean ’s GP2 form has been a little patchy .
He won the inaugural GP2 Asia championship with ease but could only manage fourth in the main series last year .
He began this year ’s campaign brightly with two wins from the first three races – but he has n’t been back to the top of the podium since .
His heavy crash at Monaco was one of a series of unnecessary incidents which have cost him valuable points .
As Piquet knows well , any such failings are brutally exposed in the cut - throat world of Formula 1 .

It was Iran 's day of destiny and day of courage .
A million of its people marched from Engelob Square to Azadi Square – from the Square of Revolution to the Square of Freedom – beneath the eyes of Tehran 's brutal riot police .
The crowds were singing and shouting and laughing and abusing their " President " as " dust " .
Mirhossein Mousavi was among them , riding atop a car amid the exhaust smoke and heat , unsmiling , stunned , unaware that so epic a demonstration could blossom amid the hopelessness of Iran 's post-election bloodshed .
He may have officially lost last Friday 's election , but yesterday was his electoral victory parade through the streets of his capital .
It ended , inevitably , in gunfire and blood .
Not since the 1979 Iranian Revolution have massed protesters gathered in such numbers , or with such overwhelming popularity , through the boulevards of this torrid , despairing city .
They jostled and pushed and crowded through narrow lanes to reach the main highway and then found riot police in steel helmets and batons lined on each side .
The people ignored them all .
And the cops , horribly outnumbered by these tens of thousands , smiled sheepishly and – to our astonishment – nodded their heads towards the men and women demanding freedom .
Who would have believed the government had banned this march ?

The protesters ' bravery was all the more staggering because many had already learned of the savage killing of five Iranians on the campus of Tehran University , done to death – according to students – by pistol - firing Basiji militiamen .
When I reached the gates of the college yesterday morning , many students were weeping behind the iron fence of the campus , shouting " massacre " and throwing a black cloth across the mesh .
That was when the riot police returned and charged into the university grounds once more .
At times , Mousavi 's victory march threatened to crush us amid walls of chanting men and women .
They fell into the storm drains and stumbled over broken trees and tried to keep pace with his vehicle , vast streamers of green linen strung out in front of their political leader 's car .
They sang in unison , over and over , the same words : " Tanks , guns , Basiji , you have no effect now . "
As the government 's helicopters roared overhead , these thousands looked upwards and bayed above the clatter of rotor blades : " Where is my vote ? "
Clichés come easily during such titanic days , but this was truly a historic moment .
Would it change the arrogance of power which Mahmoud Ahmadinejad demonstrated so rashly just a day earlier , when he loftily invited the opposition – there were reported to be huge crowds protesting on the streets of other Iranian cities yesterday – to be his " friends " , while talking ominously of the " red light " through which Mousavi had driven .
Ahmadinejad claimed a 66 per cent victory at the polls , giving Mousavi scarcely 33 per cent .
No wonder the crowds yesterday were also singing – and I mean actually singing in chorus – " They have stolen our vote and now they are using it against us . "
A heavy and benevolent dust fell over us all as we trekked the great highway towards the fearful pyramid of concrete which the Shah once built to honour his father and which the 1979 revolutionaries re-named Freedom Square .
Behind us , among the stragglers , stones began to burst on to the road as Basijis besieged the Sharif University ( they seem to have something against colleges of further education these days ) and one man collapsed on the road , his face covered in blood .
But on the great mass of people moved , waving their green flags and shouting in joy at the thousands of Iranians who stood along the rooftops .
On the right , they all saw an old people 's home and out on to the balcony came the aged and the crippled who must have remembered the reign of the loathed Shah , perhaps even his creepy father , Reza Khan .
A woman who must have been 90 waved a green handkerchief and an even older man emerged on the narrow balcony and waved his crutch in the air .
The thousands below them shrieked back their joy at this ancient man .
Walking beside this vast flood of humanity , a strange fearlessness possessed us all .
Who would dare attack them now ?
What government could deny a people of this size and determination ?
Dangerous questions .
By dusk , the Basiji were being chased by hundreds of protesters in the west of the city but shooting was crackling around the suburbs after dark .
Those who were fatally too late in leaving Azadi , were fired on by the Basiji .
One dead , thousands in panic , we heard behind us .
After every day of sunlight , there usually comes a perilous darkness and perhaps it was prefigured by the strange grey cloud that approached us all as we drew closer to Azadi Square yesterday afternoon .
Many of the thousands of people around me noticed it and , burned by the afternoon sun , seemed to walk faster to embrace its shade .
Then it rained , it poured , it soaked us .
There is a faint rainy season in mid-summer Tehran but it had arrived early , sunlight arcing through the clouds like the horizon in a Biblical painting .
Moin , a student of chemical engineering at Tehran University – the same campus where blood had been shed just a few hours before – was walking beside me and singing in Persian as the rain pelted down .
I asked him to translate .
" It 's a poem by Sohrab Sepehri , one of our modern poets , " he said .
Could this be real , I asked myself ?
Do they really sing poems in Tehran when they are trying to change history ?
Here is what he was singing :
" We should go under the rain .
We should wash our eyes ,
And we should see the world in a different way . "
He grinned at me and at his two student friends .
" The next line is about making love to a woman in the rain , but that does n't seem very suitable here . "
We all agreed .
Our feet hurt .
We were still tripping over manhole covers and kerbstones hidden beneath men's feet and women 's chadors .
For this was not just the trendy , young , sunglassed ladies of north Tehran .
The poor were here , too , the street workers and middle - aged ladies in full chador .
A very few held babies on their shoulders or children by the arm , talking to them from time to time , trying to explain the significance of this day to a mind that would not remember it in the years to come that they were here on this day of days .
The vast Azadi monument appeared through the grey light like a spaceship – we had been walking for four miles – and Moin and his friends spent an hour squeezing through a body of humanity so dense that my chest was about to be crushed .
Around the monument , the Shah had long ago built a grassed rampart .
We struggled to its height and there , suddenly , was the breathtaking nature of it all .
Readers who have seen the film Atonement will remember the scene where the British hero - soldier climbs a sand - dune and suddenly beholds those thousands on the beaches of Dunkirk .
This was no less awesome .
Amid the great basin of grass and concrete that surrounds the monument were a thousand souls , moving and swaying and singing in the new post -rain sunlight .
There must have been at least a million , and – here one struggles for a metaphor – it was like a vast animal , a great heaving beast that breathed and roared and moved sluggishly beneath that monstrous arrow of concrete .
Moin and his friends lay on the grass , smoking cigarettes .
They asked each other if the Supreme Leader would understand what this meant for Iran .
" He 's got to hold the elections again , " one of Moin 's friends told him .
They looked at me .
Do n't ask a foreigner , I said .
Because I 'm not so sure that the fathers of the 1979 revolution will look so kindly upon this self - evident demand for freedom .
True , Ayatollah Ali Khamenei , the Supreme Leader – how antiquated that title sounded yesterday – had agreed to enquire into the election results , perhaps to look over a polling statistic or two .
But Ahmadinejad , despite his obtuseness and his unending smile , is a tough guy in a tough clerical environment .
His glorious predecessor , Hojatolislam Mohamed Khatami , was somewhere down there amid the crowds , along with Mousavi and Mousavi 's wife Zahra Rahnavard , but they could not protect these people .
Government is not about good guys and bad guys .
It is about power , state and political power – they are not the same – and unless those wanly smiling riot police move across to the opposition , the weapons of the Islamic Republic remain in the hands of Ahmadinejad 's administration and his spiritual protectors .
As , no doubt , we shall soon see .
Nearly two years after it released " In Rainbows " as a pay - as - you - wish downloadable album , Radiohead has posted a new single on its Web site .
The song , " Harry Patch ( In memory of ) , " is in honor of the last known British World War I veteran , who died in late July and was buried today .
" I had heard a very emotional interview with him a few years ago on the Today program on Radio4 .
The way he talked about war had a profound effect on me .
It became the inspiration for a song that we happened to record a few weeks before his death , " Thom Yorke , Radiohead 's lead singer , said on the band 's blog .
" I very much hope the song does justice to his memory as the last survivor .
It would be very easy for our generation to forget the true horror of war , without the likes of Harry to remind us , " he said .
The BBC is streaming the song online for free today , and Radiohead is selling the downloadable track for 1 , or about $ 1.70 .
It says it is donating proceeds to the British Legion .
MIAMI ( Reuters ) - Police in a Florida city used the promise of economic stimulus checks to lure 76 people to their arrest on a variety of outstanding warrants .
The Fort Lauderdale Police Department set up “ Operation Show Me the Money ” to round up people wanted on charges ranging from second - degree murder to guns and drug charges to failure to pay child support .
Using the name of the fictitious “ South Florida Stimulus Coalition , ” police mailed letters asking the suspects to call an undercover phone line and make appointments to claim their money .
When they showed up at an auditorium and presented their identification , they were led to an area where uniformed police were waiting to arrest them .
Police said such roundups are safer and more efficient than serving warrants at people ’s homes .
“ You totally control the environment whereas when you ’re walking up to someone ’s home there ’s an unknown factor there , ” Police Sergeant Frank Sousa said on Friday .
The operation ended on Thursday night and Sousa declined to say how much money the suspects were offered .
“ They were not large dollar amounts , ” he said .
“ No one was promised thousands of dollars . ”

There has been relatively little noise out of the realtime preemption camp in recent months .
That does not mean that the realtime developers have been idle , though ; instead , they are preparing for the realtime endgame : the merger of the bulk of the remaining patches into the mainline kernel .
The 2.6.31 - rc4-rt1 tree recently announced by Thomas Gleixner shows the results of much of this work .
This article will look at some of the recent changes to -rt .
The point of the realtime preemption project is to enable a general - purpose Linux kernel to provide deterministic response times to high - priority processes .
" Realtime " does not ( necessarily ) mean " fast " ; it means knowing for sure that the system can respond to important events within a specific time period .
It has often been said that this cannot be done , that the complexity of a full operating system would thwart any attempt to guarantee bounded response times .
Of course , it was also said that free software developers could never create a full operating system in the first place .
The realtime hackers believe that both claims are equally false , and they have been working to prove it .
One of the long - term realtime features was threaded interrupt handlers .
A " hard " interrupt handler can monopolize the CPU for as long as it runs ; that can create latencies for other users .
Moving interrupt handlers into their own threads , instead , allows them to be scheduled like any other process on the system .
Thus , threaded interrupt handlers cannot get in the way of higher - priority processes .
Much of the threaded interrupt handling code moved into the mainline for the 2.6.30 release , but in a somewhat different form .
While the threading of interrupt handlers is nearly universal in a realtime kernel , it 's an optional ( and , thus far , little - used ) feature in the mainline , so the APIs had to change somewhat .
Realtime interrupt handling has been reworked on top of the mainline threaded interrupt mechanism , but it still has its own twists .
In particular , the kernel can still be configured to force all interrupt handlers into threads .
If a given driver explicitly requests a threaded handler , behavior is similar to a non-realtime kernel ; the driver 's " hard " interrupt handler runs as usual in IRQ context .
Drivers which do not request threaded handlers get one anyway , with a special hard handler which masks the interrupt line while the driver 's handler runs .
Interrupt handler threads are per-device now ( rather than per-IRQ line ) .
All told , the amount of code which is specific to the realtime tree is fairly small now ; the bulk of it is in the mainline .
Software interrupt handling is somewhat different in the realtime tree .
Mainline kernels will normally handle software interrupts at convenient moments - context switches or when returning to user space from a system call , usually .
If the software interrupt load gets too heavy , though , handling will be deferred to the per-CPU " ksoftirqd " thread .
In the realtime tree ( subject to a configuration option ) , all software interrupt handling goes into ksoftirqd - but now there is a separate thread for each interrupt line .
So each CPU will get a couple of ksoftirqd threads for network processing , one for the block subsystem , one for RCU , one for tasklets , and so on .
Software interrupts are also preemptable , though that may not happen very often ; they run at realtime priority .
The work which first kicked off the realtime preemption tree was the replacement of spinlocks with sleeping mutexes .
The spinlock technique is difficult to square with deterministic latencies ; any processor which is spinning on a lock will wait an arbitrary period of time , depending on what code in another CPU is doing .
Code holding spinlocks also cannot be preempted ; doing so would cause serious latencies ( at best ) or deadlocks .
So the goal of ensuring bounded response times required the elimination of spinlocks to the greatest extent possible .
Replacing spinlocks throughout the kernel with realtime mutexes solves much of the problem .
Threads waiting for a mutex will sleep , freeing the processor for some other task .
Threads holding mutexes can be preempted if a higher - priority process comes along .
So , if the priorities have been set properly , there should be little in the way of the highest - priority process being able to respond to events at any time .
This is the core idea behind the entire realtime preemption concept .
As it happens , though , not all spinlocks can be replaced by mutexes .
At the lowest levels of the system , there is still a need for true ( or " raw " ) spinlocks ; the locks which are used to implement mutexes are one obvious example .
Over the years , a fair amount of effort has gone into the task of figuring out which spinlocks really needed to be " raw " locks .
At the code level , the difference was papered over through the use of some rather ugly trickery in the spinlock primitives .
Regardless of whether a raw spinlock or a sleeping lock was being used , the code would call spin_lock ( ) to acquire it ; the only difference was where the lock was declared .
This approach was probably useful during the early development phases where it was often necessary to change the type of specific locks .
But ugly compiler trickery which serves to obfuscate the type of lock being used in any specific context seems unlikely to fly when it comes to merger into the mainline .
So the realtime hackers have bitten the bullet and split the two types of locks entirely .
The replacement of " spinlocks " with mutexes still happens as before , for the simple reason that changing every spinlock call would be a massive , disruptive change across the entire kernel code base .
But the " raw " spinlock type , which is used in far fewer places , is more amenable to this kind of change .
The result is a new mutual exclusion primitive , called atomic_spinlock_t , which looks a lot like traditional spinlocks :
#include < linux / spinlock.h>
DEFINE_ATOMIC_SPINLOCK(name ) atomic_spin_lock_init(atomic_spinlock_t * lock ) ; void atomic_spin_lock(atomic_spinlock_t * lock ) ; void atomic_spin_lock_irqsave(atomic_spinlock_t * lock , long flags ) ; void atomic_spin_lock_irq(atomic_spinlock_t * lock ) ; void atomic_spin_lock_bh(atomic_spinlock_t * lock ) ; int atomic_spin_trylock(atomic_spinlock_t * lock ) ; void atomic_spin_unlock(atomic_spinlock_t * lock ) ; void atomic_spin_unlock_irqrestore(atomic_spinlock_t * lock , long flags ) ; void atomic_spin_unlock_irq(atomic_spinlock_t * lock ) ; void atomic_spin_unlock_bh(atomic_spinlock_t * lock ) ;
These new " atomic spinlocks " are used in the scheduler , low - level interrupt handling code , clock - handling , PCI bus management , ACPI subsystem , and in many other places .
The change is still large and disruptive - but much less so than changing ordinary " spinlock " users would have been .

One might argue that putting atomic spinlocks back into the kernel will reintroduce the same latency problems that the realtime developers are working to get rid of .
There is certainly a risk of that happening , but it can be minimized with due care .
Auditing every kernel path which uses spinlocks is clearly not a feasible task , but it is possible to look very closely at the ( much smaller ) number of code paths using atomic spinlocks .
So there can be a reasonable degree of assurance that the remaining atomic spinlocks will not cause the kernel to exceed the latency goals .
( As an aside , Thomas Gleixner is looking for a better name for the atomic_spinlock_t type .
Suggest the winning idea , and free beer at the next conference may be your reward . )
Similar changes have been made to a number of other kernel mutual exclusion mechanisms .
There is a new atomic_seqlock_t variant on seqlocks for cases where the seqlock writer cannot be preemptable .
The anon_semaphore type mostly appears to be a renaming of semaphores and their related functions ; it is a part of the continuing effort to eliminate the use of semaphores in any place where a mutex or completion should be used instead .
There is also a rw_anon_semaphore type as a replacement for rw_semaphore .
Quite a few other realtime - specific changes remain in the - rt tree .
The realtime code is incompatible with the SLUB allocator , so only slab is allowed .
There is also an interesting problem with kmap_atomic ( ) ; this function creates a temporary , per-CPU kernel - space address mapping for a given memory page .
Preemption cannot be allowed to happen when an atomic kmap is active ; it would be possible for other code to change the mapping before the preempted code tries to use it .
In the realtime setting , the performance benefits from atomic kmaps are outweighed by the additional latency they can cause .
So , for all practical purposes , kmap_atomic ( ) does not exist in a realtime kernel ; calls to kmap_atomic ( ) are mapped to ordinary kmap ( ) calls .
And so on .
As for work which is not yet even in the realtime tree , the first priority would appear to be clear :
We seriously want to tackle the elimination of the PREEMPT_RT annoyance # 1 , aka BKL .
The Big Kernel Lock is still used in ~330 files all across the kernel .
At this point , the remaining BKL - removal work comes down to low - level audits of individual filesystems and drivers ; for the most part , it has been pushed out of the core kernel .
Beyond that , of course , there is the little task of getting as much of this code as possible into the mainline kernel .
To that end , a proper git tree with a bisectable sequence of patches is being prepared , though that work is not yet complete .
There will also be a gathering of realtime Linux developers at the Eleventh Real - Time Linux Workshop this September in Dresden ; getting the realtime work into the mainline is expected to be discussed seriously there .
As it happens , your editor plans to be in the room ; watch this space in late September for an update .

Paul Krugman does a rough ( and very conservative ) estimation of where the United States would be fiscally if Bush had not been President :
There were two big - ticket Bush policies .
One was the tax cuts , which cost around $ 1.8 trillion
in revenue ; add in interest costs , and we ’re presumably talking about
more than $ 2 trillion in debt .
The other was the Iraq War , which has cost at least $ 700 billion , and will cost more before we finally extract ourselves .
Without these gratuitous drains on the budget , it seems fair to
assert that we’d be coming into this economic crisis with a federal
debt around 20 percent of GDP ( $ 2.8 trillion ) smaller than we are .
And
that , in turn , means that we’d be looking at projected net debt in 2019
of around 50 percent of GDP , not 70 .

That type of debt would be large , but ' not scary ' , as Krugman says .
But we are now faced with a monumental economic crisis that requires the Federal government to pump trillions of dollars into the economy to rescue it , with an already unsustainable amount of debt accrued by the Bush Administration .
That is why the Republicans have absolutely no right to talk about fiscal prudence .
They can hammer the President all they want on abortion and gay rights ( those are a matter of opinion ) , but when it comes to the economy their opinions are no longer relevant .
( New York ) - The Iranian government should immediately release ailing political prisoner Behrooz Javid - Tehrani , a human rights activist first arrested during 1999 nationwide student protests , and ensure he has access to adequate medical care , Human Rights Watch said today .
Javid - Tehrani , who has been continually detained since 2005 , is on hunger strike and suffers from health problems caused by prolonged torture .
A student activist and leading defender of the rights of political prisoners and their families , Javid - Tehrani has spent the last 10 years in and out ofprison .
He is currently held in the " doghouse " section of the infamous Gohar Dasht prison in Karaj city , north of Tehran , with his hands and feet cuffed .
" Behrooz Javid - Tehrani , who is critically ill , is in prison for his peaceful political dissent and his human rights advocacy , " said Sarah Leah Whitson , Middle East director at Human Rights Watch .
" He should never have been imprisoned in the first place and he should be released at once or he will likely die in prison . "
Javid - Tehrani , 29 , has never had access to a lawyer , and has had limited access to his family since his 2005 arrest .
Despite an independent medical examination in 2006 that confirmed he had been tortured while in prison , Javid - Tehrani has been refused release to obtain needed medical care .
Amongst his current known ailments are fresh bruises and wounds to his body as well as the loss of 50 percent of his eyesight due to head injuries inflicted by his interrogators in prison .
In addition , authorities have not provided adequate medical care during his 18 - day hunger strike , according to his friend Kianoosh Sanjari , a human rights activist who was a fellow inmate during part of Javid - Tehrani 's term inEvin prison in Tehran .
Iranian officials first detained Javid - Tehrani on July 9 , 1999 , when he was 19 , as he participated in student demonstrations that spread across Iran .
He was sentenced to eight years in prison on charges of " acting against national security . "
Four years into his sentence , his sister phoned him to say their mother had passed away but the Iranian Judiciary refused to let him attend his mother 's burial .
His sentence was later commuted and he was released in late 2003 .
In 2004 , he was detained twice , both times for demonstrating for the rights of political prisoners and their families in front of the United Nations offices in Tehran .
Prison officials interrogated and tortured him in Section 209 of Evin prison in Tehran , Kianoosh Sanjari told Human Rights Watch .
Sanjari became aware of Javid - Tehrani's torture in Evin because of the close proximity of their cells and the fact that they shared the same interrogator , an official who goes by the name of Saeed Sheikhan .
In 2005 , ahead of the presidential elections won by Mahmoud Ahmadinejad , Javid - Tehrani and others in an organization called Jebhe - ye Democratic-e Iran ( the Iranian Democratic Front ) , organized activities such as putting up posters , distributing fliers , and writing political graffiti to protest the lack of transparency and lack of democracy in Iranian elections .
The group also raised funds to help families of political prisoners and made short films interviewing the families .
After Javid - Tehrani interviewed political prisoner Akbar Mohammadi during the latter 's temporary release and shortly before Mohammadi's death under suspicious circumstances during a hungerstrike in prison , he was again arrested in 2005 .
According to Sanjari , that interview was of special interest to prison officials , who raised it repeatedly during their interrogations of both friends .
The head judge at Branch 26 of the Revolutionary Court in Tehran , Judge Hasan Zare Dehnavi , known as Judge Hadad , sentenced Javid - Tehrani to four years in prison for membership in an " illegal " organization ( the Iranian DemocraticFront ) that " acts against state security , " 40 lashes for " insulting the leadership and the state , " and three - and - a - half years on charges of belonging to the Mojahedin'e Khalgh Organization ( MKO ) .
According to Sanjari , this charge was fabricated by the interrogator Sheikhan and furthered by a personal conflict with Judge Hadad , the judge who later sentenced Iranian - American journalist Roxana Saberi to eight years for espionage .
An appeals court reduced the sentence on the MKO charge by six months .
Javid - Tehrani has now served more than half his 2005 sentence .
Most prisoners in Iran are eligible for release after serving half of their sentence , but he has not been granted even one day of customary temporary release since 2005 .
Human Rights
Watch is concerned that Javid - Tehrani 's life is in immediate danger , in light of the suspicious deaths of political prisoners at Gohar Dasht prison ( also known as Rajayi Shahr ) , most recently that of Amir Heshmat Saran in March 2009 .
Gohar Dasht was one of the main sites of the 1988 mass summary executions of political prisoners which killed thousands .
" Amongst Iran 's political prisoners , Gohar Dasht prison is known as the ‘ doghouse ' because prisoners are sent there to die , " said Whitson .
" The Iranian government is legally bound to ensure safety and provide healthcare for all its prisoners .
But it has consistently failed to do so for political prisoners , with deadly results . "
Human Rights Watch urged Iranian authorities to release Javid - Tehrani immediately and end its persecution of peaceful critics and dissidents .

Stockholm : Asia needs to improve irrigation and introduce water reform to feed growing populations in the coming decades , a new study said Tuesday .
The population in Asia is projected to increase by 1.5 billion people by 2050 .
Without necessary reforms , many Asian nations " face the politically risky prospect of having to import more than a quarter of the rice , wheat and maize they will need by 2050 " , the joint report from the International Water Management Institute ( IWMI ) and the UN Food and Agriculture Organisation ( FAO ) said .
" Asia`s food and feed demand is expected to double by 2050 .
Relying on trade to meet a large part of this demand will impose a huge and politically untenable burden on the economies of many developing countries , " IWMI director general Colin Chartres said in a statement .
" The best bet for Asia lies in revitalising its vast irrigation systems , which account for 70 percent of the world`s total irrigated land , " he added .
The study was released in connection with World Water Week , an international gathering of policy makers and experts underway in Stockholm .
The scenarios in the report did not factor in climate change , where rainfall is projected to become more erratic .
South Asia was mentioned as a region where there was strong potential for improvement , and the researchers also suggested engaging " the private sector more actively in publicly managed irrigation systems " , citing experiences from China .

Updates market data throughout .
The strengthening U.S. currency is depressing prices for commodities , in particular oil ( which is priced in dollars ) and gold .
Global stocks took a dive this morning , following declining oil prices .
U.S. stocks are now joining the slump .
It 's one of those catch 22 situations .
Fear of the dollar , which is up 1.9 % over the euro -- the most since April -- ignores the good news that is reflected in a stronger U.S. currency - namely that the U.S. currency derives its strength from the U.S. economy .
Thanks go to Russian Finance Minister Alexei Kudrin , who reminded everyone during the G8 finance ministers meeting in Italy over the weekend that there is no alternative to the dollar as the primary global reserve currency .
Ironic in a way , since Russia has made a big stink about the status of the dollar and joined China in calling for another benchmark .
Deal with it world .
The dollar , like the U.S. economy , will not be defeated by the financial meltdown .
If anything , the recovery that is underway proves the resilience of America .
As for the dip in oil prices to around $ 70 a barrel , that 's really no big deal considering that oil kept on gaining and more than doubled since March despite declining overall demand .
So a correction is overdue .
Too bad for the speculators who had been using oil as a hedge against more declines in the dollar that some thought would result from all the U.S. government stimulus spending .
And why is everyone so worried about the price of gold dropping to the lowest in three weeks ?
At more than $ 930 an ounce , the yellow metal is still comfortably ahead of the $ 695.40 an ounce we saw back in October .
Sadly , the spillover of these unfounded dollar concerns hit oil stocks like
Chevron
( CVX ) - Get Report
,
Exxon Mobil
( XOM ) - Get Report
and
ConocoPhillips
( COP ) - Get Report
along with mining companies like
Freeport - McMorRan Copper & Gold
( FCX ) - Get Report
,
Newmont Mining
( NEM ) - Get Report
and the SPDR Gold Trust ETF
( GLD ) - Get Report
a setback for nascent rally we had been seeing .
That knee - jerk reaction belies the fact that a resilient U.S. currency and economy bode well for continued consumption of gasoline during the summer driving period .
Worry not , however , because these market gyrations merely indicate that things are starting to return to normal .
No need to fear the strong dollar .

On June 12th , Saychev Peak on Matua Island erupted , hurling ash and steam into the air .
Luckily , NASA 's International Space Station was watching .
This stunning image , from the Earth Observatory , reveals some rare details about this eruption .

In this image , you can see the volcanic plume extending into the sky .
But you can also see the atmospheric shock wave from the eruption , which pushed the clouds back into a ring in the sky .
Also visible is a smooth , fluffy white cloud on top of the rapidly rising ash column .
This is likely a result of rapidly rising water vapor condensing on top of the plume .
A detail of the image also reveals what is known as the pyroclastic flow .
This is a mixture of super hot gas and ash that can travel at up to 130 miles per hour .
It 's similar to the kind of rapidly moving pyroclastic surge that supposedly wiped out Pompeii so quickly , killing everyone in its path .
It 's a beautiful image , dense with interesting quirks that demonstrate just how powerful , dangerous and complex volcanoes are .

Recently we came into possession of an Adobe Acrobat PDF file that upon opening drops and executes a malicious binary .
It was quite clear that this PDF was exploiting some vulnerability in order to drop its payload .
And , during the analysis it soon became apparent that this vulnerability was not one we had seen in the wild before .
What was even more surprising was that this vulnerability affects Adobe Flash — not Adobe Reader as we initially suspected .
An issue in Adobe Flash is more serious .
Most vulnerabilities are confined to one technology ; for example , a vulnerability may affect a particular browser or a particular operating system , but it is rare for a vulnerability to span multiple platforms and products .
This is not the case with Flash .
Flash exists in all popular browsers and is also available in PDF documents .
It is also largely operating system independent ; therefore , the threat posed by this issue is not to be taken lightly .
Flash has become an integral part of the modern browsing experience — becoming so ubiquitous that most users do n’t even notice it .
Thomas Ptacek of Matasano Security summed up just how serious Flash vulnerabilities are : “ Why do you care about Flash exploits ?
Because in the field , any one of them wins a commanding majority of browser installs for an attacker . ”
( The full blog post is here : This New Vulnerability : Dowd ’s Inhuman Flash Exploit . )
The large user base of Flash presents attackers with a huge target audience and will certainly be too much for them to resist .
Ptacek made the comment above when describing an article that Mark Dowd , research engineer with IBM ISS , published in April 2008 ( Application - Specific Attacks : Leveraging the ActionScript Virtual Machine ) .
This article detailed how he created a reliable exploit that took advantage of a very subtle memory corruption issue in Adobe Flash Player version 9.0.115.0 .
He gives a detailed account of how he overcame the many obstacles put in place by the Flash developers .
This was quite an achievement .
Whether it was intentional or not , this paper gave the reader a certain sense of security since it proved just how difficult it was to reliably exploit this issue and once the patch was available we could all put that nasty incident behind us .
As expected , there were many people who were very happy to pick up Dowd ’s research and use it for their own purposes .
Since the release of Dowd ’s paper we have seen widespread attempts to exploit Flash in the wild , but invariably they would all eventually use the exploit Dowd discovered .
That is , until now .
The authors of the exploit have managed to take a bug and turn it into a reliable exploit using a heap spray technique .
Typically an attacker would entice a user to visit a malicious website or send a malicious PDF via email .
Once the unsuspecting user visits the website or opens the PDF this exploit will allow further malware to be dropped onto the victim ’s machine .
The malicious PDF files are detected as Trojan .
Pidief .G and the dropped files as Trojan Horse .
We are in contact with the Adobe PSIRT team in relation to this issue .
We urge our customers to ensure their antivirus definitions are up to date .
Like the vulnerability Dowd discovered , it ’s likely that we will see many attacks over the coming months that will attempt to exploit this vulnerability .
As always , keep an eye out for the official patch from Adobe and ensure all products are up to date .
As an extra safety measure , Vista users should avail of the UAC ( User Account Control ) feature as this will help mitigate a successful compromise .
In this exploitation the PDF exploiting the vulnerability includes multiple Flash streams ( FWS ) .
One of these is used to dynamically create the shellcode and uses a heap spray technique to increase the chances of success of the exploit .
In this attack the heap is loaded with 64 MB of data .
Here is a snapshot of what the heap looks like :
After the first step the attacker needs to somehow redirect execution to the heap in order to arrive at the malicious shellcode .
This is where the vulnerability mentioned earlier comes in .
Flash fails to sanitize instructions in a specific scenario here .
The end function does n’t expect the incorrectly constructed object and inadvertently passes execution onto the heap .
Because of the actions taken by the attacker , execution will point to a region in the section prepared by the heap spray earlier .
Execution will continue in the heap , which will ultimately result in the execution of the attacker supplied shell code .
Testing shows that the vulnerability is exploitable on Windows XP and Vista , but the dropped executables do not run on Vista if UAC is enabled .
Also , because this vulnerability affects Flash , any software that uses Flash is potentially vulnerable to this issue .

In any case , Snow Leopard truly is an optimized version of Leopard .
It starts up faster ( 72 seconds on a MacBook Air , versus 100 seconds in Leopard ) .
It opens programs faster ( Web browser , 3 seconds ; calendar , 5 seconds ; iTunes , 7 seconds ) , and the second time you open the same program , the time is halved .
“ Optimized ” does n’t just mean faster ; it also means smaller .
Incredibly , Snow Leopard is only half the size of its predecessor ; following the speedy installation ( 15 minutes ) , you wind up with 7 gigabytes more free space on your hard drive .
That , ladies and gents , is a first .
Unfortunately , Snow Leopard runs only on Macs with Intel chips  that is , Macs sold since 2006 .
If you have an older Mac , you ’re stuck with Leopard forever .
( Techie note : Popular conception has it that the space savings comes from removing all the code required by those earlier chips .
But that ’s not true , according to Apple .
Yes , that code is gone , but new 64 - bit code , described below , easily replaces it .
No , Apple says that the savings comes from “ tightening up the screws , ” compressing chunks of the system software and eliminating a huge stash of printer drivers .
Now the system downloads printer drivers as needed , on demand . )
As it turns out , Apple programmers could not leave well enough alone .
They disobeyed the original “ no new features ” mantra .
As they pored through all the bits of Mac OS X , they kept stopping and fixing little things that had always bugged them , or coming up with neat little ways to make things better .
So :
The Mac now adjusts its own clock when you travel , just like a cellphone .
The menu bar can now show the date , not just the day of the week .
The menu of nearby wireless hot spots now shows the signal strength for each .
When you ’re running Windows on your Mac , you can now open the files on the Macintosh “ side ” without having to restart .
Icons can now be 512 pixels ( several inches ) square , turning any desktop window into a light table for photos .
In another post , we ’ve told you all about the ancient yeast Raul Cano resurrected from fossilized amber , and the very special pale ale and hefeweizen that were created with it .
Now down to business … time for this homebrewer to geek out on what makes this ancient yeast so very unique , and why the entire story is so special to begin with .
It should be noted right from the start that creating beer from ancient yeast was quite a long shot from the very beginning , and Peter Hackett of Stumptown knew this when he signed on to collaborate with Cano on the project .
Even though we speak of ale yeast as a species ( Saccharomyces cerevisiae ) , there is a great deal of variation within that species ; the very variation that helps gives rise to the plethora of variety present among ales brewed the world over .
Many strains of the yeast simply do n’t perform well in the hostile environment that is wort , with its alcohol and acidity , not to mention the limited availability of oxygen .
Any homebrewer knows that viability ( health ) of the yeast is very important , even with modern yeast … what effect would 45 million years in amber have on the viability of the strain ?
The bottom line is , this yeast was very unlikely to create a reasonable beer at all , let alone a critically acclaimed one which Hackett himself said was like nothing he ’s ever had before .
To his credit , Hackett decided to press on , and found that this was indeed a very unusual strain .
When first pitched , the yeast takes longer than most modern ale yeast to kick in , but when it does – make room .
It has a very vigorous , even violent , top - fermenting initial phase that creates a very thick foam at the top of the fermenter .
Then it does something I ’ve never heard of in an ale yeast .
It drops to the bottom of the fermenter , leaving the wort nearly clear .
Normally this would be called flocculation and mark the approximate end of fermentation , when the yeast goes dormant to wait for more food ( though more accurately a small portion of the yeast would remain in suspension and keep working longer , after other cells had flocculated ) .
But Cano ’s yeast does n’t stop working .
It keeps going , fermenting on the bottom of the vessel like a lager yeast would .
Eventually , when fermentation slows to the point where the brewer is ready to put an end to it , they “ crash ” the yeast by cooling it to near freezing temperatures , causing any remaining yeast in suspension to finally give up and flocculate to the bottom so that they can be removed and the beer can be bottled .
But here again , Cano ’s yeast had other plans ; refusing to crash , it simply keeps going – for another month !
Apparently a 45 million year nap leads to an epic case of the munchies …
There are two other unique features about the yeast I ’d like to mention .
One is that it likes to work hot , even for ale yeast .
It ’s been used in a pale ale that ferments above 70 F , and a wheat beer that ferments at 68 F .
My sources suggest that typical temperatures for these two styles would be something around 67 for a pale and as low as 62 for a hefeweizen ( though there is some debate that would place it as high as 67 , but I ’ll go with Jamil Zainasheff on this one ) .
I would speculate that this is because the Eocene epoch from which the yeast hails had a much warmer , tropical climate than the one we currently inhabit , and the yeast was evolved to this climate .
My intuition would be that this higher temperature would mean more esters and phenols ( fruit and spice ) in the finished beer , and tasting notes of others ( which were discussed in our other article ) seem to bear this out .
Another unique feature is that the strain is apparently unable to digest any but a small range of carbohydrates , far fewer than modern brewer ’s yeast .
Cano believes this also contributes to the spicy character of the finished beer , though I ’m not sure why since I ’ve never heard of unfermentable sugar lending a spicy character to beer .
On the other hand , unmalted wheat and rye are often described as lending a unique spiciness regardless of the yeast used , so maybe he is on to something .
This does remind me of something I read recently about the difference between beer yeast and wine yeast .
Apparently wine yeast also works with a smaller range of carbohydrates , and this gives beer made with wine yeast a cloying ( overly sweet ) finish , unless it is coupled with a beer strain or enzymes are added to the wort to break up the larger carbohydrates into simpler ones .
They seem to have gotten around this for the Pale ale by using a lower starting gravity instead – less sugar in the beginning means that even though less is eaten , there is still less residual sugar at the end .
A typical pale ale would start at a specific gravity of about 1.058 to 1.065 , but the pale ale brewed by Hackett starts at only 1.050 , which means that there is roughly a fifth less sugar dissolved in the wort at the start of fermentation .
As for those bottles they intend to roll out to the rest of the country … Cano has patented the yeast strain , and sequenced its genome so that he can enforce the patent .
This would prevent unauthorized brewers from conjuring up cultures of the stuff from the dregs of these bottles ( apparently Cano does n’t intend to filter the product ) .
I am ambivalent about this , because while I respect his right to protect his “ babies ” as he calls them , I ’d like to see such a unique strain be as widely available as possible to further the cause of innovation and creativity with its use .
However , I suppose this is where homebrewers come in to play ; after all , Rogue ’s patent on its PacMan yeast has n’t stopped many a homebrewer from trying their hand with a sample .

JUST over 330 years ago , devout Roman Catholic villagers in Switzerland struck a deal with God that would protect them from a bloody great glacier :
If you stop the Great Aletschgletscher from engulfing our mountain hamlets of Fiesch and Fieschertal , we ’ll lead exemplary lives of great holiness – and we wo n’t even allow our womenfolk to wear coloured knickers .
God obliged – but then went and over - egged the pudding .
Typical !
We all know – and the Holy Father reminded us in his Easter message – that an unprecedented change in the climate is taking place .
The glacier is ice , ice is water and water is life .
Without the glacier the springs run dry and the brooks evaporate .
Men and women face great danger .
Alps and pastures vanish and towns die out .
The once - encroaching glacier is now receding at an alarming pace , and the villagers , located in the south of the country , want permission from the Pope to reverse their prayers to avoid a new threat : worsening floods in the valley caused by the melting glacier , and , eventually , a loss of water supply .
Whether this requested reversal of a vow made in 1678 will include acts of unrestrained gaiety , sexy undies and debauchery – an annual Gay Pride festival , perhaps ?
– is not known , but in 2007 hundred of people posed naked on the glacier to draw attention to the threat of global warming .
Now Catholic priest Pascal Venetz has just warned villagers from the Valais region – which has sent its sons to protect the Vatican as Swiss Guards since the 16th century – that :
Venetz added that many townsfolk have begun questioning the ancient vow that has been commemorated every year since 1862 in a procession to the chapel on July 31 , St Ignatius ’ feast day .
The idea to alter the vow came from Fiesch Mayor Herbert Volken , but the concern was not driven by worldly or secular impulses .
Instead , the villages “ were seeing nature change all around them , ” and realized the glacier might soon need saving , Venetz said .
Conservation body Pro Natura says the glacier base is receding up the mountain by about 100 feet ( 30 meters ) a year .
University of Zurich geographer Hanspeter Holzhauser estimates the river of ice has retreated 2.1 miles ( 3.4 kilometers ) since peaking in 1860 at a length of 14 miles ( 23 kilometers ) .
Nearly half of the shrinkage has happened since 1950 .
Venetz said there were “ countless , horrible natural catastrophes ” in his parish from the 17th to the 19th centuries as the glacier expanded .
These led to the big volumes of water with floods that brought great damage and calamity in our villages .
Villagers should continue with the vow , but the request for divine assistance should be adjusted to conform with the changing reality of nature , the pastor said .
Praying should of course continue , because our villages should be spared from natural catastrophes .
We should at the same time pray that our glacier does not melt any further , but instead grows , and that the most important thing in life – water – remains well preserved .
He said he would ask the local bishop to seek Pope Benedict XVI ’s permission to change the vow , and a statement from the cantonal ( state ) government of Valais said a papal audience was planned for September or October .
Said Venetz :
Free solo climbing , which is climbing without safety equipment , is sheer foolishness in the estimation of not only most people but also most climbers .
If you are climbing without a rope and partner and you fall , then you will probably die .
The death zone is considered to be any place above 30 feet above the ground — you climb higher than that unroped and fall and the outcome is not good .
You fall .
You die .
Media Glorifies Free Solo Climbing
It seems that the media , including climbing magazines , often focus on free soloing , an extremely risky part of rock climbing .
Much of the press glorifies free solo climbing and the interviews with climbers who are able to successfully solo are filled with platitudes about controlling the risks of climbing , that they feel more solid without a rope and belay , and that they feel more alive when risking everything .
These are , of course , empty thoughts after the fall , after a climber slips , loses his grip , slides out of a jam , and plummets to his death at the cliff base .
Climbers That Died Soloing
Consider some of the climbers that have died free soloing :
August 2015 : Veteran climber Brad Parker from Sebastopol , California , died while solo climbing the classic Matthes Crest Traverse ( 5.7 ) in Yosemite National Park .
The 35 - year - old man fell 300 feet from the ridge to his death , only hours after proposing to his girlfriend on nearby Cathedral Peak .
He told her before setting off on the solo that it was “ the happiest day of my life . ”
June 2012 : Michael Ybarra , a talented journalist and climber who wrote about climbing for the Wall Street Journal , died in a fall from the Sawtooth Ridge on 12,279 - foot Matterhorn in Yosemite National Park while soloing .
The 45 - year - old Ybarra fell at least 200 feet down steep granite cliffs .
July 2009 : John Bacher , a 52 - year - old American climbing icon , died after falling while free soloing a short route on the Dike Wall near Mammoth Lakes , California .
Bacher was well known for extreme unroped solo ascents during his long and storied climbing career .
He once said , " Soloing is a serious business because you can be seriously dead . "
May 1993 : British climber Derek Hersey , a 35 - year - old solo climber living in Boulder , Colorado , fell off the classic Steck - Salathe route ( 5.9 ) on Sentinel Rock in Yosemite Valley in late May 1993 .
Hersey , an experienced soloist , was called " one of the world 's great extreme free - solo climbers " by the New York Times in 1991 .
The Fatal Consequences of a Mistake
The list of good climbers that have fallen while free - solo climbing and died goes on — Jimmy Ray Forester ( fell soloing at Potrero Chico ) , Tobin Sorenson ( fell while attempting a solo both with and without ropes on Mount Alberta in Canada ) , Jim Adair ( fell after getting off - route on the 3rd class approach to Sentinel Rock in Yosemite ) , and many others .
There have been hundreds of solo fatalities worldwide , although no specific statistics are kept .
The fact of the matter is that free solo climbing , that is climbing without a rope , safety gear , or a partner , is extremely dangerous .
The consequences of a mistake and a fall are usually fatal .
That said , experienced climbers who free solo have great climbing skills , understand risk , and rarely fall .
Most fatal accidents happen to inexperienced and novice climbers who attempt routes that are beyond their skill level .
Cheating Death Until Another Day
It is cool to think about climbing without being fettered by a rope and a partner and without placing gear for protection or setting up belay stations .
For some climbers , the free - soloing ethic is the essence of rock climbing .
It is just a person , alone on a rock wall wearing only climbing shoes and a chalk bag , relying only on their climbing skills and a calm head to safely get up the route .
At the top of the cliff , they can bask in the thought that it was a job well done , that death was cheated once again , that their skills , strength , and control of fear kept them alive to climb another day .
The harrowing almost - falls and close calls are usually shunted to the back of the mind while the relief of survival and the joy and fulfillment of being so close to the edge of death wash over the soloist .
Free Soloing Is a Dangerous Game
Free solo climbing , despite its attractions , including the freedom of movement and the possibilities of spiritual and psychological transformation , is a dangerous game .
To most people , just the thought of climbing without essential climbing safety gear is madness .
Who would risk their life for a rock climb ?
It is difficult to know what goes on inside another person ’s mind , what drives them to take extreme risks .
Some recovering solo climbers that I ’ve talked to about their soloing addiction admit that they were in over their heads , that the exhilaration of success and the thrill of the void lured them into climbing hard routes unroped and close to their limit .
Climber Almost Falls Off On - Sight Solo at Shelf Road
One climber , who asked not to be named in this article , told me about his soloing days when he was young and dumb .
“ I was climbing hard back then , ” he says , “ doing lots of 5.13 routes at Rifle and even some 5.14s .
I started soloing easy routes at first but found that they were , well , too easy .
So I started doing harder stuff , repeating 5.12 s I had done before .
The last time I soloed though was at Shelf Road .
I was trying to on - sight a 5.12 route that I had never climbed before .
I got to the upper part of the route , trying to figure out a very technical sequence , and just about came off a couple times .
I could n’t down climb either .
I looked down and saw rocks at the bottom of the face about 50 feet below .
Your life starts to go through your mind at that point .
I really thought I was going to fall , but I promised myself that if I could get up the climb I would never solo again .
I managed to finally do the crux , all shaky and pumped and got to the top .
I ’ve never soloed again . ”
How to Live Long and Prosper
Solo climbing has long been an important part of climbing lore and history .
Soloing also gives the best climbers like Alex Honnold or the late Dean Potter immense rewards .
Soloing also brings up the fascination with cheating death and a possible heightened sense of freedom .
Despite the dangers and deaths , climbers continue to free solo up routes … and they continue to fall off them and die .
If you want to live long and prosper , it is best to leave the free solo exploits and adventures to others .
Learn essential climbing skills like leading , placing protection , belaying , and rappelling ; buy a rack of climbing gear and a sturdy rope ; find yourself a good climbing partner , and then go climbing .
Have fun , be safe , and always tie into your rope .
Your mother , life partner , and children will thank you for not soloing .

Facebook was not taken completely offline by the attack A blogger who was targeted in a co-ordinated attack against websites such as Facebook and Twitter has told the BBC he blames Russia for the assault .
The pro-Georgian blogger , known as Cyxymu , said he had been targeted for " telling the truth about the Russian - Georgian war " in his writings .
The attack caused a blackout of Twitter for about two hours on Thursday .
Despite the blogger 's claims , security researchers say there is " no suggestion the attack was state - endorsed " .
Google , Facebook and blogging platform Live Journal - all sites where Cyxymu had accounts - were also affected .
" I write the truth about the Russian - Georgian war and somebody did not like these truths - these people in Russia , " the blogger told BBC News .
" I do n't know which people , " he added .
The blogger , real name Georgy , has posted videos and blogs which criticise Russia over its conduct in the war over the South Ossetia region , which began one year ago .
" It 's a big surprise to me that my blog has meant that 250 m people have not been able to enter Facebook , " he said .
Graham Cluley , of security firm Sophos , told BBC News there was no suggestion the attack against the blogger was state - endorsed .
" It was almost certainly an individual who took objection to his blogs , " he said .
" They took internet vigilantism into their own hands to try to blast him off the web , but in the process blasted Twitter off instead . "
' Fragile service ' Facebook had previously confirmed to BBC News that the attacks were directed at an individual who had " a presence on a number of sites , rather than the sites themselves " .
" A botnet was directed to request his pages at such a rate that it impacted service for other users , " the spokesperson said .
DOT .LIFE BLOG
' Up is down , left is right and black is white , ' a chief security researcher told me .
' These attacks do not make sense '
Read Maggie Shiels blog Botnets are networks of computers under the control of hackers .
The machines were used to mount a so - called denial - of - service ( DoS ) attack on Thursday .
DOS attacks take various forms but often involve a company 's servers being flooded with data in an effort to disable them .
" Attacks such as this are malicious efforts orchestrated to disrupt and make unavailable services such as online banks , credit card payment gateways and , in this case , Twitter , for intended customers or users , " wrote Twitter co-founder Biz Stone on his blog .
Twitter was knocked out by the attack for around two hours , while Facebook said its service had been " degraded " .
The effect on Live Journal is unclear .
Only Google seems to have escaped unscathed from the attack .
" Google systems prevented substantive impact to our services , " the company said in a statement .
Sudden realisation
The company has not confirmed which services were targeted in the attack , but it is thought that its e-mail service Gmail and video site YouTube were under fire .
Twitter updated users via a status page " We are aware that a handful of non-Google sites were impacted by [ an ] ... attack this morning , and are in contact with some affected companies to help investigate this attack , " the company said .
All of the affected services were keen to stress that users ' data had not been put at risk in the attacks .
" Please note that no user data was compromised in this attack , " wrote Twitter 's Biz Stone .
" This activity is about saturating a service with so many requests that it cannot respond to legitimate requests thereby denying service to intended customers or users . "
The blogger said he first noticed that things were not right when he realised his Live Journal page was not working .
" After , I entered Facebook to say Live Journal was not working and Facebook was down , " he told BBC News .
" So I entered Twitter to say that Live Journal and Facebook were not working , and Twitter was down .
" And so I understood that it was under attack .
It is not possible that these three services were all down at one time . "
He told the BBC that he still did not have access to his blog or profile pages on any of the services .
However , he said , he had set up a new blog to continue his writings .

Denver ’s marijuana policy review panel agreed Wednesday to send a letter to the presiding judge of Denver County Court urging a $ 1 fine as penalty for possession of marijuana of less than an ounce .
The current fine schedule indicates a $ 50 fine for such offenses , plus a $ 100 drug surcharge required by the state of Colorado and a $ 10 “ bureau fee . ”
Mason Tvert , a member of the panel and the executive director of Safer Alternative for Enjoyable Recreation , which has pushed decriminalizing possession of small amounts of marijuana , said state law requires the surcharge and the $ 10 bureau fee .
He said that if Presiding Judge Marcy Celeste accepts the recommendations , the penalty would still stand at $ 111 .
Tvert said lowering the fine would send a message to police “ that it is not worth their time or the court ’s to issue any more citations . ”
The panel agreed to send the letter to the judge on a 6 - 2 vote .

Laptops ai n't cheap , and unattended laptops are one of the first things a thief keeps an eye out for .
What are thieves not all that eager to steal ?
Unattended newspapers .

The mitemite unnecessary objects lab sells newspaper laptop sleeves designed to make your laptop fade into the background in public .
These laptop sleeves sell for around $ 86 , which is a lot , but we 're featuring it because , frankly , how hard could it be to make your own newspaper sleeve for a fraction of the cost ?
We love the idea ( it reminds us of the uglified digital camera ) , though it does seem to have at least one obvious downside :
While thieves probably are n't going to be attracted to your newspaper , normal people " borrow " unattended newspapers all the time .
Presumably most people will leave your stuff alone once they discover that your newspaper is actually a laptop , but it still might be asking for trouble .
( On the flipside , we 'd never suggest leaving your laptop unattended just because it's in a newspaper sleeve .
The only way to ensure your stuff is n't stolen is to keep it with you .
A newspaper sleeve is just a fun way to make your laptop a little less conspicuous just in case . )

From Shakespeare to Hitchcock , mistaken identity makes for a powerful narrative .
A police officer who ’s proud of his reputation for getting along with black officers , and for teaching cadets to avoid racial profiling , feels maligned to be cast as a racist white Boston cop .
Image Maureen Dowd Credit ...
Fred R. Conrad / The New York Times
A famous professor who studies identity and summers in Martha ’s Vineyard feels maligned to be cast as a black burglar with backpack and crowbar .
Race , class and testosterone will always be a combustible brew .
Our first African - American president will try to make the peace with Gates ( who supported Hillary ) and Crowley ( whose father voted for Obama ) .
I tracked down Gates by phone at J.F.K. on Friday after he had talked to the president and agreed to go to the White House for a symbolic beer with the man he labeled “ a rogue policeman . ”
Gates , coughing from a cold he picked up in China , said he wondered if perhaps “ fate and history chose me for this event . ”
He was pleased with the thousands of empathetic e-mail notes he ’s getting , material for a PBS documentary on racial profiling .
He says he ’s ready for “ marriage counseling ” from the “ Solomon ” in the Oval , who wrote in his memoir that the police pulled him over “ for no apparent reason . ”
“ If Sgt. Crowley and the president and I meet , it ’s clearly not going to be like Judge Joe Brown , OK ?
‘ You tell your side , you tell your side . ’
We have to agree to disagree .
But I would be surprised if somebody did n’t say , ‘ I ’m sorry you were arrested . ’ ”
How can they ever reconcile their accounts ?
Crowley says he asked Gates to come outside and the professor replied , “ Ya , I ’ll speak with your mama outside . ”
Gates wryly suggests
Crowley got the line from watching “ Good Times ” as a child .
“ Does it sound logical that I would talk about the mother of a big white guy with a gun ? ” he asked .
“ I ’m 5 - 7 and 150 pounds .
I do n’t walk on ice , much less ( expletive ) with some cop in my kitchen .
I do n’t want another hip replacement . ”

Dear Blog
This entry is very , very hard to write .
Hard enough that it took a family meeting , a call to the authorities , a conference with my webhost and long hours of talks with friends to decide what the right thing to do is .
It is this .
I get mean emails and comments .
I do n't mean " email that disagrees with me " because disagreeing with me or holding a different opinion than me is n't mean .
If I like Prince ( and I do ) and you send me an email saying you think Prince sucks - I do n't think that 's mean .
What I mean is when I say " I love Prince " and someone emails with " how can you think that you must be so f**king stupid you dumb bitch , I hope you never sell another book that 's how f**cking stupid you are . "
That 's mean .
( It 's also almost a quote from an email from a few years ago , but there you go . )
Every once in a while there 's a mean comment , but mostly they are mean emails , because most mean people like to be privately mean , and do n't care for the light to shine on them at all .
The internet encourages this sort of thing , the private meanness , because ... well .
It 's really private .
You do n't have to face the person you 're hurting , you do n't even have to use your real name .
You can give over to every single low , unreasoned impulse you have ever had , and there 's almost no way that anyone could ever hold you accountable or make you stop .
As a general principle , I am opposed to fighting fire with fire .
In my experience it just makes more fire .
Usually I ignore the mean emails , as well as ignoring the mean comments - with one exception .
Every once in a while , someone who has been commenting nicely on the blog using a name I know hauls off and sends me something terrible under another name - thinking they 're anonymous .
The first time they do this , I ignore it .
Everybody 's entitled to a mistake once in a while .
If it happens again , I send them a really polite but firm email letting them know that they are actually not anonymous , that my server sends me emails with the IP address attached to comments , and that they might want to conduct themselves accordingly .
This has been remarkably successful in reducing the mean .
It turns out that if they are n't anonymous , most normal , mentally healthy people having a poor impulse or a bad day get a grip on themselves instantly , and usually , in the spirit of " we all make mistakes " we go on to talk about it , start over and move on .
I shine a little light on it , remove the perceived privacy , and the whole thing gets sane fast .
In recent weeks , this approach has n't worked .
There is one person , who had previously commented on the blog who went off the deep end with my Canada Day entry , ( although she had previously twittered and blogged some strange stuff about me ) and left some anonymous comments designed to insult and inflame people .
I sent her a note , letting her know that she was not indeed anonymous , that I knew who she was and tried to shine the light on her .
It read :
Dear Name Removed
I understand you do n't like me , that much is clear and you 're welcome to feel that way .
I do however , want you to know that the attempt to leave anonymous comments is not just somewhat cowardly , but pointless .
Your comments today as " Name Removed " from the fake address of " email removed " still show up as you .
If you 'd like to take a stab anonymously - this one is n't quite working .

The above ( and nothing has been deleted from it , that is how it appears in my sent folder with the exception of her name and email ) was an email that the poster has referred to as violent , rude , mean , nasty , insulting and cursing .
Since that email and that day , things have been out of hand .
Badly out of hand .
No matter what I write , what I say or what I do ... She 's been writing and promoting hateful blog posts and tweets , leaving inflammatory and rude comments , and sending me horrible mail , which I 'm afraid may not be entirely rational .
I have been doing my best to not feed the fire , although I have been deleting her comments for several reasons .
( For the record , there is only one other person who 's comments have ever been deleted on this blog .
Their comment was blatantly and viciously racist . )
I have been deleting because :
1 . Her comments are intended to hurt people .
I wo n't pay for the bandwidth on that .
2 . Her comments are intended to rile people up , generate conflict in the comment section , injure me and are not how I will be spoken to in a place where I pay the bills .
3 . I believe that if I left the comments , some of you would defend me , thus giving her the satisfaction and attention she craves and giving her a more of a forum for hurting others .
4 . Her comments have been accompanied by private email that is nothing short of awful .
These comments appear regularly , I watch for them and I have been deleting all of them as a matter of policy , hoping it would get old for her .
Yesterday it all came to a head .
I have been reading her blog , partly because I think it 's a good idea to know what she 's up to , and partly because I 'm a little afraid , and reading her blog helps me feel like I know what 's going on .
She 's been sending me email telling me she can see me reading her blog , since she 's worked out what my IP address is , and I suppose I do n't mind .
After all , she 's clearly reading mine .
Yesterday , after her latest comment , I checked her blog , read it , and left the window open .
( Apparently for 96 minutes .
Who knew ? )
During that time , someone who had seen that comment on this blog before I could delete it , followed the link to her blog and left some sane , reasonable ( although not necessarily nice ) comments defending me .
This woman is now convinced that I left those comments , or that I had someone leave them .
( This is because the other person had a Canadian IP address . )
This has inspired her to new and frightening heights .
She left a comment calling me names , and I wrote back and told her the truth .
It was n't me , that I would never leave her a comment ( I believe I used the phrase " cold day in hell " ) and suggested that it were possible that there was more than one Canadian in the world .
I was not rude .
I was firm .
I did not call her names .
I did not insult her or threaten her .
She responded with another mocking , insulting email , accusing me of reading her blog , and that informed me that I had no " American Grit " and that she had tracked me down and knew where I lived .
I responded thusly :
Name Removed , considering the number of comments you 've left me , I do n't think I need to feel concerned that I check your blog too much .
After all , you 've not been kind , and I think it 's reasonable to be concerned .
I appreciate the time you spend on my blog as well , and I 'm unconcerned about your analysis of my grit ..
Best wishes ,
Stephanie
This was a mistake .
This was the big one .
For some reason , this was my correspondence with her that was so cruel to her that she redoubled her efforts .
( Note : These are comments she intended for public consumption .
I deleted them . )
At 10:13 she left this comment :
A little advice harlot : Do n't try to get into a fight with an American
girl .
We fight hard and dirty .
Especially when it 's directed at a person
who takes Americans like fools .
Trust me ... we 're not fools .
And guess
what I also found out ?
Your publisher is CONTENT DELETED TO REMOVE IDENTITY .
I 'm already looking up contacts ..... unless you change your
ways , of course ...
At 10:29 :
Like I said before ( before you rudely deleted my comment ) , I DO NOT LIKE IT
when you say anti-American things or else you ridicule us .
We do NOT appreciate being ridiculed .
And you can " hate " on me all you
like , and you can get your friends to comment negatively on my site all you
like --- but it will STILL NOT take away the fact that you make anti-American
comments on your site .
And I am going to take up for us --- both myself and my fellow Americans .
Hell , you make 80 % of your money down here in American --- and we don't
appreciate the fact that you take our money yet insult us on your Canada
Day postings !
It 's been happening year after year !
And go ahead --- get your friends to comment negatively on my site --- I am not
afraid .
I will print their comments and answer their questions .
( Although
yes , I do frequently cuss -- but we 're big girls here , right ? )
You have enjoyed a time where you believed you were the " darling " of the
knitting world .
But that 's about to change .
From now on , you have to EARN
you reputation .
You must show that you love ALL people , not just Canadians .
If you expect Americans to love you , then you jolly well EARN their love
by loving them !
From now on , some of us will be watching and listening .....
and at 10:32 ( unbelievably )
Sorry for the grammar errors --- I type fast and so I frequently leave out
letters .....
At this point she switched to email , and after a conversation with several people .
I did something I 've never done before .
I blocked her at the server level .
We took her IP address and shut her down .
She would n't even be able to see the blog , never mind leave comments anymore .
I was exhausted with worrying she was leaving them , worrying that she was going to start a riot , worrying about what they said ... it was a relief to finally make it stop .
I knew it would n't stop the personal mail , but at least then it would be between the two of us .
Here 's where I do something I 've never done before .
I believe that personal email is personal .
The above from her were left as comments , something she intended to be public , so I do n't mind posting them .
What is below is the mail she sent me when she discovered that she had been blocked from the server .
( She believed that I had become frightened enough of her to shut down the blog . )
I know that posting this is controversial , but I 've come to realize that it is only a matter of time until what she 's doing goes public anyway , and we feel that it 's only fair that we show you what it is that she 's doing privately , so that you can understand our extreme measures , especially when we are accused of censorship .
We have removed her name , and wo n't be revealing her identity .
What 's the matter , YH ?
Lost your nerve and guts ?
You pulled your blog off the server !
YOU ARE CHICKEN !
Can't take the heat , can you !
You are one of those few cowardly people who can't take criticism --- it makes you nervous !
You havevn't the backbone to answer back to somebody who takes you to task !
This cowardly behavior of yours makes Americans laugh like hyenas !
We disdain people who can't use their backbone to defend themselves !
You do n't deserve to take a defensive position !
You 're a PUSSY ! , the worse criticism of all the American list of insults .
( I will refrain from making comments here about how I feel about slang for a woman 's body parts being used as a hurt ... that 's a rant for another day )
Then about five minutes later :
Sorry .... did n't think you were so weak !
HA HA Ha Ha Ha Ha Ha !!!!
What a weakling .
Now I know why your husband is so worthlessl .
He 's the one who tries to " make music " , heh !
Got his car stuck in the snow and you ( a woman ) had to come rescue him !
The best laugh was when you got married by a weirdo who has no religion !
Without God as part of your ceremony !
You 're atheists !
And probably wiccans !
sorry ---- did n't realize how weak you guys were .
Word to the wise --- do n't take on a CHRISTIAN woman again .
We have God on our side .
You would do well to read the Christian Bible and find out who Jesus is for your souls .
Then , once she realized it was just that she was blocked :
I love challenges .
So does my computer wizard guy , Name Removed ( oh , and all his friends ....)
See you on your website soon .--- the problem has been solved already but I 'm tired of you this weekend .
And , be advised .... I hope you 've learned your lesson about how doggedly I complain against anti-Americanism types .
I wo n't appreciate it if I ever see anymore anti-American comments on your site again .
( Yes , I can access your site --- did you really think a block would work ?
You obviously do n't know much about computers . )
--------------
You 're played out as a writer .
( How many " comedy " books did you think you could do ?
It 's getting old ....)
And Americans are getting TIRED of the left .
( And you are a typical Canadian left . )
Keep going ..... keep trying to antagonize me .... because you are only getting more looney .
Have n't you noticed how the " respectable " knitters are distancing themselves from you ?
( Yeah , you did n't think I knew . )
Hah , keep trying to aggravate me --- it will be your downfall .
And I will laugh my head off --- as will all my friends who can't stand you .
Sadly , it would appear that she was n't tired of me this weekend , because by this morning there were a few more emails , and she had a new IP address and two new comments , which went up while I was away from my computer .
The first read :
Hey , Yarn Harlot , I did n't appreciate your rude emails .
I do not deserve
them nor does the rest of the American knitters who do n't appreciate your
anti-Americanism comments .
Did you think this was a game ?
It 's not .
Many
of us have totally HAD it with your arrogant , holier - than - thou
anti-Americanism .
I have taken up the cause , because I personally don't
think Americans should buy your books .
I will not let you off the hook
for this .
I will constantly watch your site for anti-Americanism and I
will hopefully educate you in how to relate to America as a friendly
nation , a nation who saved your butts over and over throughout history .
I wo n't post the second one , because it reveals her identity .
For the record , she is referring to the correspondence I posted above as my " rude emails " I have sent her nothing further .
( Also for the record , I believe we define " rude " very differently . )
I have blocked her IP again .
Her twitter feed is a string of tirades and accusations about me , the emails keep coming , and I 'm sure she 'll have her IP address changed in a few hours .
I absolutely cannot keep up with her , the lies , the threats or the accusations .
She believes that everything I do , every post I write , ever tweet I log , even mentioning drinking a beer , is about her .
Everything I write is bait to her , and I can't stop writing .
One of her comments is definitely going to make it onto the blog while I 'm sleeping or eating or with my kids .
I 've spoken with my web host , the authorities , and some other resources to see what I can do ... but I realized that this morning , I was going to fail .
She is determined to take it public , determined to get a comment up and determined to keep hurting me .
She 's decided something about me , and I 'm not engaging .
I do n't think it 's true , or that she 's right ... but eventually , she 's going to get the attention that she craves .
More people are going to notice , no matter how much I keep trying to keep it from going viral and creating conflict in the comments .
This has been a difficult time .
I struggle with self - esteem as much as the next person , and these emails feel exactly like my critical inner voice , the part of me that is irrationally hard on me , suddenly got my email address and started sending me mail and comments .
I 've tried to cope , to not be hurt , to know it 's not true , but the whole thing is scary , especially once she started referring to my parenting ( did n't tell you about that one ) and my family in general .
I am searching in my heart for sympathy for her , because this must be taking up a lot of time for her , and because I do n't think you do something like this to another person with this sort of dedication without really having some emptiness or hurt inside you , and that 's sad .
Really , genuinely sad .
Here 's the thing , the reason I 'm putting all this here now .
I 've kept this to myself for a month .
It 's not stopping .
I 'm trying to stand by what I believe .
That shining light on something can help , and because I 'm going to need your help .
She is going to change her IP address .
She is going to leave more comments , and I am going to be busy one of these times that it happens .
It 's inevitable , and I need to be able to sleep at night without worrying that a riot has erupted in my comments , or that someone is wondering why the hell this woman is accusing me of all these horrible things .
I want the background to be public , so that it is n't confusing , suspicious or bizarre when / if you see one of her rants .
When that happens , I 'd really , really like all of you to know my position , although of course , you are welcome to yours .
Light .
Love .
Respect ... even to those who do not demonstrate it to you .
I do not believe in an eye for an eye , and I 'm asking , politely , that when you hear from this woman ... that you just take a deep breath , even if she 's insulting ( or misrepresenting ) your country ( and trust me Canadians , she 's no fan ) to me , to you ... to anyone - that we just all try to take some of this power away from her .
The last few days have proved that any measure of attention is incitement .
Defending me , explaining to her , taking her on ... only makes it worse , only increases the number and hurtfulness of the private mail she sends .
She 's lost the right to post here , I 'll keep deleting her .
When or if you see her posts , I hope you wo n't engage , wo n't visit her blog to tell her what you think of her , wo n't insult her , wo n't injure her ... wo n't lower yourself to her level .
( Unless , of course , you agree with her . )
Thank you , and I 'm sorry this is where we 're at .
Let 's never speak of this again .

This conceptual gel remote from Panasonic lays limp when not in use , pulsating with a soft light .
But when its sensors detect a hand coming , it stiffens , ready for action !
Constructed of a soft , flesh - like gel , the remote appears cold when off .
Once turned on , however , it seems to come to life .
A soft light emanates somewhere from within as the center of the device begins to slowly rise and fall , mimicking the tranquil motions of breath .
Left undisturbed , the remote will slumber peacefully .
But should a human hand approach , sensors inside alert it to the imminent touch .
It stops breathing , grows rigid - the light from within is extinguished .
Wow , congratulations on the world 's creepiest remote , Panasonic .
Limp when not in use , rigid when you touch it -- does n't that remind you of something else ?
No ?
Me neither .

Thanks Anothony , but put that away .

I knew a bus driver once .
Alcoholic cross dressing regular at my old local he was and an entertaining one at that .
He had LOADS of stories of deliberate bastardry against passengers like : Deliberately stopping in front of puddles so they'd have to step in water .
Angling the bus in sharply at stops when it had rained so the water would sheet off the roof and soak everyone as he braked .
Bypassing stops or entire stretches of his route to make up time after stopping for a sandwich or quick beer .
Refusing to accept $ 10 notes all day ( or $ 5s or $ 20s , whatever he fancied ) .
Refusing to speak English to anyone all day .
Accelerating or braking to send people falling all over the place .
Best one he told however was when the bus was loaded with people he'd look in the mirror and mutter to himself " You 're all worthless cunts are n't you ? " then tap the brakes and watch them nod in agreement . ( , Sat 27 Jun 2009 , 8:17 , 5 replies
This is a test given to 2nd graders in China !
Try to switch the frogs to the opposite side .
Click to begin .
Note :
There is a secret , yet simple , way to solve the puzzle .
Do n't give up .
It can be done !
Yesterday in Salisbury a band of about 30 protestors braved the humidity and threat of rain to send a message to Congressman Frank Kratovil – keep Obamacare and the government out of our lives !
Let me say straight away that I would n’t have recommended the noose and effigy of Frank Kratovil .
The “ no Kratovil in 2010 ” ( as in the first photo below ) would have been effective enough .
And it ’s not like the signs were n’t quite creative , like the ones in the second and third photos below .
Obviously those in the protest had concerns about Obamacare .
Chief among the murmurs was coverage of illegal immigrants and the lack of tort reform while the rest of us lost our option to keep private health insurance .
As one observer put it , private solutions can do a better job while another complained ( correctly ) that “ small businesses do n’t know what to do ” because the federal situation is in such flux .
Eventually the group was greeted by Kevin Lawlor , who is the Communications Director for Congressman Kratovil .
Lawlor stressed that the Congressman was “ not committed ” yet on the Obamacare bill and that he has “ a lot of questions and concerns ” about it .
One criticism I would have about the organization of the protest is that the questioners strayed from topic .
I think they perceived the flip - flop by Kratovil on cap - and - trade ( many protestors noted Frank was originally leaning against it ) as a sign of him being “ Nancy Pelosi ’s lap dog . ”
But Lawlor countered by saying a lot of people were for cap - and - trade too , and that the office averaged 500 to 600 calls a day in the heat of that debate .
Moreover , Frank “ does n’t think cap - and - trade will fail ” , according to Kevin .
Once the questioners got around to debating the merits of the healthcare reform bill , the remark by Lawlor that “ people want to see some reform ” was met by the retort that several states had tried and failed at being healthcare providers .
Congressman Kratovil , noted Kevin , “ supports the public option but not at the expense of private insurance ” and countered that the extra taxes people were concerned about were already being paid when those uninsured can’t pay for their health care .
Lawlor also claimed that Kratovil is asking the same questions we are and “ trying to change ” the legislation to “ make it better . ”
But the sentiment among those in front of Frank ’s office was one of skepticism .
“ Leave us alone , we ’ll fix it ourselves ! ” cried one .
Another in the crowd , which was made up primarily of seasoned citizens , asked why she was forced to give up her private insurance when she became eligible for Medicare .
Kevin pledged that the Congressman “ will not vote for a bill that makes people leave private insurance ” and further stated that Kratovil is “ doing his best to let people know why he votes the way he does . ”
I found one question asked by a protester had an answer both troubling and disturbing .
Since I know Frank ’s office reads monoblogue , perhaps they can clarify this response .
When asked about the Constitutionality of the proposal , Lawlor responded that the Congressman “ does n’t necessarily think ” this conforms to the Constitution .
I guess I ’d like to know where a lot of other items he ’s voted for manage to conform to our founding documents .
Since I ’m certain this is n’t going to be a one - shot deal , the suggestions I would make to the protestors would be to stay on topic better and designate one or two spokespeople to ask questions .
Granted , this turned out to be a peaceful 45 minute dialogue but a lot of energy was wasted on items which were n’t really germaine – Frank ca n’t change his cap - and - trade vote ( although he can vote against any version coming from a House - Senate conference . )
Kevin noted that he ’d addressed a similar protest in Bel Air last week and another is coming up .
Now a special treat for monoblogue readers .
A different rally occurred last Wednesday down on the Eastern Shore of Virginia .
District 100 Delegate candidate Melody Scalley ( a definite friend of monoblogue ) sent along a few photos of the Eastern Shore Declare and Defend Rally down at the Eastern Shore Community College in Melfa and described it this way :
Excellent speakers from the Eastern Shore and East Coast !
Many local Eastern Shore men and women spoke about their concerns for the Eastern Shore , Virginia and our Country .
Speakers from across Virginia , Maryland , North Carolina and even Washington DC came to our rally to express their concerns .
My sincere thanks to everyone who joined us for this event !
We are all concerned about the direction that our Government is headed and the amount of Government spending underway .
( snip )
Following the rally over 30 people enjoyed dinner at a local restaurant , prompting someone to say that we were bringing our own private business stimulus to the Eastern Shore !
She also sent along her own photos .
I have to say that she ’s done it very conveniently in a nice 640×480 format – thanks Melody !
It ’s worth pointing out that the Maryland part of the Eastern Shore was well represented by Andrew Langer of Campaign for Liberty and Pocomoke City mayor and General Assembly candidate Mike McDermott , along with other local and national speakers on a variety of conservative topics .
I ’m also working with Melody on something that could be a first for monoblogue , so stay tuned for that .
Finally what can I say ?
I hope the title gets me some extra Google hits .
But the mood among many freedom - loving Americans is one of panic , albeit a restrained panic thus far .
It ’s why these rallies have suddenly become big news as government tries to become a bigger force in our lives .
We may have gotten a late start but that does n’t mean we ca n’t fight to the finish .

It soon will be – if it not already is – known as the Twitter revolution in Iran .
But I ’ll think of it as the API revolution .
For it ’s Twitter ’s architecture – which enables anyone to create applications that call and feed into it – that makes it all but impervious from blocking by tyrants ’ censors .
Twitter is not a site or a blog at an address .
You do n’t have to go to it .
It can come to you ( as newspapers should ) .
Twitter is an outpost in the cloud and there can be unlimited points of access from every application and site using its API , so the crowd can always stay ahead of the people formerly known as the authorities .
That , I believe , is the keystone in the architecture of the new infrastructure of unstoppable freedom of speech and democracy .
That ’s what enables Clay Shirky to declare , “ This is it – the big one . ”
It is n’t merely “ social media ” that make this a step - change in the internet ’s impact on society and government , as the reporters who ’ve been calling me and other pundits want us to say .
Sree Sreenivasan tweeted , “ on CNN just now , I asked – China quake , Mumbai attacks , US election , Iran … how many times can one technology ‘ come of age ’ ? ” RIght .
See January 16 , 2001 when , as Howard Rheinhold recounts in Smart Mobs , tens of thousands of protesters against Philippine president Joseph Estrada were brought to a square with an SMS .
See Mark Zuckerberg proudly talking about the Spanish - language Facebook being used to organize Colombians against FARC .
Iran is just another example of people organizing themselves online for a cause or a revolution .
The people will avail themselves the latest available technology to serve their needs and cause .
Twitter is different because it ’s live and social – the retweet is the shot heard ’ round the world – and because that API lets it survive any dictator ’s game of whack - a- mole .
But it ’s by no means the final word in digital revolutions .
I know we will soon see witnesses and participants to events such as these broadcasting them live from their mobile phones .
We will see people organizing with Google Maps .
We ca n’t imagine what will come next .
Twitter has been used in many ways in the Iran story :
* Citizens of Iran are using it to inform each other .
* They are using it , most importantly , to organize .
* They are using it to inform the world .
* We outside Iran are using us to see what people were saying and doing in Iran .
Journalists are using it as a tip service to news and a way to find witnesses to interview .
I ’ve said in Twitter – to respond to the obvious complaint I hear – that , no , Twitter is no more the final source of news in and of itself than Wikipedia is the only source of knowledge .
But it is a tip service for journalists who then still need to do their job and report .
* We can use it to see the interests of at least the Twitter demographic – limited though it may be – and then to use that to beat up CNN , Fox , and MSNBC for their terrible news judgment last weekend as they all but ignored a revolution .
Of course , Twitter – and Facebook and blogs and camera phones – alone cannot win a revolution .
They cannot protect their users from government ’s bullets and jails , as we have seen all to tragically in Iran .
( This thought led Tom Friedman to the worst line on the New York Times editorial page , worse even than the worst of Maureen Dowd : “ Bang - bang beats tweet - tweet . ” )
Fighting for freedom requires courage and risk we must not underestimate .
But at least these tools allow allies to find each other and to let the world know of their plight .
For thanks to the fact that anyone in the world – outside of North Korea – now has a printing press and a broadcast tower , they can be assured that the whole world is watching .
I recorded a Skype video interview for Al Jazeera English that will air at 20000 GMT today and looked at the camera and said , “ Despots , beware . ”
Your days are numbered .
This is more than a revolution .
It is an evolution in the architecture of speech and freedom .
: LATER : Note that not just Iran is censoring the internet .
Germany wants to , seeking a censorship infrastructure that can be used for one purpose today , another tomorrow .
Oh , when will they ever learn ?

Advertisement Mahmoud Ahmadinejad has been sworn in for a second term as Iran 's president , after weeks of post- election unrest .
In an address after the ceremony , he criticised foreign powers who have cast doubt on the validity of the election , saying Iran would resist them .
Opposition supporters protesting outside parliament were met by hundreds of riot police .
Germany , France , Britain and the US all said they would not be sending letters of congratulation to Mr Ahmadinejad .
At least 30 people died during the street protests which followed the 12 June poll .
Mr Ahmadinejad now has two weeks to form a government that must then be approved by parliament .
' We will resist '
Taking his oath of office , broadcast live on state TV , Mr Ahmadinejad promised to " protect the official faith , the system of the Islamic revolution and the constitution " .
ANALYSIS Jon Leyne , BBC Tehran correspondent
The formalities have been observed .
Iran 's authorities will be pleased that the show of unity was maintained as Mr Ahmadinejad was sworn in for his second four - year term .
For the moment the fractured Iranian establishment has come together to agree on the one thing that unites them - decrying foreign interference in their domestic affairs .
Nevertheless , there was a substantial boycott by reformist members of parliament , and by leading opponents of Mr Ahmadinejad , including former President Rafsanjani .
Already the conservative press is speculating about the new cabinet .
The conservative Hamshahri newspaper called for the new ministers to be " efficient , religious and prudent " - a strong hint that conservatives have not been happy with the calibre of past ministers .
The opposition has kept up its pressure on the streets .
The appearance of calm and normality in Iran 's affairs of state may not last very long .
Tough challenges facing president
In the address that followed , he called for " a national will , a national resolve " , and told his audience : " We need to join forces . "
" I do not have any incentive other than serving the people and the country and I do not think of anything but the progress and development of the nation , " Mr Ahmadinejad said .
Following the swearing - in , he used his first address to defend the official results of the election - which gave him an overwhelming victory - and criticised Western powers ' response to the disputed poll .
" Some governments should feel responsible for their words and deeds , " he said .
" The people of Iran are for a constructive dialogue ...
We will resist violations of law and abuse ... " [ Foreign governments ] just want democracy at the service of their own interests - they do not respect the rights of other nations .
They see themselves as the yardstick of democracy - our people oppose this , that 's what our people are resisting , " he said .
Several states which have criticised the elections said they would not be sending customary letters of congratulations to Mr Ahmadinejad to mark his reappointment as president , including the US , Germany , France and the UK .

Outside , hundreds of demonstrators gathered .
There were reports of clashes with riot police and at least one arrest .
Khamenei endorsement
There were some notable absences for Wednesday 's inauguration ceremony , though envoys from the European Union and the UK did attend .
After the election I demonstrated in support of the government .
This is because I see the protesters as a minority group who are trying to impose their view on the majority

Iranian views : Divided country
In pictures : Election crisis Mr Ahmadinejad 's predecessors as president - Mohammad Khatami and Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani - were missing , as they were from a formal ceremony to endorse his presidency on Monday .
Also missing were two defeated opposition candidates - Mir Hossein Mousavi and Mehdi Karroubi - who continue to contest the results .
In addition , a reformist faction of about 70 MPs said only about 13 of its members attended - and some of those who did attend reportedly left during Mr Ahmadinejad 's speech in a show of protest .
Mr Ahmadinejad has received the backing of Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei , who has supported him throughout the unrest .
FROM THE TODAY PROGRAMME Please turn on JavaScript .
Media requires JavaScript to play .
More from Today programme Mr Khamenei said Mr Ahmadinejad was the rightful winner and that Iranians had " voted in favour of a fight against arrogance , to confront destitution and spread justice " .
Meanwhile in the US , White House spokesman Robert Gibbs retracted his description of Mr Ahmadinejad as the " elected president " of Iran .
Mr Gibbs said he had misspoken and that the US would leave it up to the Iranian people to decide whether the election was fair .
The BBC's Tehran correspondent , Jon Leyne , says forming an acceptable , credible government could be the real challenge for the Iranian president .
Mr Ahmadinejad has been dogged by controversy in recent weeks , becoming embroiled in a series of disputes with conservative politicians who would normally be his allies .
More than 100 people , including some members of the opposition movement , went on trial in Iran on Saturday for their alleged involvement in the post-election violence .
Foreign media , including the BBC , have been restricted in their coverage of Iran since the election protests turned into confrontations with the authorities in which at least 30 people were killed .

About six months ago , Michael Bay approached Digital Domain , the Academy Award winning special effects company behind movies like Benjamin Button , Titanic , and the The Fifth Element , with a last minute request .
He needed a closeup .
( WARNING : Minor Spoilers Ahead )
Advertisement
Digital Domain was already working on some secondary characters for Transformers 2 while George Lucas ' Industrial Light and Magic building the main robots like Optimus Prime .
Yes , Transformers 2 had such a big budget that DD was hired just to ride shotgun .
Advertisement
One key moment of DD 's handiwork depicts the transformation of a girl named Alice — played by actress Isabel Lucas — into a lethal robot .
The main shot , seen above , uses digital techniques like advanced particle simulation ( physics ) to tear 10,000 pieces of skin away from a girl 's body — the kind of high - concept graphics that require lots of software know - how , and computers to do incredible amounts of heavy lifting .
It was the sort of shot that showcased everything DD could do .
When Michael Bay saw it , he found it lacking .
After watching an early edit of the movie , Bay had decided that although the wide shot of Alice was nice , the film was missing a close - up — he wanted 40 frames of the girl 's face as she began transforming .
The close - up would n't take as much as the full - body master shot .
Instead of 10,000 pieces of skin , only about 50 had to move .
But because of time , budget and manpower constraints , this animation had to be done the old - fashioned way — working by hand .
It meant that five guys would spend the next three months of their lives on less than two seconds of the finished film .
Computer graphics supervisor Paul George Palop walked me through their process of crafting the " very , very painful " 40 frames .
Advertisement
The goal sounded simple : Transform this closeup of a human into a closeup of a robot .
Alice 's face would begin to shatter away , revealing a gruesome creature underneath .
But to model in 3D over digital film takes some prep work .
To make the effect look real , the guys would need to map the 2D film original shot into digital 3D space .
Then they could add all the neat robot stuff .
Advertisement
First , the DD team cut out all of the background and extraneous objects ( including Shia LaBeouf 's head ) , isolating the female figure .
It 's the first step of a classic technique known as rotoscoping , a trick that predates Disney , in which animators overlay cartoon characters and other animation on top of live action backgrounds .
( Now that CG has blended humans and cartoons , it 's probably safe to say that there is n't an FX - heavy movie made now that does n't involve some kind of rotoscoping . )
Advertisement
With the basic 2D work done , DD used a laser scan of Lucas ' figure to create a perfect 3D map .
The rotoscope plate was then laid over this map , allowing the animators to work with real image depth and geometry .
We do n't have that exact shot , so we stole a still from the later wide shot to make the point .
On the right , you have the 3D body scan model .
On the left , you can see the 3D applied to the 2D figure .
Advertisement
One artist worked solely on the little skin plates that cracked away around Alice 's mouth .
Each of these 50 or so pieces was hand - animated , frame by frame , to create the short effect .
But to enhance the illusion of movement , artists applied extra texture to the tiles along with some displacement mapping to each tile 's edge , which essentially complicates the square shape into an array of small triangles .
( See how they look all jagged in the version on the right ? )
One the 3D - animated shapes were laid out , they had to be naturally lit , lest the girl 's skin look unnatural before she transformed completely into a metal monster .
Advertisement
In the meantime , the exact movements of the human Alice head needed to be applied to the newly animated robot Alice head , so that any movement from the former could be copied instantly in the latter .
Advertisement
Finally , all of the pieces were composited , rendered and placed on a newly drawn background .
You 'll notice that beyond the obvious visual effects , artists beefed up Alice 's figure a bit .
They rebuilt the end of her left arm and , while they were at it , added a bit more lift in the back of her hair .
Even with a blockbuster megamovie deadline , there 's always time for last - minute styling .
Advertisement
After all of this meticulous work — three months of effort from digital effects masters — audiences everywhere got a bonus 40 frames of remarkable robotic transformation .
Ironically , one of the movie 's chief complaints would be its length .

Floating wind turbines can help shift offshore wind farms out of sight
The world 's first floating wind turbine is to be towed out to sea this weekend .
Statoil 's Alexandra Beck Gjorv told the BBC the technology , the Hywind , to be put off Norway 's coast - " should help move offshore wind farms out of sight " .
And it could lead to offshore wind farms eventually being located many miles offshore , away from areas where they cause disruption , Ms Gjorv added .
This would benefit military radar operations , the shipping industry , fisheries , bird life and tourism .
" Taking wind turbines to sea presents new opportunities , " said Ms Gjorv , of Statoil 's new energy division .
" The wind is stronger and more consistent [ and ] areas are large . "
Floating wind farms are set to be connected to mainland grids via cables across the seabed .
The longer the cable , the more expensive it is , so the distance from land is not set to become unlimited , explained Ms Gjorv .
The Hywind , a 2.3 megawatt ( MW ) wind turbine built by Siemens , combines technologies from both the wind farming industry and the oil and gas sectors , and will be tested off the coast of Norway for two years .
In a similar way to how large parts of icebergs are hidden below the sea surface , the turbine has a 100 metre draft that is anchored to the seabed with cables , that can be up to 700 metres long .
Wealthy customers Floating wind turbine
The flotation element stretches 100 metres below the sea surface
It is anchored to the seabed in three places
It can be moored in waters up to 700 metres deep Offshore wind farms cost considerably more than wind farms on land , and initially floating ones will be more expensive than static offshore installations .
But over time , insisted Ms Gjorv , the floating turbines should not cost more than fixed ones .
Statoil plans to target markets where there is both an ability to pay as well as large and growing demand for energy , she added .
Floating wind farms could later be established off both coasts of North America and off the Iberian peninsula and the coasts of Norway and the United Kingdom , she said .
Floating wind farms could provide an additional source of energy for countries that have run out of space for their onshore wind farms , or where there is not enough wind on land , Ms Gjorv added .
" The global market for such turbines is potentially enormous , depending on how low we can press costs , " she said , though she was not able to quantify it or to outline a timescale for when floating wind farms would become commercially available .

Many adults cannot name a scientist
USA Today ’s Snapshot for 29 June was a survey in which 1000 adults were asked to name a famous scientist .
Here are the results :
47 % named Albert Einstein
23 % could not name anyone
6 % named Marie Curie
4 % named Louis Pasteur
4 % named Thomas Edison
The survey was conducted by L’Oreal , but the methods were not revealed .
Therefore it is not possible to determine if the results can be extended to the adult population in general .
Nevertheless , the poor showing on naming a famous scientist is an indictment of the science education of those who participated in the survey .
I ’m interested in how the readers of virology blog would respond to the question , ‘ Name a scientist ’ – it does n’t have to be a famous scientist , and it should not be a relative , or the author of virology blog .
Do n’t look up someone in a book or online – I ’m interested in who you would think of spontaneously .
Post your answer – just one scientist – in the comments section , or send it to virology@virology.ws .
I ’ll reveal the results here in a few weeks .
In attempting to determine how the L’Oreal survey was conducted , I learned about the L’Oreal - UNESCO For Women in Science Program , an effort to celebrate women who have dedicated their careers to scientific research , and to encourage emerging talent to pursue scientific discoveries .
It ’s a commendable program , and I do hope they impress upon the recipients of these awards the need to educate the public about their work .
I have lived in Europe on two occasions now — for five months in the Netherlands ( two years ago ) and for ten months in Poland ( currently ) .
I have been green - minded since I was a young child , and knew that Europe did better on many green issues .
Nonetheless , to come here and live here has given me more insight on the perspectives of the people and more of a practical understanding of why Europe fairs so much better than the US on many environmental issues .
Recently , I came up with a list of seven things that really stand out to me as good environmental practices in Europe that could be transferred to the US .
These could all be adopted in the US , but some are more personal in nature and some are more systematic .
Furthermore , some of the personal ones regard large , life decisions , and some are much simpler in nature and easier to implement into your life now .
[ social_buttons ]
Of course , Europe is not one country and things vary from country to country .
Nonetheless , there are also several similarities across borders .
I have friends in other countries and have traveled a bit as well , so I hope to be sharing the best of the best .
Here ’s the list !
1 ) Live within a pleasant walk or bike ride from where you shop or work ( or both ) , and use these modes of transport !
A large percentage of people walk or bike to get groceries or to go to work in Europe .
Parking lots at supermarkets and malls are miniature compared to parking lots in the States .
A pleasant walk or ride ( not just proximity ) to your destinations is an important factor — if it is n’t pleasant , it is unlikely your environmental ethic will be stronger than your desire for a comfortable trip .
My master ’s thesis on bicycling in the United States and the Netherlands confirmed this theory .
Of course , there are many hurdles in the system of US cities and how they were built that makes this harder in the US ( i.e. it can be hard to find an affordable place in such a location , and it can be hard to find a good route anywhere because of the way we ’ve planned around cars ) , but there are also many opportunities .
Often , you can find a back - route and 40 % of trips in metropolitan areas in the US are two miles or less , ideal distances for bicycling .
For more information on transportation ’s environmental importance , read “ The Hidden Giant # 2 : Transportation ” .
2 ) Put a basket on your bike , or buy a bike with a basket !
This is common practice in Europe and hardly seen in the US .
Although , city bikes , practical cruisers and Dutch - style bikes are becoming more and more popular in the US ( read this New York Times article ) .
This may seem like a superficial , aesthetic issue , but I think it is paramount to using the bike for transportation purposes .
With a basket on your bike , you can easily go shopping on your bike and it becomes a fun , attractive thing to do .
3 ) Make recycling visible !
This is an interesting one for me , a new one .
In Poland , recycling bins are not hidden ( like the trash bins are ) .
They are generally very visible and accessible , and they are frequent in many cities and even small villages .
Plastic bins are the most prominent .
They are large cages and you can see all the plastic that is in them .
In a traditional society like Poland , but even in the US , social norms can drive environmental action .
When you see a big cage full of plastic , you think , “ Hmm , .. it is normal to recycle and I should be sure I am doing it as well . ”
Social norms and social pressure can be created by simple means such as this .
4 ) Live in a smaller space .
Well , this is a hard one to convince people of , but it is also a big one .
Even if you “ green ” everything in your home , if you live in a big home it can often be more environmentally unfriendly than a smaller home .
Live in enough space for your needs , but do n’t just have a big home to have a big home .
Many of the people in Europe who live in small apartments or townhouses would opt for a big home if they had more choice .
I ’ve heard this in the Netherlands and Poland repeatedly .
Due to governmental policies , an older history , and economical reasons , more people live in smaller homes .
Nonetheless , this is a big reason why Europe is more green .
People have learned to live in smaller spaces and are very creative and efficient with the use of their space .
One example is that people often sleep on fold - out couches ( slightly different from the ones in the US ) , so that your living room turns into a bedroom at night .
This works very well , it seems , and is a big space saver .
5 ) Protect the countryside .
Many countries in Europe have strong protection of the countryside around and between cities and towns .
This is often governmental , so it is a systematic issue .
There is a lot of push to do this more in the US , but it is a struggle and requires citizen support in many cases .
If you get involved in the situation where you live , however , planners and government officials are often on your side and just need more citizen demand to make this happen .
Protection of greenspace is a common ideal in related government fields these days , and especially in the field of city and regional planning .
Make it happen !
6 ) Use the train or bus for long - distance travel .
Common practice in Europe , and several times more efficient that driving or flying ( see this graph ) , traveling by train or bus is an option in the US and you can look into it for your next trip .
Greyhound is introducing new buses that include wireless internet access and electrical sockets .
They will also give more legroom for passengers .
Step outside of the automatic key - in - the - ignition or get - on - a- plane policy and try going by train or bus to your next destination .
7 ) BYOB : Bring Your Own Bag .
Here ’s a simple one to end the list .
Many people here in Europe bring a reusable bag to do their shopping .
I ’m not sure how this process became so popular , as many people do not actually have any special care for the environment or see themselves as environmentalists , but it is a common practice .
Perhaps , because it is easier — bags are easier to carry and unlikely to break — or because some shops charge for a bag ( very few do this , though ) .
Perhaps , it is a habit from the past that was never broken .
Whatever the reason , it is easy to do and still has a huge impact — try to count how many plastic bags you use in a year !
In the US , Whole Foods Market has banned plastic bags from their stores ( pushing reusable bags as much as possible , but still providing paper if needed ) .
Get into the habit and you will find it makes your life easier !

Tired of pinching every penny ?
It ’s not a crime to treat yourself every once in a while .
Even in this economy , it ’s OK to splurge .
What ’s the point of having money , if you never use it to enhance your life experiences ?
After months of worrying about where every penny has gone , it may be time for a bit of a treat .
The key , however , is to splurge wisely .
Getting into debt over a big splurge only worsens matters in the long run .
Instead , get a little enjoyment out of life with these five small splurges :
1. Eating out .
Go out to dinner ( for a smaller splurge , have lunch ) .
Go somewhere you really want to go .
Get an appetizer -- order dessert !
2. Grocery store .
Buy that fancy chocolate , or that fine cheese .
Buy something extra for the table .
3 . Stay an extra night .
Taking a vacation ?
Pay for an extra night in the hotel .
Let the kids enjoy the pool .
4. Clothing .
Buy that top you ’ve had your eye on .
Encourage your husband to purchase new jeans .
Bonus :
Buy them on sale .
5. Relaxation .
Get a massage , or enjoy a pedicure , manicure or shave ( for men ) .
You may not be able to pay for an entire day at the spa , but go ahead and splurge for a single treatment .

Would you marry a bachelor with a million dollars ?
My friends used to raise the same question when we were kids .
What usually sparked a debate was the ensuing query :
What if that man or woman is ugly and cruel ?
Obviously , we were totally clueless about romance and marriage back then .
Now , friends still raise the issue from time to time , but discussions have taken a different twist .
“ Would you marry for love or money ? ”
They now ask .
I just found a report that attempts to answer the million - dollar question .
According to “ Marriage for love of money ” at Wall Street Journal , two - thirds of women and half the men said they would marry for money .
When asked about their “ price ” to see them walk down the aisle , the singles said it would have to be over $ 1 million to $ 2 million in net worth .
But is n’t love the end - all and be-all of happiness ?
Does n’t almost every chick - flick end with a blushing bride marrying the “ man with a good heart ” and they live happily ever after ?
Not necessarily .
It ’s the marriage that comes in bundles of money that lasts .
That ’s at least according to Daniela Drake , a former McKinsey consultant , who recently raised the issue in her piece in Reuters .
Are women better off marrying for money ?
Read
As highlighted by Drake the glaring disparity between women and men in the workplace :
The number of female CEOs on the Fortune 500 grew from eight to 12 in two years .
“ At this rate it will take a little over 100 years for us to represent half of the CEOs in the Fortune 500 , in the year 2128 , ” she said .
Indeed , 12 is a disappointing figure , considering that a lot of women have sacrificed a lot to outpace men in the workplace .
But who ’s to blame ?
Unlike men , women are always torn between motherhood and career , and , unfortunately , many have chosen the path away from the corporate ladder .
So , given that equality in the workplace is impossible to achieve in our lifetime , should women marry rich , then ?
A financial adviser makes it very clear : Women should marry for love , but not for the love of money .
He however , notes that many women from poorer countries who married men from richer ones have very successful marriages .
“ There is something very attractive to women about a man with lots of money .
Similarly , most men are fascinated by women with personal wealth . ”
Personally , I ’m not that financially desperate to pounce on just about anyone with a fat wallet .
Will I ever consider tying the knot with a billionaire , just for his money ?
No .
But if the person I love happens to be that billionaire , that would be perfect !
Let ’s take this further .
What if the one I love has no financial plan in place , has difficulty paying the bills and spends more than he earns ?
Now , that ’s where the problem comes in .
Money issues are the leading cause of divorce .
We ’ve heard that many times .
It does make sense when people say marriage is like a business arrangement , that money plays a critical role in the sustainability of a partnership .
Do you really think your marriage will fare better if your partner is bad with finances ?
Do you honestly want to be with someone who is miserably in debt and squanders away all your hard - earned money ?
I believe that love and commitment are a solid foundation for a marriage .
But we should not ignore the fact that money problems can easily break a union .
I ’m not saying you choose only a rich partner to cover your bases , but rather one who is responsible with money and makes your heart tick at the same time .
The subject is totally thought - provoking .
The underlying message remains the same : Choose your partners wisely .
Deliberately or not , it ’s a financial decision too .
What ’s your take on the issue ?
Although the White House continues to insist that President Obama supports the public option , it 's abundantly clear that he is distancing himself from it .
For example , on July 17 , President Obama said an insurance exchange with a public option was a " must include " element of reform ; on Saturday , he said it was " just one sliver " of reform and wondered why it was getting so much attention .
Transcript :
July 17 , 2009 : Any plan I sign must include an insurance exchange : a one - stop shopping marketplace where you can compare the benefits , cost and track records of a variety of plans – including a public option to increase competition and keep insurance companies honest – and choose what ’s best for your family .
August 15 , 2009 : All I 'm saying is , though , that the public option , whether we have it or we do n't have it , is not the entirety of health care reform .
This is just one sliver of it , one aspect of it .
And by the way , it 's both the right and the left that have become so fixated on this that they forget everything else .
Some thoughts :
Do n't say something is a must have if one month later you 're going to dismiss it as largely inconsequential .
If you want to know why it 's getting so much focus , it 's because ( a ) it has been one of the central elements of President Obama 's reform plan since the campaign and ( b ) because President Obama has previously said it must be included in the final legislation .
If the White House does end up letting the public option disappear without a major fight , many of President Obama 's most ardent supporters , inspired by his " Yes we can " attitude , will withdraw from politics , their previous cynicism once again affirmed by a broken system .
Defeating the public option will be a tremendous victory for the right - wing , and will energize conservative Republicans for 2010 and beyond .
There 's still time to get this thing right .
Let 's hope they figure out a way to get back on track .
The company behind the desert chocolate said it wanted to be " the Godiva of the Middle East " and is in talks to expand into new Arab markets , Japan , the United States and Europe , where it would like to be on sale at the Harrods department store in London .
Knights
Knights is a free multiplayer game involving several knights who must run around a dungeon and complete various quests .
Click here for more screenshots
This game is fun .
It is n't at first because there 's just so much to take in , but stick with it for an hour or two and I promise you this is one of the best games ever created .
Steven Pearson ( reviewing the original Amiga Knights )
Gameplay description
Each game revolves around a quest – for example , you might have to find some items and carry them back to your starting point .
This may sound easy , but as there are only enough items in the dungeon for one player to win , you may end up having to kill your opponents to get their stuff !
Other quests involve escaping from the dungeon , fighting a duel to the death against the enemy knights , or destroying an ancient Book using a special Wand .
While exploring , you will find various items to aid you .
Hammers can smash down wooden obstacles .
Axes can be thrown or swung at your opponents .
Potions and scrolls will give you ( temporary ) powers .
But beware , for there are also dangers , including deadly traps , bloodthirsty vampire bats , and zombies who exist only to kill living knights !
Although this game can be a bit complicated to learn at first ( due to the large number of weapons and items available ) , it is great fun and the customizable quests and random dungeons make it highly replayable .
It can be played online , over a LAN , or in split screen mode .
If any other convincing is necessary that this is one of those multi-player games to play with friends while drinking beer , then consider this : how many other Amiga games let you bash through a door with an axe in a " Here 's Johnny ! " style just before you bury the axe in your opponent 's skull ?

Some history
Knights was originally a freeware game for the Amiga , written by Kalle Marjola in 1994 .
This version uses all of the original graphics and sounds ( kindly made available by the original author on this page ) , but the game code has been rewritten from scratch in C ++.
The main changes compared to the original are faster , smoother gameplay , and the addition of online play .
The latter includes the ability to have more than two players in the dungeon at once – opening up a whole new dimension of Knights gameplay !

Can You FOIA to Find Out If You Have Been Reported to the White House ?
And What is the ACLU 's Position ?
I am clueless about FOIA and related law , but would be interested in knowledgeable responses to the following question .
Is there a mechanism by which an individual can find out , or require the government to disclose , whether he or she has been named ( or some web posting , statement , or other form of speech of the person named ) to the White House email address for submitting " fishy " " disinformation " on the health care debate ?
White House Press Secretary Gibbs denied that the White House is " collecting names , " but it is hard for me to see how , if it is seeking to counteract what it regards as " disinformation " or " fishy " stuff , it can do so without keeping track of that which it wants to respond to and that which it does n't .
In any event , is there a way that a citizen can force the government to disclose if he or she has been flagged to the White House ?
I have also been trying to figure out what , if anything , the ACLU has said officially on the subject .
I served for several years on the Free Speech Policy Committee of the ACLU way back when , and I can't imagine that back then it would not have taken a strong position on such a move by any White House , regardless of party .
On the other hand , as Wendy Kaminer has shown , it 's not that ACLU anymore , so I 'm not so sure .
I 've been on the ACLU official website and do n't seem to find anything , but maybe I 'm just not navigating it expertly .
One reason I think there must be something there that I 'm not finding is that FoxNews reports that in response to an inquiry , the ACLU responded :
The ACLU said in a statement to FOXNews.com that the White House blog is a " bad idea that could send a troublesome message . "
But the organization added , " While it is unclear at this point what the government is doing with the information it is collecting , critics of the administration 's health care proposal should not fear that their names will end up in some government database that could be used to chill their right to free speech . "
I imagine that if the ACLU issued a statement like that , it should appear somewhere on its website , so if someone could point me to it , or anything else the ACLU has said on the matter , I 'd appreciate it .
If it is an accurate statement of the ACLU 's position , I do not exactly understand the following .
( This is a question quite apart from how this position is consistent with the ACLU 's traditional protectiveness of speech against the government . )
How does the ACLU get from " unclear at this point what the government is doing with the information " to the reassuring ( on what basis , one wonders ) conclusion that " critics ... should not fear that their names will end up in some government database " ?
Moreover , how does the ACLU get from there to the conclusion that critics should not fear that they could end up in some database that " could be used to chill their right to free speech " ?
How could the ACLU possibly know any of this ?
How could it possibly know this given its own statement that it is " unclear " what the government is doing with the information ?
Did the ACLU obtain some court order ensuring this that I do n't know about ?
Did it have a conversation with the Obama administration , to which it grants credence it has not traditionally granted any government administration ?
And in any case , how does it get from " unclear " to " should not fear " ?
It is a statement far enough from traditional ACLU views that I wonder whether it is actually accurate , and I would welcome anyone pointing me in the right direction at the official ACLU website to clear up its official position .
( Update : MH at 10:42 says :
I 'm puzzled by the ACLU 's wording too .
Calling it a bad idea and saying they are unsure of what the administration plans seems inconsistent with the last statement .
Perhaps the spokesperson meant to say " critics of the administration 's health care proposal should not have to fear that their names will end up in some government database that could be used to chill their right to free speech " ?
That wording would make a lot more sense to me , too .
Could that be the ACLU 's actual position ?
...
A day later , I have n't seen anything to indicate that the FoxNews statement is not an accurate statement of the ACLU 's position ; please advise if that turns out not be be so . )
I realize this is a pretty incendiary topic , on which I certainly have opinions , but in this case I 'm really looking for knowledgeable views on the freedom of information questions , as well as the official ACLU view , if any .
( Update note : Generally : I 'm looking for legally knowledgeable information about how and whether it is possible to find out whether one 's name has been sent to a White House email address , in which the White House affirmatively created the account and invited people to send in information .
I 'm interested in hearing from people who actually know the law about this .
I do not practice in this area , and I 'm asking a question about the law .
Re the ACLU , I 'm trying to figure out what it 's position is , and specifically to find out how , if at all , it differs from what was quoted in a FoxNews story .
Again , I 'm not actually inviting general comments of an incendiary nature , in any direction .
To 9:49 ( and if the comment was satirical , my apologies for getting slightly huffy here ) : I 'm afraid I do n't understand , first , how it is " rank paranoia " and " shameful " to ask a question as I did ( see above ) .
Second , I do not see in what sense it has been asked in anything but a " civil " tone .
It does not seem to me paranoid , shameful or even the slightest bit peculiar to ask , if the White House sets up an email address and invites citizens to send information concerning their fellow citizens , how and whether one might find out whether one 's name appears therein .
It strikes me as ordinary and normal .
In any event , going to the question of the ACLU and its role - well , one of the general propositions of the ACLU 's Free Speech Policy Committee , when I served on it , was that citizens were quite entitled to ask questions of government , and to ask them whether or not they seemed to government , or anyone else , paranoid or shameful or unworthy .
And that as a general matter , government had an obligation to respond to them , or make an affirmative showing why it would not .
Government would often disagree , and then the ACLU would entertain the possibility of going to court .
As well it should .
Re : 10:23 .
I imagine that this web move was indeed some WH staffer 's not - so - bright idea .
That happens in lots of White Houses .
In that case , there is traditionally a sharp , vicious reaction out in the world at large , the White House mumbles some sort of statement that it there was some miscommunication and issues a quasi-apology while trying to save face , the offending thing disappears , and some hapless staffer loses his or her job .
Pretty much as happened with the Air Force One flyover .
What is disconcerting is that this has not happened , at least not so far .
A final rushed , alas cryptic update , and then I 've gone internet dark :
I will simply say in all candor that I do not understand that there is a meaningful difference between citizens reporting " rumors " and such in the abstract to the White House email address , and reporting on fellow citizens .
It has been a theme of many of the comments , and with all respect , I think it is a difference without a distinction .
Certainly it is the sort of distinction that civil libertarians have long rejected , as a matter of principle .
The principle , however , is not precisely the one that the commentators seem to be saying .
Commenters on this thread , at least , seem to be taking the view that you treat everything the administration is doing in good faith so that unless someone presents evidence of - well , I 'm not clear what for many of our commenters would actually count as something , but let 's say something that would cross the line .
Short of presenting evidence of that , good faith requires that we trust the government .
Other commenters naturally take the opposite view and claim that the administration acts per se in bad faith .
The American constitutional tradition , I suggest , is quite different from either - and consists of two not entirely consistent strands .
First , it consists in not trusting the government .
The freeborn citizens of this country have zero obligation to accept the government 's claims that it collects information or does much of anything else in good faith ; the government has the obligation , as a general presumption - it can be answered , yes , but still a presumption of popular democracy - that it , not the citizens , has to account .
We honor that ornery , recalcitrant position not because we think it is always right , but because it is a considerable bulwark , procedural as well as cultural , against tyranny .
That 's why , crazy as I personally happened to think the left was acting during much of the Bush years , there was a certain abstract honor in it .
But - and this is the crucial but - only as long as you are willing to grant the same to the other side in the alternation of power .
The second is a constitutional tradition of doing the opposite of what I just stated above .
One way of defining the role of ' His Majesty 's Loyal Opposition ' , to express it anachronistically , is to say that it expresses its views , not by taking the majority 's positions as being in good faith - but in ' suspending public disbelief ' in the bad faith of the majority .
Yes , that 's a mouthful - and it is a very difficult balancing act .
It requires acting as though one takes the majority 's policies , proposals , etc. , not in bad faith - which , however , is not quite the same thing as taking them in good faith , or even as though in good faith .
There are subtle differences in affect , attitude and action as among these .
But the problem of the loyal opposition is to walk as far as it can disagreeing with the majority 's preferred policy , while still accepting that it is offered in good faith .
At some point , it might not be able to do so , in which case , well , see the first , above .
It wo n't be possible to give an a priori rule telling one when that point , in good faith of its own , has been reached , alas ; hence many battles of the kind we are seeing over claims of good and bad faith .
But the essential line is not really between good faith and bad faith - it is when the loyal opposition should drop a certain public presumption of good faith .
On the matters of policy substance - raise taxes , lower taxes , etc. , that should be regarded as a very drastic step .
It has not been , by either party , in recent administrations .
However , one thing that the loyal opposition is always right to insist upon is that the ' traditions of process ' be observed punctiliously - because those are the traditions of office by which the majority governs and to which the minority aspires .
The office , including its sacralization through those traditions of process , is greater than either .
Again , to be blunt , however , the current administration does not seem to regard the office as greater than it .
Hence the dispensability of traditions by which the office is honored .
In my view , they include that the office of the President of the United States not ask one group of loyal citizens to inform on the indisputedly lawful , constitutionally protected speech - activities ( even if you think there 's a difference between that and the citizens themselves , which I do n't ) of another group of loyal citizens .
The president of the United States has treated the constitutional speech of citizens as - phrasing here is important , and it is not the equivalent of " the same as " - not sufficiently distinguishable from asking citizens to be on the lookout for suspicious activities that might turn out to be perfectly legal , but might turn out to be a bomb on an airplane , but in which there is a legitimate question of sifting for possible grave and violent criminality .
We do n't really like it in the latter case - and should n't - but accept some part of it , even while arguing over its extent , because it is related to a function of government to protect the physical security of the commonweal against mass criminal violence , for example , mass terrorism .
In the current situation , however , there is no question of criminality or the need to have a suspicion thereof .
The speech is all constitutionally protected , and so even that reason of state , and not simply the desires of a political administration , is quite absent .
Why such a blunder over something that , at least if one is minimally attuned to the traditions of the office , is fairly obvious ?
At risk of giving great offense to many friends and correspondents , the current administration seems curiously to believe that it honors the office , rather the other way around .
Moreover , the presence of - once again , so many friends and colleagues and correspondents , so risking offense - so many luminous and glittering intellectuals does not help the administration to find a certain humility in the mere office of the presidency .
I imagine one reason is that a not - insignificant number do not especially see the office as having any special moral standing , compared , they would say , to a more just and universal institution of governance .
A certain form of cosmopolitanism risks blinding one to the nuance of actual political communities , and to confuse their constitutive political elements with their mere politics .
Nor does it help matters that the prevailing intellectual ( as distinguished from strictly political ) mood within is one of pragmatism .
Mere ordinary people will tend to believe that pragmatism is essentially a synonym for " moderate . "
It was part of the basis on which the Obama administration was elected - pragmatic moderates who would rule through the virtues of technocracy .
But pragmatism as a political philosophy in this case is not strictly a matter of devotion to moderation .
It might be .
But then it might not .
As a political program , it can have the virtue of lowering the affective temperatures of politics - as happened , for example , in the generation in Scotland following the civil wars , for whom pragmatic , technocratic language ( " and now , a Report on the types and numbers of cattle in Certain Highland Villages " ) offered a neutral language out of the wars of religion .
But pragmatism is not essentially moderate or immoderate ; pragmatism is essentially unconstrained except by its own calculations of a remarkably reductionist moral psychology , which is both its virtue and vice .
It arises out of certain versions of utilitarianism , and in that consideration , such things as the embodiment of rights within a political tradition means something very different from what ordinary people might have thought .
This is equally a problem of pragmatists of the left and right , to be sure .
But it is the pragmatism of the left that currently governs .
Pragmatism in pursuit of ends that technocrats in majoritarian power have determined to be welfare maximizing has license to be radical and not always moderate , if that is what it takes .
What matters are the costs on the other side .
At this very moment , however , it might say , considerable numbers of people appear to have drawn from that a need to raise those costs across the country : and yet the pragmatists would be right in substance but wrong as to what people think they are doing .
They think they are exercising their rights to speak and force their political representatives - not rulers - to hear them .
Pragmatism 's virtue is its pursuit of sense .
The problem , however , is that a democratic polity consists partly of technocratic sense , but also of sensibility and that sensibility is embedded primarily in its traditions of process .
( Look , I do understand entirely that half the readers are yawning because this is all so obvious - whereas the other half simply lack the receptors for the kinds of moral distinctions I am suggesting ; it is as though , cribbing William James , I were trying to convert them to the gods of the Aztecs .
The whole debate and all these distinctions do n't register , just as certain things quite fail to register with me , such as the distinction between collecting information on what one 's fellow citizens are saying but not collecting information on them .
We try through mechanisms of cultural assimilation to prevent those gaps from growing too large , and in our public life , we properly try and rely upon the suspension of public disbelief about the good faith of the other .
When those run out of grip upon us , we have a big problem . )
See Burke on all of this , but particularly on his notion of the sublime , to grasp his moral psychology prior to reaching to his ( often quite inconsistent ) politics .
There are subtle differences of sensibility in a democratic polity that the prevailing rationalist , reductionist pragmatism fails to capture , because it insists that all debates are over sense , rather than sensibility .
( See also , a trifle weirdly , my post below about girls and college admissions , and how Austen no longer counts ; fuse it with this one to grasp why the de-emphasis on Austen , and by extension the inability to use a language of politics to express a view on sensibility as well as sense is a way in which the intellectual class denudes our political language of the subtlety necessary to capture even the concept of a " loyal opposition " in a democracy .
La trahison des New Class ?
Yeah , something like it .
I leave everyone else to sort it out , as I am going offline and wo n't be reading comments .
I am sorry if I have offended a sizable number of people with this addendum .
I 'm also sorry that it sounds like what it is - a professor writing at high speed ; I do n't have time to go back and amend or edit .
But my general view of this is captured by Peggy Noonan 's weekend column and likewise , even more strongly if possible , a passing remark of hers a week or so ago in a WSJ column , to the effect that we need to revive the category and analysis of the New Class .
Amen to that .
Agree with her or not ; she 's eloquent and clear - even if I 'm not .

Amateur astronomer Anthony Wesley from Canberra , Australia captured an image of Jupiter on July 19 showing a possible new impact site .
Anthony ’s image shows a new dark spot in the South Polar Region of Jupiter , at approximately 216° longitude in System 2 .
It looks very similar to the impact marks made on Jupiter when comet Shoemaker - Levy 9 crashed into the gas giant in 1994 .
( But read the Bad Astronomer ’s post that the black spot could also be weather . )
UPDATE ( 7/20 ) :
It has been confirmed this is an impact on Jupiter .
Mike Salway shared the news Glenn Orton from JPL has imaged the Jupiter black spot with the NASA Infrared Telescope and he has confirmed it ’s an impact .
The list below shows the times ( in UT ) when the black spot will be visible again ( generated in WinJupos by Hans - Joerg Mettig ) , and found on the Mike Salway ’s Ice In Space website .

If you get the opportunity to observe or image this potential new discovery , please do .
On his observing blog , Anthony said he began observing Jupiter at approximately 11 pm local time ( 1300UTC ) , using a 14.5 ″ Newtonian telescope .
“ I ’d noticed a dark spot rotating into view in Jupiter ’s south polar region and was starting to get curious , ” he wrote .
“ When first seen close to the limb ( and in poor conditions ) it was only a vaguely dark spot , I thought likely to be just a normal dark polar storm .
However as it rotated further into view , and the conditions also improved , I suddenly realized that it was n’t just dark , it was black in all channels , meaning it was truly a black spot . ”
First he thought it might be a dark moon ( like Callisto ) or a moon shadow , but it was in the wrong place and the wrong size .
“ Also I ’d noticed it was moving too slow to be a moon or shadow .
As far as I could see it was rotating in sync with a nearby white oval storm that I was very familiar with – this could only mean that the back feature was at the cloud level and not a projected shadow from a moon .
I started to get excited . ”

LOS ANGELES ( Reuters ) -- Starbucks
Corp next week will open a new neighborhood cafe pilot store that will feature beer and wine , night - time hours and live entertainment such as music and poetry readings .
That Seattle cafe , called 15th Avenue Coffee and Tea , takes its name from its street address and borrows heavily from neighborhood coffee shops .
A Starbucks ( SBUX , Fortune 500 ) spokeswoman said the cafe and any others that follow , would return to making espresso drinks by hand and sell products without the Starbucks logo .
The coffee chain , which has been slashing costs and closing hundreds of poorly performing Starbucks outlets amid a long recession , said the first pilot store is a renovated Seattle Starbucks that was slated to be shuttered by year end .
Starbucks stores around the world currently do not serve alcohol .
What ’s uncontroversial and indisputable is that Goldman alumni have played key roles in both the Bush and Obama administrations ’ responses to the current crisis  even though Goldman has a big stake in the outcome .
The dense revolving - door conflicts of interest are appalling .
Goldman is howling about Taibbi ’s article , but the bottom line was articulated last week by the economic blogger Felix Salmon of Reuters .
He wrote that he could n’t “ think of a single government regulation over the past couple of decades which has remotely harmed Goldman Sachs ” as opposed to the many that “ have done it a world of good . ”
Goldman also rules at the New York Fed , a supposed monitor of Wall Street .
Until May the Fed ’s chairman was serving simultaneously on the Goldman board ; he resigned only after The Wall Street Journal reported that he was also still buying Goldman stock during his Fed tenure .
At least that other failed watchdog , the Securities and Exchange Commission , has now cleaned house .
But Politico reported last week that its new chairwoman , Mary Schapiro , had been the star draw at a lavish June banquet for the S.E.C. Historical Society , an independent organization that sold tables for up to $ 7,500 to “ law and lobbying firms that do business with the S.E.C. ”
Among the buyers : Standard & Poor ’s , a credit ratings agency that enabled the subprime bubble by giving its approval to wildly speculative derivatives .
It ’s against this grand backdrop of business - as - usual at the top of the pyramid that we learned at week ’s end that the speed of job losses is accelerating again .
The government also reported that Americans who still do have jobs now have an average 33 - hour workweek , the lowest since tracking began in 1964 .

The Obama administration ’s response to the economic crisis is rapidly facing its own stress tests .
We will soon learn the ultimate fate and stringency of the regulatory package sent to Congress , including the consumer - protection agency the banks want to maim or kill .
The stimulus ’s ability to put Americans back to work remains an open question .
Should we have a jobless recovery or , worse , a second - wave recession like the one that blindsided F.D.R. in 1937 , it will be as catastrophic for the Democrats as it will be for the country .
Barney Frank seems to understand the political dynamic better than the White House .
He told bankers back in February , “ People really hate you , and they ’re starting to hate us because we ’re hanging out with you . ”
If the administration wants to be reminded of how quickly today ’s already sour mood can turn rancid , Michael Mann ’s haunting “ Public Enemies ” could not be a more apt refresher course .
The casting alone tells you where the audience ’s sympathies will lie : Dillinger is played by America ’s reigning male sweetheart , Johnny Depp , while his G- man pursuer , Melvin Purvis , is in the hands of the thorny Christian Bale .
“ Public Enemies ” does n’t make a federal case of parallels between its era and ours .
It does n’t have to .
But it ’s instructive to revisit the actual history .
In the book that inspired the film , the journalist Bryan Burrough writes that Detective magazine polled movie theater owners during Dillinger ’s yearlong spree of 1933 - 34 , and found that in terms of drawing audience applause Public Enemy No. 1 beat out F.D.R. and Charles Lindbergh .
Roosevelt ran with it .
As Steve Fraser writes in his cultural history of Wall Street , “ Every Man a Speculator , ” F.D.R. “ likened his Wall Street villains to ‘ kidnappers and bank robbers ’ eluding capture ” in his 1936 re-election campaign .
He knew Wall Street manipulators were the real targets of the public ’s ire .
Visible only to those like them and to human children , Damiel and Cassiel are two angels , who have existed even before humankind .
Along with several other angels , they currently wander around West Berlin , generally on their own , observing and preserving life , sometimes trying to provide comfort to the troubled , although those efforts are not always successful .
Among those they are currently observing are : the cast and crew of a movie - a detective story set in WWII Nazi Germany - which include a sensitive and perceptive Peter Falk ; an elderly man named Homer looking for eternal peace ; and the troupe of a financially failing circus , which has closed early for the season because of those financial problems .
One day , Damiel tells Cassiel that he wants to become human , to feel not only the sensory aspects of physical beings , but also emotional aspects .
He embarks on this thought with the full realization that there is no turning back if he decides to do so .

Nothing in his experience of life or politics could have prepared Kenny MacAskill for the walk towards that podium last Thursday and I wondered if he would endure the ordeal ahead .
Scotland 's justice minister , an honest journeyman in the minority part - government of a relatively unimportant country , had nothing beyond a desire to see that natural justice must prevail as he pondered his decision to show compassion to Abdelbaset Ali Mohmed al Megrahi .
This is the man whom Scots justice had found guilty of the biggest terrorist atrocity committed on these islands , the bomb aboard Pan Am flight 103 over Lockerbie in 1988 .
He knew that his decision was being scrutinised on four continents and that his character would be trashed before the hour was spent .
Yet he emerged from his trial with his stature increased and Scotland woke up on Friday with its reputation for decency and fairness enhanced .
MacAskill could have washed his hands of this issue and simply had a terminally ill man spend the few remaining days of his life in a Greenock prison cell .
Few , beyond the masters of the British petroleum industry , would have demurred .
Certainly not Downing Street , whose haunted incumbent would have been praying for such a verdict , and certainly not America whose default position on justice is : " When in doubt , hang them from the neck … especially if they are poor , black and uneducated . "
In the Arab world , there would have been desultory protests but nothing more .
Baghdad , Helmand , Kabul and the West Bank are of far more pressing concern than the final resting place of a man they all wished to forget .
But this unprepossessing minister of justice sought to ignore all the serried interests of the global supermen .
Instead , he found refuge in the fundamental principles of a judicial system that has served Scotland soundly for more than 400 years .
For 16 years now , our statutes have given us leave to release from prison anyone who is deemed by competent medical authority to have three months or less to live .
It was a concession rooted in compassion , pity and forgiveness .
Few in the United Kingdom have ever taken issue with it .
It is a good and just law .
MacAskill simply applied it .
In this case , he used it merely to allow a murderer go home to die .
Before Megrahi , 23 other prisoners had been shown a similar mercy in Scotland .
It was also a decision buttressed by two oncologists and two urologists who provided written documentation that , in their opinions , the Libyan prisoner was in the very last stages of his final agony .
Nor had MacAskill been party to any quid pro quo deal that involved Megrahi dropping his appeal against his original conviction in return for compassionate release .
The desired outcome for the Scottish government was for Megrahi to die in a Scottish jail and for his appeal to proceed .
It was easy for them to reject the Libyan government 's application for release under Tony Blair 's gross act of cynicism in the desert with Colonel Gaddafi in 2005 that established a prisoner transfer treaty between the UK and Libya .
Only one Libyan prisoner resided in a British jail , Megrahi , and yet the Scottish government was not consulted about it .
One senior SNP politician I spoke to last night stated categorically that no deal had been struck with Megrahi : " Politically , the worst option for us was the one chosen by Kenny MacAskill .
But it was also the right and proper one and consistent with the principles this nation strives to govern itself by .
What no one could have foreseen two years ago was the onset of the prisoner 's aggressive prostate cancer and this changed everything . "
The criticism of MacAskill from opposition parties has been pitiful .
Labour leader Iain Gray wasted no time in branding the decision a disgrace , yet he and his party know that the only disgraceful act by a UK politician over this affair was Blair 's deal in the desert which owed more to the interests of British petrochemical companies in securing contracts with a country which owns Africa 's biggest oil reserves than to any notion of justice .
The Conservatives , in the spirit of the nearby Edinburgh comedy festival , suggested that Megrahi be made to see out his final days in a detached bungalow in Newton Mearns , an affluent suburb of Glasgow .
The Liberal Democrats are always keen to demonstrate their utter irrelevance in Scottish politics and they could n't help themselves this time either .
They could do nothing more than criticise MacAskill for dithering in the time he took to come to his decision .
Megrahi's homecoming to Libya has variously been described as triumphant and joyous , strange words to describe an event about a man about to die of cancer .
Did anyone ever truly believe that there would be no fanfare for a man who swears that he is blameless and whom the country believes is innocent ?
But it has been the outrage of the Obama administration in Washington that has been most difficult to stomach .
Hillary Clinton 's cack - handed attempt to interfere in matters under the jurisdiction of Holyrood last week was highly dubious .
Scotland needs no lessons in matters of fairness from a country that has been routinely waterboarding suspects in Guantánamo Bay .
America bows to no one in the art of political expediency .
Surely that was n't North Korea , top of the league in the axis of terror , that Barack Obama 's new best friend Bill Clinton was bending the knee to earlier this month , to secure the release of two US nationals .
Intriguingly , neither the Washington Post or New York Times elected to devote much coverage to Megrahi 's release the following day .
Like most observers , they probably sense that many facts about 21 December 1988 will never emerge and that if justice truly has been dragged through the mud then the process started in the weeks immediately following Lockerbie .
The next time Clinton calls to express her disgust about the decision to send Megrahi home to die , perhaps someone in the Scottish government could ask her in return about the leniency shown to US soldiers involved in the Mai Lai massacre in 1968 .
And then they can remind her about the US warship Vincennes , which blew an Iranian Airbus and its 290 passengers out of the sky in 1988 .
There remain some doubts about the evidence used to convict Megrahi of the Lockerbie attack , yet even if it had been tested once more at a court of appeal along with any new evidence , the decision to convict may still have prevailed .
And it is simply naive to believe that somehow all the conspiracy theories surrounding the atrocity would have been laid to rest by a new trial .
But there is something worse than all of this .
That somehow , even if more answers were found , the pain of those closest to the 270 victims of Pan Am flight 103 could be assuaged a little .
Does anyone truly believe that somehow , even if more answers were found , the pain of those closest to the victims could be assuaged a little ?
Further revelations in another Scottish court will not reduce their loss or remove their hurt .
JSONP Memory Leak
27 July 2009
[ Sorry , this is a technical post .
Non-programmers should probably skip this and listen to some nice accordion music instead . ]
Occasionally one has to defeat the same - origin policy and exchange data from a 3rd party server .
The least ugly hack is the badly named JSONP technique .
Basically you create a script tag , append it to head , then it will fetch a remote JavaScript file and execute it :
script = document.createElement (' script ' ) ; script.src = ' http://example.com/cgi-bin/jsonp?q=What+is+the+meaning+of+life%3F'; script.id = ' JSONP ' ; script.type = ' text/javascript ' ; script.charset = 'utf - 8 ' ; //
Add the script to the head , upon which it will load and execute .
var head = document.getElementsByTagName( ' head ' ) [ 0 ] ; head.appendChild( script ) ;
This works well and can be executed at any time , not just at page load .
As soon as the remote script is loaded it will execute will full permissions .
Data can be sent to the server as in GET parameters on the script URL , and data can be received as JavaScript data structures in the returned file .
One catch is that URLs have a maximum length , one that is not standardized .
Thus if one wants to send more than about a thousand characters , then one needs to break the call into multiple requests .
When run once or twice , this is all fine .
But when run repeatedly , the head will fill up with old script tags .
Deleting them would appear to be easy :
// Remove any old script tags .
var script ; while ( script = document.getElementById( ' JSONP ' ) ) { script.parentNode.removeChild(script ) ; }
The above code will successfully remove the script tags from the DOM .
The problem is that every one of today 's browsers will fail to garbage collect the offending node .
The DOM and the JavaScript world have separate garbage collection algorithms and an entity which has one foot in both is often immortal since each side is scared of corrupting the other side .
Thus the script tags stay in memory .
Since my application involves transmitting significant volumes of data through JSONP , the result was a browser leak in excess of 15 MB per hour .
Leave a few of those tabs open overnight at your own risk .
The solution was pretty simple , accept that the script tag will last forever , but destroy all its properties :
// Remove any old script tags .
var script ; while ( script = document.getElementById( ' JSONP ' ) ) { script.parentNode.removeChild(script ) ; //
Browsers wo n't garbage collect this object .
//
So castrate it to avoid a major memory leak .
for ( var prop in script ) { delete script [ prop ] ; } }
A couple of lines of code saved many terabytes of user memory per day .
Sweet .
As usual IE is the odd browser which requires a special case .
IE does n't like deleting native properties off of DOM nodes .
Fortunately this does n't matter , since IE allows one to reuse script tags .
Just change the SRC property and it will fetch the new page immediately .
Thus one only needs a single script tag in IE .

Soaring population will force millions to flee water shortages in search of refuge - and , according to new figures , Britain will be one of the world 's ' lifeboats ' .
On the eve of a major population conference , Science Editor Robin McKie asks : could the UK cope ?
Britain will become one of the world 's major destinations for immigrants as the world heats up and populations continue to soar .
Statistics from the United Nations show that , on average , every year more than 174,000 people will be added to the numbers in the UK and that this trend will continue for the next four decades .
By then , only the United States and Canada will be receiving more overseas settlers , says the UN .
This increase in British numbers is likely to put considerable strain on the country 's transport , energy and housing , experts warned last week .
" The US and Canada will be taking in more people than us every year by 2050 but they are huge countries , " said demographer Professor Tom Dyson of the London School of Economics .
" Britain , by contrast , is a small nation .
We will feel the impact of all these people .
There will be no getting out of it .
Simply controlling our carbon dioxide emissions will become harder and harder as more and more people arrive on our shores .
In addition , housing , water supplies and transport will be strained and will need greatly increased investment . "
However , other experts say such increases could also produce benefits for the nation , bringing in immigrants who could provide a vital supply of young workers .
These demographers point out that , by 2050 , more than a third of the UK population will be aged 60 or over .
By then there will be a desperate need for bus drivers , care - workers and others to keep the country running and immigrants could fill this gap .
In addition , there is the issue of humanitarian responsibility .
Britain is likely to be one of the few nations to survive the worst effects of climate change while other nations , particularly those in the developing world , have their farmland and fishing grounds destroyed .
It could be argued that the UK has a moral duty to provide shelter for as many refugees as our shores can support .
But deciding what numbers the country might support is a highly controversial issue and will be the focus of a conference on sustainable populations which will be held this week in London .
Organised by the Optimum Population Trust , the meeting will hear that the United Nation expects that by 2050 the world will be inhabited by around 9.2 billion people , compared to its current level of 6.8 billion .
Every day , the equivalent of the population of a large city is added to the numbers of humans , a rise that is now straining the planet 's resources to breaking point .
At the same time , Britain 's population will rise from its current level of 61 million to 72 million by 2050 .
The nation will then be the most populous in the European Union , outstripping Germany , whose population will slump from 82 million to 71 million people as its immigration figures plummet .
The idea that Britain could one day support such numbers has been questioned by Aubrey Manning , emeritus professor of natural history at Edinburgh University .
" There are far too many people living in Britain already , " he said .
" Once our population passed the 20 million level around 1850 , it became too numerous .
That is the figure at which we could no longer sustain our population from our own resources .
We are now three times over the limit and heading for more .
We have long passed the line of sustainability .
As for the planet , its maximum sustainable population is no more than 3 billion , I would say . "
The rise in population indicates that the country is set for some considerable overcrowding .
Britain 's land area is only two - thirds that of Germany , yet it will soon support the same number of citizens .
" This population rise , brought about by rising immigration , will strain our infrastructures - our housing and water supplies - and bring very little advantage to the nation , " said Dyson , who will address the conference .
" Nor do I think these extra people will be able to help in looking after our older people . "
But these points were disputed by Tim Finch , head of immigration for the Institute of Public Policy Research .
" A healthy economy sucks in young , educated people and that is what has happened to this country over the past couple of decades .
These young immigrants have helped keep the country running as our population has started to get older and they will become more important as the decades go past and that ageing intensifies .
The immigration system picks out the best and the brightest of immigrants and they will be of great service to Britain .
That is just a fact . "
The problem is that discussions of population numbers in the past have been associated with talk of eugenics and with attempts at controlling ethnic populations .
As a result , there is little discussion today of the subject or its impact on the environment , a point stressed by James Lovelock , the distinguished environmental scientist .
" The subject has become a taboo , a matter of political correctness , " he said last week .
" And that is dangerous , for the numbers of humans on Earth are going to be crucial to our survival . "
Manning added : " We have stopped worrying about population because other issues - acid rain , climate change and others - have occupied our attention and because past fears of global food shortages were proved unfounded .
But the subject will not go away .
Our planet is now dangerously overpopulated . "
Another conference speaker , Chris Rapley , director of the Science Museum , in London , agreed .
" We desperately need to bring down our emissions of greenhouse gases but the truth is we will never get the contribution of each individual down to zero .
Only the lack of the individual can bring it to zero , and that is an issue for population control which we need to talk about openly and urgently . "
Rapley will tell delegates that the Earth 's population is now rising at a rate of around 80 million a year .
" That is roughly the same as the number of unwanted pregnancies across the world , " he said .
" If we can prevent unwanted pregnancies , we can halt this spiral in our numbers . "
To do that , contraception will have to become universally available - and political and religious opposition to birth control removed .
If that happened , the world 's population could be stabilised to around 8 billion by 2050 , added Rapley .
But many climatologists believe that by then life on the planet will already have become dangerously unpleasant .
Temperature rises will have started to have devastating impacts on farmland , water supplies and sea levels .
Humans - increasing both in numbers and dependence on food from devastated landscapes - will then come under increased pressure .
The end result will be apocalyptic , said Lovelock .
By the end of the century , the world 's population will suffer calamitous declines until numbers are reduced to around 1 billion or less .
" By 2100 , pestilence , war and famine will have dealt with the majority of humans , " he said .
One of the few places to survive the worst impacts will be Britain .
" Our climate will be one of the least affected by global warming , " added Lovelock .
" As a result , everyone will want to live here .
We will become one of the world 's lifeboats .
The trouble , of course , will be that , even if we wanted to , we will not be able to pick up everyone .
There will be some hard decisions to make . "
Many experts predict that disaster will strike long before 2050 .
Last week , the government 's chief scientific adviser , Professor John Beddington , said the planet faced " a perfect storm " of food , energy and water shortages which could strike in less than 20 years .
In a speech to the Sustainable Development Commission conference in London , Beddington said that one in three people were already facing water shortages and that by 2030 world water demand would increase by more than 30 % ; energy demands would increase by 50 % .
" There are dramatic problems out there , particularly with water and food , but energy also , and they are all intimately connected . "
In the long run , however , humanity should benefit , said Lovelock .
" If you look at our species over the past million years , there have been a number of major climatic events , some devastating .
Between the Ice Ages , sea levels rose by 120 metres and tracts of land were flooded .
Yet that period covers the time that early humans emerged and evolved into Homo sapiens
" Often our numbers were brought to catastrophically low levels by climate change and numbers were reduced to only a couple of thousand on a couple of occasions .
Every time things got bad , our numbers plummeted and we improved as a species .
That is certainly going to happen again over the next 100 years . "

We should not celebrate this .
I think that the thing I truly hate about the Internet ( such a strong word , hate , but it is the only one that describes it ) , is what it has done to so many people in the context of their understanding of right and wrong .
Stealing is wrong .
Period .
End of story .
A thief is the worst sort of human animal there is .
How can thieves do what they do ?
Why do they not understand how destructive to their own souls it must be ?
" Leaked Lenovo OEM DVD " - so they congratulate themselves for being such great haX0rs ...
I hope the management at Lenovo finds the offender and beats him / her until their clothes change color .
They steal an image file and yet more criminals use it and even more criminals access it and they all think they got one over on the world .
They 've done nothing but degrade themselves .

# 2 - You really think stealing is soooo horrible , yet you think they should beat the person who did this .
What 's with the assault ?
Why not just fire them , and make them pay microsoft for all the loses

I 'd rather be robbed than raped or killed .
They 've done nothing but degrade themselves .
They 've also shown , once again , that DRM is a waste of time and effort .
It is always cracked .
It pisses honest users off while doing nothing to stop copyright infringement .
At least the online music stores are starting to figure it out .

# 4 , Yes , yes I do .
There 's little separation between life and livelyhood .
Thieves hurt businesses ' ability to retain and promote their people and it can result in layoffs and worse .
When a man can't provide for his family , it can be destroyed .
People no longer understand this basic math .
When a thief steals he hazards so many and it costs so much more than the property involved .
Whether it is immediate or not does not matter .
The real costs are there .
Assault ?
Ha .
A beating would be mild compared to what a thief deserves .
They take food out of the mouths of the kids of hard working men .
A lot has changed in my many years , but I recall well what used to happen to thieves .
There were laws and then there were rules we all understood and it was always better to starve to death than it was to steal .
Even food .
It was better to die physically than die inside .
I know perhaps none of you understand the perspective .
Do believe that I hope you never have to .

# 5 , I do not disagree ; however , my perspective is shaped by the understanding that as horrid as other crimes are , theft can and often does impact much larger numbers of people and the pain and hunger they can produce can be staggeringly far reaching .
Look at what thieves did to so many in the Madoff case ?
How many lives were destroyed and out of that destruction , we do not know how many died , or wish they were dead .

This not to get to the scale of action reasoning : the " Kill a man you are an assassin , kill thousands you are a hero " paradigm could well be applied to stealing too as , for example , the history of this Continent as well as other ones have proven over and over .

" A thief is the worst sort of human animal there is . "
Who would have thought that thief would ever outrank child sex offender as the worst type of human ?

# 7 : Look at what thieves did to so many in the Madoff case ?
At least those people are alive to carry on and rebuild their lives .
I suspect that the depth of your feeling has more to do with who the victim is in this case .

I really hope no one here is really surprised by this .

MrRoper , such animals as you describe are not human at all .

I still remember the days of yore , when traveling minstrels were free to sing the songs of other minstrels without paying for the right .
Then politicians and lawyers dreamed up laws that labeled these songs as " intellectual property , " and then quite suddenly , the minstrels who sang the songs of others were labeled " the worst sort of human animal there is . "
Some things never seem to change ;-)

Woooooaahhhh !
Easy there !!
It 's not stealing , no matter what Lloyd and the " mafiaa " goons want to call it and make you believe .
Nothing is being stolen .
It 's called copyright infringement :

Fortunately my company pays for several MSDN subscriptions so I do n't have to stoop to " copyright infringement " .
It really amazes me that the biggest bellyachers about Microsoft are the first ones in line to steal , errr ... sorry " infringe " on Microsoft 's copyrights .
# 18 By 234697 ( 208.125.233.10 ) at 7/30/2009 9:49:42 AM
Stealing is stealing PERIOD .
I do n't care if you call it copyright infringement or not .
I do n't care if you hate Microsoft or not - this is just simply : NOT RIGHT .
Thousands of developers worked on that software .
This does nothing but hurt the consumer - no wonder Microsoft has to keep the costs of the OS high . :(
I 'm really disappointed .
I would have been impressed if the " hackers " actually did something " useful " .
Instead , they had to revert to stupidity .
# 19 By 12071 ( 203.166.237.93 ) at 7/30/2009 9:54:33 AM
# 17 I have an MSDN license ( also thru work ) so I 'm not quite sure why you bothered to get on your high horse there !
But good on you for at least , even if it was with sarcasm , calling it what it actually is ...
Copyright Infringement !
No-one is stealing anything .
As for the people that do use this activation method - good on them :) after all it's no different than infringing on someones copyright when you download their music without paying for it or tv shows or movies - as many here have freely admitted to doing in the past .
I mean , you 'd hate to be a hypocrite ...
Right ? ;)
# 20 By 15406 ( 216.191.227.68 ) at 7/30/2009 10:57:29 AM
# 18 : Stealing is stealing PERIOD .
Agreed , but we 're talking about copyright infringement here .
I do n't care if you call it copyright infringement or not .
Why not call it rape with a foreign object then ?
That 's just about as accurate as calling copyright infringement " stealing " .
this is just simply : NOT RIGHT
Agreed .
Thousands of developers worked on that software .
Irrelevant .
This does nothing but hurt the consumer
While it can be argued that there are indirect harm being done to the consumer , I would argue that MS 's DRM does direct harm .
Which is worse ?
no wonder Microsoft has to keep the costs of the OS high .
Hahahahaha , thanks for the laugh .
Newsflash : MS has a monopoly on desktop OSes and can charge whatever they feel like , regardless of the environment around them .
Also , did you notice they have something like $ 40 + billion in the bank ?
They could easily afford to lower their prices despite piracy .
I would have been impressed if the " hackers " actually did something " useful " .
They did something useful and clever .
They removed obnoxious DRM from Windows as an ongoing exercise in proving that DRM does not work .
Instead , they had to revert to stupidity .
No , stupidity is adding DRM to something when you know it will be instantly cracked , and tha said DRM will hassle your legit , honest customers while doing nothing to impede the dishonest ones .
Brilliance .
# 19 : as many here have freely admitted to doing in the past .
I mean , you 'd hate to be a hypocrite ...
Right ? ;)
I believe it was mini-moore that admitted to that .
You know that nobody else will fess up even though they all have likely infringed copyright to some extent recently .
# 21 By 12071 ( 203.185.215.144 ) at 7/30/2009 7:37:00 PM
# 18 see # 20
# 20 " I believe it was mini- moore that admitted to that "
Parkkker has admitted as much in the past in regards to music as well and I would bet confidently that everyone here , with the possible exception of Lloyd , has infringed copyright by downloading movies / tv shows .
# 22 By 12071 ( 203.185.215.144 ) at 7/30/2009 8:00:57 PM
More on DRM from the very same type of people that " misinform " you by call it stealing :

Folks , I 'm writing this from prison .
I was in my local Best Buy , and stuffed a Village People CD down my pants .
When I was stopped by security I told them " I 'm not stealing , I 'm infringing on the copyright .
It 's all right though , me and the fellows are getting along fine .
They even gave me some special soap ( it 's a little slippery though ) and I 'm leading the prison talent show .
If only I had that Village People CD ....
# 24 By 12071 ( 203.166.237.93 ) at 7/31/2009 8:34:23 AM
Hey parkkker :)
Golly gosh ... they let you out of school early did they ?
If only your parents and teachers did a better job of raising and teaching you !
I do n't blame you of course ... you do n't know any better ... all of these grown up ideas ... all of these big words ...
I 'll help you along and do my best to try and keep as much as I can monosyllabic ( that last word means " having just one syllable " ) .
Just so you 're aware ... going into a store and taking the cd IS stealing - you see , if you do that then someone else will be unable to purchase that cd .
If you had downloaded it off the web however , as you do with all of your music , you 'd just be taking a digital copy whereby the original is completely untouched .
Thereby you'd be infringing on the artist 's copyright not stealing .
This is bad and you should n't do it because otherwise the RIAA goons wo n't get their cut ( and by their cut I mean roughly 95 % of the total amount given that they 're in the business of screwing the very artists that provide them with a means to make money ) .
This is like if you had a magical " copy " device which you could use to walk down the street , point it at a Ferrari and then hit the button to make an identical duplicate .
Lloyd , the mafiaa goons etc would all have you believe that this was stealing .
Heck , they 'd even make a huge song and dance about how you 're the worst kind of person on the planet for doing that - it 's really a good thing that they 're not prone to over - exaggerating and plain out lying !
But the truth is that you have n't stolen anything .
The car 's owner is completely unaffected .
What you have done is infringed on Ferrari 's copyright , their " intellectual property " ... but you have n't stolen a single thing !
Only ignorant people equate copyright infringement to stealing .

With his family away for their annual summer holiday , New Yorker Richard Sherman decides he has the opportunity to live a bachelor 's life - to eat and drink what he wants and basically to enjoy life without wife and son .
The beautiful but ditsy blond from the apartment above his catches his eye and they soon start spending time together .
It 's all innocent though there is little doubt that Sherman is attracted to her .
Any lust he may be feeling is played out in his own imagination however .

BOSTON ( AP )  Boston Red Sox left fielder Jason Bay has long played America 's pastime and can now call himself an American .
The 30 - year - old from Canada was among 360 people to became U.S. citizens Thursday in a ceremony led by U.S. District Court Judge Leo Sorokin at Boston 's historic Faneuil Hall .
Bay said " it 's a pretty proud day for me . "
He said his wife and daughters are Americans .
The British Columbia native is the first Red Sox player to be naturalized since Dominican Republic - born David Ortiz was sworn in last summer in Fenway Park .
Bay said he 's not denouncing being Canadian , " but I 'm definitely proud to be an American . "

Asali , a 26 - year - old Masai giraffe who lived at the Los Angeles Zoo for most of her life , has died from apparent birthing complications , zoo officials announced Friday .
The giraffe , who had successfully borne 12 calves since 1988 , died after zoo veterinarians worked for two days to remove a stillborn calf .
Although they were able to remove the calf , the mother died afterward , officials said .
“ The Los Angeles Zoo is saddened by the loss of Asali , ” the zoo ’s director , John Lewis , said in a prepared statement .
“ Over her many years here at the zoo , Asali was viewed by millions of visitors and over two generations of schoolchildren .
“ For many who will never travel to Africa , Asali served as an ambassador to her wild cousins and provided our guests with the opportunity to marvel at the beauty and massive height of this species , ” Lewis said .

Asali was one of the last Masai giraffes caught in the wild to enter the U.S. when she arrived as a not - yet fully grown 1 - year - old .
Her offspring and some of their offspring have helped add to the giraffe populations at zoos across North America , officials said .
Bob Barnes , the zoo ’s registrar , recalled picking her up when she arrived at Los Angeles International Airport in December 1983 .
“ We loaded her shipping crate onto a stake - bed truck and drove her up the Harbor Freeway to the zoo , ” Barnes said .
The crate did n’t have a top , he added , so “ a lot of the people on the Harbor Freeway were surprised to see a giraffe . ”
The zoo has five remaining giraffes , ranging in age from four months to 23 years .

Updated Details could undermine Microsoft 's proposal to let Windows users pick their browser , the company 's effort to keep Internet Explorer on the right side of European Union regulatory law .
Speaking with TechFlash , Opera Software CTO
Hakon Wium Lie has questioned the use of the famous IE icon in a ballot screen Microsoft said it 's willing to include in Windows .
Meanwhile , Lie has told told Computerworld he would like to see Windows users worldwide given the ability to pick the browser they want .
The ballot screen - detailed as part of a settlement package Friday by Microsoft - would let users pick from a list of browsers when they install Windows .
The screen would come with Windows 7 and could be downloaded via software update to Windows XP and Windows Vista .
When a user clicks the browser they want , it would take them to the download site .
Spot IE : Microsoft 's proposed Windows ballot screen for browsers
Lie has reportly said that the use of icons in the ballot screen could result in a natural bias towards IE .
The sticking point could be that the IE logo has become synonymous with Windows .
" The blue 'e ' has become so associated with the Internet in general , due to the bundling with Windows .
We think using the blue 'e ' might not be such a good idea , " told Tech Flash .
But Lie is apparently pleased with Microsoft 's proposal .
In the reading - between - the - lines world of EU - antitrust politics , that could be an early sign of settlement .
It was Opera that brought the original complaint against Microsoft to the EU , over integration of IE with Windows , and it has been outspoken on the latest version of IE and Windows : IE 8 and the up - coming Windows 7 .
The EU , meanwhile , which in its preliminary findings found integration of IE and Windows broke anti-trust law earlier this year , said it " welcomed " Microsoft 's proposal . ®
This article has been updated to include Lie 's comments in Computerworld on the ability to pick browsers worldwide .
During the 2008 recession , the percentage of temporary and contracting workers went up to a whopping 55 % .
In a normal market , the average is about 25 % .
Hopefully , this situation will not last as long and most businesses will be able to bounce back pretty quickly post Covid .
Are you worried about hiring the wrong person in an uncertain economy ?
Hiring someone with the wrong skill set or maybe not the right culture fit , could cost your business thousands , and you do n’t want to be making mistakes like that right now .
Have you and your team thought about hiring contractors or temporary staff ?
Maybe you have n't had much experience dealing with temporary , contracting or interims in the past or maybe you 've had an unpleasant experience ?
Whatever your views , as UK businesses start to put their hiring plans together post pandemic - many will be turning to contigent staff as an option .
6
Reasons why hiring temporary , contracting or interim staff will help your business recover from Covid .
1 . The jobs market is very different to what is was even 3 months ago .
Have there been redundancies in your market or maybe with your competitors ?
There maybe skilled candidates on the market that did n't expect to find themselves there a few months ago .
Have you seen the Easy Jet pilots who are now Tesco delivery drivers for the short term ?
This means there will be excellent candidates on the market , who have unfortunately been made redundant , that you previously had no access to because they were happy in their jobs .
Why not take advantage of the market situation and hire these skilled people on a contracting basis to try them out ?
When you hire a contractor you are in effect ‘ trying before you buy ’ .
This means if they do n’t have the right skills or you discover they are n’t the right culture fit , you can simply and quickly let them go with zero risk to you .
2 . You can hire someone quickly to hit the ground running - no lengthy interviews or on boarding and paperwork with HR .
Many contractors and interims bring in a wealth of experience and knowledge from moving from business to business - it could be just what your company needs right now , bring in some expertise !
3 . Maybe your business only needs someone for a short period of time , maybe to cover sickness , maternity or perhaps a project needs completing .
Hiring a contractor or temporary person covers that position for as long as you need them .
Helping to secure your clients as you complete deadlines .
4 . Your cash flow is protected - we take care of NI , statutory sick pay , reducing your short - term costs .
Hiring temporary or contracting staff means no HR responsibility , no fees to pay , no need to payroll , spreading the cost of hiring and reducing risk .
5 . You only pay for the hours they work , which again reduces your costs .
6 . Precision operates a 15 week ‘ temporary to permanent ’ programme where by the cost of hiring a candidate is spread out over 15 weeks - again reducing your costs .
If you ’re company requires more senior - management , but you are reluctant in this present climate to hire someone permanently , then an interim is exactly what you need to help navigate during a crisis or during times where there is lack of management , we can also help with this .
Orgainsing your business post - pandemic

De prairietuin : natuurlijke schoonheid en weinig onderhoud !
De prairietuin is een tuin met onderhoudsvriendelijke beplanting en een fantastische belevingswaarde .
Door haar natuurlijke charme en verschillende kleuren blijft het door alle jaargetijden heen een mooi plaatje .
De samenstellingen zijn vrolijk met een mix van bloemen en planten .
Er zijn verschillende combinaties van langbloeiende vaste planten en siergrassen om een kleurrijke tuin of border te creëren , die weinig onderhoud nodig heeft .
Een prairietuin met biodiversiteit
Een prairietuin is erg duurzaam en past goed binnen de vereisten van de natuur .
Vaak wordt de prairietuin ook wel de tuin met klimaatadaptieve beplantinggenoemd , die de flora en de fauna stimuleert .
In een prairietuin heb je weinig tot geen last van onkruid omdat de planten diep wortelend zijn .
De ondergrond wordt uit speciale lagen van lavagesteente opgebouwd .
Dat lavagesteente houdt kiemend onkruid grotendeels tegen .
Daarnaast zorgt het tevens voor een gezonde waterhuishouding voor de beplanting .
Lava absorbeert water waardoor de beplanting na een flinke hoosbui ook nog overeind staat .
In de droge zomermaanden bijvoorbeeld voorkomt de lava ondergrond juist weer uitdroging .
Duurzaam en onderhoudsvriendelijk dus .
Waar kan prairiebeplanting worden toegepast ?
Prairiebeplanting kan op een zonnige standplaats ( minimaal halve dag zon ) worden toegepast , maar in de halfschaduw zijn er ook mogelijkheden .
Een juiste analyse voorafgaand aan het aanleggen van de prairietuin , is echter een absolute pré .
Er wordt hierbij dan ter plekke gekeken naar de grondsoort , de grondvochtigheid en de ligging van het perceel .
De klimaatadaptieve beplanting kan zowel toegepast worden in een compacte tuin als op een groot landgoed van enkele hectaren .
In beide gevallen begint het altijd met een goede inventarisatie van de wensen om tot de juiste aanleg te komen .
Sfeerimpressies van de klimaatadaptieve beplanting
Onderstaande afbeeldingen geven je een impressie van de verschillende mogelijke combinaties .
Na jarenlang onderzoek zijn deze mixen speciaal samengesteld met als doel om een duurzame , mooie en onderhoudsvriendelijke beplanting te creëren en dat is ook geslaagd .
Naast de privé tuinen is deze vorm van beplanting ook zeer in trek bij openbare gelegenheden en plantsoenen van appartementencomplexen .
Dit is niet zo gek , want de onderhoudskosten worden in vergelijking met de traditionele groenvoorzieningen zoals bijvoorbeeld gras drastisch verlaagd .

“ You have the power to hold your leaders accountable . ” – President Obama ,
Ghana , July 14 , 2009
At an Amnesty International conference a few years ago , I had the honor of attending a talk by Clive Stafford Smith , a British attorney who represents some of the prisoners at Guantanamo Bay .
Smith shared some alarming details about the abuse that his clients received .
Perhaps most shocking was Smith 's description of cigarette burns and other scars that covered the body of a teenage prisoner .
This boy had been taken into custody when he was only 14 years old .
And this kid is allegedly not the only child who has been forced to experience the nightmare that is Gitmo .
In a forthcoming book , Hearts of Darkness : Torturing Children in the War on Terror , which was recently excerpted at truthout.org , author Henry A. Giroux describes some of these cases in horrifying detail .
He righteously condemns the culture of cruelty in which this kind of thing is even possible , and the " resounding silence " on the part of the media , which keeps it off the public radar .
But , even if the mainstream media did find the courage to cover these atrocities , would it make a difference ?
It seems as though many Americans have become so desensitized by the right - wing spin machine that they see all Muslims as the enemy , in an overly simplistic " us vs. them " kind of mindset .
Influenced by haters like Rush Limbaugh , Glenn Beck , Ann Coulter , and Sean Hannity , they think every Middle Eastern person looks suspicious .
Influenced by those right - wing extremists , they see every Muslim as a jihadist who wants to finish the job that the 9/11 hijackers started .
And , influenced by those right - wing extremists , they regard the perceived " enemy " as less than human .
Like the " gooks " of World War II and Vietnam , the " towelheads " and " hajis " of Iraq and Afghanistan are painted with one big broad brush .
Even the children .
How else could they justify the killing and maiming of so many innocent civilian men , women , and children , and the torture of any human being , let alone a child ?
This is what we have become , seduced by the misguided emotional appeasement of hate .
We attacked an unarmed nation that posed no threat to us or to its neighbors .
Then we tortured human beings .
We abused children .
And we killed the innocent .
All paid for with our tax dollars .
America has lost its conscience .
If we are ever to regain a moral standing in this world , Americans need to wake up and see these atrocities for what they truly are :
War crimes , and crimes against humanity
And , if we are ever to regain a moral standing in this world , those who committed these crimes -- and those who authorized them -- must be held accountable .
And they must be held up as an example of a foreign policy gone terribly wrong , a foreign policy gone evil .
Because what is more evil than these things that have been done in our name in the past eight years ?
There is no excuse .
No excuse at all .

Over the course of that day , 700 other Portland residents did the same .
Since 2004 , 18 states and New York City have approved laws that make manufacturers responsible for recycling electronics , and similar statutes were introduced in 13 other states this year .
The laws are intended to prevent a torrent of toxic and outdated electronic equipment  television sets , computers , monitors , printers , fax machines  from ending up in landfills where they can leach chemicals into groundwater and potentially pose a danger to public health .
The Environmental Protection Agency estimates 99.1 million televisions sit unused in closets and basements across the country .
Consumer response to recycling has been enormous in states where the laws have taken effect .
Collection points in Washington State , for example , have been swamped by people like Babs Smith , 55 , who recently drove to RE - PC , a designated electronics collection and repurposing center on the southern edge of Seattle .
Ms. Smith ’s Subaru Outback was stuffed with three aged computer towers that had languished in her basement after being gutted by her teenage sons , who removed choice bits to build their own souped - up computers .
“ It ’s what geeks do , ” she said .
Since January , Washington State residents and small businesses have been allowed to drop off their televisions , computers and computer monitors free of charge to one of 200 collection points around the state .
They have responded by dumping more than 15 million pounds of electronic waste , according to state collection data .
If disposal continues at this rate , it will amount to more than five pounds for every man , woman and child per year .

Use of the drop - off points was so overwhelming at first that the Washington Materials Management and Financing Authority , which oversees the program , urged consumers to consider holding off until spring .

Invasion of the Pattern Snatchers
When he regained consciousness , Surgeon - at - Arms Roald Vik of the 3rd Armored Biomedical Brigade , Affiliated Planets Unified Defense Force , was only moderately worried by his initial view of the room .
Unadorned pale - blue ceiling and walls .
Institutional , glossy - surfaced armchair .
On the wall opposite his bed , a curtain that he assumed covered an observation window .
So : a typical jail cell .
But then he noticed the faint stinging scent , like rubbing alcohol — and his bed ’s railing bore an impressive control panel .
Frowning , he sat up and looked over his shoulder .
Though he did n’t recognize the particular connectors on the wall behind him , in his brief career he ’d seen enough monitor and life - support fittings to recognize the overall configuration .
But what sort of hospital bed lacked restraining straps ?
Vik ’s apprehension increased further when he discovered an excruciatingly tender , fist - sized swelling above his right ear .
Had he crash - landed ?
“ Ah , you ’re awake , ” said a woman ’s voice from somewhere near the curtained window .
Vik could n’t see a loudspeaker .
But though he still had no idea why he was in a hospital , now the knowledge of his location and mission flooded back to him — for the woman had spoken in Flemish .
A bit over two centuries ago , an Affiliated Planets automated probe had discovered the world of Nieuw Vlaanderen orbiting a star about fifteen light - years from Vik ’s homeworld , Eiriksson .
Like all human colonies , Nieuw Vlaanderen was still recovering from the Collapse ; like most in this region , its recovery had lagged Eiriksson ’s by several generations .
By the time of its discovery the planet ’s leading civilization had regained a technology level averaging late - 18th century Europe — well behind that period in physics and engineering , though significantly ahead in chemistry and biology .
As usual in such cases , after the probe ’s initial reports had been received and reviewed , a message was sent instructing the probe to release a stealth depopulating agent into the planet ’s biosphere .
The A.P. in its patient conquests sought resources and territory , not opponents ; no truly civilized society , surely , would prefer the untidiness and sufferings of war .
But in the century following the agent ’s release , the probe failed to detect any drop in the local birth - rate .
This unprecedented development , so potentially threatening to the A.P. ’s longstanding strategy for expansion and regional domination , demanded urgent on - site investigation .
And so sub-lieutenant Roald Vik , recently commissioned UDF Surgeon - at - Arms , was crammed into a cold - sleep pod and fired off on a seventy - year voyage to Nieuw Vlaanderen .
He could remember waking in orbit , seven decades of hypno- lessons in the probe ’s observations — plus copious Earth history of possible relevance , including four dialects of Flemish — still echoing in his head .
He remembered reviewing update summaries from the old but still - functioning probe , which in the two hundred years since its original report had identified a number of anomalies that did n’t match any previously recorded patterns of post - industrial cultural or technological development .
He ’d chosen his first site to investigate .
There ’d been no crash - landing — he recalled his on - target arrival during an overcast night when neither moon was up .
After ensuring that his ship was well camouflaged , he ’d walked out of the forest to the nearby village .
He could even remember the sickly looking fern - like plant sitting on the bar beside him as he sipped a beer and struck up a conversation with the bartender .
But then — ?
Vik touched the swelling above his ear .
Had he fallen ?
Been attacked ?
“ Would you mind , ” asked the woman ’s voice , “ if I opened this curtain ? ”
“ Alstublieft , ” he replied .
Please .
He tried to mimic her accent .
Motorized , the curtain slid open to reveal a large pane of glass .
In the dimly lit room beyond stood a pale , dark - haired , middle - aged woman in a pastel blouse and white coat .
She leaned toward the glass .
“ How are you feeling , Mr. Boeykens ? ”
So she ’d seen the identification papers he ’d been carrying .
He wondered what she made of their vagueness .
“ My head , how — ? ”
“ You do n’t recall ?
Ah , well that ’s not surprising — I ’m afraid you struck it against a table when you fell .
According to our investigator , you tripped over the leg of a chair as you followed him out of the tavern . ”
Vik frowned .
“ Investigator ? ”
Her eyebrows lifted .
“ From the provincial Department of Health .
Exactly what do you remember ? ”
“ I was drinking witbier … a man sat beside me … ”
He struggled unsuccessfully for a clearer image , then shook his head in frustration .
“ Please , do n’t worry .
A bit of amnesia is quite common with head injuries . ”
Yes , of course , he thought — but how frustrating !
What if he had discovered the newcomer ’s association with the health department , and managed to steer the discussion to an aborted infertility epidemic of nearly two centuries ago ?
Maybe this “ investigator ” had already given him the answers that the A.P. required !
“ In any case , ” the woman continued , “ what we really need to learn are some facts about you .
Your papers are quite incomplete — we do n’t know where you ’re from , how long you ’ve been visiting our province , who may have come into contact with you… ? ”
Vik refocused his attention .
He ’d taken her for a local physician , but now he wondered .
Slowly , he said , “ I ’m sorry , but I do n’t understand … why all of these questions ?
And why are you standing in another room ?
I do n’t even know your name . ”
She pursed her lips .
“ My apologies .
I am Dr. Steibs , head of Infectious Diseases for the Department of Health .
And you , Mr. Boeykens , are quite the mystery . ”
“ I ’m sorry , but — ”
“ You are in an isolation room .
If that bartender had n’t been so observant , I shudder to think how many more people you might have exposed .
It ’s urgent that we trace your movements since your arrival . ”
“ Exposed ? ” Alarmed , Vik pulled up the sleeves of his loose pajamas in search of rashes .
He felt at his face , tried to listen to his own breathing for wheezes .
“ Please , Mr. Boeykens , calm yourself !
We ’ve already started you on the appropriate antibiotic .
You ’ll be over the infection in a few days . ”
Some local bug , then — he must have picked it up in the forest .
“ What sort of infection ? ”
“ Besnoitia speecki . ”
She spoke the name with careful enunciation and then leaned away , as if she had just delivered news of great portent and now awaited his reaction .
Besnoitia .
The genus did n’t sound completely unfamiliar .
He rummaged through his memories of General Microbiology … Some sort of protozoan parasite ?
Not one that caused any human diseases , though , he was reasonably sure .
And certainly not an organism that the UDF had ever weaponized .
“ I ’m sorry , ” he said .
“ But I ’m not familiar with that — ” he caught himself before using any terms that might reveal his medical training — “ that germ . ”
His statement apparently surprised her .
“ Surely you must have taken some classes in biology and history ?
Where did you grow up , Mr. Boeykens ? ”
He was afraid to reply — having planned for a casual evening in a pub rather than an inquisition , Vik had prepared only the sketchiest of cover stories .
Now he wished that basic spy-craft had been part of the standard medical curriculum .
But , he realized , Dr. Steibs had already provided him with a perfect evasion .
“ Why , I grew up in — ” Drawing on his training in interrogating patients , Vik did his best to mime Sudden Unexpected Uncertainty .
“ In — ” He moved on to Mounting Confusion , followed by Increasing Concern .
“ I can ’t — ” And now : Apprehension … and then , Alarm !
“ I ca n’t remember ! ”
Dr. Steibs frowned .
“ Please , Mr. Boeykens , this is very important .
Try to focus on just the past few days .
Can you recall entering our province ?
Our town ? ”
He shook his head in what he hoped looked like Fearful Misery .
“ No .
I do n’t remember a thing .
I was sitting at the bar , but before that …it ’s all a blank ! ”
“ I see . ”
She crossed her arms before her chest and clucked her tongue a few times , looking thoughtful .
Vik , whose grades in Neurology had not been among his highest , began to wonder whether he ’d picked such a clever stratagem , after all .
Outside of adventure stories , how common was global amnesia ?
But finally Dr. Steibs said , “ All right , please try to remain calm .
I expect that your memory will return over the next day or two .
Do n’t push too hard ; just let it come on its own .
“ In the meantime , ” she continued , “ I ’ve got a different sort of question for you .
One moment … ”
Relieved that she ’d accepted his performance , Vik watched as Dr. Steibs pulled a stylus of some sort from her pocket , and turned to the side .
She leaned over as if writing or drawing on a table .
He could see her make a large circular movement , and then several smaller strokes .
Then she pushed something aside and drew a series of straight lines and curves .
Dr. Steibs straightened up and briefly examined her work .
Then she lifted a white page and pressed it against the window ; it remained affixed when she removed her hand .
She smoothed a second sheet onto the glass beside the first .
She looked over the pages at Vik .
“ Tell me what you see . ”
The first sheet bore a large circle containing three irregular shapes .
At a glance he recognized the three distinctive continents of Nieuw Vlaanderen .
“ A map of the world , ” he said , wondering what she was after .
She nodded .
“ Very good .
And what else ? ”
He turned his attention toward the second page stuck to the glass .
But then he remembered his still - unexplained infection .
“ This Besnoitia — ” he forced himself to stumble over the syllables — “ you have n’t told me its symptoms .
Is there anything I should be watching out for ? ”
She shook her head .
But Vik thought that she looked pleased about something .
“ Just take your medication with each meal , and everything will be fine . ”
“ But the symptoms — ”
“ I wo n’t be able to explain those to you for a couple of days . ”
Before he could respond , she added , “ I look forward to speaking with you tomorrow , Mr. Boeykens . ”
She touched the wall beside the window , and the curtain glided shut .
* * *
Meals arrived through a slot below the window .
On that evening ’s dinner tray , and again at breakfast , was a small paper cup holding a pair of pink pills , each embossed with a tiny “ KM . ”
Vik swallowed the dinner pills .
But at breakfast he set the cup aside when he returned his tray to the slot .
As soon as Dr. Steibs opened the curtain , maybe an hour later , he held up one of the pills .
“ What are you giving me ? ”
She pursed her lips .
“ You really do need to take your medication on time , Mr. Boeykens . ”
“ Just tell me what it is . ”
She sighed .
“ That is koningmycin .
A very old , very reliable antibiotic .
Though if you do n’t know about Besnoitia , then I do n’t suppose koningmycin is familiar , either . ”
He studied the pink pill , no wiser than before .
“ Please , ” she said .
He looked up to see her pointing at the paper cup .
He shrugged , and then fetched a glass of water from the lavatory .
He swallowed the pills .
Dr. Steibs gave him the smallest of smiles .
“ So — how is your memory this morning ?
Anything coming back yet ? ”
She did n’t seem particularly perturbed when he shook his head .
“ Well , ” she said , “ then we ’ll just have to accept another day of mystery . ”
Vik wondered at her newfound lack of urgency .
“ Otherwise , I trust you ’re feeling well ?
No headaches , dizziness ?
Blurry vision ?
Good .
Could you take another look at my artwork here , and tell me what you see ? ”
Baffled , he approached the window to view the two pages still stuck there .
“ This is Nieuw Vlaanderen , ” he reported .
The second sheet held some uninteresting cross-hatching .
He looked back at the map , then to her .
“ I told you that yesterday .
What is the point of this ?
Some sort of psychological test ?
Or are you just curious about my knowledge of geography ? ”
“ I think , ” she said , “ that I ’ll be able to answer your questions tomorrow .
In the meantime , try to dredge up any memories you might happen to have regarding lancet flukes .
Or Toxoplasma . ”
The curtain closed before he could respond .
* * *
When the curtain reopened the next morning , Vik again had something to show Dr. Steibs .
Holding up an empty juice glass from his breakfast tray , he demanded , “ Are all of your isolation rooms infested ? ”
Dr. Steibs peered at the tumbler as he brought it to the window .
He thought he saw her lips quirk into a fleeting smile .
“ Where did you find that ? ” she asked .
“ On my leg ! ”
He pointed at the tiny insect lying motionless at the glass ’s bottom .
“ Look how swollen its abdomen is — it was sucking my blood !
Probably infected me with some horrible new germs . ”
“ No , ” she said .
“ I do n’t think it has . ”
She bent down to squint into the glass .
“ Dermanyssus speecki . ”
Her voice had softened , as if she were fascinated at the sight .
He glanced at the bug .
Maybe half a centimeter across , its many legs and antennae crisscrossed each other to form a peculiar , asymmetric pattern .
He ’d been trying to puzzle out that pattern for the past hour , but could n’t seem to keep himself focused on the task .
“ Say , ” he asked , “ your koningmycin does n’t have any cognitive side - effects , does it ?
I ’ve been having trouble with my concentration . ”
Dr. Steibs looked up to meet his gaze , but before she could answer he recalled her apparent familiarity with the blood - sucker in his juice glass .
“ So , this is a common bug around here ? ”
“ It used to be . ”
This time she did n’t try to hide her smile .
“ Nobody ’s seen one in two hundred years . ”
He gaped at her in confusion .
Then she held up a finger , and swung it downward to point at her two drawings .
Where yesterday he ’d seen only a dull jumble of lines and curves , today he saw a peculiar , asymmetric pattern .
Very slowly , he rotated his juice glass until the bug matched Dr. Steibs ’s sketch .
Vik stepped back from the window until he bumped against the armchair .
He let himself fall into it , still holding the tumbler and its cryptic occupant .
“ This , ” he said , “ would be a good time for explanations . ”
Apparently she had a chair on her side of the window , too ; when she sat , Vik could see only her head and shoulders .
“ Are you familiar , ” she began , “ with the lancet fluke ? ”
At his blank expression , she continued .
“ A parasite of cattle , back on Earth — it ’s described in one of the library data crystals we discovered ten years ago .
The fluke larvae take over the nervous system of their carrier , a particular species of ant .
Every evening they force the ant to leave its colony and climb to the top of a blade of grass ; it hangs on until dawn , then returns home and leads a normal day .
This cycle continues until eventually a cow happens along and eats the blade of grass , thus delivering the fluke to its definitive host . ”
Vik had had instructors like this — you asked them a straightforward question and they responded with what seemed like a complete non sequitur .
When you fell into their trap by pointing out their failure to answer your question , they pounced with their prepared rant on the inadequacy of students these days .
Only then did they finally provide the missing information that connected their initial response to your original question .
Vik had learned to deal with such teachers by looking attentive , and waiting .
He did that now .
After a few seconds , Dr. Steibs continued .
“ How about Toxoplasma ?
Normally , of course , mice and rats become extremely anxious and fearful when they smell a cat .
But infect them with Toxoplasma and not only do they lose their fear , they actually find themselves attracted to cat odors .
Rather inconvenient for the rodents , as you might imagine — but Toxoplasma can only reproduce within the gut of its definitive host , a cat . ”
Vik looked nervously at his juice glass .
“ So this insect — ”
“ It ’s a mite , actually . ”
“ — this mite , it ’s the carrier for the Besnoitia parasite that infected me ?
And the Besnoitia makes the mite want to suck human blood ? ”
Dr. Steibs looked quite disappointed in him .
“ No , Mr. Boeykens .
The mite is the parasite ’s definitive host .
You are the carrier . ”
The tumbler slipped from his fingers .
Vik watched anxiously as it rolled across his lap and fell to the floor .
He leapt to his feet .
The unbroken glass was rolling toward the dark space beneath the bed ; just in time he bent over and grabbed it .
Letting out a breath , Vik lifted the glass for another look at its occupant .
The tumbler was empty .
Vik jumped backwards , banging an elbow on the wall .
Then , frantic , he scanned the floor all around the chair .
After several long seconds he finally saw the mite , near where the glass had initially landed .
On its numerous legs it was advancing , very slowly , toward Vik ’s bare foot .
He slammed the inverted juice glass to the floor , trapping the bug inside .
Then , with great care , he slid the glass and its prisoner toward the middle of the room .
Keeping his eye on the glass , he stepped backwards until he could once more lower himself into the armchair .
As Vik began to catch his breath , Dr. Steibs raised an eyebrow .
“ Shall I continue ? ”
“ Alstublieft , ” mumbled Vik .
“ These mites , we assume , are ubiquitous wherever humans live .
Although of course we can’t prove it from only Nieuw Vlaanderen observations , the degree of specialization evolved by both Besnoitia and the mite strongly suggest that they have been living with our species for thousands of years .
Perhaps since before the earliest civilizations . ”
“ But — ”
She held up her hand to head off any interruption .
“ The mite acquires Besnoitia from an infected human ’s bloodstream .
The parasite reproduces in the mite ’s salivary glands ; its larvae then escape into another human when the mite next feeds .
From there the larvae travel to their carrier ’s brain , where as they mature they exert an exceedingly subtle cognitive effect . ”
Vik had regained enough composure to want to reassert his own cognitive abilities .
“ The human , ” he hazarded , “ loses the ability to see that pattern . ”
He pointed toward Dr. Steibs ’s drawing .
“ Nearly correct . ”
She tilted her head , apparently not completely unimpressed with him .
“ Infected humans can still see the mite ; electrophysiological studies have confirmed this .
But the sight becomes remarkably uninteresting .
One glance dispels all awareness of the mite — including not only its image but also the tickle of its feet , the pinch of its bite .
Anyone who discovers one of the mites immediately forgets that discovery .
“ Koningmycin , ” she continued , “ was chanced upon quite accidentally .
But once people could see the mite , it did n’t take long to also uncover the parasite and work out the details .
We thought we had long ago eradicated both organisms worldwide — until you came along , Mr. Boeykens . ”
Not wanting her to pursue that line of thought , but also genuinely curious , Vik asked , “ Getting rid of the Besnoitia , what health effects has that had ?
Besides allowing people to notice the mite . ”
Again her head tilted .
“ A very perceptive question .
Indeed , there have been three beneficial effects .
Five percent of schizophrenia cases had lacked a known cause — now it ’s known , and eliminated .
The same for half of all previously unexplained epilepsy . ”
“ Impressive . ”
“ But it ’s the final effect that has had the greatest impact .
What would you say is the defining aspect of life ? ”
The question took Vik off guard .
But this was merely another familiar variant of instruction by non sequitur — how he answered the apparently irrelevant question would n’t actually matter .
So he offered the first response that occurred to him .
“ Reproduction ? ”
She dismissed his reply with a wave of her hand .
“ No , Mr. Boeykens .
Pattern matching . ”
Vik was intrigued ; none of his instructors had ever suggested such a connection .
“ Consider : a rabbit detects a certain canine aroma , or hears a distinctive padded footfall ; immediately it recognizes a pattern of danger , and flees .
Just as the same rabbit will dig up the root of a plant whose leaves it has learned to associate with food .
And that plant , too , is a pattern - matcher , responding to lengthening periods of daylight by developing flowers . ”
“ So , ” Vik asked , “ then computers are also ‘ alive ’ ? ”
She snorted .
“ Computers are merely tools of human pattern matching .
But it ’s pattern matching that ’s behind every intelligent , conscious human behavior , from language to music to science to interpersonal relationships . ”
She paused and looked at him expectantly .
“ What ’s this have to do with Besnoitia ? ”
As Dr. Steibs shook her head in apparent pity at his intellectual shortcomings , Vik cursed himself for falling into her pedagogic trap .
She really was very good .
“ The patterns recognized by humans , ” she said , “ are often exceedingly abstract .
But anyone infected with Besnoitia loses the ability to work with an entire class of abstract patterns — those that share any significant features with the image of that mite .
It ’s as if they lived in a world of geometry problems but could never grasp the concept of angles . ”
At Vik ’s obvious confusion , she said , “ I ’ll give you an example .
About thirty years after the discovery of koningmycin , a clerk in a provincial Vital Records department felt there was something odd in recent birth numbers . ”
Vik tried to hide his surprise .
Could Dr. Steibs be describing the A.P. probe ’s attack ?
The timing would be about right .
“ The clerk could n’t point to any specific discrepancy , but when she visited the neighboring provinces and reviewed their records , again she felt there ’d been a change from past trends .
We had no computers then , of course , and statistics was still in its infancy .
So it took her several weeks of poring over her records to pin down the strange pattern she had sensed .
“ The clerk found a very slight increase in the ratio of female to male babies .
But not all mothers were affected equally ; those who had been the first - born of their siblings were spared . ”
Vik swallowed .
This was exactly the first - generation effect designed into the A.P. ’s engineered bacterium , to help mask the initial assault .
Of the few other attacked worlds that had identified this pattern , none had ever managed the feat before the bacteria ’s secondary effects were already well established .
Dr. Steibs continued .
“ The clerk published her findings .
Nearly simultaneously , so did four other clerks from four other countries .
Still , it took a couple of years to isolate the bacteria responsible , an oddly mutated form of Wolbachia .
Heard of it ? ”
Vik worked to keep his expression blank as he shook his head .
He did n’t know how much of this incredible tale he should believe ; not a single previous planet had even confirmed that a bacterium was the cause of their fertility problem — let alone isolated it .
“ No ?
Well , Wolbachia normally infects invertebrates , so this was a bit of a surprise .
Even more surprising , this particular strain — which proved remarkably challenging to grow in culture — was resistant to all the usual classes of antibiotics .
In the end it was a bit of a race , coming up with a new antibiotic before the bacteria could spread widely enough for its other effect to matter . ”
“ Other effect ? ”
“ Ah — should both parents carry the infection , all of their offspring would be female .
I see you recognize the inevitable consequences . ”
Vik ’s expression of horror , though , reflected not sympathy for the aborted genocide Dr. Steibs described , but rather fear of what these people could one day do to his own .
Freed of humanity ’s millennia - old parasitization by Besnoitia , apparently Dr. Steibs ’s forebears had — in just a couple of years — not only detected , but correctly analyzed and then neutralized a weapon whose mere existence had eluded most of its previous targets , a weapon whose effects had never before proven less than catastrophically fatal .
Once Nieuw Vlaanderen regained space travel , how long until its people threatened the Affiliated Planets ?
With such superior pattern matching abilities , how likely were they to lose any kind of interplanetary battle ?
His superiors had been correct to send an investigator here !
But , Vik realized , he now held the power to even those future odds .
Once he transmitted a description of Besnoitia and its mite back to Eiriksson — even better , what if he managed to carry home a sample of koningmycin for analysis ?
— then his own people could free themselves of the parasite , too .
Who knew what insights and breakthroughs might follow ?
And what accolades for the humble soldier who ’d brought his people such knowledge ?
He was picturing himself at the christening ceremony for a battlecruiser bearing his name , when he realized that Dr. Steibs had risen from her chair .
“ Now that you can see the mites , you can assist in your treatment .
After feeding , the mite disengages for 48 hours , until its next blood - meal .
You ’ll find them lying in your bed - sheets , or hiding in corners .
Kill them as you discover them . ”
“ And then I can leave this room ? ”
She smiled .
“ 72 hours after the last sighting , yes .
Though you ’ll still need to complete a full two weeks of the koningmycin to guarantee the eradication of your Besnoitia . ”
Even as the curtain slid closed , Vik approached the inverted juice glass on the floor .
He bent over and lifted the glass , leaving its inhabitant behind .
Then he returned the glass to the floor right - side - up — with , as his Therapeutic Pathology instructor had been fond of saying , extreme prejudice .
* * *
Vik ’s clothing , fumigated and laundered , had preceded his breakfast through the delivery slot this morning .
While the maroon turtleneck sweater , black denim trousers , and lightweight boots were barely familiar to him — he ’d chosen the ensemble from his ship ’s extensive wardrobe , and worn it for less than a day — he found their weight and varied fabrics reassuring after a week of flimsy hospital pajamas .
When Dr. Steibs opened the curtain he told her , “ I ’m going to miss our little chats . ”
She granted him a slight smile .
“ I ’m sure that you ’ll find your doctor in the rehabilitation clinic at least as entertaining .
Or have you recovered your memory since yesterday ? ”
Vik hurried to don an expression of Deep Concern .
“ No , nothing at all . ”
“ The Hollebeke clinic has a very good reputation ; they ’ve managed tougher cases than yours .
Still … ”
“ What ? ”
“ The train to Hollebeke does n’t come through until late this afternoon .
You might want to spend the next few hours wandering around town .
See if you can stir up any recollections before you leave . ”
Vik nodded .
“ We ’re done , then ? ” He stood .
“ Apart from some paperwork , yes . ”
She wagged a finger at him .
“ And you must finish all of your antibiotics . ”
He patted the trouser pocket that held his bottle of pills .
“ Do n’t worry .
I ’m not going to lose these . ”
Vik turned toward the room ’s locked door .
“ One last thing , ” said Dr. Steibs .
He turned back .
She pointed to her drawings .
He had to laugh .
“ Believe me , Dr. Steibs — after three days of hunting and squashing mites , I ’m never going to forget that pattern ! ”
She smiled politely .
“ Humor me . ”
With a sigh , Vik glanced at the drawings , then back to her .
“ Still the same pattern .
Really . ”
She reached toward the wall beside her window , pressed some control there .
Vik heard a click from the door ’s lock .
As he turned again toward that door , Dr. Steibs said , “ Good luck , Mr. Boeykens . ”
One day , Vik thought , Dr. Steibs ’s descendants were going to wish that his luck had been a good deal worse .
* * *
“ All right .
No , do n’t follow him any further .
Yes , okay .
Good . ”
Steibs hung up the phone .
She clucked her tongue as she stared out her office window .
After strolling apparently aimlessly through the village for over an hour , Boeykens had abruptly headed straight for the pub where he ’d originally been picked up .
But he spent only a few seconds loitering outside that pub before turning and marching into the nearby woods .
The woods where last week they ’d found his spaceship .
Until the ship had been discovered , Steibs had n’t been as convinced as her colleagues of her patient ’s otherworldly origin .
But after that discovery — not to mention the analysis of his genetics — she ’d relinquished any doubts .
Steibs sighed .
No one could be sure that “ Boeykens ” came from the same world that had sent the infertility plague .
While his DNA did bear many of the same engineering residues as that of the modified Wolbachia , this was at best circumstantial evidence — some other world might have happened to employ the same splicing enzymes .
She ’d hoped to get a rise out of him when she ’d related the story of the discovery and analysis of the Wolbachia plague ; if he ’d been surprised by her tale , though , he had covered his reaction immediately .
He really was very good .
Steibs turned back to her computer , where her unfinished report waited .
They ’d been fortunate that the bartender had recognized the mite crawling along his counter , and that he ’d so promptly called the health department .
She ’d already written a commendation for her assistant ’s quick thinking in knocking out Boeykens and hauling him to the hospital .
Even so , two dozen people had needed prophylactic koningmycin , and the bar had to be closed for intensive fumigation .
Wherever he came from , Boeykens would presumably soon be flying home to share the discovery of koningmycin with his people .
In that , at least , she could take some professional pride — she was a public health officer , after all .
Steibs lifted her two drawings from the desk .
She winced at the clumsiness of their execution ; still , she felt that she ’d captured the mite pattern rather nicely .
She had not enjoyed the heated arguments over teaching Boeykens about Besnoitia and the mite .
The military had been against treating him at all , not to mention educating him and handing over samples of koningmycin .
In the end , though , it was her colleagues ’ plan — conceived , engineered , and put into a freezer half a century ago , against the possibility of someday receiving just such a visitor as Boeykens — that had carried the day .
Yes , Boeykens ’s people would rid themselves of Besnoitia .
And yes , they would therefore gain pattern matching skills to rival those of Nieuw Vlaanderen .
But those skills would never be used to attack her world .
Twice a year , for the rest of his life , Boeykens was going to develop a mild respiratory infection .
His sneezes were going to expose his colleagues to a very special pair of viruses , both of which should spread quite widely in just a few seasons — unimpaired by koningmycin or any other antibiotic .
Then , once a given populace developed a high enough prevalence of the viruses , a very specific side effect would kick in .
As a test , Boeykens ’s isolation room had been sprayed not only with the two viruses but also with an aerosol mimicking the virus - induced pheromones of an infected population .
The side effect had worked perfectly , leaving Steibs confident that her descendants would never meet anyone from Boeykens ’s world — unless it were her descendants who took the initiative .
She looked again at her drawings .
The image of a mite that humanity had n’t noticed for millennia .
And the image of her own planet .
An image that Boeykens had n’t noticed for days .
I ’m in the process of working on , and improving , test suite support in TestSwarm ( an upcoming project of mine ) .
However , there is n’t a lot of information on which unit testing frameworks developers actually use to test their code ( whereas there is more information on which JavaScript libraries are used ) .
It will be of great help to me if you could quickly fill out the question below .
I will release the results of the survey as soon as possible .
Thanks !
The poll is now closed .
I ’ve received 1853 responses and plan on writing a detailed blog post on the results .
Thanks everyone !

JERUSALEM  Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel urged the Swedish government on Sunday to condemn an article in a Swedish newspaper last week accusing the Israeli Army of harvesting organs from Palestinians wounded or killed by soldiers .
As the furor in Israel over the article gathered into a diplomatic storm revolving around questions of anti-Semitism and freedom of speech , Mr. Netanyahu told ministers at a cabinet meeting on Sunday that the article , published in the Swedish daily newspaper Aftonbladet , was “ outrageous ” and compared it to a “ blood libel , ” referring to medieval anti-Semitic accusations that Jews ritually killed gentile children and collected their blood .
“ We are not asking the government of Sweden for an apology , ” Mr. Netanyahu said , according to an official who attended the cabinet meeting and who spoke on the condition of anonymity .
“ We are asking for their condemnation .
We are not asking from them anything we do not ask of ourselves . ”
Mr. Netanyahu made his comments behind closed doors , but other Israeli ministers have publicly attacked the Swedish government ’s refusal to take an official stand against the article .
Avigdor Lieberman , Israel ’s outspoken foreign minister , has led the protest , saying that the Swedish government ’s silence was “ reminiscent of Sweden ’s position during World War II , when it also did not become involved . ”

The object responsible for the mysterious brightening seen in 2006 ( right ) is ordinarily too dim to detect ( left ) ( Image : Barbary et al . )
A wandering black hole may have torn apart a star to create a strange object that brightened mysteriously and then faded from view in 2006 , a new study suggests .
But more than three years later , astronomers are still at a loss to explain all the features of the strange event .
The object , called SCP 06F6 , was first spotted in the constellation Bootes in February 2006 in a search for supernovae by the Hubble Space Telescope .
The object flared to its maximum brightness over about 100 days , a period much longer than most supernovae , which do so in just 20 days .
Further analysis of the object ’s spectrum in 2008 offered no more clues : SCP 06F6 seemed to resemble no known object , and astronomers could n’t even say whether the event originated in the Milky Way or beyond .

Examining the work over coffee , Boris Gaensicke of the University of Warwick in Coventry , UK , and colleagues noticed that dips in the object ’s light spectrum looked familiar .
They resembled those created when light passes through a relatively cool area that is rich in carbon .
“ These wiggles are basically the fingerprints of carbon molecules , ” Gaensicke says .
Too close
The expansion of space stretched these wavelengths of absorbed light to the redder part of the spectrum .
The amount of the stretching suggests the object sits some 2 billion light years away .
Gaensicke and colleagues envision two scenarios that might explain the object .
In one , a carbon - rich star gets too close to a middle - or heavy - weight black hole , which tears the star apart .
Some of this material is absorbed by the black hole , and some is blasted away in a flare that was eventually seen from Earth as SCP 06F6 .
Such flares brighten and dim with the same leisurely pace seen in SCP 06F6 , and they also produce X - rays with a similar brightness to those the team found at the location of the firefly - like event .
Shock waves
But so far , no one has found a galaxy or even a cluster of stars in the same place as the object , which argues against the possibility .
Although black holes might get gravitationally kicked out of their birthplaces in star clusters and galaxies during mergers with other black holes , they are more likely to be found in crowded areas .
“ It would be very contrived to have a free - floating intermediate - mass black hole that would be disrupting a free - floating star in the intergalactic medium , ” Gaensicke told New Scientist .
A more probable scenario is that the event is due to the explosive death of a massive star that was swaddled in carbon dust , Gaensicke says .
The shock waves from the event would squeeze and heat the gas , producing an event that could be as prolonged as SCP 06F6 .
But massive stars are also not likely to be found on their own .
They live short lives , so should not have enough time to travel beyond their home galaxies .
And the X - rays produced by SCP 06F6 were about 50 times brighter than those produced in the most luminous supernovae studied so far .
‘ Best match ’
The carbon spectral lines “ are certainly the best match to the SCP 06F6 spectrum found so far ” , but the wiggles are not a perfect fit , says Kyle Barbary of the University of California , Berkeley , lead author of the 2008 study on the object .
“ No possibility suggested so far is conclusive . ”
Finding another example of the ‘ firefly ’ event would be the next big step in figuring out what the object is , Barbary says .
“ SCP 06F6 was found in a relatively small survey , so it is likely that there are a lot more of them out there , ” Barbary told New Scientist .
“ I ’m quite hopeful that we will be able to find out the true nature of the event in the near future . ”
Gaensicke hopes one of Hubble ’s new cameras , the Wide Field Camera 3 , which was installed on the last space shuttle mission to visit the telescope , could reveal more about the object ’s origins .
The camera may be able to spot a host galaxy around the object that was too faint to see with other instruments .

WASHINGTON -- Liberals who see the effort to overhaul health care as a once - in - a - generation opportunity are growing anxious that a final deal -- and a Democratic president they backed -- will negotiate away their top priority : a public plan to compete with private insurers .
Some Democrats are threatening to oppose any bill that excludes this option , and sympathetic outside groups are pressuring wavering lawmakers .

Updates to Counter - Strike 1.6 have been released .
The updates will be applied automatically when your Steam client is restarted .
The specific changes include :
The string will of course not totally replace a real tripod .
But it can give you just that extra stop .
This is the luxury model .
- Thanks John for modifying the 1/4 bolt .
The basic model is a simple piece of string with just a loop at each end .
Put one loop around your camera and put your foot in the other .
If you pull it tight , you win up to three stops .
Cheaper than IS and so low - tech that it exists almost as long as photography itself .
Now I think of it : did anyone ever try to shoot a gun with this as a stabilizer ?
The one on the right is the one I always have in my bag .
Even with a 300 mm it can give me 2 stops extra .
That may just save my day .
Dutch star photojournalist
Theo van Houts once used a contraption like this to capture a candid shot of the Nobel Prize ceremony in Stockholm .
( He did not invent it , as the article in Dutch suggests . )
Feb 2008
This is the latest version of my string tripod :
American viewers may recognise the black screw : it is a retaining screw for US license plates .
Really good ones are nylon .
Cheap ones are just cheap plastic .
Sometimes you get them for free .
I drilled a tiny hole in the head , which I sanded the sides off first to get a better grip .
Now I can turn it with two fingers .
It is hardly possible to screw it in too tight because of the really small size of the grip .
The cord is kevlar and the aluminum bean is from my tent .
It is easy tro see why this is better than a washer .
The whole thing weighs about 3 grammes which is 0.1 oz .
The length of the bean is 1.5 inch or 37 mm .
I recently started experimenting with new configurations and the results really look promising .
Watch this space ;-)
Some time ago Ernesto Andrade sent me an e-mail with two illustrations in wich he altered my picture .
Have a look : it 's brilliant !
It felt as if I had a leg missing - or even two ;-) Hilarious !
Still a good idea !
Any triangle is a very stable construction in nature .
This is the story of Theo van Houts as written ( in dutch ) by Dirk Kuin for Camera Magazine : Inverted Tripod Also an invention by Theo Van Houts is the inverted or negative tripod .
Another tale .
He is off to Sweden a lot .
For one he speaks the language .
At one time he goes to Stockholm to cover the awarding of the Nobel Prize in literature to Garcia Marquez .
He knew that there always was a designated photographers area just next to the main stage .
" Anytime you see a picture of the Awarding Ceremony , it 's from the side : both the king and the recipient are in profile .
No wonder , because you are not allowed to be anywhere else [ as a photographer ] . "
True to himself he did not give in easily .
He schemed and networked and made contact with - not the members of the flagger troupe this time [ yet another tale - ww ] - but with the members of the choir that usually sang on the Ceremony .
They have a nice place on center stage and have a commanding view of both the actual ceremony , the guests and the rest of the hall .
Van Houts rented a morning coat and disguised as a choir member took front row .
Hidden in the coat 's inside pocket the Minox we mentioned before .
Small and above all almost noiseless .
Attached to his belt a shock cord of about 15 inch .
At the moment supreme he pulls the tiny camera from his pocket ( " I pushed the 160 iso film to 320 " ) attaches the cord ( " to get enough counter force , in order to hold it reasonably still for a longer shutter speed - hence the negative tripod " ) and made a gorgeous panoramic overview with his moderate wide angle .
The awarding of the Prize , the Royal entourage , laureates , the public and - last but not least - somewhere below the stage a tangle heaving and toiling colleagues .
He caught everything and everybody .
" I think it was a shutter speed of 1/15 or even 1/ 8 .
At full aperture .
Because of my shock cord it was a picture that could be well enlarged .
Later I went back in Hamstad where it hung prominently at my show .
It was the first time the Swedes could see what the Ceremony really looked like . "

EVERYONE who wants universal health coverage ( me included ) finds irresistible the rallying cry that all Americans should have the same health benefits that members of Congress have .
But Congress ’s health insurance  that is , the heavily subsidized preferred provider plan that most members have  is not an ideal model , because it is quite rich .
As with other fee - for - service plans , it does little to encourage people to be smart health care shoppers .
Congress ’s health plan pays for routine expenses like office visits and vaccinations , for example , which is like auto insurance covering oil changes or new windshield wipers .
As a result , the premiums are steep  upwards of $ 13,000 a year for a family ( 69 percent of which is paid by the government ) .
To provide the 50 million Americans who are now uninsured with such a plan would require scary tax increases .
When faced with staggering cost projections , advocates of universal coverage often suggest something less grand for the uninsured ; after all , it ’s better than the nothing they have now .
But that approach violates the as - good - as - what - Congress - has standard .
Plus , it makes uncomfortably explicit the dread possibility of a “ two - tier ” system in which influential or better - off Americans have lavish health insurance , and the less affluent make do with a slimmed - down plan .
( To be sure , we now have multiple - tier care , but in a democracy we like to pretend that ’s not the case . )
The obvious answer  conveniently overlooked by the 535 well - insured members of Congress  is to stick with our rallying cry , but give Congress a more cost - effective plan .

Michael Bay would be proud .
In 2001 , a firefighter for the Ohio National Guard , legally changed his name to " Optimus Prime " on his 30th birthday , because the show character was like a " father figure " for him when he was growing up .
The name appears on his driver 's license , military ID , and even his uniform .
Take that , Megatron .
So , thankfully , the left has been exerting pressure on Nelson to fall more in line with health care reform .
Several ads have been run in Nebraska toward this goal .
One of the most recent , and most effective , is a joint effort by Democracy for America ( there 's a concept ) and the Progressive Change Campaign Committee .
And it goes a little something like this :
Now that 's what I call a bright snappy toe - tapping number .
Hotcha - cha - cha !
However , it turns out that Nelson does not think the ads have a good beat and will not give them a 98 .
In fact , he 's so put off his spleen by them that his office sent out a little missive today .
You can read the whole thing here , but here are a few choice excerpts :
Nebraskans do n't need outside special interest groups telling them what to think .
Senator Nelson has nothing but praise for Nebraska groups working toward health care reform .
Unfortunately , he says , these outside groups undermine the sincere and dedicated efforts of people in our state .
Recently , similar ads have run in Nebraska .
Those ads by other special interests prompted hundreds of Nebraskans to call our offices , with 9 to 1 urging Senator Nelson to do exactly the opposite of what the special interest group wanted .
In short , the ads backfired .
So let me get this straight .
9 to 1 calls came into Ben Nelson 's office demanding that he drive the small business owner out of work ?
Riiiiight .
Now the rumblings become slightly ominous :
Further , these scare tactics are certain to further divide the public on health care reform , make it less likely Congress will pass real reform and call into question the motives of those who say they want reform , but use the issue to raise money to try to buy influence inside the Beltway .
So his thinking is , our side 's ads make people mad , make them call into his office to demand no health reform , and despite the fact that he rilly , rilly wants to give health care reform to the people , he 'll just have no choice but to deny the country health care !
I mean , even if we buy this story at face value , it says two things :
1 ) Nebraskans are apparently all petty enough to renounce health care because they 're annoyed by a few ads , and 2 ) Nelson is more concerned with keeping his job than giving health care to the country ( which , in fairness , we already knew ) .
Yeah , no , this dog is n't hunting .
Let 's see , blah de blah , do n't rush reform , do it right , etc. , etc ...
Oh , here we go :
He has said he will consider a " public plan " as long as it does n't undermine the health coverage 200 million Americans have now .
He supports Medicare , TRICARE and S - CHIP , and each is a public plan .
He also helped establish Kids Connection , Nebraska 's public - plan health insurance for children .
Some wiggle room there , anyway , although he 'll no doubt fall back on the " protect private insurance " platform if questioned .
Blah blah bipartisan , blah blah " independent thinker " ( if only ) , but finally , we get to the big finish :
If this is an indication of the politics going into August , then health care reform may be dead by the end of August .
You heard it here first , folks .
Ben Nelson is threatening to kill health care reform for all Americans because he does n't like being targeted by a few ads .
Surely we can have as much fun with this as we did with Newt 's Air Force
One temper tantrum ?
I think one thing is definitely apparent ; Nelson 's protests demonstrate the exact opposite of what he 's claiming , i.e. , that the ads , and the pressure , are working .
More , please !
Hey !

Thanks for the props , now let 's hit it !

Kathleen Neill charged with public lewdness after posing for a photographer at the Metropolitan Museum of Art
New York 's Metropolitan Museum of Art is full of nudes in marble and oil on canvas .
But the idea of a real , naked human body is , it seems , just too much for the authorities .
Kathleen " KC " Neill , 26 , was arrested yesterday and charged with public lewdness after posing naked in the museum for photographer Zach Hyman as part of a series of nudes in New York 's public spaces .
" It 's just ridiculous , " Hyman , 22 , said of the charge .
" There are sculptures of nude men and women in there .
There are paintings of nude men and women in there .
They 're talking about children in there and seeing this happen and how awful it is .
Then do n't bring your kids to the Met . "
Yesterday afternoon , Hyman , who has shot nudes in Times Square , in the subway , in a church and other public spaces without complaint , entered the museum with Neill and his support team .
At what Hyman thought was the appropriate moment , Neill shed her dress and the photographer got to work .
Seconds later Neill donned her clothes and Hyman handed the film to an aide .
" None of the patrons had any problem with it , " he said , " probably because they were in an art museum and we were doing an art piece . "
But a female guard followed Neill to the front of the 129 - year - old museum , where another guard physically prevented the model from leaving , Hyman said .
Police were summoned .
Hyman was released while Neill was handcuffed and taken away in a police car .
" As a nonprofit institution on city - owned land , the Met , like all other individual and institutional citizens , is subject to municipal laws , rules , and regulations , " said museum spokesman Harold Holzer in a statement .
For his part , Hyman said the project , entitled Decent Exposures , was inspired by the nudes in the Met 's galleries .
" I want to show the human form in all of its glory , " he said .
" It 's basically to dissemble the idea that nudity equates to pornography and nudity equates to sexuality . "
The photograph will go on display at New York 's Chair and the Maiden gallery next week , along with the rest of the series .
Hyman has photographed both men and women for his project , but said women are easier .
" People see a naked woman and they smile , " he said .
" They see a penis and they freak out . "

Brawn GP has now secured the funding to guarantee its Formula 1 future for the next three years , AUTOSPORT has learned , after confirming for the first time that its deal with Virgin will end later this season .
The outfit had come into this campaign with enough funding from Honda to see it through to the beginning of 2010 , but it needed to find additional backers to guarantee its place in F1 beyond then .
A sponsorship deal with Virgin was signed at the Australian Grand Prix but hopes it could be expanded into a title - sponsorship deal were scuppered when the two parties could not agree on the level of funding .
Virgin is now on its way to the new Manor Grand Prix team .
Despite failing to find a deal with Virgin , it is understood that Brawn GP has now managed to put in place agreements with a number of unidentified major backers that will commence from the start of 2010 .
Brawn GP CEO Nick
Fry said the identity of the sponsors would likely be kept secret until the launch of is 2010 car .
The team has been linked to deals with Emirates airline , Monster energy drink , Bwin and Telmex in the past .
" We have zero worries on funding for this year , next year , the year after , and the year after that , " he told AUTOSPORT .
" I smile when people talk about money , because we 've always had the finances for this year , and neither Ross nor I would not have taken on the team if we did not have the money for this year .
" We 've signed some nice contracts , and those will come out into the open when we launch the car next year , but we will see what happens .
There is zero worry on our side . "
Talks with team backers accelerated over the summer once the new Concorde Agreement was in place - as it guaranteed the future of F1 and ended talk of a breakaway .
Team principal Ross Brawn said : " That was a log jam because sponsors wanted to know what the situation was , and things are freeing up .
Everyone up the pit lane will find that things are now much better because we know what the commercial basis is for the future .
" We know we are going to be racing for the next three years at least in this championship - and I hope beyond , I hope we do n't get into discussions about alternative championships again . "
Fry also publicly confirmed for the first time that Virgin was leaving the team at the end of this season , following its first foray into F1 .
When asked if the company 's logos would be on the Brawn GP car next year , he said : " No . We 've had a great relationship with Virgin .
" You have noticed different stickers from Virgin on the car over the year , and that is the result of additional requests from their side , which has increased our income as well , which is nice .
I think they have had a great initiation into F1 , and we are helping where we can in advice about what they can do with Manor .
" I really do hope they are successful not only next year but beyond , because they are a good company and it is a good company for F1 to have . "
Twenty years ago , Pete Rose did what Major League Baseball wanted him to do , step up and take responsibility for his alleged gambling habit .
Rose , who has been cooperative since , followed orders and confessed his wrongdoing .
Still not in the Hall of Fame , and still jumping when being told to jump , I cannot figure out why he has not gotten his second chance yet .
Athletes have done so many things worse than Rose on the totem pole of ethics .
I am not here to rip on the other athletes , but rather convey the message that Rose is still being punished for much less .
Michael Vick , a name we are all sick of hearing , ran a dogfighting ring , did his time , and is suiting up for Philadelphia .
Vick was given a second chance that quick .
Steroids in baseball have more to do with altering the course of a game moreso than a manager [ Rose ] betting on his team to win every night .
I understand that Mark McGwire , Sammy Sosa , Rafel Palmeiro , A - Rod , and Big Papi will probably never see the Hall of Fame either .
However , they cheated .
How is betting on the team you are managing to win cheating ?
It is unethical , but it is not cheating .
Donte Stallworth killed another human being because he was drunk .
He served some time ( minimal ) , coughed up a small fortune , and you can bet he will be back on the field next year .
How can these guys literally get away with murder , and Rose still be punished 20 years later ?
It makes no sense to me .
Rose is baseball ’s all - time leader in hits .
If Bud Selig decides that enough - is - enough already , he would be making the right decision .
Selig seems to want to milk this and turn Rose ’s funeral into his induction period .
Selig knows he belongs .
Rose played from 1963 until 1986 .
Without him , there was no Big Red Machine , no Charlie Hustle , no advertisements that featured a baseball player so much .
Rose did so much more good for the game than the bad he is still being judged upon .
There are common people who serve less than 20 years for murders .
To keep a star like Rose out of the limelight is dumb .
He is still charismatic , loves the game , and hurt no one but himself .
Time is up , do the right thing and re-instate Pete Rose .

Encore Post
On the road for a day and a half .
Here is an encore post from last October , an issue that remains salient , sadly , as creationists have stepped up their presence in Texas before the next round of biology textbook approvals before the Texas State Board of Education .
I discuss why intelligent design should not be in science books .
[ From October 2006 ] :
We ’re talking past each other now over at Right Reason , on a thread that started out lamenting Baylor ’s initial decision to deny Dr. Francis Beckwith tenure last year , but quickly changed once news got out that Beckwith ’s appeal of the decision was successful .
I noted that Beckwith ’s getting tenure denies ID advocates of an argument that Beckwith is being persecuted for his ID views ( wholly apart from the fact that there is zero indication his views on this issue had anything to do with his tenure discussions ) .
Of course , I was wrong there — ID advocates have since continued to claim persecution where none exists .
Never let the facts get in the way of a creationism rant , is the first rule of creationism .
Discussion has since turned to the legality of teaching intelligent design in a public school science class .
This is well settled law — it ’s not legal , not so long as there remains no undisproven science to back ID or any other form of creationism .
Background : The Supreme Court affirmed the law in a 1987 case from Louisiana , Edwards v. Aguillard ( 482 U.S. 578 ) , affirming a district court ’s grant of summary judgment against a state law requiring schools to teach creationism whenever evolution was covered in the curriculum .
Summary judgment was issued by the district court because the issues were not materially different from those in an earlier case in Arkansas , McLean vs. Arkansas ( 529 F. Supp. 1255 , 1266 ( ED Ark. 1982 ) ) .
There the court held , after trial , that there is no science in creationism that would allow it to be discussed as science in a classroom , and further that creationism is based in scripture and the advocates of creationism have religious reasons only to make such laws .
( During depositions , each creationism advocate was asked , under oath , whether they knew of research that supports creationism ; each answered “ no . ”
Then they were asked where creationism comes from , and each answered that it comes from scripture .
It is often noted how the testimony changes from creationists , when under oath . )
Especially after the Arkansas trial , it was clear that in order to get creationism into the textbooks , creationists would have to hit the laboratories and the field to do some science to back their claims .
Oddly , they have staunchly avoided doing any such work , instead claiming victimhood , usually on religious grounds .
To the extent ID differs from all other forms of creationism , the applicability of the law to ID was affirmed late last year in the Pennsylvania case , Kitzmiller v. Dover .
Against this legal background , Dr. Francis Beckwith has been arguing that school boards may legally inject creationism into their curricula .
His analysis is long and off the point ; among other things he thinks that , philosophically , courts should not inquire into the religious motives of school boards and other legislative bodies when they pass such silly laws .
In this argument , Beckwith appears to miss the essential elements upon which the courts rule :
That there is no demonstration of science in the various flavors of creationism , and consequently no valid , secular reason to put it into school curricula .
In my days in intercollegiate debate , we called such cases “ squirrels . ”
They depend on one ’s roping - in the opponent to an off - topic discussion on some point where you actually have a case , in order to avoid arguing on all the issues where you are weak .
In the case of creationism , the ID advocates wish to avoid arguing on the issues of whether they ’ve done any significant or substantial lab work since 1981 , because they have n’t .
Having not paid the dues to be called science , having not purchased the research ticket to respectability the courts require , they need to argue something else to stay in the game .
The bottom line is this : Dr. Beckwith claims that it would or should be legal to teach intelligent design ( ID ) in public school science classes , as science .
These claims are predicated on an assumption that science is behind the ideas of intelligent design — and that assumption is completely unwarranted .
There is not enough science in ID to get a nomination for the IgNobel Prizes , let alone to warrant teaching it as science to innocent children .
Beckwith does n’t see it that way , of course .
He ’s got a book out , Law , Darwinism , and Public Education , in which he argues that ID should be treated like just an alternative proposal , and in which he concludes that if a school district were to make the ruling just right , ID would be found to be good science to be taught to kids .
I bought the book a couple of years ago — at a church conference featuring the Discovery Institute ’s best videos and books , a science conference being something too scary for intelligent design , it appears — and I have intended at various times to make a good fisking of it .
But there are problems :
First and foremost , the book is so rife with error that I ca n’t get more than a couple of pages at a time without throwing it down in disgust at its lack of editing .
Nor is there any financial incentive — one more analysis that shows ID is still outdated and bad science , and that the law has not changed since 1788 , is not much in demand .
Perhaps someday , when I get some real library time , I might fisk it anyway .
In other places I have likened Beckwith ’s claim to a claim that , philosophically , the Federal Aviation Administration ( FAA ) should regulate pig farms in air traffic lanes near major airports , since , if pigs could fly , they might pose a hazard to commercial and general aviation .
Such a claim is nearly indistinguishable from Beckwith ’s claims in the soundness of their reasoning and arguments , and in the utter failure of the argument due to the error in a major premise .
ID is n’t science , and pigs do n’t fly .
Pig flight is a good analogy to Beckwith ’s claims , I think .
Logically , one can make the case that the FAA would have jurisdiction over farms with flying pigs .
One can make that case under current law , which charges the FAA with worrying over hazards to aviation , and which in practice requires FAA and airports and airlines to seriously consider risks from birds around airports , as well as things like deer on the runways ( hello O’Hare ? ) .
So , logically , philosophically , the case makes sense .
It is a perfect squirrel case , except for this issue : Pigs do n’t fly .
At Panda ’s
Thumb , earlier , I put it this way :
You have assumed that ID is science .
It ’s not .
You ’ve assumed that the science can be well demonstrated in a courtroom .
No one has tried .
It is unjustified , therefore , to make the leap to the position that teaching ID in a government - sponsored science class could be constitutional .
I think the repeating of this canard is part of what makes non-legal scholars , like Tom DeLay , angry when the judges merely apply the law that exists , instead of the law that non-party partisans have told DeLay and others could exist .
One could , philosophically , argue that the Federal Aviation Administration should regulate effluents from pigs , if it can be shown that pigs do fly .
The effluents could , arguably , pose a hazard to commercial and recreational aviation , and they could have effects on the ground around pig airports .
If the pigs fly in FAA - regulated areas , then the law is pretty clear that they fall into the purview of the FAA .
But if the FAA shows up at an Arkansas pig farm to inspect the pigs , the farmer would be well within his rights to throw them off the farm .
Pigs do n’t fly , no matter the philosophical validity of the FAA ’s having jurisdiction , if they did .
ID is not science .
That pig has n’t even sprouted wings yet .
Dr. Beckwith , later in that thread , came as close as he ever has to dealing with the issue :
Ed .
I do n’t recognize my arguments in your comments .
As you know , if you have read my book , I am not offering legal advice to teachers .
I am assessing a debate over Constitutional Law .
To employ an illustration , prior to our current First Amendment regime , lawyers argued in law reviews that hard core pornography is protected by the Constitution , even though those lawyers would not advise their individual clients to start purchasing pornography .
So , there is a difference between the sort of advice one may give a client , and the more scholarly debate about the nature of our legal regime and what sorts of actions are permissible under it .
The difference between pornography and intelligent design being only that pornography really does exist , and can be found easily , and in some cases may be argued to have socially redeeming value ( see , c.f. , the Sistine Chapel ) .
In any case , I think we can conclude that Beckwith and I agree on this : Teachers , administrators , do n’t try ID in the classroom .
That pig wo n’t fly .
Update , December 2012 : You probably ought to read subsequent pieces , by scholars with much more stature than I have .
That pig still ai n’t flyin’ !
Also , even more :
( Why are we still discussing this stuff , 9 years after ID got skunked in Texas before the education authorities , 7 years after the Dover , Pennsylvania decision , in which ID got skunked in federal court and declared “ not science ” before God and the whole world , and 87 years after the Scopes trial ? )

Video and story from Media Matters , July 13 :
Megyn , Megyn , Megyn .
What has gone to the FOX anchor 's head ?
It 's one thing to demonize People for the American Way , we kind of expect that .
But in an interview with the attorney for the New Haven Firefighter who sued for reverse discrimination ( in a case made notable by the involvement of Judge Sotomayor ) BAM out of nowhere you compare him to Joe the Plumber ?
Joe not -a- plumber , Joe who toured with McCain as a prop ?
Poor Joe , the " innocent " guy who wanted to avoid the public spotlight so vigorously , he hired a Nashville publicist to handle his press requests ?
And somehow , stating that the GOP " failed to vet " Joe the Plumber is an unfair smear ?
Kudos to the attorney for agreeing quickly with Megyn Kelly as if it were her own idea .
You do what you can for your client and your own firm 's PR , no matter how divorced from reality your claims might be .
Every lawyer knows the value of billable hours , my friends .

Northern Ireland Security Minister Paul Goggins has described loyalist decommissioning as a " very bold and important step " .
Two Northern Ireland loyalist groups , the UVF and Red Hand Commando , have decommissioned weapons , ammunition and explosives , observers have confirmed .
Mr Goggins called the move " very welcome " .
" I welcome the leadership of those within those organisations who made this bold step , " he said .
Mr Goggins said the UDA still had " some way to go " but were engaged in the process .
The minister said there could be no deals over decommissioning but that the challenge remained to provide investment in hard - pressed communities .
" The gun has been taken out of the equation as regards loyalist communities , " he said .
" The political challenge can now be embraced by everybody who has a care about people who live on the edge of society . "
The Independent International Commission on Decommissioning ( IICD ) confirmed on Monday that it had witnessed a " major decommissioning event " .
Earlier , both groups said their weapons and explosives were " totally and irreversibly beyond use " .
No details were released about the number of arms decommissioned .
In a statement , a spokesman for the commission said : " The IICD can confirm it has witnessed a major decommissioning event involving arms , ammunition , explosives and explosive devices belonging to the UVF and Red Hand Commando .
" The leaderships of both organisations have advised us that the weapons and material put beyond use in our presence include all the arms under their control . "
' Big moment ' Northern Ireland Secretary Shaun Woodward said the confirmation of loyalist decommissioning was " a cause for real celebration " .

More from Today programme " What the people of Northern Ireland want is these illegal weapons taken off the street - these acts confirmed by General John de Chastelain are very significant and I think it 's a big moment in Northern Ireland , " he said .
US Secretary of State Hillary Clinton welcomed the move as a " courageous step " and praised unionist politicians for making it possible .
On Saturday , the UVF said the decommissioning was observed by three independent witnesses - from the UK , Ireland and America .
Later that day , the decommissioning body confirmed the UDA had begun getting rid of its weapons - but had not finished the process yet .
It gives grounds for great confidence and it cements our peace process
The Reverend Harold Good A spokesperson said : " The IICD has witnessed a decommissioning event involving arms belonging to the UDA and the Ulster Freedom Fighters .
" This is a significant move and we look forward to completing the process of putting all UDA / UFF arms beyond use at an early opportunity . "
The BBC's Mark Simpson said no details have been released about how many loyalist weapons were decommissioned , which method was used or where it happened .
The commission , headed by retired Canadian general John de Chastelain , was established to oversee the decommissioning of paramilitary weapons , as part of the peace process .
Earlier on Sunday , the Reverend Harold Good , an independent witness on the IICD , said the steps taken by loyalist paramilitaries to give up their arms was another step towards normality in Northern Ireland .
" I think it gives grounds for great confidence and it cements our peace process , " he said .

Producer , Boob Job : My Big Decision
Unhappy with her body , Kianna feels that she does not fit in with her friends A recent survey found that nine out of 10 teenage girls in the UK are unhappy with their bodies .
Twenty - six percent of respondents were considering plastic surgery and over the past three years the number of teenagers having cosmetic surgery has risen 500 % .
Kianna , 13 , has wanted breast enhancement ever since she can remember and she is determined to go to the US when she is 16 to have the operation .
" The things I do n't like about my body are my breasts I spend almost 100 % of my life thinking about it . "
" It does make me unhappy .
My friends are more developed than I am at the moment and I do n't like it ' cos they can wear whatever they want and I can't .
I stand out and look really weird . "
Kianna and her family live on a housing estate where she has never really felt at home .
" Two things make me stand out of the crowd - my colour and my boobs I am the only mixed - race girl around and I just do n't fit in . "
Single mother Sharon knows just how strong - willed her only child can be .
" Kianna just does n't give up - she 's got no fear about what 's going to happen to her body . "
And Sharon 's sister , Angela , is equally worried that her niece is wanting breast implants just to fit in .
" I would n't like to be a teenager growing up , there 's too much pressure on them now what the magazine and telly are portraying ... her head 's way ahead of her body and she needs to give herself time to go into puberty . "
Intimacy issues Kianna goes on a journey of discovery about breast enhancement surgery as part of a BBC programme .
She is joined on the road trip by 17 - year - old Katrina ( Kat ) from Tunbridge Wells , who also suffers from low self - esteem and hopes plastic surgery will make her feel more confident about her body .
Kianna and Katrina ( Kat ) both face life changing decisions " I would like to look like a mix between Jordan and Katy Perry .
" I do want them to look a bit fake like I 've had them done because then I 'll be more confident in showing other people ' cos they wo n't be mine . "
Her mother Jules is devastated that her only daughter wants to change herself so dramatically through surgery .
" For me to endorse her having a boob job is a difficult thing because , as a mother , you just want to see your daughter happy .
But the surgery she wants is to look artificial and I struggle to understand why . "
Kat has had boyfriends since she was 13 , but struggles with intimacy .
" I do n't like people touching my boobs , I wo n't let them do it I do n't think I 've ever taken off my top in sex ' cos I just do n't feel comfortable . "
Jules knows that time is running out to dissuade Kat from surgery she may live to regret .
" I love my daughter so much and I care about her decisions in life and I do n't want her to make wrong decisions . "
Surgery regrets
Both families meet people and witness experiences that are designed to get the teenagers talking openly and honestly and help inform their decision .
Kat 's mother Jules was concerned about her daughter having surgery Meeting a group of young girls , some of who had had surgery , Jules was distressed to hear some of the horror stories associated with getting bigger breasts .
" I got them done when I was 18 but I actually regret having them when they took the tubes out of me I was in excruciating pain and felt like someone was ripping off my skin , " says one girl .
Jules was shocked by the stories she heard .
" I think she 'll go through with it ' cos I think she 's got her mind set and that girl that she spoke to was very much the size that Katrina is now , and she might go through the same sort of pain . "
The girls also met The Sun " Page Three " model , Ruth .
Page
Three has a " no boob job " policy and Ruth - who is very anti-surgery - wanted to help change Kianna 's mind .
" Scarring can really show especially if you 're mixed race so when you 're looking at yourself in the mirror with your nice big new boobs you 're gonna have these two great big marks underneath them as well . "
Changing minds
After meeting with a surgeon and observing the reality of a breast - augmentation procedure , the teenagers were divided in their decision .
Seventeen - year - old Kat was still eager to pursue surgery but was happy to wait .
" It 's hard to say - I do n't want a boob job .
I 'm not going to lie , but I think in a couple of years time when I 'm 20 or 25 but for now I 'm just going to concentrate on college . "
But 13 - year - old Kianna came to realise that if she wants to pursue her dream career as a dancer , larger breasts might get in the way .
" My opinion changed a lot and I know now that I 'm not going to get a boob job I like my body at the moment , I do n't feel like a little girl , or a woman I feel like a teenager . "
Boob job : My Big Decision is on BBC

On “ magic ” , once again
So it seems Giles Bowkett is upset about use of the word “ magic ” .
I ’m happy to agree with the general consensus from various fora that the specific article he ’s complaining about is , well , pretty much content - free .
I could read that post over and over and still have no idea what actual things the author liked about Django or did n’t like about Rails .
But I ’ve pretty much learned to ignore content - free hype , and that ’s what I did in that case .
I ’m also quite happy to grant that not all programming languages do the same things in the same ways .
Usually , I ’m even willing to overlook the sorts of predictable comments which have so endeared Lisp and Smalltalk programmers to the world in general ( see : “ Lisp had that forty years ago ” , “ Smalltalk is the only real object - oriented language ” , “ this would be so much better with macros and tail recursion ” , “ we invented refactoring , you insensitive clod ” , etc. ) .
But that word , “ magic ” .
It keeps coming up over and over again .
Now , I ’ve written ( at some length ) about this topic , and generally endorsed the viewpoint that the sorts of things typically described as “ magic ” are often just applications of simple principles or techniques , and so really just require some background knowledge to understand and use effectively .
And , really , I think the advantages or disadvantages of such “ magic ” are — except in extreme cases — largely subjective and have more to do with experience and preference than anything else .
I think that ’s not too far from what Giles was trying to say , but I could be wrong .
So I ’ll see if I can explain where I ’m coming from .
For my first trick …
Django , of course , famously underwent a “ magic removal ” ( immediately preceding the 0.95 release ) which was hugely backwards - incompatible and is a motherlovin ’ pain to migrate through if you happen to be upgrading really old Django installs ( see : my life at the moment ) .
What was this “ magic ” ?
Well , let ’s say you want a blog application which , in the grand tradition , we ’ll call blog .
You want a way to store , retrieve and represent entries , so — since you ’ve got this object - relational mapper lying around — you want to use a model class to do this .
In any Django release since 0.95 , you ’d have a directory ( a Python module ) named blog , in it a file named models .py and in that a class named Entry .
Want to interact with it ?
from blog .
models import Entry and away you go .
Simple .
In Django releases prior to 0.95 , you have a directory ( a Python module ) named blog , in it a directory ( also a Python module ) named models , in that directory a file named blog.py and in that file a class named Entry .
Oh , and the models module needs to explicitly export that in its __all__ declaration .
Want to interact with it ?
Well , the obvious thing would be , say , from blog.
models .blog import Entry , which is a bit redundant but still serviceable .
Except that wo n’t work .
What you actually want is from django .
models .blog import entries .
You can get at the Entry class through that ( entries .
Entry ) , but what you almost always want is the collection of other stuff in entries , which is to say all the helpful functions for retrieving entries from your database , exceptions related to entries , constants related to entries , etc. , none of which you ever actually wrote and all of which were generated on - the - fly rather than , say , being inherited from some suitably - generically - written parent class .
Wait , what ?
Understanding why it worked that way is easier if you have some knowledge of the prehistory of Django ; originally , the Django ORM was , literally , a glorified code generator .
You ’d feed it a definition of your data model , and it would churn for a bit and then spit out a Python module , containing your model and a bunch of utility functions and other stuff .
Then you ’d stick that somewhere on your Python import path and go to town .
And if you needed to make changes , no problem : just re-generate the code .
Based on advice from the outside world , that went away before the first public release of Django .
Sort of .
What actually happened was that instead of generating a module you ’d save somewhere on your filesystem , the ORM just generated that whole module of code on the fly , kept it in memory and hacked sys. path to make it importable .
This is not as hard as it sounds and can be a neat parlor trick ( ladies and gentlemen , I have no .py files up my sleeve !
Now watch carefully … ) .
So , really , it was still a glorified code generator , it was just wearing a mask and a fake moustache and hoping nobody would notice .
This was “ magical ” in the sense that a whole bunch of stuff you ’d never written appeared in a module you ’d never created and was supposed to be used in place of the code you had actually written .
And although the level of dynamic programming and cleverness involved was , to borrow Giles ’ phrase , “ Palookaville , Omaha bullshit ” compared to the types of things you see in , say , Lisp or Smalltalk , it was pretty much universally condemned .
But — and this is important — it was n’t condemned because dynamic programming or cleverness are bad in themselves ; it was condemned because , well , there are situations where that stuff ’s appropriate and situations where it ’s not .
More on that in a moment .
In the center ring …
Many circuses and travelling shows involve a particular feat wherein one or more performers set up some thin poles and set plates or other round - ish objects spinning upon them , balancing them and keeping them rotating fast enough that they stay — seemingly in defiance of natural law — perched atop the poles rather than crashing to the ground .
Keeping in mind the fact that all analogies for programming are inherently bullshit , this can be considered an analogy for programming : you ’ve got some plates , and you have to keep them spinning or you get crashes .
Some languages , libraries and / or frameworks require you to keep track of a larger number of plates than others .
For example , in C you have to manage memory yourself , and remember to free anything you ’ve malloc ‘d when you ’re done with it , and to remember what you ’ve already freed so you do n’t try to follow a pointer down the rabbit hole .
There are programmers who consider this to be a character - building experience .
Personally , I just look at it as adding a bunch of plates that I have to keep spinning .
Other languages , libraries and / or frameworks try to reduce the number of plates you have to keep track of .
For example , many languages have now come around to the idea of automatic memory management and garbage collection ; this has , by and large , been a boon to programmers everywhere ( see : jwz , “ Java does n’t have free ( ) .
I have to admit right off that , after that , all else is gravy . ” ) .
In my experience , reducing the number of plates you have to keep track of makes programming simpler and programs more robust .
So this is generally a good thing .
Round and round she goes
What does this have to do with “ magic ” ?
Well , sometimes programmers decide to do clever things , often in the name of convenience .
They set things up so that , say , some variables will be automatically defined and populated without you having to do anything .
Or so that certain modules of code are automatically loaded and made available to you without lots of tedious import statements .
Or so that the return value from A ends up rendered by B , based on some convention of similarity of names between the two .
Or so that a two - line class declaration ends up producing lots of members which were never explicitly defined in that class or any of its ancestors .
These sorts of things are , in certain circles , referred to as “ magic ” .
They are , without a doubt , quite clever in their way .
And in many cases they do , without a doubt , offer some level of convenience to the programmer who uses them .
But they can also introduce whole new batches of plates that you ’ve got to keep an eye on .
And they wo n’t be plates that you personally set spinning , and sometimes they ’re not plates that you can easily watch or run over to if they start getting wobbly .
They ’re just a bunch of plates that got added to your act , and they ’ve got to keep spinning or else they ’ll crash and ruin the show , and figuring out why that happened or how to prevent it may prove rather difficult ( see : Brian Kernighan , “ debugging is twice as hard as writing a program in the first place .
So if you ’re as clever as you can be when you write it , how will you ever debug it ? ” ) .
In my opinion , designing good languages , libraries and / or frameworks consists of finding a balance between providing clever and convenient things , and asking programmers to keep too many plates spinning at the same time .
When so many clever things are going on that it ’s hard to track all those plates , people tend to call it “ magic ” .
When so few clever things are going on that everyday tasks get cumbersome , people tend to call it “ dumbed down ” .
To paraphrase Jeff Goldblum …
Every language / library / framework has its equivalent of “ magic ” .
Python , for example , has functions and classes as first - class values , ( non-mutable ) closures , the decorator pattern baked into the language , generators , comprehensions , properties , special methods you can implement to enable language - level syntactic constructs , dynamic code generation and all sorts of other stuff .
These features are extremely important in Python , but use of these features often appears “ magical ” to people coming from languages which do n’t have them ( like , say , Java ) .
And every language / library / framework has its own conventions on when and how to use the “ magic ” it offers .
For example : I am not a Lisp guru , but I ’ve seen plenty of people who are point out that you should never write a macro when a plain old function will suffice .
Sure , you ’ve got all that fantastic dynamism that lets you bend the language in clever ways , but cleverness for cleverness ’ sake is not a virtue ; it ’s just spinning up a bunch of extra plates , for no other reason than “ because I can ” .
To put it concisely , I think that ’s what a lot of critiques of “ magic ” really boil down to : the notion that just because you can do something does n’t mean you should .
Accepting this can be tough , but I think it ’s a necessary part of becoming a good programmer .
If you do n’t have a certain sense of discipline and respect for the power you ’re wielding , well , you might end up cloning dinosaurs and getting eaten by them when the power goes out .
Of course , there ’s quite a lot of room for subjectivity here .
If you grew up , metaphorically speaking , in a family of acrobatic plate - spinners , you probably do n’t mind handling a bunch of extra plates in your act , because you ’ve been spinning lots of plates your whole life .
If you did n’t , well , you might take a different view of things .
And I think we also have to account for taste ; there are , I know , people who can keep dozens of plates spinning but who choose not to , because that ’s not what they like to do .
And I ’m sure there probably are people who ca n’t but would love to if only they could .
Get to the point
I ’m not entirely certain that there is just one point here .
It ’s a bad thing to reflexively call stuff “ magic ” just because it does something you do n’t yet understand .
But it ’s equally a bad thing to use “ magic ” just because you can .
The right thing , if there is one , consists of a willingness to learn how stuff works even if it ’s unfamiliar or seems complicated , but also consists of learning to solve problems in a way that ’s clear and useful to people who ’ll read and use your code .
Often , that means learning and abiding by the customs and conventions of the particular programming community you ’re part of .
Python and Ruby , though surprisingly similar as languages , have communities of programmers whose norms are significantly different from each other .
And even within a language there can be large variations ( and , as with so many other language features , Lisp has arguably been doing that longer than anything else ) .
It also means that long after you ’ve mastered the syntax , concepts , patterns , libraries and frameworks of the languages you work with , you ’ll still be working to master the discipline ( in multiple senses of the word ) of programming .
In fact , if you do it right you ’ll always be working on that part , you ’ll always be learning to find the right amount of “ magic ” in both the languages you use and the programs you write , and sooner or later you ’ll have to accept that it will never be a fixed quantity .
And do n’t listen to these modern pundits who think you can rush into all of that ; ten years is nowhere near enough time .
PlayStation 3 owners eager to dive into the downloadable content for post - apocalyptic adventure Fallout 3 will have to wait an extra couple of months .
A Bethesda Game Studios producer tells the official PlayStation blog developers hope to have the first episode ready by the end of September .
Operation Anchorage , the first piece of DLC released on Xbox 360 , was originally scheduled to appear on the PlayStation Network at the end of June .
Producer Ashley Cheng writes in the PlayStation blog that Bethesda will also change the order in which the content is released .
PS3 owners can expect Broken Steel , the campaign that rewrites Fallout 3's ending and raises the level cap , to arrive first .
The other four episodes would appear soon after , although Bethesda has not provided specific dates .
Bethesda is also releasing a Game of the Year Edition of Fallout 3 , which will include the original game and all five pieces of DLC , in October .
Readers , what do you think of the news ?

Google Puts the World at the Tip of Painter 's Brush
Kentucky Man Uses Google Street View to Paint the World
Bill Guffey has never walked the streets of London , New York or Barcelona .
He has never visited the coast of Maine or watched the sun set in Italy over a Florentine villa .
But if you looked around his rural Kentucky studio , you would never know it .
Tableaus from European cities and every U.S. state ( except for Hawaii ) cover the walls of his home , illustrating the adventures of a presumably well - traveled artist .
Yet the self - taught oil painter said he has never physically been to 99 percent of the places he has captured on canvas .
To reach the closest Wal - Mart , Guffey said he needs at least 30 minutes in the car .
But with 30 seconds on his computer , he can fly around the world with Google Street View and paint any place his cursor lands .
Not only does the mapping tool give Guffey and other users a street - level window to many places in the world , it lets them navigate 360 - degree horizontal and 290 - degree vertical unbroken panoramas .
" I live in a very rural area , " the 45 - year - old said of the Burkesville , Ky. home he shares with his wife and two daughters .
" Here , I can go out and I can paint cows all day , barns all day … With Street View , I can find things I normally would n't see here . "
Google Street View Offers Views of the World
About a year and a half ago , Guffey , a graphic artist for the local Cumberland County News , said he was struck by the urge to paint .
So he stopped by a local hobby store , picked up a set of paints and canvases and got to work .
" From that point on , I was just addicted , " he said .
But pastoral though rolling hills and endless greenery may be , Guffey said he wanted to try his hand at something else .
" What I did was I started painting from Google Street View , " he said .
" I was looking at it and found that I could travel the world from rural Kentucky . "
Painted in June , Guffey calls this image " Barcelona Walk . "

Launched in May 2007 , Google Street View layers panoramic images of public streets ( and some national parks ) captured by Google over its maps ( after blurring faces and license plates ) .
Although it initially prompted some privacy concerns , the tool now covers nearly a dozen countries around the world in North America , Europe and Asia .
And it 's still expanding .
This painting , completed in July , shows Canada House in London 's Trafalgar Square .

Artists Can Compose From Panoramic Images
Guffey said Google Street View is particularly helpful for artists because it lets them view a whole scene and then select what to include in the image .
" A lot of artists will not work from someone else 's photograph , " he said .
But with Google Street View , he added , " you 're actually composing the theme , just like you were there taking the photograph . "
In February , he started a series of images from every state in the country .
Since Google does n't include images of Hawaii ( although the company said it 's working on adding them ) , he substituted in Washington , D.C. , for the 50th state .
Starting with Louisiana , Guffey said he finished off the 50 paintings in about 60 days , mostly keeping his cursor away from popular and famous landmarks .
" One of the whole points was to be able to travel virtually and paint places that I had not been , " he said , adding that he tried to capture the grit of real life and not just the " pretty , pretty scenes . "
For example , instead of choosing the historic plantations or sunny beaches of Virginia , Guffey chose an industrial view of a train track in Suffolk .
Virtual Paintouts Inspire Artists Around the World
This image , called " Morning Tracks , " shows a scene from Suffolk , Va. Photo credit : Bill Guffey .
For his own home state , however , he acknowledged that he made an exception .
" For some reason , I came back to the simple garage scene that I 'd passed by 1,000 times , " he said of his Kentucky painting , the final one he completed in his state series .
This painting of Burkesville , Ky. was Guffey 's final image in his state series .

Since March 2008 , Guffey has painted nearly 100 images from Google Street View , in addition to more than one hundred others .
In total , he said he has sold 30 to 40 pieces , some for as much as $ 1,500 .
For the past six months , he has also encouraged artists around the world to join him with his monthly " Virtual Paintouts . "
At the beginning of each month , Guffey announces a location and invites participants to send him painted views of the city .
At the end of the month , he posts them all on his blog .
So far , he said the paintouts have attracted about 25 painters from North America , Europe and even Australia .
In the near future , he said he hopes to expand his outreach to disabled artists , encouraging them to virtually travel to and paint the places they may not be able to be reach physically .
Google : Guffey Is ' Remarkable ' Example
For its part , Google has been supportive of his efforts .
" When we were creating Street View , we were excited about all the everyday uses , like looking for parking or planning trips , " Stephen Chau , product manager for Google Street View , said .
" Bill 's use of Street View , to inspire his paintings and to create a virtual community of artists , is a remarkable example that we had n't imagined but are really excited to see .
It 's been amazing to see the possibilities that have opened up as Street View has been brought to more places around the world . "
This painting , called " Dr. Gachet 's Lemon Tree , " shows a small street in Auvers , France .

But now that Guffey has traveled the country – and the world – with Google , he 's itching to do it for real .
" That 's one of my goals , " he said .
" To be able to go to the spots that I painted virtually and paint in real life . "

Are We In A Post - Racial America ?
by Louis Proyect
Book Review
Roediger , David : How Race Survived U.S. History : from settlement and slavery to the Obama phenomenon , Verso 2008 , ISBN - 13 : 978-1-84467-275-2 , 240 pages .
( Swans - June 1 , 2009 )
As part of the euphoria surrounding the election of Barack Obama , members of the punditocracy speculated that the U.S. had entered a " post- racial " epoch .
Typical was The Washington Post 's Jim Hoagland who editorialized on Election Day last year :
Barack Obama has succeeded brilliantly in casting his candidacy -- indeed , his whole life -- as post-racial .
Even before the votes have been cast , he has written a glorious coda for the civil rights struggle that provided this nation with many of the finest , and also most horrible , moments of its past 150 years .
If the results confirm that race was not a decisive factor in the balloting , generations of campaigners for racial justice and equality will have seen their work vindicated .
After deploying data in his introduction to How Race Survived U.S. History to the effect that racism continues unabated ( one in three children of color lives in poverty as opposed to one in ten of white families , etc. ) , David Roediger poses the question : " How did white supremacy in the U.S. not yield to changes that we generally regard as constant , dramatic , and , in the main , progressive ? "
The remainder of his brilliantly argued and researched book gives the definitive answer to this question .
As such , it belongs on the bookshelf next to Howard Zinn 's People 's History of the United States and other such works that offer a " revisionist " history of this country in accordance with truth and -- more importantly -- justice .
The theme that Roediger keeps coming back appears initially in Chapter One on colonial Virginia in the 17th century ( " Suddenly White Supremacy " ) ; namely , that a white identity was created in order to unite men and women of conflicting classes against the most exploited groups of the day : the slave and the Indian .
And when necessary , blacks were also recruited to the master 's cause against the Indians .
As has always been the case , the British -- including the freedom - loving colonists who would form a new republic in 1776 -- have been adept at dividing and conquering .
Roediger writes :
The most spectacular example of revolt , Bacon 's Rebellion of 1676 , took Virginia to the brink of civil war .
Broadly arising from the desire for good land among European and African servants and ex-servants , the rebellion therefore also had anti-Indian dimensions , demanding and implementing aggressive policies to speed settlement onto indigenous lands .
Bondservants joined those who had recently served out " their time " under the leadership of the young English lawyer and venture capitalist Nathaniel Bacon , laying siege to the capital in Jamestown , burning it , driving Governor William Berkeley into exile , and sustaining insurrection for months .
Authorities offered freedom " from their slavery " to " Negroes and servants " who would come over into opposition to the rebellion .
Rebels , meanwhile , feared that they would all be made into " slaves , man , woman & child . "
Both the promise of liberation and the language registering fear of retribution suggest how imperfectly class predicaments aligned with any firm sense of racial division .
Even today , you can find the same sort of manipulation of " Negroes and servants " in support of xenophobic attacks on immigrant rights .
In the March 29 , 2006 , edition of Counterpunch , Earl Ofari Hutchinson took note of the absence of open and vocal support in the black civil rights establishment for the immigrant rights movement :
The great irony in the gargantuan march of tens of thousands in Los Angeles and other cities for immigrant rights is that the old civil rights groups have been virtually mute on immigration and the marches .
There are no position papers , statements , or press releases on the websites of the NAACP , Urban League , SCLC on immigration reform , and nothing on the marches .
The Congressional Black Caucus has n't done much better .
It has issued mostly perfunctory , tepid and cautious statements opposing the draconian provisions of the House bill that passed last December .
As was the case in colonial Virginia in the 17th century and once again in 2006 , the capitalist class demonstrates an enormous talent for conning its victims into lining up behind its own class interests .
If its victims demonstrated only one - half of this skill at creating unity across color , gender , and sexual orientation lines , perhaps the capitalist system would have come to an end long ago .
Moving forward , Roediger demonstrates an uncanny ability to discover a racial narrative in the most unexpected places , including the Louisiana Purchase of 1803 .
This event has always been represented in high school and college classrooms as a straightforward commercial deal between the U.S. and France .
For Roediger it was a bid by the new republic that had won its freedom from British colonialism to now create its homegrown colonial system .
Ironically , it only was able to conclude a deal with the French because it had been weakened by the freedom struggle of Haitian slaves that Jefferson and other American " democrats " had opposed .
Roediger quotes an 1889 observation by Henry Adams that " the prejudice of race alone blinded the American people to the debt they owed to the desperate courage of five hundred thousand Haytian negroes who would not be enslaved . "
As a long - time critic of an element of the thesis associated with Robert Brenner that equates free labor with capitalism , I found Roediger 's discussion of slavery and Jim Crow most useful .
To summarize the Brenner thesis briefly , he and his co-thinkers including Ellen Meiksins Wood distinguish capitalism from all systems that preceded it by its ability to coerce workers solely through market relations rather than through " political " means such as discriminatory laws , etc .
While not mentioning Brenner or Wood specifically , Roediger 's words would seem to refute their analysis :
Liberal and radical writers of the late twentieth century inherited from earlier progressive historians a framework viewing the Civil War itself as a contest between the agrarian feudalism of the South and the industrial capitalist ambitions of the North .
Early Marxist historians generally agreed , and the most celebrated late twentieth - century Marxist writing on the subject unfortunately resonated with such accounts far more than it did with Marx 's own writings on the United States .
By contrast , Marx 's own words at their best impressively resisted drawing the easy opposition between a backward pre-capitalist South and a progressive capitalist North .
For Marx , the contrast was less marked , even as he championed the Union side in the Civil War .
" We . . . call the plantation owners in America capitalists , " he wrote , because they exist and compete " within a world market based on free labor . "
Not only did slaves produce commodities like cotton for the world market , they were commodities themselves .
Roediger notes that 40 percent of all slave trades before the Civil War were interstate , involving as much as $ 600 million exchanging hands .
If slaves were treated by law as less than human , then it was inevitable that supporters of the system would attempt to explain their status in " scientific " terms .
The slave system was not just responsible for debased human relations , it also produced debased ideology .
Roediger dissects Samuel Cartwright , one of the more odious practitioners of scientific racism .
A physician based in the South , Cartwright tried to explain the racial differences that justified one group dominating another .
He discovered a mental disorder common among slaves called drapetomania -- the desire to flee from servitude .
There was also Dysaethesia aethiopica , a disease " affecting both mind and body " that explained the apparent lack of work ethic among slaves .
More associated with inaction during the Great Depression than with racism , Herbert Hoover was just as bad as Cartwright .
Before becoming president , he worked as a mining engineer and rated labor on the basis of its innate racial abilities .
Whites were at the top and indigenous peoples in Australia , whom he referred to as " niggers , " were at the bottom .
Even the white workers were suspect , especially in Australia where they had " loafing proclivities . "
He imported crews of Italian workers , who he regarded as " servile " and " peaceable " in order to put pressure on native labor , colored and white alike .
Always attuned to the bottom line , Hoover told a 1902 international congress of engineers in London that Chinese workers might be the best investment since despite having a " capacity for thieving , " their families would be mollified by a $ 30 compensation for death due to accident .
Thus , less money would have to be spent on supporting timbers in mines worked by Chinese labor .
Returning to a question that has consumed others working in this field , including the late Ted Allen and Noel Ignatiev , Roediger considers the susceptibility of Irish immigrants to be recruited to the racist cause despite being regarded as little better than " niggers " themselves on their arrival to the U.S.
This kind of anti-Irish venom was not limited to the uneducated .
Francis Amasa Walker , who taught political economy at Yale and went on to become president of M.I.T. , warned that Irish immigration would pose the threat of racial degeneration .
Walker also worried about other threats to American civilization like the Poles and the Italians who represented " races ... of the very lowest stage of degradation . "
At the outset Irish workers were open to a class unity that transcended race .
In the early 1840s abolitionists held a mass rally that supported the Irish struggle for independence .
These hopes were crushed as the Democratic Party , the party of slavery , devised ways to elevate the Irish immigrant community in exchange for siding against black people .
Daniel O'Connor , a pro-abolition Irish nationalist , remarked that Irish Americans had " learned this cruelty " of pro-slavery in the U.S. , not Ireland .
Despite the Democratic Party 's reputation for opposing racism , given a new lease on life with the election of Barack Obama , there are indications that not much has changed since the mid-19th century .
The Democratic Leadership Council emerged in the post - Reagan era in order to woo the white " Reagan Democrat " back into the fold , which meant backing politicians like Bill Clinton who offered only the most tepid resistance to Republican assaults on affirmative action and who scuttled Aid to Dependent Children , a welfare measure that was perceived ( incorrectly ) as favoring people of color .
Even under the " post- racial " epoch of Barack Obama , there are few signs that the Democratic Party is willing to attack the institutional basis of racism as long as the party is under the control of Wall Street banks , real estate developers , and other sectors of the capitalist economy that prosper on the super - exploitation of non-white workers .
Obama signaled his intention to adhere to the status quo even before he became president .
In his speech to the 2004 Democratic Party convention , he stated " Go into the [ blue ] collar counties around Chicago , and people will tell you they do n't want their tax money wasted by a welfare agency or the Pentagon . "
Considering how welfare budgets have been slashed in the past 25 years or so while the Pentagon drains tax coffers in order to fend off one enemy or another overseas ( mostly people of color in the colonial world ) , Obama 's remarks can only be considered cheap demagogy .
Furthermore , his willingness to condemn Jeremiah Wright for alluding to the truths self - evident to everybody in the black community and receiving a scholarly treatment in Roediger 's book demonstrate that the task is the same as it was from the beginning : to unite the victims of the capitalist system against those who benefit from it .
Since we have hundreds of millions that we can count on eventually against a tiny minority , our final victory is assured as long as we have the courage to march forward without illusions in temporary fixes .

Report : Roy Halladay on the block
According to a report by FOXSports.com , the Blue Jays are listening to offers for ace Roy Halladay .
“ We have to see what ’s out there , ” Blue Jays general manager J.P. Ricciardi says .
“ I ’m not saying we ’re going to shop him .
But if something makes sense , we at least have to listen .
We ’re ( leaning ) more toward listening than we ’ve ever been . ”
Ricciardi first made similar comments to CBS Sportsline , prompting immediate skepticism from one rival executive , who speculated that Halladay was either hurt or that the Jays were being forced to dump the pitcher ’s salary .
Actually , the Jays ’ motives are far less sinister .
They ’re falling out of contention .
They probably cannot afford to keep Halladay when they owe outfielders Vernon Wells and Alex Rios approximately $ 160 million combined from 2010 to ’ 14 .
And they know that Halladay would prefer to pitch for a winner anyway when he becomes a free agent after next season .
Oh , and one other thing :
The trade market is barren of quality starting pitchers , much less one who is a true difference - maker , one of the top five starters in the game .
You ca n’t blame Ricciardi for at least kicking the tires on a potential deal .
As the article notes , Halladay becomes a free agent in 2011 and will probably exit stage left anyway – so why not try to get a king ’s ransom for him now ?
FOX speculates that the Yankees , Red Sox , Phillies , Dodgers , Cubs , White Sox , Brewers , Mets , Rangers and Angels could all be in the market for Halladay , but it might be hard for New York or Boston to acquire the ace since they ’re both in the AL East with Toronto .
The Cubs might also not have enough quality farm pieces to acquire Halladay .
If the Rangers were n’t such a cheap organization , I think they would make the most sense .
They have one of the best farm systems in all of baseball and are a couple of starters away from possibly gaining the edge on the Halos in the AL West .
But owner Tom Hicks has never had the organization ’s best interest at heart , would probably not want to pay Halladay ’s salary for the next year and a half , and he ’s in the midst of trying to sell the team .
Still , maybe current president Nolan Ryan could convince Hicks and GM Jon Daniels to make a move .
The Dodgers are also intriguing because they ’re already a World Series contender as is , but Halladay would essentially put them over the top and allow them to go toe to toe with anyone in either league .
But would they be willing to give up an arm like Chad Billingsley or Clayton Kershaw as part of a package to acquire Halladay ?
That ’s doubtful .
Either way , let the Halladay trade speculation begin .

In a breakthrough that will help scientists unlock mysteries of the Sun and its impacts on Earth , an international team of scientists led by the National Center for Atmospheric Research ( NCAR ) has created the first - ever comprehensive computer model of sunspots .
The resulting visuals capture both scientific detail and remarkable beauty .
The high - resolution simulations of sunspot pairs open the way for researchers to learn more about the vast mysterious dark patches on the Sun 's surface .
Sunspots are associated with massive ejections of charged plasma that can cause geomagnetic storms and disrupt communications and navigational systems .
They also contribute to variations in overall solar output , which can affect weather on Earth and exert a subtle influence on climate patterns .
The research , by scientists at NCAR and the Max Planck Institute for Solar System Research ( MPS ) in Germany , is being published June 18 in Science Express .
" This is the first time we have a model of an entire sunspot , " says lead author Matthias Rempel , a scientist at NCAR 's High Altitude Observatory .
" If you want to understand all the drivers of Earth 's atmospheric system , you have to understand how sunspots emerge and evolve .
Our simulations will advance research into the inner workings of the Sun as well as connections between solar output and Earth 's atmosphere . "
Ever since outward flows from the center of sunspots were discovered 100 years ago , scientists have worked toward explaining the complex structure of sunspots , whose number peaks and wanes during the 11 - year solar cycle .
Sunspots encompass intense magnetic activity that is associated with solar flares and massive ejections of plasma that can buffet Earth 's atmosphere .
The resulting damage to power grids , satellites , and other sensitive technological systems takes an economic toll on a rising number of industries .
Creating such detailed simulations would not have been possible even as recently as a few years ago , before the latest generation of supercomputers and a growing array of instruments to observe the Sun .
The model enables scientists to capture the convective flow and movement of energy that underlie the sunspots , which is not directly detectable by instruments .

The work was supported by the National Science Foundation , NCAR 's sponsor .
The research team improved a computer model , developed at MPS , that built upon numerical codes for magnetized fluids that had been created at the University of Chicago .
Computer model provides a unified physical explanation
The new simulations capture pairs of sunspots with opposite polarity .
In striking detail , they reveal the dark central region , or umbra , with brighter umbral dots , as well as webs of elongated narrow filaments with flows of mass streaming away from the spots in the outer penumbral regions .
The model suggests that the magnetic fields within sunspots need to be inclined in certain directions in order to create such complex structures .
The authors conclude that there is a unified physical explanation for the structure of sunspots in umbra and penumbra that is the consequence of convection in a magnetic field with varying properties .
The simulations can help scientists decipher the mysterious , subsurface forces in the Sun that cause sunspots .
Such work may lead to an improved understanding of variations in solar output and their impacts on Earth .

Supercomputing at 76 trillion calculations per second
To create the model , the research team designed a virtual , three - dimensional domain that simulates an area on the Sun measuring about 31,000 miles by 62,000 miles and about 3,700 miles in depth - an expanse as long as eight times Earth 's diameter and as deep as Earth 's radius .
The scientists then used a series of equations involving fundamental physical laws of energy transfer , fluid dynamics , magnetic induction and feedback , and other phenomena to simulate sunspot dynamics at 1.8 billion points within the virtual expanse , each spaced about 10 to 20 miles apart .
For weeks , they solved the equations on NCAR 's new bluefire supercomputer , an IBM machine that can perform 76 trillion calculations per second .
The work drew on increasingly detailed observations from a network of ground - and space - based instruments to verify that the model captured sunspots realistically .
The new model is far more detailed and realistic than previous simulations that failed to capture the complexities of the outer penumbral region .
The researchers noted , however , that even their new model does not accurately capture the lengths of the filaments in parts of the penumbra .
They can refine the model by placing the grid points even closer together , but that would require more computing power than is currently available .
" Advances in supercomputing power are enabling us to close in on some of the most fundamental processes of the Sun , " says Michael Knoelker , director of NCAR 's High Altitude Observatory and a co-author of the paper .
" With this breakthrough simulation , an overall comprehensive physical picture is emerging for everything that observers have associated with the appearance , formation , dynamics , and the decay of sunspots on the Sun 's surface . "

Uyghur youths now under official Chinese protection describe the deadly clash in Guangdong that sparked the July 5 protests and riots .
HONG KONG — Three youths belonging to the mostly Muslim Uyghur ethnic group and now under Chinese government protection after ethnic clashes in the southern province of Guangdong said fighting began when Han Chinese laborers stormed the dormitories of Uyghur colleagues , beating them with clubs , bars , and machetes .
The deadly fighting between Turkic - speaking , Muslim Uyghurs and Han Chinese at the Lacewood toy factory in Guangdong 's Shaoguan city began late June 25 and lasted into the early hours of the following day .
Authorities said two people died and 118 were injured in the clashes , which were sparked by an online report that Uyghur migrant workers at the factory had raped two Chinese women .
A Chinese man is now detained for " forging " that report .
Excerpts of interviews with the three men , conducted on a single , hidden cell phone , follow .
All spoke on condition of anonymity , and while their accounts cannot be independently verified , they are consistent :
Uyghur Man 1 : Who are you ?
RFA : Radio Free Asia 's Uyghur service .
We broadcast in the Uyghur language .
Uyghur Man 1 : We do not have any freedom here .
If they hear us talking on the phone , they will punish us .
RFA : Where were you when the brawl happened ?
Uyghur Man 1 : We were taking our meal break after the night shift , when the day shifters [ Uyghurs ] were sleeping in their dorms .
We saw them [ Han Chinese ] storm into their dorms , pull them out from their beds , and start beating them , hacking and burning .
RFA : What time was it when this happened ?
Uyghur Man 1 : It was around 12:30 a.m. or 1 a.m .
RFA : How many people stormed in ?
Uyghur Man 1 : Thousands of Chinese , and 800 Uyghurs were there .
RFA : How do you know there were thousands ?
Uyghur Man 1 : This factory is very big .
RFA :... Chinese workers attacked you ?
Uyghur Man 1 : Yes , as long as Uyghurs were around , they attacked us .
RFA : Everyone including female workers attacked you , or only male workers ?
Uyghur Man 1 : The females , too , were against us , and they were throwing things at us from the tops of buildings .
RFA : Apart from factory workers , were there any members of gangs from outside among the attackers ?...
Uyghur Man 1 : Yes .
RFA : How many of them were there ?
Uyghur Man 1 : It was dark , so we could not tell how many .
RFA : How did they attack ?
Did they just storm into the dorms or did they gather you somewhere ?
Uyghur Man 1 : When the first floor dorms were attacked , we , the night - shifters who were eating on the second floor , escaped .
RFA : So , only night - shifters who were out eating escaped , and those inside were attacked ?
Uyghur Man 1 : Yes .
RFA : How many night - shifters were there ?
Uyghur Man 1 : More than 200 people .
RFA : So , 200 of you escaped .
Uyghur Man 1 : Yes .
RFA : Were you aware of what happened to those inside ?
Uyghur Man 1 : We were not given details .
They simply told us that they were in the hospital receiving treatment .
RFA : So you did not see the brawl with your own eyes , correct ?
Uyghur Man 1 : Yes , we saw it .
RFA : Can you describe it ?
What did you see , for example ?
Uyghur Man 1 : I will tell you .
It has been eight days since we have been forbidden from leaving .
RFA : How many of you are there ?
Uyghur Man 1 : More than 400 people are here .
RFA : All them escaped ?
Uyghur Man 1 : There are those who escaped and those who were moved from the site .
We were put here and told that they were protecting us .
They are feeding us rice .
RFA : There are 400 people there right now , correct ?
Uyghur Man 1 : Yes , we are the ones who escaped with few injuries .
RFA : Did you guys respond to the attack ?
Did you fight back ?
Uyghur Man 1 : If they had spit , we would have drowned .
RFA : So there were very many people ?
Uyghur Man 1 : Yes .
We were empty - handed .
They had bats , bars , clubs , cudgels , machetes , kitchen knives , and axes .
RFA : Can you describe your mental state now ?
Uyghur Man 1 : Our spirits are very low .
We demanded to be allowed to return home .
They did not allow us .
RFA : Let ’s talk about those who died in the attack .
Authorities say there were only two dead and 89 injured .
Is it possible that there were so few casualties ?
Uyghur Man 1 : It is impossible .
RFA : Why do you say it is impossible ?
Uyghur Man 1 : I can not say for sure , but we saw that ambulances were blocked .
The injured inside [ the ambulances ] were also pulled out and stepped on , beaten .
We were spared because we escaped to the mountains .
I believe there are many dead .
The injured also were numerous .
It was merciless .
We are Muslims .
We do not shed blood nor take lives , is n’t that so ?
Our religion forbids this .
But they were heartless .
RFA : We have heard that Uyghur girls were raped in the attack .
Do you know about this ?
Uyghur Man 1 : We have heard so , but we did not see it .
At least , I did not see it .
I do not know if others saw it .
RFA : Are there any girls among the 400 people there ?
Uyghur Man 1 : Yes , there are girls .
RFA : Why were you forbidden from leaving the hotel for the past eight days ?
Uyghur Man 1 : Because if there is a Uyghur [ on the streets ] , the Chinese will chase you , slash and kill you .
The government is protecting us .
RFA : Who is outside protecting you ?
Uyghur Man 1 : The police .
RFA : If you were in the mountains , how did they bring you to the hotel ?
Uyghur Man 1 : When we were hiding in the mountains , military units from Shaoguan city came and stopped the beating .
Then we came here with them .
RFA : How long did the brawl last ?
Uyghur Man 1 : It started between 12:30 a.m. and 1 a.m. , stopping near dawn .
At dawn , we were in [ the military ] vehicle .
RFA : What do you think happened to the other 600 Uyghurs who were left in the factory ?
Uyghur Man 1 : Perhaps more than half of them are OK , but the others are not .
Uyghur Man 1 : Do you know the exact number of dead ?
Uyghur Man 1 : How can we know since we are [ being held ] here ?
RFA : If there are 400 people there , where are the rest of you ?
Do you know where the rest are located ?
Uyghur Man 1 : There is no way we can know .
RFA : There is a report that Uyghurs girls also died .
Do you know about this ?
Uyghur Man 1 : We have heard about it , but since we did not see it with our own eyes , we can not be sure .
RFA : Do you know the cause of the attack ?
We have heard that it was because Uyghur men raped Chinese women , and then the Chinese attacked Uyghurs to take revenge .
Is that true ?
Did you find out the reason for the fighting ?
Uyghur Man 1 : The rape allegation was false .
Forged .
I can only assume that because there were more injured on the Uyghur side .
They said this to hold us responsible for what happened .
RFA : Then what do you think was the real cause of the attack ?
Uyghur Man 1 : Ethnic discrimination .
RFA : We have heard reports that Uyghur men were separated from Uyghur women in the workplace , and that they were assigned to different assembly lines .
There , the Uyghur girls were sexually harassed and were asked to give massages to Chinese co-workers .
Is this is true ?
Were there any incidents of Uyghur women being harrassed or abused there ?
Uyghur Man 1 : I have heard of it , but I did not see it .
RFA : Did the police come to suppress the fighting ?
If they did , when did they come ?
Uyghur Man 1 : They came at the end , when the fighting was almost over .
They came at dawn — around 5 a.m....
Around 20 or 30 of them came before then .
RFA : You are saying that they were unable to stop the attack ?
Uyghur Man 1 : No , let me put it this way .
They are all Chinese , right ?
I think you can understand even if I do not say the rest .
Then , the armed police arrived with big trucks .
At that point it was stopped .
RFA : When they stopped the brawl , did they beat you as well , or protect you ?
Uyghur Man 1 : They just stopped it .
At the time we were escaping outside by breaking through a wire fence .
We were not there .
RFA : What about the ones who were left inside ?
Uyghur Man 1 : The rest ?
They were beaten up by the Chinese , wherever they were taken by them .
RFA : It seems the government did not make any serious move to stop the clash — is that true ?
Uyghur Man 1 : That is right .
They did not stop it in time .
RFA : Is that so ?
Uyghur Man 1 : Yes , then [ the clash ] became big .
RFA : Can I talk with someone who was inside ?
Uyghur Man 1 : Sure , here is someone to speak with .
RFA : You were inside when this attack happened ?
Uyghur Man 2 : Yes , I was there .
RFA : What did you see ?
Can you describe the scene ?
Uyghur Man 2 : It was dreadful .
RFA : In what way ?
Uyghur Man 2 : The Chinese stormed our dorms and started beating us up .
RFA : Can you describe how they beat you ?
Uyghur Man 2 : When they beat us they had machetes and other weapons in their hands .
RFA : Did they beat you one by one or as a group ?
Uyghur Man 2 : They just came together and beat us .
RFA : What were you feeling at that time ?
Uyghur Man 2 : We thought we were doomed .
RFA : Did you fight back , or did you not have any chance to do so ?
Uyghur Man 2 : We did not have any chance to fight back .
RFA : They were saying there are some Chinese injured as well .
Do you know how they were injured ?
Uyghur Man 2 : At the beginning were in the dorms .
Some of us are wanted to break through their circle and had to fight to escape to the mountains .
That is how the Chinese might have been injured .
I will now hand the phone to a guy who was injured at the scene .
RFA : OK .
Where were you injured in the brawl ?
Uyghur Man 3 : Above my right eye and eyebrow .
I got eight stitches .
It was all opened and my skull was exposed .
RFA : What was used to hit you on the head ?
Uyghur Man 3 : A steel bar ...
When they chased me , I climbed up to the roof .
I had to run upstairs .
When I was escaping on the fifth floor , six of them came and started to beat me .
When I fell , one of them hit me in the head ...
When I fell down , they hit me .
Then I got up and ran away .
RFA : Where did you go then ?
Uyghur Man 3 : I ran outside , away from the fighting , and hid myself somewhere .
RFA : You are injured .
Why are n't you in the hospital ?
Uyghur Man 3 : I went to the hospital .
Right now I am resting here .
RFA : Which hospital did you go to ?
Uyghur Man 3 : I do n't know exactly .
RFA : Are there many injured ?
Uyghur Man 3 : Yes , there are a lot of injured people .
But the government did not ask us about our injuries , what kind of compensation we need , or the cause of the injuries .
We were just talking to each other about it and went by ourselves to treat the injuries .
Nobody from their side asked us what had happened to us or the reason for our injuries .
RFA : How many injured Uyghurs did you see at the hospital ?
Uyghur Man 3 : They separated us when they took us to the hospital , so I am unsure .
RFA : How many people attacked the Uyghurs ?
Uyghur Man 3 : I think there are currently more than 6,000 Chinese workers at the company and there were gang members from outside as well .
That is for sure .
For that we do not have eyewitnesses at the moment , but it is clear that they injured the gatekeepers at the company and stormed into the factory .
That is for sure .
Even though we do not have any eyewitnesses , every one of us knows that gangs brought machetes and other weapons to hurt us .
RFA : What do you think was the cause of the fighting ?
Uyghur Man 3 : I do not want to talk about it .

The Man who tricked Al Capone and sold the Eiffel Tower ... twice !
Published on 10/30/2007
Victor Lustig was born in 1890 in what is now the Czech Republic .
As a youngster he studied languages .
He also studied people : their habits , mannerisms , and especially their weaknesses , and decided to do something in that field instead .
By the age of twenty he was a confirmed conman .
By the age of thirty he was a confirmed wanted man on the run from police in several European countries .
He started over again in the United States and called himself ' Count ' because it sounded important .
One dupe he conned was Al Capone ; the most dangerous criminal in America at that time .
The Count knew that the crime lord could n't be taken in like the others ; he would get revenge .
Lustig devised something different for the underworld boss .
The count asked Capone to invest $ 50,000 in a swindle that he claimed he was working on .
Lustig promised to double his money in sixty days .
The homicidal Capone gave the cash - and a warning of what would happen to Lustig if there was a double - cross .
Lustig let the money sit in the bank for sixty days .
At the end of that time he went back to Capone with a look of disappointment .
He told his investor that the deal feel through .
Just before Capone was about to explode , Lustig handed back the $ 50,000 .
The crime boss was so impressed with Lustig 's honesty (?! ) that he rewarded the conman with a thousand dollars .
Which is what Lustig expected Capone to do !
In 1925 Lustig was back in Paris with his new friend Dapper Dan , relaxing at an outside cafe .
They were in need of money just as they read in the newspaper that the Eiffel Tower was in need of repairs .
While others said what was really needed was to tear down the 985 foot structure .
Almost immediately the Count thought up a scheme ; he would sell Paris ' most famous landmark to a scrap metal dealer .
He gave himself the title ' Deputy Director - General of the Ministry of Mail and Telegraphs ' .
Dapper Dan would be his secretary .
They typed - up letters with Lustig 's title printed on them and mailed them out to the five leading scrap metals dealers in Paris .
They were asked to come meet with Lustig and his secretary at their room in the fashionable Hotel Crillon .
The buyers were told that it had become too costly to repair the Eiffel Tower and that the 7,000 ton steel structure would be sold to the highest bidder to be torn down .
They were also told to keep the meeting secret ; if the public found out too soon there would be an outcry .
The secret bids meant nothing to Lustig .
He talked to each client and picked out the man most likely to fall for the scam ; the one who seemed most anxious to get ahead .
A week later the chosen victim , Monsieur Poisson , showed up at Lustig 's place .
He was handed a phony contract that stated that he owned the Eiffel Tower while Lustig was handed a real check .
The Count and Dapper Dan quickly cashed their earnings and just as quickly fled France for Austria .
Lustig never did say how much he got paid for France 's top tourist attraction .
Resting in Vienna they scanned the newspapers to see if Poisson went to the police ; he did n't .
Poisson was too embarrassed to tell anyone what happened .
After a month 's vacation Lustig and Dapper Dan decided to do it again .
This time they used the same techniques but with different results .
The scrap metal dealer who was fleeced reported his loss of $ 100,000 to the police .
Once again the Count fled to America .
This time on America , the law caught up with Lustig when he tried to pass off counterfeit dollars .
In 1935 he was sentenced to twenty years in Alcatraz prison where he died from pneumonia in 1947 .
While in prison he was protected from harm by orders from another prisoner ...
Al Capone .

We 've already covered the new Cowboys Stadium 's opulent luxury , from the $ 40 million scoreboard to the $ 60 pizzas .
How about $ 75 seats where you can only see one - third of the playing field ?
Thank you , Jerry Jones for all your blessings !
GeekBrief.tv posted this longer video about the giant punt - blocking HDTV hanging over the field , but in the course of their visit they also discovered something special — the worst stadium seats imaginable .
One is literally behind a cement column .
The other sits up against a cement wall that obstructs all of the stadium except for one red zone .
I 'm not sure which exact seat this is , but there does n't seem to be any indication on Ticketmaster that obstructed view seats are available or that they are any cheaper than the lowest listed price of $ 75 .
( $ 59 as part of a season ticket package . )
The standing - room only morons get a better deal than that , but at least you get a chair .

How bad are these seats ?
You are in the same room with the world 's largest video screen , a massive 160 - by - 90 - foot egoriffic TV built specifically to give fans in the cheap seats a visual reminder that they are actually attending a football game ... and you can't even see that .
Unless you 've recently had your neck elongated , you are better off watching at home .

So when broadcasters are boasting every Sunday about the 100,000 maniacs feeding the Jerry Jones wishing machine , do you think they will mention the 35,000 ( plus two ! ) fans who are paying money to not watch a football game with their own eyes ?
Please , sir , may we have some more ?

Of course , I do n't expect you to do all this arithmetic yourself .
That 's what computers are for .
If we substract this value from each of the original Y's , then we are effectively dropping the first term from the equation .
If we run through the whole process again , this should find us the second term .
Etc .
Thinking backwards , then , we see that when we reach a constant , the column number must be the highest power in the original equation .
Each time we take a derivative , we multiply by the exponent , so if we take derivatives all the way to a constant , we will have multiplied by all the integers from 1 to the original power , that is , by the power factorial .
So when we get to a constant row , we know that the first term in the original equation must have been this constant times x to the column power divided by that power factorial , that is , if k is the constant and p is the column number , the first term must have been ( k / p ! ) x p .
In this example , the final column would be column 3 which would contain all 12's .
We get ( 12 / 3 ! ) x 3 = ( 12 / 6 ) x 3 = 2 x 3 .
Which indeed is the first term .
So for example , suppose the equation is y=2 x 3 + 3 x - 7 .
( Of course the whole point is that we do n't know that initially , but let 's suppose that 's what it is . )
So as we take successive differences , we get :
When you continue taking differences until you get a constant , this is the equivalent of taking derivatives until you get to a constant function .
When we take the difference between pairs of values , we are , in effect , finding the derivative .
You may note that the value you get is the derivative at some value in between the two values where you took the difference .
That is , when you take the difference between the Y values corresponding to X values of , say , 2 and 3 , you get the derivative at some X between 2 and 3 .
Not necessarily 2.5 , but between 2 and 3 .
While I have n't constructed a formal mathematical proof that this works , the principle is simple if you know a little calculus .
I 've tinkered with setting a margin of error , for example , differences less than .001 are considered insignificant , and then averaging the numbers together to go to the next step .
I have n't found any solution better than trial and error for selecting the margin of error .
If the next table does not end in fewer columns than the previous , then the margin of error was not correctly chosen .
Perhaps there is something more rigorous one could do here ; I have n't pursued it .
In the above discussion I 've been assuming that all numbers were exact .
For a math problem , this would normally be the case .
But if you 've gotten a set of numbers from real - world measurements , there is probably some margin of error on your measurements .
In this case , you run into an additional problem :
If two numbers look close , are they equal within some margin of error ?
Or are they really different ?
And if you do consider them equal , what value do you use when you proceed to the next step ?
So if you want to be obnoxious , the next time you are given a quiz of " find the next number in the series " problems , just pick any number you like and fill it in , and you 'll be completely correct .
You 'll probably get a failing grade on the test , but you can enjoy the smug satisfaction of knowing you were right .
Note this also illustrates the fact that any problem asking " what 's the next number in this sequence " has an infinite number of possible answers .
If someone gives you the sequence , say , " 1 , 4 , 9 , 16 " , you could run them through the above process and get the answer that the person is probably looking for : the rule is n 2 so the next value is 25 .
But you could also invent any number as the next number in the sequence , say 42 , and come up with a rule for " 1 , 4 , 9 , 16 , 42 " .
Feel free to work it out .
It comes out to :
As I noted earlier , a table is complete when all the values in a column are the same .
If you come to a single value in a column , then it is the same as itself , and the table is complete .
Mathematically , this is a perfectly valid solution .
But if this happens , it should introduce some doubt into your mind .
Do the numbers really follow some pattern , or am I just coming up with a formula to fit a set of random numbers ?
It is , after all , possible to come up with a formula for any set of numbers .
The fact that this technique works should demonstrate that : pick any set of numbers , run them through this method , and you will get a formula to describe them .
If you get to a column with two or three numbers the same , this is a good indication that there really is a pattern described by this formula .
You would be unlikely to get such a result by chance .
And we see that the answer is the near - mythical value , 42 .
To find the next value in the table is now simply a matter of plugging 6 into the formula :
Once we get a table that is complete in the zero column , we are done .
So now we put all these terms together to get the full equation :
( Recall that any number to the zero power is simply one , and can be dropped from the expression . )
This is simple , of course , because column 0 already contains all the same value , so we are quickly done .
We build a new table with these values and go through the whole process again :
Again we plug the successive integers into this term and subtract from the starting values .
Note we subtract with the values that we started with on this table -- we do n't go back to the original values .
Note that we are subtracting a negative , which is the same as adding a positive .
Note that this table was completed in fewer columns than the first table .
That is , the first table ended with column 3 , while this table ended with column 2 .
Every table must end with fewer columns than the previous table .
If that does n't happen , you have made an arithmetic mistake .
( Otherwise you could get two n 3 terms or whatever , which does n't make sense . )
Now we go through the same process as we did for the first table .
We create a new table from these values , calling these our new column 0 .
Like so :
We started with value # 1 was 2 .
So we plug 1 into n 3 = 1 3 = 1 , then subtract this from 2 , 2 - 1 = 1 .
Now we evaluate this term for 1 , 2 , 3 , and so on , and subtract each result from the corresponding starting value .
We are now ready to construct the first term of the polynomial .
The column number where we stopped is the power of n .
In this case we stopped at column 3 , so the first term involves n 3 .
We multiply this by the value in the column divided by the factorial of the column number .
( A " factorial " is the product of all the integers from 1 to that number .
For example , 5 factorial -- which is written " 5 ! " -- is 5 x 4 x 3 x 2 x 1 = 120 . )
The value in this column is 6 and 3 ! is 6 , so our first term is :
What happens , you may ask , if we never reach a point where all the numbers in a column are the same ?
Simple : sooner or later we will get to the point where there is only one number in the column .
As this number must always be the same as itself , then we are done .
More on this later .
We continue making new columns in this way until all the values in a column are the same .
In this case , that just takes one more column .
Now we make a column 2 by taking the differences between the values in column 1 , like so :
We number the column with the original values " 0 " .
We then create a column 1 , where each value is the difference between each pair of values in column 0 .
Always take the lower number minus the upper number .
That is , we first compare the first two numbers : 2 and 8 . 8 - 2 = 6 , so we write 6 to the right of and somewhat between 2 and 8 .
Then we compare the third number , 9 , to the second number 8 .
9 - 8 = 1 .
We proceed down the column this way , like so :
The first step is to arrange them in a column .
To the left of this column we write an ascending list of counting numbers , like this :
To explain my technique , let 's work through an example .
Suppose you are given the following series of numbers and want to find a formula for them , and then compute the next number in the sequence .
A mathematically astute person might immediately object that what I am saying is impossible , that there is no " one formula " that fits any given set of numbers .
This is quite true .
What this technique finds is the simplest polynomial that fits the numbers .
A polynomial is an equation in the form
Disclaimer :
While I developed this technique myself , the mathematics behind it is simple enough that I would not be in the least surprised to learn that someone else invented it before me .
If anyone reading this is aware of this or a similar technique being published elsewhere , I 'd be interested to here about it .
Perhaps you have seen one of those math problems that says , " What 's the next number in this series : 2 , 6 , 12 , 20 , ... " .
Or in the real world , scientists and engineers routinely find a set of numbers through experiments and would then like to find a formula that fits these numbers .
A few years ago I developed a simple ( though admittedly sometimes tedious ) technique for finding a formula to fit a set of numbers .

Thanks for your excellent article at http://www.johansens.us/sane/technotes/formula.htm
I could n't really understand why this works .. but I could follow through your argument and solve for any future such cases .
For your reference , I also happen to see a very concise and sweet method in here ..
http://www.teachers.ash.org.au/mikemath/numseqfindiff/note2.pdf
which works nicely and to the point .
The method is certainly similar to users , and again I could n't really understand the theory behind why it works .
Thanks & Regards

It would be easy enough to increase the number of input fields on the screen .
The logic would be the same .
But 15 seems like a very large number .
This program finds the simplest polynomial formula that will generate the set of numbers that you give .
That is , formulas in the form a + b x + c x2 + dx3 + e x4 ... ( Where x2 means " x squared " , x3 means " x cubed " , etc .
No superscripts in text email . )
The highest exponent term it can generate is one less than the number of values you entered .
That is , if you enter 10 values , it could come up with a formula going up to x to the 9th power .
With 15 values , it can go up to x to the 14th power .
If the set of numbers you give really requires a polynomial going up to the 14th power , well , I guess it depends what you 're doing , but that 's a very complicated formula .
If , say , you 're using numbers from a physics experiment and trying to find a formula to relate them , the odds are that the real formula does n't go to the 14th power .
This program does n't allow for experimental error , it expects all numbers to be exact .
Maybe some day I 'll make a version that lets you enter some sort of margin for experimental error .
Anyway , my point is , try entering the first 15 numbers from your set and see what formula you get .
If it really goes up to the 14th power , you probably have a set of numbers that cannot be described by a polynomial .
They may be describable by some other sort of formula , a logarithm or trig function or some such .
Or they may be just a bunch of random numbers .

Sir , I am writing from Cameroon .
I write to appreciate your effort of developing a very good program , How to Find formula for a set of Numbers .
For I have been searching for such a program until this day that I found this one .
But Sir , you limited the program for whole numbers and fractions formula to only 15 numbers .
That means only the formula for 15 numbers and not more can be obtained after clicking on poly me Sir , I also write to inquire if you have any latest update for the program especially with regard to finding the formula for more than 18 numbers or so or between 18 to 25 numbers .
Thanks

I googled and found your site tonight for solving a sequence .
I had a table with 4 sets of numbers , x and y , with x values starting with 1 and ending with 4 .
Your method helped me find the formula , which was a 3rd degree polynomial , not fun .
Well , I think I have seen this method before .
Have you been told any other sources for it ?
I have taken History of Mathematics .
Maybe it was in that class .
But your method saved the day - it was the only one that showed up in the search engine .
I was helping a poor College Algebra student who was given the table and asked whether it was proportional .
We should have just plotted it to see that it was n't linear ( and / or did n't go through the origin ) .
But I got stubborn and had to find the formula .
It was a good exercise .
Thank you for posting it .
Have a nice weekend .

I really need to update my page .
It turns out that this technique was invented by a little - known mathematician named Isaac Newton .
I guess if you 're going to come in second to someone , Isaac Newton is n't a bad person for it to be .
Also , he did n't create a web page to implement it . :-)
Nick Aug 7 , 2011
Well , I guess you are in good company .
You should create an algorithm for data analysis .
Just tweak the web page code to analyze data for signals ( formulas ) .
That awesome technique has to have some commercial / scientific application .
I might write some C++ code for the technique .
Chris Sep 6 , 2011
I found your site and have found it immensely helpful with a project i have been working on for a while .
It is essentially the same formula program you have made , except its designed to analyse multiple columns of data to get the equation , similar to BACON1 .
The version im working on is also designed to calculate it in terms of other mathematical functions ( such as sin , mod , log , sqrt , etc ) .
I was wondering if you would be willing to give me a hand with it or any resources i could use for aid .
Jay Johansen Sep 8 , 2011
Expanding to other types of equations is an obvious next step .
It also seems like a fairly difficult next step .
Do you have a plan for how to do it ?
You could always do it by trial and error , i.e. have a list of functions and try each in turn until you get something that seems to work .
Off the top of my head I do n't know what you could do that would be better , but , well , there should be something .
Trial and error would make it very difficult to discover a formula like y=sin x / x + ln x - x^2 .
Curtis Sep 12 , 2011
I recently view your website regarding your systematic computation of polynomial formulas .
One issue I wanted to mention is that it incorrectly maps all functions to polynomials .
For example the function n! which is NP and cannot be mapped to a polynomial , but in your website it is mapped to a polynomial in your program .
There should be a quick check in place to see if the sequence grows at a rate faster than polynomial speed ( i.e. n^k as k -> some constant exponent value ) .
Another example is 2 ^x ...
The idea of subtracting numbers in a sequence to obtain the terms has been done many times , however your website does it quite nicely !
However , your algorithm is inefficience and I wanted to help you out but giving you a suggestion to improve your solution .
If you can " guess " the highest order term , simply by looking at the terms and seeing how each term relates to index i... you can guess the highest power this way .
Then compute f( n ) / n^highest power .
If this value approaches a constant , you have correctly guessed the highest power .
If it approaches 0 , the power you have guessed was too high ( you should guess again with a lower power ) , and if it approaches infinite the power you guessed was too low ( guess again with a higher power ) .
You can use this information to determine whether you need to revise the power you guessed or not .
MOST IMPORTANTLY , when it approaches a constant , the value that it approaches is the constant which is multiplied by the highest power ( i.e. f( n ) / n^2 ( assuming 2 is highest power ) if computing this sequence seems to approach 5 , then the first term in the function is 5n ^ 2 ) .
This is a much more efficient algorithm .
Computing this way would allow you to compute hundreds of terms instead of just 15 on your site , as long as your server speed was fast enough , which in today 's standards , is definitely not a problem .
Keep up the good work and enthusiasm !
Jay Johansen Sep 13 , 2011
Hmm , I do n't know how you can say that my algorithm " INCORRECTLY maps all functions to polynomials " .
How can you say that my mapping is incorrect ?
It derives a polynomial that generates the given set of numbers .
Consider the series 1 , 2 , 6 , 24 .
Yes , this series could be generated by the formula y=x !
This program generates the polynomial y=11/6 x^3 - 19/2 x ^2 + 50/3 x - 8 .
The first four terms of this polynomial are , in fact , 1 , 2 , 6 , 24 .
11/6 ( 1) ^3 - 19/2 ( 1 ) ^2 + 50/3 - 8 = 11/6 - 19/2 + 50/3 - 8 = ( 11 - 57 + 100 - 48 ) / 6 = 1
11/6 ( 2) ^3 - 19/2 ( 2 ) ^2 + 50/3 ( 2 ) - 8 = 88 / 6 - 76/2 + 100/3 - 8 = ( 88 - 228 + 200 - 48 ) / 6 = 2
Etc .
Both formulas generate the same set of numbers .
Therefore , both are correct solutions to the problem .
The fact that you may have come up with the sequence by using the factorial function does n't make that the " correct answer " .
There 's no way for the computer to know what you were thinking when you typed in the numbers .
Indeed , there are an infinite number of equations that could generate any given sequence .
We could also generate this sequence with
y= ( - x ^4 + 32 x ^3 + - 149 x^2 + 250 x - 120 ) / 12
Or
y = 2^x ( 2 - x ) ( x - 3 ) ( x - 4 ) / 12 + 2^x ( x - 1 ) ( x - 3 ) ( x - 4 ) / 4 + 3 cos( x - 3 ) ( x - 1 ) ( x - 2 ) ( 4 - x ) + 24 ln( x ) ( x - 1 ) ( x - 2 ) ( x - 3 ) / ln( 4 )
As I stated on the web page , " What this technique finds is the simplest polynomial that fits the numbers . "
For any given finite list of numbers , there are an infinite number of possible rules or formulas to produce that list .
For every new value added to the list , we could eliminate some of these possible formulas , but there will always be an infinite number .
I absolutely agree that an algorithm that could find trig functions and exponentials and logs and so on would be cool .
But to derive this from a finite set of values would not be possible with a determinitive algorithm , i.e. there would not be a single correct answer .
Intuitively you would want the " simplest " answer , i.e. " 3 x sin( x ) " should win over a ten - term polynomial .
But simplicity in that sense is difficult to even define mathematically , never mind implement with an algorithm .
The 15 - value limit is not imposed by the power of the computer , but was simply an arbitrary choice .
The intent when I created this web page was that it would be used with empirical data .
If it can't find the right equation with 15 terms , the odds are that what you are looking for is not a polynomial , but a trig or log or some other formula .
Anyway , thanks for the comments .
Curtis Sep 14 , 2011
That is a great explanation and definitely makes sense .
I was rude and tactless to say " incorrectly , " and also the lack in clarity is on my part .
My meaning in saying incorrectly , is that such a deterministic approach lends itself only to polynomial solutions .
IT IS possible to fix this and it is not difficult .
If you compute the solution using the method of dividing by the greatest power , than you will have the speed to compute two functions and compare them to find which one is " simpler " i.e. less terms .
The first function is a polynomial guess ( which you can compute efficiently using the method in the last email ) and the second function is a NP guess of fairly simplistic forms such as a^x or n!.
Here is how to write the function for NP guesses .
To find 2^x functions and factorial functions , the trick is to simply try dividing by f( n - 1 ) for all functions which grow faster than polynomial time .
That will do the trick .
Dividing by f( n - 1 ) maps n! to n and a^x to a allowing you to get a quick clear solution which you can output extremely efficiently .
By comparing this solution with the polynomial solution , you can output whichever has least terms with a very quick comparison .
My reason for suggesting that what you have is incorrect is based on the following .
If a user inputs 2 4 8 16 32 64 128 256 512 .... up to the 15th digit , and you output a 16 term polynomial , I can't find any good argument to say that anyone realistic person would suggest that a 16 term polynomial solution is any good to them .
Relative to a simple output of 2^x , it is of no value .
I agree completely that you can find infinite functions which fit discrete values , NO ONE will dispute that point .
But we all know a basic intuition of why we write programs ... we write them to be useful , to aid us , and to solve problems .
An extremely long polynomial solves the problem for a machine , but as humans , it is not useful and it does not aid us when a solution such as 2^x exists and can be obtained extremely quickly simply by checking the case when f( n ) / f( n - 1 ) and taking the limit as n-> infinite .
When someone enters 15 digits they are generally suggesting a pattern for a well described function , not simply an exuberant polynomial which somehow fits the digits .
Its all about the point of the writing the program in the first place .
If its point is just to map all discrete sets to polynomials than it is perfect .
You just asked those with suggestions to comment , and I wanted to help you out by showing you a very quick adjustment that would make it cover a much greater range of functions , be more versatile , become more efficient and faster , and in the case of NP problems , give the correct answer .
Your website is awesome .
I would n't take the time to write this if you did n't have my respect .
Vanderhoof Oct 31 , 2011
I am writing you today in reference to an article you wrote , " How to Find a Formula for a Set of Numbers " .
I was intrigued by the idea of formulating a polynomial from a table of values and was very pleased to see that you had developed a method for this .
I noticed , however , that you had not written a mathematical proof at the time ( as you stated on the webpage ) and I was wondering if you had written one since then or if you had been informed as to whether or not anyone else had written one .
I am currently involved in the mathematics education department at the University of Central Florida and , since I plan on sharing this technique with my colleagues , I would love to have a proof to share as well ( if available ) .
Thank you for your time and I look forward to hearing from you .
Jay Johansen Nov 1 , 2011
I 'm told that my technique is essentially the same as one developed by Isaac Newton , which is called his " method of differences " or " method of divided differences " .
I just have n't had the time to investigate this but frankly I would have been surprised if someone had n't figured out this basic technique before me : it 's pretty obvious .
( Bummer !
Newton beat me by only 300 years ! )
In any case , the concept behind it is this :
When you take the difference between " adjacent " values , you are finding delta-y for delta-x = 1 for a series of x values .
You are in effect finding the derivative .
For example , say the function is actually x ^2 +
1 . ( The whole idea is that we do n't know this starting out , but let 's assume this for purposes of discussion . )
So our initial table would look like this :
x f(x )
1 2
2 5
3 10
4 17
Now we find the differences
x f(x ) f'( x ) f'' ( x )
1 2
3
2 5 2
5
3 10 2
7
4 17
The f'(x ) of itself is n't much use , because we do n't know what the x values are .
We know that f'(x ) is 3 for some value of x between 1 and 2 , but we do n't know what value .
( In this case it 's halfway between , 1.5 , but in general it 's not that simple . )
But when we get the f'' ( x ) column , the f'' value is constant , so it does n't matter what x is , it applies to all x .
So now we know that f'' ( x ) =
2 . From this we can deduce that f'(x ) =2x+C1 and f( x ) =x ^2 + C1*x + C2 .
In general if the constant term ends up as some value n , and the constant is in column p , then the high - order term is n/p! * x^p .
If we subtract x^2 from each f( x ) value , we can then run through the same procedure to find C1 .
Then we do it all again to find C2 .
I realize this is a long way from a formal mathematical proof , but that was the concept .
I must admit that I 'm just not quite sure how to get from where I am to a real proof .
I 've never really sat down to try to work it out .
I'm a computer geek and not a mathematician , so I was approaching this from more of an engineering perspective : I did n't need a formal mathematical proof , just some logic that sounds plausible and that works when I try it with a variety of data .
Sure , this kind of thinking often gets non-mathematicians into trouble : without a formal proof , you can't be sure that it works 100 % of the time .
There may be special cases .
Or for that matter the cases you tried may turn out to be the small number of special cases where it works .
Hmm , just thinking about it now , it occurs to me that the casual thinking I 've done about it so far has been trying to go from the differences to the polynomial .
But it occurs to me that a more productive approach is probably to go from the polynomial to the differences .
That is , if the high order term is ax^n , then we can readily demonstrate that the n-th derivative of f is a*n ! .
So all that remains to prove is that the n-th column of differences are equal to the constant term of the n-th derivative .
If I just worked on this a little I might come up with an actual proof .
Chris Nov 13 , 2011
I was n't quite sure .
I was thinking of having a set of functions to test in sequence ( of all available data ) in each possible format .
There would be constants that can be adjusted later , but this stage is designed to try and discover the function for the change , then after , the constants can be adjusted to get it to line up .
It sort of is trial and error , but if a list of suitable tester functions for each element could be assembled , id imagine it could get quite close , maybe find multiple equations for the same outcomes .
I recon it would be very similar to the keplar program .
Ashley Feb 10 , 2012
I like your website , it 's informative .
I also tried to use the sequence program and got a huge string of numbers .
Maybe you could help me decipher them ?
Okay so I typed in a string of ' random ' numbers and this is what I got ( was just looking for the next in the sequence ) :

Jay Johansen Feb 11 , 2012
If you type in random numbers , you 'll get essentially random output .
Assuming the program is working this function should generate the sequence of numbers you gave .
Verifying it would be a pain .
You might try it with shorter , more carefully chosen set of numbers .
Like put in 1 , 4 , 9 , 16 and see if it says this is x ^2 , etc .
Ashley Feb 14 , 2012
Well , I took the sequence of numbers from a random number generator .
Seeing how its a computer function i thought it could n't actually be random .
I guessed using your program could maybe show the pattern ?
Apparently not .
Is it possible to figure out how numbers are selected through a random number generator using a produced string of numbers ?
Just curious .
Jay Johansen Feb 14 , 2012
My " function finder " would n't uncover the algorithm behind any computer random number generator that I know .
My function finds polynomials , and computer random number functions tend to use recursive functions and twiddle bits , which would obscure any polynomial .
Yes , it is true that computer random numbers are not random in the same sense that a die roll is random .
They are often called " pseudo - random " .
Are you wondering how computer random number functions work in general , or how one works in particular ?
If the former :
The random number function used by Java is pretty typical .
Each random number is generated from the previous random number .
It takes the previous number , multiplies by 25214903917 and adds 11 .
Then it calls another function that I do n't have the source code for but I think it 's just preventing getting the same number twice in a row .
Each request for a random number specifies how many binary digits it wants , so it peels off the first however - many digits and that 's what it returns .
Then this number ( the full number , not the peeled - off digits ) is saved to use the next time around .
To get the first number , when you have no " previous " , the calling program can set a value .
Programmers sometimes do this when testing so they can get the same series of numbers for each test .
Normally , though , it uses the number of nanoseconds from the current time as the starting value .
I just noticed that Java carefully adds 1 to this each time you create a new random - number sequence , so if you create two random number sequences within one nanosecond they 'll get different starting values .

I am contacting you regarding your method of calculating differences between polynomial terms as I too have done work on this area , though with a different approach and not as in depth .
I , also was not able to find any demonstration of this work in other places , though would be highly interested in finding out if you find some professional work on this topic .
I am currently a high school equivalent student to give you some perspective .
I think a formal would proof would be showing that the nth derivative of x^n simplifies to x ! , try it for yourself .
Interestingly this may , with a little adapation , work for non integer n by means of an infinite series , [ note to self gamma function ? ] .
Your blog has just given me a little eureka moment !
Thanks for the entertaining article , and please contact me if you find a more in depth explanation of this , though I fear it may be too simplistic to be considered in great depth .

I remember learning this formula from a math club instructor back in high school .
Then I forgot it and I needed it to solve a problem in one of my classes .
I gave up on finding the formula and then today I stumbled across your website where you said you derived this yourself and you were interested in knowing if anyone else had either so I guess I 'm just emailing you to say thanks for putting that up and that I have seen it before and it's probably my favorite mathematical trick so .... thanks again !!
Ed Feb 1 , 2013
Thanks for posting this .
I am considering the use of your Formula Generator for an certain application where the numbers inputted represent specific incremental bioenergetic microfrequencies - representative of disorder in a chaotic system .
My query :
I am trying to understand how the formula derived might be understood to represent a harmonic relationship between the individual numbers of increasing values .
Should such a relationship be conceivable as such .
I am also interested in knowing which process , or variable , would bring the established formula to zero ( theoretically neutralizing the entropy represented by the values )
I am obviously attempting to find a numeric value which stabilizes the disorder .
Your thoughts are very much appreciated .
Many thanks for your time ,
Jay Johansen Feb 2 , 2013
Short answer :
This program will find the simplest POLYNOMIAL which generates the given set of data .
I do n't want to overstate what it does .
If the " true " formula is a harmonic or trigonometric or some such , this program wo n't generate n^ - 1 or sin n terms -- it will still generate a polynomial , the polynomial that gives the best fit to your data .
People have occasionally suggested that I extend the program to handle a wider variety of functions .
I agree that would be cool , but barring a brainstorm on how to do it easily , that would be a much more complicated project , one that I 'm not likely to do in my spare time .
I 'm happy to chat with you about how to find solutions for the more general case , but that 's about all I can say .
Best of luck ! :-)

My greatest of compliments on your program .
I have been using your website to introduce students to linear regression and Taylor / Maclaurin as a tutor for years now .
I was wondering if you might be selling " polyme " the program as a stand - alone program that would n't require Internet access .
If you are n't , again , my greatest of compliments and thanks for the instructive resource that I 've been using all of these years .
Stephen Jul 28 , 2013
I absolutely LOVE your page on a formula for any set of numbers .
i've long wondered about that sort of thing and eventually i found your page after attempting to research such a thing on the internet .
I know it 's been several years since you made the website , look at the page I think it 's been 15 , but you updated it 5 years ago if I 'm not mistaken .
However , I 'm very interested in computer science now , and I 'm going to be a freshman at a university in North Carolina in the fall , so I 'm wondering if there 's any chance you would mind giving me access to your page , or spreadsheet , whatever it is that you used to create that program which does the math for you .
I understand this is a big request , which is why I 'm asking you .
I 've begun to try to emulate the process you describe , using my limited ( though rapidly improving ) knowledge of excel , but I can't even get the if - then statements to work :(
anyway , I 'm hoping to hear from you soon , and have a great day and thank you for your marvelous work !

Dear Mr. Jay ,
Hope you will be fine and enjoying some great work .
I would like to convey my special thanks to you for such a nice program for generating equation for numbers .
For my M.Sc Engineering in mechanical design thesis work , I have established a equation from your written online program .
This program helped me a lot .
Well done .

I came across your " How to Find a Formula for a Set of Numbers " webpage and was intrigued by it .
I 've done the same thing many times myself ; in fact , in 6th grade , this is essentially what our teacher taught us to do .
I 'm sure you 've been told this before , but do you realize that you essentially recreated Taylor Series ??
It 's quite cool .
Thanks for the fun !
satdeep Jan 30 , 2014
I found your " How to Find a Formula for a Set of Numbers " webpage very useful .
But I have a small confusion .
While generating the formula , especially for your data , 2,8,9,11,20 , ... you came up with a step like this ,
6 / 3 ! x n3
= 6 / 6 x n3
= n3
I do n't know what ' x ' and ' n ' indicates .
Because , in this webpage you finally ended up with the formula ,
n3 - 17/2 n2 + 49/2 n - 15
But , if I use your computer program ' Poly Me ' , the formula comes like this ,
y = +1 x3 - 17/2 x2 +49/2 x - 15
Please clear my confusion .
Jay Johansen Feb 2 , 2014
Okay , I was inconsistent . " x " and " n " are the input variables .
The letter does n't really matter .
Whether you write y=3x+5 or q=3n+5 , it 's the same formula .
To take that example , if I plug in x=1 I should get out y=8 .
If I plug in x=2 I get out y= 11 .
Etc .

3
5 -> 2
9 -> 4 -> 2
15 -> 6 -> 2
So first term is 2/2 ! x ^ 2 = x ^ 2 .
Subtract that from each term ...
3-1=2
5-4=1
9-9=0
15-16=-1
Then run thru again ...
2
1->-1
0->-1
-1->-1
so second term is - 1/1 ! x ^ 1 = - x. Subtract that from each term -- remember minus a minus is a plus .
2+1=3
1+2=3
0+3=3
- 1+4=3
So last term is 3/0 ! x^0 = 3 .
Putting that together gives x ^2 - x + 3 .
Check it :
f( x ) =x ^2 - x +3
f(1)=1-1+3=3
f(2)=4-2+3=5
f(3)=9-3+3=9
f(4) =16-4+3=15
Hooray !

I wanted to mention that this would not be a good method to find the formula for a sequence of real world data .
Although this method would be able to fit a n^th order polynomial to the curve , and it would go exactly through all the points , it would not be much use at actually predicting other values .
But for cases when you are just trying to find the next value in a sequence , this is very interesting and fine .
Jay Johansen May 1 , 2015
Caitlin : Absolutely true , especially if we 're talking about using my program .
If you have data collected from , say , a scientific experiment , there is going to be some measurement error in there , and my program expects all the numbers to be exact .
It 's useful for working with MATH problems , not SCIENCE problems .
This method could work for real - world data if you accepted some fudging of the numbers , like if you see a column of differences comes out to 1.9 , 2.1 , 1.88 , and 2.02 , you might way , " hmm , maybe the real number is 2 " and see how it works out .
I 've been thinking for a long time of adding a feature to my program to allow for some error , but I 've never gotten around to it .
Also , note this method will find a POLYNOMIAL , period .
It wont find a trig function or a log or many other possibilities .
It would take entirely different methods to find such functions .

I am trying to use your method , or rather your calculator , to predict next year 's baseball stats .
Do you think it will yield useful results , or that I should look for another method ?
Every relevant formula in Google Sheets wants two axes , but all I have are one - dimensional lists .
Jay Johansen Dec 25 , 2015
Nick : Short answer : I sincerely doubt it will work .
1 . It 's extremely unlikely that baseball stats follow a rigid formula .
There are hundreds of factors involved , many of them very difficult to quantify objectively .
I would be extremely surprised if you could come up with a formula where you plug in the year and it pops out , say , the number of home runs that were or will be hit that year .
At the very least you 'd have to factor in some measure of the skill levels of the players .
Probably also everything from humidity on the day of the game to data about the composition of the particular ball pitched .
2 . On the practical side , my program only handles functions in one variable , and makes no allowance for measurement errors in the data .
It 's really intended more for uses in pure math than real - world measurements .
I keep saying that some day I 'll add a " measurement tolerance " to it , but I have n't gotten to it .
If you actually come up with a formula that accurately predicts baseball stats in advance , I presume you can become very rich by betting on game results .
Which is why people have been trying to do it for decades , and to the best of my knowledge none has succeeded .

Hello Jay ,
Thank you for sharing this great tool .
Although i have a question for you .
If i have three data and trying to find a connection between these data .
e.g
Temperature of a room is determined by the time the heater is turned on to the area of the room .
A = Temperature
B = Time
C = Area of the room .
I have all three values for about 50 test conditions and they all have different values .
based on this can i get a code to generate a formula that will give an accurate A value when i use any value for B or C .
Thank you .

Jay Johansen Jun 4 , 2016
Solomon :
My technique as I have worked it out only handles functions of one variable .
I have n't pursued multiple variables .
In general , I think the way you solve such a problem is by holding one variable constant , varying the other , and seeing what kind of formula you can derive .
Then hold the second one constant and vary the first .
Jay Johansen Jun 4 , 2016
grad student : " It is much quicker to just use Lagrange interpolation " So ... use Lagrange interpolation .
I 'm not familiar with the technique .

I 'm sure you 're thinking of a rule more like , " Each number occurs as many times as that number , one one , two two's , three three 's , etc . "
But the whole point of my article here is that you can always find a polynomial that will generate any finite series .
My algorithm finds the polynomial .
There are an infinite number of ways to generate any given series .
The polynomial MAY be the simplest or most logical , or it may not .

Jeff Smith Nov 4 , 2016
This is fantastic , but what about a series of numerical values ?
For example , let 's say I have to make a bridge out of plywood .
The only samples I have are 5 feet , 6 feet , 7 feet , and 8 feet long .
Now , assume that the bridge must be symmetrical , and that both using the pieces most similar in size and using the fewest amount of pieces is the best .
I want to find the best way to make a bridge 14 pieces long , 15 pieces long , 16 .....50 pieces long .
Each numerical value representing each bridge will look like ( N1 N2 ... Nk ) , where k is the fewest amount of pieces .
14 pieces = 2 7 ' = ( 77 )
15 pieces = 3 5 ' = ( 555 )
16 pieces = 2 8 ' = ( 88 )
17 pieces = 1 5 ' , 2 6 ' = ( 656 )
18 pieces = 3 6 ' = ( 666 )
19 pieces = 2 6 ' , 1 7 ' = ( 676 )
20 pieces = 1 6 ' , 2 7 ' = ( 767 )
21 pieces = 3 7 ' = ( 777 )
....
Sure , I can manually do this for up to 50 pieces , but what if I want to make a bridge 1400 pieces wide ?
It 'd be nice to have a formula that could do this .
Any ideas ?
Edward Negondeni Nov 19 , 2016
Hello Jay Johansen
Your program is really fantastic .
It does help indeed .
Can there be a way of finding a formula through this program if the given x values skip and the given y values given also skipped ?
Like
x :-3 ; 0 ; 3 ; 6 ; 9 ; 12
y : 4 ; 2 ; 0 ; - 2 ; - 4 ; - 6
I struggled to get through this ordered pairs in order to find the formula .
Please help !

Look at the age of this thing !
Math doesn`t get old :)
Thanks for this wonderful article !
Jay Johansen Nov 30 , 2016
Edward Negondeni : Sometimes , with some extra work .
Let 's create a new variable , call it n.
Imagine a function x=f( n ) , and another function y=f ( n ) .
That is , f is ( 1, -3 ) , ( 2,0 ) , ( 3,3 ) , ( 4,6 ) , ( 5,9 ) , ( 6,12 ) . g is ( 1,4 ) , ( 2,2 ) , ( 3,0 ) , ( 4 , - 2 ) , ( 5 , - 4 ) , and ( 6, -6 ) .
Run f through this method and you get x=3 n - 6 .
Run g and you get y= - 2n+6 .
Now you " just " need to combine those two equations to get a function that maps x to y .
In this case , we can solve f for n. n=1/3 x +
2 . Then plug that into g. y= - 2 ( 1/3 x + 2 ) + 6 , which simplifies to y= - 2/3 x + 2 .
If f can not be solved for n , it gets more complicated .
Jay Johansen Nov 30 , 2016
Jeff Smith :
The method described in this article is n't going to help you , as it 's just not that kind of problem .
It 's not a polynomial .
This is more like linear algebra .
I think in your examples you meant not " 14 pieces " , " 15 pieces " , etc but " 14 feet " , " 15 feet " , etc. Right ?
It does n't seem to make sense otherwise .
You can get 14 feet with 2 7 foot pieces , etc .
With these particular numbers , many lengths would be impossible .
9 feet , for example .
If the bridge is symmetrical , then you can have at most one length that occurs an odd number of times : one that goes in the middle .
I do n't think you can solve this with a formula or equation , but you could come up with an algorithm .
My thought is : take the total length .
If it 's odd , there must be an odd number of pieces , and the middle one must be a 5 or a 7 .
If it 's even , we could have an odd number of pieces with the middle one having an even length , or an even number of pieces .
So take all the possible values for the middle piece -- including zero .
For each , divide the remaining length by 2 .
Find the largest multiple of 8 less than this .
See if you can make up what 's left with shorter pieces .
If not , take the next lower multiple of 8 .
Etc.
With a little work you could probably make it more systematic .

I think what you published was very reasonable .
However , think on this , suppose you were
to create a killer headline ?
I ain't saying your information is not good . , but suppose
you added a post title that makes people desire more ?
I mean How To Find a Formula For a Set of Numbers - Island of Sanity is a little vanilla .
You could peek at Yahoo's front page and watch how they create article titles to grab people
to open the links .
You might try adding a video or a related picture or two
to grab readers interested about everything 've got to say .
In my opinion , it might bring your posts a little bit more
interesting .
math solver ( Jorja ) Mathematics is vital in many
areas , including natural research , engineering , medicine , money and the communal sciences .
Applied mathematics has led to new mathematical disciplines
entirely , such as information and game theory .
Mathematicians also take part in pure mathematics , or
mathematics because of its own sake , with no any application at heart .
There is absolutely no clear range separating natural and applied mathematics ,
and practical applications for what started out as pure
mathematics are learned often .

I 'd like to first pile on my praise to your heap of praises for your clear explanation on your site . :)
I liked it so much that i tried doing an implementation in python , which worked .. but it seems to be pretty slow the more numbers i added ( which is within expectations )
however it seems your implementation on your calculator differs slightly in that your subsequent column zeros get shorter and shorter .
I was wondering if anything changed in between your article and your calculator program ( the one that works with fractions ) .
perhaps that implementation is a lot faster ?
i could n't get it to work at a reasonable pace once i fed upwards of 10 - 15 numbers .
If you like , i can send you my python implementation ( which is neither concise nor very pythonic ) for a look .
hope to hear from you !

You can drop one row with each iteration .
If you try it manually , or have the program dump out the results , you 'll see that after the first " frame " , the numbers in the last column are always the same .
Regardless , I do n't see why it should be slow .
My PHP program runs in a fraction of a second .
I frankly do n't know if PHP is inherently faster than Python , but I would be surprised if it is a huge difference .
If your program is taking a long time to run , I suspect you have a flaw .
You are doing the same work over and over , or maybe creating and destroying too many objects , or something of that sort .
I could take a look at your Python program but I 've only dabbled in Python , I do n't claim to be any sort of expert .

I gave you
n =... desired result ...
1 1
2 2
3 1
4 2
5 1
6 2
7 1
8 2
9 1
10 2 ... etc .
You gave me " y = +2/2835 x9 -11/315 x8 +20/27 x7 -44/5 x6 +8666/135 x5 -4444/15 x4 +486536/567 x3 -468688/315 x2 +62144/45 x - 510 , " but the answer is
" 2 - ( n mod 2 ) . "
What gives ?

Dude .
So I used your method to calculate the random sequence 1,6,13,14 and managed to get it to work .
Thanks .
I am sure you can imagine my pleasant surprise when I got to the 6th number :)

Yogesh Singh Jul 15 , 2017
This was really fun to try out and it helped in small sets .
Thanks for posting this method ..
But was trying to find out relation between nearly 20000 numbers in a column ..
This would increase the power so high that polynomial calculation looks would be a costly affair for the machine .
Does anyone think of any other methods ?
Sherman Jul 22 , 2017
I like the valuable info you provide in your articles .
I will bookmark your weblog and check again here frequently .
I am quite sure I will learn many new stuff right here !

Does this only work for integers ?
I tried it for the sequence below and got 2 n^4 terms , which , according to your explanation , should not happen
1 , 27 , 31 , 4 , 57.5
Jay Johansen Aug 6 , 2017
No , it should work for any real numbers .
When I enter those values I get the formula
y = +241/48 x^4 - 1241/24 x^3 +8339/48 x^2 - 5005/24 x + 165/2
Perhaps you made an arithmetic error somewhere ?
You might try my on - line program .
See the link at the bottom of the article .
Jay Johansen Aug 6 , 2017
Yogesh :
If you are looking at real - world data , just try running the algorithm against the first 10 numbers or so .
If you get a formula that looks like it might be plausible , see if it works with the remaining 19,990 numbers .
The method will work with 20,000 numbers , but it could result in a polynomial with 20,000 terms , which is unlikely to be useful .

I tried this with the sequence 1,2,5,26,677 and did not get an answer that worked ( the last column kept ending up as all zeroes ) .
I 'm not sure if I misunderstood it or what .
Any advice ?

I have found formula for sequence .
In this you use minus of terms .
But we also use multiply of terms .
Like 2 4 8 ...
So in this formula is 2 ^n. your method not give this formula .
you dividing term to next term so you give 2 .

locations of each point are used as starting values in a repeating , or iterating calculation ( described in detail below ) .
The result of each iteration is used as the starting values for the next .
The values are checked during each iteration to see whether they have reached a critical " escape " condition , or " bailout " .
If that condition is reached , the calculation is stopped , the pixel is drawn , and the next point is examined .
For some starting values , escape occurs quickly , after only a small number of iterations .
For starting values very close to but not in the set , it may take hundreds or thousands of iterations to escape .
For values within the Mandelbrot set , escape will never occur .
The programmer or user must choose how many iterations–or how much " depth " –they wish to examine .
The higher the maximal number of iterations , the more detail and subtlety emerge in the final image , but the longer time it will take to calculate the fractal image .

The Federal Communications Commission is examining a recent decision by Apple to reject an iPhone application developed by Google .
On Friday , the commission sent letters to executives at Apple , Google and AT&T , which is the exclusive carrier for the iPhone in the United States , saying it was “ interested in a more complete understanding of this situation . ”
In opening the investigation , the F.C.C. cited an article in The New York Times this week describing Google ’s frustration in winning approval from Apple to distribute its iPhone applications through Apple ’s App Store .
Apple recently rejected Google ’s effort to bring a service called Google Voice to the iPhone , and the company also rescinded its earlier approval of several applications created by third - party developers that worked with Google Voice .
In its letter to Apple , the F.C.C. asked the company to explain why it rejected the application and removed the related applications from its App Store .
A spokesman for Apple declined to comment , saying the company does not typically discuss regulatory issues .
Google Voice , which is already available on BlackBerrys , provides users with free domestic calls , inexpensive international calls , free text messaging , call routing and other services .
In a statement , Google said that its application had been rejected but that the company would “ continue to work to bring our services to iPhone users , for example by taking advantage of advances in mobile browsers . ”
The company also said it would supply the information requested by the F.C.C..
Here ’s a hint …it ’s not sitting at a shell prompt typing out commands .
I ’m sitting here on hold , waiting for Dell support to come online and tell me that my laptop is out of warranty , so I ’ve got some time to think , and I ’m reflecting on some of the sysadmins I ’ve met lately , as well as some of the technologies I ’ve seen for enabling administration , and it all seems pointed in one direction .
Sysadmins are becoming developers .
If you think about it , in a sense , we ’ve always been developers … developers of systems , that is .
Infrastructuresmiths , you might even call us .
In my mind , though , there ’s always been a delineation between the admins who run the systems and the programmers who program them …at least there has been since the early sages who wrote the software and the operating system .
Maybe that ’s just my own inexperience talking ( if so , please , comment and let me know ! ) .
Administration is definitely getting away from the method that I “ grew up ” learning , which was “ fix it right the first time so you do n’t screw it up , then document it when you get the chance ” , where “ fix it ” meant log in to the machine ( as root , of course ) , edit the configuration by hand , test the syntax ( if the service supports that sort of thing ) , then restart the service and check to see if the edit worked .
If what you “ fixed ” broke something else , then you ’d scramble to fix it , and restart the service again .
Lather , rinse , repeat .
It ’s probably an understatement to say that there are better ways of going about this .
For a while , best practices flirted with development by storing machine configurations in version control repositories like subversion .
You would make a change to the config , commit the file to the subversion repository ( along with notes regarding whatever you did ) , and if your change broke the service , you just rolled back the change .
It was a big improvement , and similar in methodology to how developers manage source code .
This was really the first step for us .
Now , a few years later , we ’re being introduced to another paradigm of system administration : framework - based configuration management AKA cfengine , puppet , and chef .
These configuration management packages offer exciting new time - saving abilities .
Not only do you get configuration management , you get it centralized and programatized .
I ca n’t say I have any experience with cfengine or chef , but what little experience I have with puppet has taught me that it ’s more programming language than configuration file , and best practices are to treat it as such .
Store it in a subversion repository to keep it safe , and to roll back changes when needed .
You can even use subversion to create development testing branches and the like .
If we ’re not becoming developers , we ’re blurring the line quite a bit .
This is n’t necessarily a bad thing , but it does require us to update our skillset a bit .
CS degrees which teach proper development techniques are going to become more valuable .
Those of us without those particular skills may want to keep them in mind for the next time we get some free time to work on improving skills .
Michael Halligan said the other day on twitter , “ I feel that any sysadmin today who is n’t learning Ruby and either Chef or Puppet will be unemployed in 5 years ” .
That might be overstating it a bit , but knowing up - to - date system management solutions will never be a hindrance , in my opinion .
Are you using anything remotely modern on your systems , or do you still use the “ change and scramble ” method ?
And do n’t be afraid to share , we wo n’t judge .
Chances are really good that we ’ve all seen ( and done ) worse !

U.S. prisons are too punitive and often fail to rehabilitate , but targeting prisoners ' behavior , reducing prison populations and offering job skills could reduce prisoner aggression and prevent recidivism , a researcher told the American Psychological Association on Saturday .
" The current design of prison systems do n't work , " said criminal justice expert Joel Dvoskin , PhD , of the University of Arizona .
" Overly punitive approaches used on violent , angry criminals only provide a breeding ground for more anger and more violence . "
Presenting at the American Psychological Association 's 117th Annual Convention , Dvoskin discussed his upcoming book , " Applying Social Science to Reduce Violent Offending , " which examines why prisons are failing and what needs to change .
" Prison environments are replete with aggressive behaviors , and people learn from watching others acting aggressively to get what they want , " Dvoskin said in an interview .
Applying behavior modification and social learning principles can work in corrections , he said .
" For example , systematic reinforcement of pro-social behaviors is a powerful and effective way to change behavior , but it has never been used as a cornerstone of corrections , " he said .
Also , punishment can be effective in changing behavior , but it only works in the short term and immediately after the unwanted behavior happens , he said .
While there is a place for punishment , it should be used in psychologically informed and effective ways .
However , punishment should not be one - size - fits - all , Dvoskin said .
" We need to know what may be behind the criminal behavior to know what the best treatment is , " he said .
" A person who commits crimes when drunk but not when sober is likely suffering from an alcohol problem .
Treating the alcohol problem may diminish the criminal behavior . "
Decreasing prison populations needs to be more of a priority , Dvoskin said .
" This can be done by paying more attention to those with the highest risk of violent behavior rather than focusing on lesser crimes , such as minor drug offenses . "
Finally , bringing work back into prisons can benefit prisoners by teaching them job skills and filling unmet job needs .
With the increase in the criminal population and lack of increase in prison staff , " there is not enough supervision to allow prisoners to work and build skills , " Dvoskin said .
" This makes it very hard to re-enter into the civilian world and increases the likelihood of going back to prison . "
With 7 million American adults in prison and almost 50 percent of them African - American males , many children are growing up without fathers and are at risk for continuing the vicious cycle of criminal behavior , Dvoskin said .
" If we do n't make the changes now , we will see these numbers go up . "
Dvoskin , along with co-editors Jennifer Skeem , Ray Novaco and Kevin Douglas , wanted to find out what social science reveals about preventing and reducing violent crime .
" Our intention , " said Dvoskin , " is to avoid the extreme partisan bickering about whether to be ' soft ' or ' hard ' on crime , but to combine social science and common sense so that our correctional systems can more effectively change behavior .
After all , is n't that their job ? "

Continental confirms it sent another kid on wrong plane IAH had misdirectred kid flier , too
Continental carrier reports 2nd such incident of week
An 8 - year - old Continental Express passenger flying unaccompanied from Houston on Saturday was taken to the wrong destination , the second such case over the weekend confirmed by Houston - based Continental Airlines .
Taylor Williams of College Station , traveling alone on a Continental Express commuter flight departing from Bush Intercontinental Airport , went to Fayetteville , Ark. , instead of her destination of Charlotte , N.C. , where her father was to meet her .
The next day , 10 - year - old Miriam Kamens boarded a Continental Express plane at Boston ’s Logan airport and landed in Newark , N.J. , instead of her intended destination of Cleveland to visit her grandparents .
The two Continental Express flights were operated by ExpressJet under contract with Continental .
In a statement Tuesday , Continental spokeswoman Kelly Cripe said both incidents occurred when flights with different destinations were loaded simultaneously from the same doorway and that “ miscommunication among staff members resulted in the child being boarded on the wrong aircraft . ”
“ In both circumstances the children were supervised throughout the entire process and were rebooked and routed to the proper destinations on the same day , ” Cripe said in the e-mailed statement .
“ Continental has clear procedures to assist children traveling alone , and we take the responsibility very seriously , ” the statement said .
“ We have also taken immediate action to reinforce to airport representatives that they must closely adhere to established procedures . ”
The U.S. Department of Transportation has been alerted about the errors .
“ DOT will conduct investigations if we think there are some violations of the regulations or there was some kind of deceptive practices on the part of the carriers , ” said spokesman Bill Mosley .
“ There are no regulations relating to the treatment of unaccompanied minors on carriers .
It ’s really up to the carriers and the parents and guardians . ”
Parents call forreview
The parents of the children who were sent to the wrong airports , however , say regulators should closely examine how carriers are handling this responsibility .
“ I have never seen so much incompetence in all my life , ” said Taylor ’s mother , Wendy Babineaux of College Station .
The girl was on her way to visit her father , Babineaux ’s ex-husband , in Charlotte .
After landing instead in Fayetteville , Taylor was flown back to Intercontinental in Houston and then to Charlotte .
She did not arrive there until 10:30 p.m. — more than eight hours after she was due , said her father , Rahman Williams .
On Monday — before hearing about the Sunday incident on the flight from Boston — Babineaux hired a lawyer to help her and her ex-husband get a full refund for the cost of the airline ticket and to present their concerns to federal authorities .
“ We should n’t have to pay anything because it was Continental that messed up , ” Babineaux said .
“ We should n’t have to pay for the mess they put my child through .
It ’s not so much the money ; it ’s the neglect that they showed my child . ”
Compensation
Continental said in its statement that it has apologized to both families and is working with them to resolve the situations .
“ The compensation offered to both families is the same , ” the airline said , without elaborating .
The families , however , described different compensation offers .
Williams said Continental has promised to refund the unaccompanied minor fee he paid and issue his daughter a $ 400 travel voucher for a future flight to visit him .
Miriam ’s father , Jonathan Kamens , reported on his blog that a Continental customer service representative promised to “ refund my daughter ’s entire fare and fly her back to Boston in first class for free . ”
He wrote that the airline also refunded the cost of the round - trip tickets his in - laws had purchased earlier to fly Miriam back to Boston after her visit and replaced them with first - class tickets , as well .
Kamens said in an interview that he is satisfied with the compensation but disturbed to hear about Saturday ’s incident involving Taylor .
“ You would think that after this happened on day one that it would not have been a possibility on day two , ” Kamens said .

But you will discover that the “ Conclusions ” tab presents a distillation of all that , into a set of carefully worded . . . er . . .
Conclusions .
Really .
Links to further descriptive help , FAQ pages and resources for this benchmark
utility are located at the bottom of each page .
An overview and list of the
unique features of GRC's DNS Benchmark utility are provided below .
Why a DNS Benchmark ?
People use alphabetic domain names ( www.grc.com), but Internet data packets require numerical Internet IP addresses ( 4.79.142.202 ) .
So the first step required before anything can be done on the Internet is to lookup the site 's or service 's domain name to determine its associated Internet IP address .
[ 4.79.142.202 ] www.grc.com[4.79.142.202]
Since nothing can happen until IP addresses are known , the use of slow , overloaded or unreliable DNS servers will get in the way , noticeably slowing down virtually all of your use of the Internet .
Unless you have taken over manual control of the DNS servers your system is using ( which , as you 'll see , is not difficult to do ) , your system will be using the DNS servers that were automatically assigned by your Internet connection provider ( your ISP ) .
Since they are likely located close to you on the Internet ( since they are provided by your own ISP ) they may already be the fastest DNS servers available to you .
But they might be in the wrong order ( the second one being faster than the first one , and that matters ) or , who knows ?
Many people have discovered that their own ISP 's DNS servers are slower than other publicly available alternatives on the Internet , which are faster and / or more reliable .
This DNS Benchmark will give you visibility into what 's going on with your system 's currently assigned DNS servers by automatically comparing their performance with many well known publicly available alternatives .
What is GRC's DNS Benchmark ?
GRC 's DNS Benchmark performs a detailed analysis and comparison of the operational performance and reliability of any set of up to 200 DNS nameservers ( sometimes also called resolvers ) at once .
When the Benchmark is started in its default configuration , it identifies all DNS nameservers the user 's system is currently configured to use and adds them to its built - in list of publicly available “ alternative ” nameservers .
Each DNS nameserver in the benchmark list is carefully “ characterized ” to determine its suitability — to you — for your use as a DNS resolver .
This characterization includes testing each nameserver for its “ redirection ” behavior : whether it returns an error for a bad domain request , or redirects a user 's web browser to a commercial marketing - oriented page .
While such behavior may be acceptable to some users , others may find this objectionable .
The point made above about the suitability — to you — of candidate nameservers is a crucial one , since everything is about where you are located relative to the nameservers being tested .
You might see someone talking about how fast some specific DNS nameservers are for them , but unless you share their location there 's absolutely no guarantee that the same nameservers would perform as well for you .
ONLY by benchmarking DNS resolvers from your own location , as this DNS Benchmark does , can you compare nameserver performance where it matters . . . right where you 're computer is .
When the benchmark is run , the performance and apparent reliability of the DNS nameservers the system is currently using , plus all of the working nameservers on the Benchmark 's built - in list of alternative nameservers are compared with each other .
Results are continuously displayed and updated while the benchmark is underway , with a dynamically sorted and scaled bar chart , and a tabular chart display showing the cached , uncached and “ dotcom ” DNS lookup performance of each nameserver .
These values are determined by carefully querying each nameserver for the IP addresses of the top 50 most popular domain names on the Internet and also by querying for nonexistent domains .
Once the benchmark finishes , the results are heuristically and statistically analyzed to present a comprehensive yet simplified and understandable English - language summary of all important findings and conclusions .
Based upon these results , users may choose to change the usage order of their system 's own resolvers , or , if alternative public nameservers offer superior performance or features compared with the nameservers currently being used , to switch to one or more alternative nameservers .

Primary Benchmark Features :
For each of up to 200 DNS nameservers , using the Internet 's most popular top - 50 domain names , independently measures , charts , statistically analyzes , reports ( and optionally exports ) :
Cached lookups – the time to return a domain name that is already in the resolver 's name cache .
Uncached lookups – the time to return a sub - domain name that is not already in the resolver 's name cache .
Dotcom lookups – the time to consult the nameserver 's chosen dotcom resolver (s ) for a dotcom name .
Reliability – the number of queries not replied to ( lost ) during the benchmark .
Rebinding protection – whether the resolver blocks non-routable private IP addresses .
Optionally verifies whether nameservers provide DNS security ( DNSSEC ) record authentication .

As it happens , one can see some of those homes from Mr. Hall ’s front lawn in Southport , not far from his office .
But his case is more complex .
Mr. Hall , raised in Britain and known for titanium nerves and a collection of pricey art , is the standout performer at an operation that has netted Citigroup about $ 2 billion over the last five years .
If Citigroup will not pay him the huge sums he has long made , someone else probably will .
The added wrinkle is that Mr. Hall works in a corner of the trading world that appears headed for its own infamy .
Regulators are pushing to curb the role of traders like Mr. Hall , whose speculation in the energy markets may have played a major role in the recent gyrations of oil prices .
That suggests that last summer , drivers paid more at the pump , at least in part , because of people like Andrew J. Hall .
How do you hand $ 100 million to a guy who may have profited because gas hit $ 4 a gallon ?
Whatever the answer , the case of Mr. Hall highlights the hazards of mixing the public interest with capitalism at its most unbridled , and it raises basic questions of fairness .
There was outrage last week over a report by the New York attorney general that about 5,000 traders and bankers at bailed - out firms got more than $ 1 million each last year .
So it could be politically untenable for a company like Citigroup to pay gargantuan sums even to those who generate gargantuan profits  the very people the company must retain if it is to recover .
Among those who believe the Phibro - Citigroup relationship is doomed by bailout politics is the $ 100 million man himself .
People with knowledge of talks between Phibro and Citigroup say that Mr. Hall is quietly pushing for what is being called “ a quiet divorce ” from his parent company and that he has had preliminary talks with one possible suitor .

The Opus Dei headquarters is in the underground church in Villa Tevere
If ever a religious movement has been defined in the public imagination by its depiction in a novel , it is the Catholic group Opus Dei .
Dan Browns bestseller The Da Vinci Code portrayed a mysterious , cult - like organisation , shrouded from the wider world .
Opus Dei insists the reality is very different and I was given a rare chance to see the wide variety of initiatives they undertake in Rome .
Some aspects , if not mysterious , are certainly intriguing .
For example , Opus Dei tends to be extremely discreet about the function of its buildings .
The groups large seminary where priests are trained in central Rome is unidentifiable from the outside .
One small doorway in a high wall is apparently the only entrance , even though the community is home to more than 100 men .
Conspiracy theorists might start to raise their eyebrows but inside , I found a uniformly warm welcome from students insistent that there was nothing odd about being trained by Opus Dei .
Follow the rules Members of Opus Dei have to attend church every day Singing their evening prayers in a chapel built long before Opus Dei took over the ancient building , the seminarians are drawn from countries around the world .
They speak of the honour of being sent to Rome to be trained by the group , and clearly have high regard for what they refer to as the holiness of the priests they learn from .
However , it is ordinary Catholic lay people , rather than priests , who have dominated the membership of Opus Dei , ever since it was founded in 1928 by the Spanish priest Josemaria Escriva , who was later made a saint .
People like Marta Brancatisano , who is not a mysterious , shadowy religious figure , but a middle - aged mother and lecturer at Opus Deis university in Rome .
Marta teaches about family life , and the Catholic values that should underpin it , at the Pontifical University of the Holy Cross .
The name itself is significant .
To be honoured by the Vatican as a pontifical university shows that Opus Dei is regarded by the Church as part of Romes intellectual Catholic establishment .
I met Marta just after she had finished a lecture , which included comments about the dangers of social networking sites undermining traditional family values .
There s jealousy , theres envy , theres confusion and I think they re working very hard to clarify that and help people to understand who they are

She could hardly be more effusive in her praise for Opus Dei , regarding it as a way to see beyond the troubles of everyday life .
 This is freedom , this is joy .
If it is real , this is paradise on Earth , " she said .
Opus Dei makes strict demands on its members , as it helps them find what is referred to as holiness in everyday life .
Each day they are expected to attend church and make time for personal prayer and devotion .
Most members of Opus Dei are married .
But single members , called numeraries  by the movement , are also asked to undertake a spiritual discipline known as corporal mortification .
It involves self - inflicting pain in order to focus on Christs suffering on the Cross , something also practised by some other Catholics .
Healthcare innovation Opus Dei is also concerned with the relief of suffering , and its innovation in healthcare is perhaps the most remarkable and unexpected aspect of the groups work .
They want to find medical treatments that conform to Catholic values
On a large site on the outskirts of the city , a massive hospital and biomedical research centre is Opus Dei 's latest initiative .
Members of the public are treated free of charge and research laboratories work to find medical treatments that conform to Catholic values .
Rome is also the headquarters for the groups new overseas development charity , Harambee , providing microfinance to African communities .
One man who is candid about opposition within the wider church to Opus Deis work is Sean Patrick Lovett , a senior official at Vatican Radio .
 There s jealousy , theres envy , theres confusion , and I think they re working very hard to clarify that and help people to understand who they are , what they do and why they do it .
It may have become famous through the thrilling fiction of Dan Brown but the reality of Opus Dei is certainly less dramatic , perhaps even a bit more mundane .
Opus Dei should not be underestimated .
While relatively small in numbers , it has found ways to extract lives of committed service from its members .
The movement now plans international expansion , into new countries like Indonesia , where it does not yet have a presence .
As it spreads its message of finding holiness in everyday life , it seems determined to continue growing its influence .
Assignment is broadcast on BBC World Service on Thursday at 0906 GMT and repeated at 1406 GMT , 1906 GMT , 2306 GMT and on Saturday at 1106 GMT .

Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger is hoping that the " Great California Garage Sale " will turn government clutter like surplus prison uniforms and office furniture into cash to bulk up the state 's depleted finances .
On offer as the state clears out clutter are nearly 600 state - owned vehicles and thousands of pieces of office furniture , computers , electronics , jewellery , pianos , even a surfboard , a food saver and an Xbox 360 gaming system .
State officials estimate the giant two - day yard sale being held at a state warehouse will bring in hundreds of thousands of dollars .
In addition to clearing out office products , the state is also selling unclaimed property from state parks and items confiscated by law enforcement , said California department of general services spokesman Eric Lamoureux .
The prison department contributed dental chairs and surplus prison shirts and jeans .
" This is a win -win for the state and for shoppers , " Schwarzenegger said in a statement on Tuesday announcing that a selection of items also would be sold on eBay and Craigslist .
" Together we are eliminating waste and providing great deals in this tough economy . "
Schwarzenegger also has autographed 15 car visors in an effort to fetch more money during the sale today and tomorrow .
California sure could use the cash : the state was force to hand out IOUs earlier this year , government workers are on the brink of revolt over a 14 % pay cut and the state remains in an interminable state of financial morass .
Talk show host Jimmy Kimmel recently spoofed the upcoming garage sell , saying the governor was so desperate he was selling everything from a set of burned dumbbells for $ 10 ( £ 6 ) to a pair of first lady Maria Shriver 's leg warmers for $ 8 .
" We are out of money here in California , " Kimmel said .
" I do n't know how much this is going to raise for the state but you can see the governor is going all out with this . "
State officials expect the discounts will draw thousands .
The public was invited to preview cars for sale yesterday but the garage sale began today at 8 am local time .
The sale will shut down at midnight tomorrow .
Schwarzenegger was scheduled to visit the sale this morning .
Early shoppers walked between rows of cars , opening doors and getting inside to inspect the interior during yesterday 's preview .
They took notes on the cars they liked and eyed the competition with suspicion .
Akili Daniels , 32 , of Sacramento , said he was worried about used car dealers scooping up the best vehicles .
Daniels , who was looking for a sedan or SUV to launch his own video production company after being laid off from a local television station , said he 's hoping to get a vehicle for under $ 5,000 .
He was also looking for a van for his wife 's new day care venture .
" It 's good if we can get it for a good price , " Daniels said .
" It helps for people who ca n't buy new cars .
But there are people from car lots .
You can tell they 're locking the cars on the really nice ones .
There are all kinds of schemes . "
Tim Craythorn , 45 , of Elk Grove , said he was in the market for a second used highway patrol car because he got a good deal last year .
He said he purchased a 2000 Ford Crown Victoria from a state auction last year for $ 2,700 .
" It was an executive car so it was n't used in vehicle pursuits , " he said .
" It actually smelled new .
And it gets 19 mpg . "
While the state 's department of general services auctions off surplus property every six weeks and the California highway patrol periodically auctions off its older fleet , Lamoureux said the state had never done both at the same time .
Craythorn said he plans to return today with his son to shop for a 35 mm camera .
He said he supported the garage sale .
" The way the economy is right now , it 's better to have money in the bank rather than sending things to the junkyard , " Craythorn said .
" It 's better to have things sitting on an auction lot rather than paying for rent or storage . "
Other items up for grabs will be sold at set prices .
For example , used Blackberry cell phones are going for $ 25 each .
Wood desks are going for $ 30 .
Eight stackable chairs are priced at $ 40 .
And laptop computers cost $ 200 .
Just like any yard sale , the items are being sold on a first come , first serve basis .
And of course , all sales are final .
# 1 : Clean Energy Patents Hit Record High in the US
August 27th , 2009 by Zachary Shahan
The economy is down , but here is another sign that green technology may be the way out of our economic dilemma .
US clean energy patents hit a record high last quarter .
[ social_buttons ]
According to intellectual property law firm Heslin Rothenberg Farley & Mesiti P.C. , who publishes the Clean Energy Patent Growth Index ( CEPGI ) every quarter , 274 clean energy patents were granted last quarter .
This is 31 more than the previous quarter and 57 more than in the same quarter last year .
This is a good sign that clean technology will continue to provide the US with a greater and greater share of its energy .
Additionally , clean technology in the transportation sector is advancing at great speed and with momentum and maybe we will find our way out of gas and oil related crises soon .
Fuel cell * technology is leading the way .
Victor Cardona , co-chair of the firm ’s Cleantech Group , states : “ Fuel cells continued to dominate the other technologies while wind and solar patents continued an upswing .
Honda earned more patents than the other patentees to again claim the Clean Energy Patent Crown . ”
Another record high was in the biofuels ** sector .
“ Biofuel patents reached an all time
quarterly high at 13 and were up 2 relative to the first quarter and up 8 over a year before , ” according to the press release .
Geographically , Japan led the pack ( with 75 new patents ) , California was second ( 29 ) , Michigan and Germany tied for third ( 23 ) , and New York and Korea tied for fifth ( 15 ) .
In addition to Honda , the top companies were GM , Toyota , GE , Nissan , and Panasonic Corp. ( respectively ) .

Book Burning : A True Christian® Tradition
The burning of books is nothing new to True Christians® .
We invented the practice over two - thousand years ago as a way to promote our faith in the Lord Jesus .
In the early days of Christianity , when new believers in Christ were converted , they were naturally moved by the Holy Spirit to grab as many books as they could and pitch them into a fire .
Unlike the sissy " Jesus is Love " fake - Christians ( whom both the Lord Jesus and we loathe ) we have running around today , the early followers of Christ were never ashamed to burn books .
In fact , if you ever find yourself being grateful for the destruction of most of the works of pagan nincompoops like Socrates , Plato , and Aristotle , you have a Christian to thank !
In the Book of Acts we learn that anyone who wants to follow Jesus , should get ready to start burning books at the drop of a hat .
The Book of Acts teaches us that burning someone 's books is a great way spread God 's word .
" Many of them also which used curious arts brought their books together and burned them before all men and they counted the price of them and found it fifty thousand pieces of silver .
So mightily grew the word of God and prevailed . "
Acts 19:19 - 20 After September 11th , a spiritual awakening swept across the United States of America .
One of the great signs that the Holy Spirit is moving in the hearts and souls of Americans is our glorious and sacred return to the practice of book burning .
Secular humanists and Atheists have spent hundreds of years trying to make " book burners " look bad .
Oftentimes the media paints a terrible image of book burners .
" They make us out to look like fanatics or Germans , " said one Christian .
Did you know that a militant homosexual named Ray Bradbury , even wrote a popular book called Farenheight 451 about book burning ?
He made Christians out to look like fools !
Well , Mr. Bradbury , if you are still alive , and God has n't sent you to Hell yet , we 'd like you to know that Farenheight 451 is also a book that can be burned .
And nobody would miss it !

The truth is , burning a book is one of the most loving things a Christian could do for a person they really care about .
The Landover Baptist Church is proud to be sponsoring America 's Largest Book Burning on Satan 's Birthday , October 31st .
This will be the third consecutive year we have held the event .
Last October , we had 152,800 American Christians show up for the event .
We burned over 3.4 million books !
That 's right !
Do n't let the numbers dissuade you from holding a book burning at your local church this Halloween .
Thousands of churches in America have collected millions of Harry Potter books to be burned that very night .
As a Christian , you should be eager to participate in this Bible based tradition .
Burning books just like the first Christians did in New Testament is a great way to say " no " to Satan and " yes " to Jesus .
As most Christians already know , the Harry Potter book series is the most evil and dangerous set of books to be released this century .
" The Potter series is worse than pornography .
The books are even more dangerous than the Satanic Bible , " reports Pastor Deacon Fred , " At least with the Satanic Bible , young people know that the book was written by Satan .
The Devil just changed his name to J.K. Rowling this time . "
The release of the fifth book in the Harry Potter series has been delayed because Christians have been praying to God that he will send angels to scramble Satan 's brain and force him to admit Rowling 's spent body to a mental hospital so that the whole series will never be completed .
To celebrate the delayed release of the fifth Harry Potter book and the post September 11th return to American Christian values , The Truly Saved® all across America are calling upon the name of Jesus this Halloween to decrease the number of Harry Potter books currently circulating in America by at least 70 % .
" We 're giving True Christian® school children the Biblical authority to remove these evil books from their school libraries , bookstores , homes , grocery stores , and anywhere they find them , " said Pastor Deacon Fred .
" All they need to say is , Jesus wants me to take this book !
Friends , let 's help this great Country return to it 's True Christian® roots .
Wont ' you please set up a Holy Ghost book fire at your local church on Satan 's Birthday this Halloween ?
Thank you . "

In a recent column , Eric Margolis labeled the Republicans as “ America ’s champion of war and torture . ”
Those are some harsh words — harsh but true .
The recent release of the Bush torture memos and the revelation that the CIA waterboarded Abu Zubaydah 83 times and Khalid Sheik Mohammed 183 times before Bush claimed that we do n’t torture has elicited a predictable response from conservative Christians who think the Republican Party is the party of God : silence .
It is also no surprise that a new survey by the Pew Research Center for the People & the Press shows that of four major religious traditions in the United States ( white evangelical Protestant , white non-Hispanic Catholic , white mainline Protestant , and unaffiliated ) , white evangelical Protestants are more likely to believe that the use of torture against suspected terrorists can often or sometimes be justified .
In fact , the more often people attended church , the more likely they were to justify torture .
A similar poll commissioned last year by Faith in Public Life and Mercer University reported that almost 60 percent of Southern evangelicals believed that torture was often or sometimes justified .
When the Spanish did it , it was torture .
When the Japanese did it , it was torture .
When the Germans did it , it was torture .
When the Khmer Rouge did it , it was torture .
But when waterboarding was done by Americans under a Republican administration , it suddenly became an “ enhanced interrogation technique . ”
Such has not always been the case .
Waterboarding - like techniques used by American soldiers during the Philippine Insurrection and the Vietnam War were condemned .
But that was before the “ war on terror ” where anything goes in the name of “ national security . ”
“ Khalid Sheikh Mohammed was not waterboarded 183 times , ” says a Republican hack at Fox News .
That number is “ highly misleading ” and a “ vast inflation ” because “ the much - cited figure represents the number of times water was poured onto Mohammed ’s face — not the number of times the CIA applied the simulated - drowning technique on the terror suspect . ”
Okay , so how many “ pours ” does take to be waterboarded ?
If a prisoner is removed from his cell , taken to an interrogation room , forced to endure one “ pour , ” and then taken back to his cell — can we not say he was waterboarded because he only suffered one “ pour ” ?
And what about Abu Zubaydah ?
In addition to being waterboarded , he had a collar wrapped around his neck , was smashed against a wall , was forced to stay in a pitch - dark box for hours , was stripped naked , was suspended from hooks in the ceiling , and was deprived of sleep .
Is it not torture if these things only happened one time ?
The strict constitutionalist at Fox , Judge Andrew Napolitano , who actually read the 175 pages of torture memos , sees things differently from the defenders of the Bush regime at his network : “ This is not rocket science and it is not art .
Everyone knows torture when they see it ; and no amount of twisted logic can detract from its illegal horror , its moral antipathy , and its attack at core American values . ”
Who are these CIA operatives that engage in waterboarding and other forms of torture ?
What kind of a man does such a thing ?
The FBI does profiles of serial killers .
How about a profile of a CIA agent who tortures prisoners , in the interest of national security , of course ?
Are these men Christians ?
I suppose they are .
The majority of Americans claim to be a Christian of some sort .
Can a Christian waterboard an A - rab for Jesus ?
For the Christian , there is no other way to do it .
The Bible says : “ And whatsoever ye do in word or deed , do all in the name of the Lord Jesus , giving thanks to God and the Father by him ” ( Colossians 3:17 ) .
It also says that whatsoever we do , we should “ do it heartily , as to the Lord ” ( Colossians 3:23 ) .
We should do everything “ to the glory of God ” ( 1 Corinthians 10:31 ) .
Can a Christian smash someone against a wall in the name of the Lord Jesus ?
Can a Christian heartily lock someone in a dark box for hours at a time ?
Can a Christian deprive someone of sleep to the glory of God ?
Can a Christian give thanks to God while he hangs someone from the ceiling ?
Sure he can , but not without violating the whole tenor of the New Testament .
Christians are told to put off anger , wrath , and malice ( Colossians 3:8 ) , to not render evil for evil ( 1 Thessalonians 5:15 ) , to not give offense ( 1 Corinthians 10:30 ) , to abstain from all appearance of evil ( 1 Thessalonians 5:22 ) , to not be a brawler ( Titus 3:2 ) , and to abhor that which is evil ( Romans 12:9 ) .
I think this rules out waterboarding .
Okay , but suppose the perpetrators of torture in the CIA do not claim to be Christians and do n’t care what the New Testament says ?
Well , does that mean it is okay if Christians cheer them on ?
If not , then what should Christians do ?
Should they just be indifferent ?
John the Baptist told Herod “ It is not lawful for thee to have her ” when he married his brother ’s wife ( Matthew 14:4 ) .
He also told Roman soldiers to “ Do violence to no man ” ( Luke 3:14 ) .
Why are n’t Christians doing likewise ?
Why are n’t Christians letting the CIA and the military know that waterboarding is torture and that torture is wrong ?
Could it be that these institutions are filled with Christians ?
Could it be that Christians respect these institutions ?
Could it be that Christians trust these institutions ?
I think all of the above are true .
Where is the outrage from the evangelical community over these torture memos ?
I ’ll tell you where .
It is in the same place as the outrage over the invasion of Iraq , the thousands upon thousands of dead Iraqis , the over four thousand American soldiers who died for a lie , the bloodbath that Iraq has become , the Guantanamo prison camp , the CIA secret prisons , the destruction of liberty in America due to the war on terror , and America ’s evil foreign policy .
Christians should be leaving the Republican Party in droves .
Christians should be crawling on broken glass as penance for blindly supporting the Republican Party .
Christians should be repenting in sackcloth and ashes for thinking the Republican Party was the party of God.
Instead , even as more and more crimes of the Bush administration come to light , I fear that Christians who are outraged , and rightly so , at the crimes of the Obama administration and the Democrats will look in the next election to the Republicans as their savior instead of the champions of war and torture .
America needs more Christians like John the Baptist instead of John Hagee .

Die offizielle Webseite von MOGiS e.V. ist http://mogis-verein.de/
Frau von der Leyen hat einen Vortrag in Sulzbach gehalten .
Bei dieser Gelegenheit ist sie unter anderem auf das Thema Kinderpornographie eingegangen .
Sie griff dabei wieder auf die Art demagogischer Rhetorik zurück , die viele Netizens an Ihr so sehr zu „ schätzen “ gelernt haben .
Sie hat bei dieser Gelegenheit auch , wie schon häufiger , offensichtlich falsche Zahlen und Fakten an ihr Publikum gebracht .
Ich möchte im folgenden auf zwei Dinge eingehen
Die Alterstruktur
Frau von der Leyen sagt :
30 % der Kinder sind jünger als drei Jahre .
Dazu die IWF - Studie des Jahres 2007 , die hier falsch zitiert wurde :
10 % of the children in images assessed by IWF appear to be under 2 ; 33 % 3 – 6 ; 80 % under 10 ″
Es waren also geschätzte 33 % zwischen 3 und 6 Jahren [ 1 ] .
Die IWF hat anscheinend Ihre Methode geändert , denn in der Studie des Jahres 2008 waren es dann nur noch 4 % die jünger als 3 Jahre geschätzt wurden .
Ich mag in dieser Hinsicht der Frau von der Leyen aber keine Unwissenheit mehr unterstellen .
Auf der Rio-Nachfolgekonferenz am 30.6 . in Berlin hatte ich eine kurze Unterhaltung mit Ihrem Staatsekretär Herrn Hoofe und hatte danach den Eindruck , dass er einen ziemlich guten Überblick über die Zahlen hat – diese aber eben lieber „ geeignet “ zitiert um damit Politik zu machen .
In diesem Zusammenhang muss ich auch zugeben , dass ich verstehe , warum das Familienministerium und Frau von der Leyen so tun , als ob es MOGiS nicht gäbe .
Würden sie mit uns öffentlich reden , würde das unsere Bekanntheit deutlich steigern .
Natürlich sät die Existens eines Vereins wie MOGiS aber bei vielen Menschen Zweifel , die das Ministerium und Frau von der Leyen aber sicherlich lieber vermeiden wollen .
Die Inhalte
Frau von der Leyen sagte weiterhin :
Wenn ich von Kinderpornografie im Internet spreche , spreche ich nicht davon , dass nackte Kinder posieren .
Das ist schlimm genug .
Ich spreche davon , dass Kinder vor laufender Kamera vergewaltigt werden .
Auch hier möchte ich wiedersprechen .
Wenn ich eines von der Rio-Nachfolgekonferenz in Berlin mitgenommen habe , dann folgendes :
Gesperrt werden sollen vor allem Inhalte , denen man anders nicht beikommen kann .
Damit meine ich nicht die Inhalte , die angeblich in irgendwelchen ( noch zu benennenden ) failed states liegen , sondern Inhalte die thematisch in einem Graubereich liegen .
Der Paragraph 184b im Strafgesetzbuch sagt :
pornographische Schriften ( § 11 Abs. 3 ) , die sexuelle Handlungen von , an oder vor Kindern ( § 176 Abs. 1 ) zum Gegenstand haben ( kinderpornographische Schriften )
Dazu gehören zum Beispiel auch fiktive Darstellung in Form von Comics / Mangas , die in den USA und auch Japan teilweise unter die Kunst - und Meinungsfreiheit fallen .
Dazu gehören aber nach Ansicht einiger Gruppierungen eben gerade auch die Posenphotos von denen Frau von der Leyen im obigen Zitat spricht .
Diese Posenphotos sind aber laut BGH Urteil vom 2 .
Februar 2006 keine Kinderpornographie , da sie nicht den Missbrauch eines Kindes zum I nhalt haben [ 2 ] .
Sie können also selbst in Deutschland nicht strafrechtlich verfolgt werden .
Man bekommt sie auf diesem
Wege also nicht aus dem Netz .
An diesem Punkt setzen die geplanten ( und bald umgesetzten ) Sperren an .
Es geht gar nicht um die Verfolgung der Missbrauchsdokumentation .
Das würde voraussichtlich ein Gerichtsverfahren nach sich ziehen , bei dem am Ende eventuell die Unschuld des Beklagten festgestellt wird .
Das will man aber aus offensichtlichen Gründen eben nicht .
Deswegen gibt es m.E. auch auf Seiten der Sperrbefürworter eine solche Angst vor einem echten Richtervorbehalt .
Das würde ja bedeuten , dass ein Richter eventuell feststellt , dass diese Inhalte nicht gesperrt werden dürfen .
Mit den Sperren wird jetzt ein System der Halblegalität umgesetzt .
Damit wird am Rechtsstaat vorbei eine bestimmte Vorstellung von Sicherheit und Ordnung durchgesetzt .
In Finnland zeigt der Fall Matti Nikki welche Auswüchse das haben kann : Matti Nikki ist dort als Zensurgegner gesperrt , weil er die Sperrlisten auf seiner Webseite veröffentlicht hat .
Er ist daraufhin zur Polizei gegangen , und hat gemeint , wenn Sie denn schon sperren , dann mögen Sie ihn doch bitte auch wegen der Verbreitung von Kinderpornographie anzeigen / anklagen .
Darauf hat die Polizei aus offensichtlichen Gründen verzichtet .
Matti Nikki wird aber noch immer in Finnland gesperrt
Hier wird also die Möglichkeit geschaffen den Zugang zu Inhalten zu erschweren , zu deren Verfolgung man sich ( zum Teil zu Recht wie im Fall Matti Nikki ) außer Stande sieht .
PS : Bitte weitersagen .

CDC to College Students : Smooch With Surgical Masks to Curb Swine Flu Government offers unusual advice to ill students : no kissing without a mask .
Aug. 21 , 2009  --
When it comes to swine flu , John Genovese of Scottsdale , Ariz. , said he's not taking any chances as he settles in the dorm for his freshman year at Arizona State University .
" Swine flu is a pretty serious thing , so I 'd adhere to whatever the CDC advises , " Genovese , 18 , said .
But even Genovese said that a new piece of advice issued Thursday by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in Atlanta seems a bit strange .
It 's a recommendation suggesting that if college students are ill , they should refrain from kissing but , if they must , wear a surgical mask while doing the deed .
" I studied abroad in Costa Rica when swine flu broke out over there and we had to wear masks for a while , " he said .
" But I do n't think I 'd kiss with a surgical mask . "
At least one of Genovese 's classmates said he would , although he did add that he imagined kissing with a surgical mask would n't be comfortable .
" It just seems a little crazy and weird , " said 18 - year - old freshman Jordan Wilhelmi of Rosemont , Minn .
" But I 'd wear a mask if someone asked me to . "
The recommendation is just one of several that federal health officials posted online in a document titled " CDC Guidance for Responses to Influenza for Institutions of Higher Education during the 2009 - 2010 Academic Year . "
The tips are aimed at dorm - residing college students and , for the most part , they are the same well - worn guidelines that the agency has promoted in light of the swine flu pandemic , mainly involving social distancing and proper hand - washing technique .
But one of the " recommended strategies under current flu conditions " has raised eyebrows .
" If close contact with others cannot be avoided , the ill student should be asked to wear a surgical mask during the period of contact , " the recommendation reads .
" Examples of close contact include kissing , sharing eating or drinking utensils , or having any other contact between persons likely to result in exposure to respiratory droplets . "
CDC spokesperson
Tom Skinner acknowledged that the language of the recommendation was confusing and that the agency would " look at rewording " the guidance .
" We 're not telling them to wear a mask when they kiss , " Skinner said .
" What we 're trying to do is give examples of ' close contact . ' "
Some infectious disease experts agreed that despite the seemingly odd piece of advice , the overall intent of the guidelines is reasonable .
Mask Advice Is Strange , Doctors Say
" I believe the intent of the writer was to avoid close contact , including the examples cited , and to wear a surgical mask if close contact cannot be prevented such as when [ you 're in a ] in room coughing and hacking with your roommate , " said Dr. Christopher Ohl , associate professor of medicine at the Wake Forest University School of Medicine 's Section on Infectious Diseases , in Winston - Salem , N.C. " Obviously , kissing with a surgical mask on is a bit technically difficult .
I do n't think the writer was insinuating that ' If you have to kiss , put on a mask . '
The verbiage could have been clearer . "
But others said the guidance , regardless of intention or verbiage , is simply unrealistic .
" It falls into that category of , ' It 's the right advice , but impractical and hence not going to be followed , ' " said Dr. Gregory Poland , director of the Mayo Vaccine Research Group at the Mayo Clinic in Rochester , Minn .
" I think telling two college students in love not to kiss is neither practical nor informed about human behavior -- do n't tell my grad student daughter I said the latter -- and therefore less helpful than explaining the virus is transmitted by the respiratory route : sneezing , coughing , oral contact , etc . "
Dr. Pascal Imperato , dean of the SUNY Downstate Medical Center School of Public Health in Brooklyn , N.Y. , was less charitable .
" Implying that kissing through a mask is fine probably refers to kissing on the cheek , not the sort of kissing college students usually have in mind when they think of kissing , " Imperato said , adding that in his view , even a kiss on the cheek through a mask would not be wise .
" I suspect that whoever drafted the wording for this recommendation may never have kissed while in college , nor anywhere else for that matter , " he said .
" They really need to revise this statement . "
Meanwhile , Philip Alcabes , author of " Dread : How Fear And Fantasy Have Fueled Epidemics From The Black Death To Avian Flu " and associate professor of Urban Public Health at Hunter College of The City University of New York , said that the recommendations will likely do little to curb the spread of the flu -- and much more to spread fear .
" Of course , it is n't crazy to tell people that kissing could spread flu virus , " he said .
" But [ Thursday's ] CDC guidance -- with masked kissing , flu buddy schemes , and shirt - sleeve sneezing -- is further evidence that panic has set in among officials .
" Probably , our officials are well meaning and concerned with the public 's health .
But it often seems like their overriding concern is n't real programs to stop disease , it 's that they 'll be criticized for doing too little .
And since there 's nothing to be done right now , they just say something .
Anything .
' Masks . ' "
Can Masks Cut the Spread of Swine Flu on Campus ?
It 's not just the kissing guidelines that may pose a problem , SUNY 's Imperato said .
Specifically , sharing of utensils is something that should never be done with an ill friend -- regardless of whether they happen to be wearing a mask or not .
" What is additionally odd is that it implies that such students can share eating and drinking utensils with well contacts , provided that they , the ones ill with the flu , wear a mask , " Imperato said .
" The bottom line here is that students ill with the flu should not be kissing other people nor sharing eating and drinking utensils with them . "
" I guess a mask is better than duct tape , " noted Charles Gerba , a microbiologist at the University of Arizona whose work on microbes has earned him the nickname " Dr. Germ . "
" Some barrier is better than [ none ] at all , but I would just avoid kissing altogether and sharing utensils , or at least wash them , " he said .
" I was trying to figure out how you drink or eat with a face mask on .
I think they must mean if you are in a room where someone is eating or drinking . "
Eating and drinking aside , at least one student -- a nursing major no less -- appeared to agree wholeheartedly with Gerba 's advice .
" I'm a bit germaphobic in general , so I 'd definitely wear a surgical mask , but not for kissing . " said Anna Salinas , 19 , from Goodyear , Ariz .
" It 's better to wait until you 're better . "
Auto - Tune
It ’s been called one of the defining sounds of this era as well as a trend [ that became ] a gimmick .
TIME Magazine acknowledged it as a rare gimmick that can lead to innovation .
Rick Rubin has called its use lazy and argues that using it can remove the emotion from a performance .
All this over a simple computer program ?
Yes , Auto - tune has both captivated audiences and caused tidal waves of hatred usually reserved for Twilight fans .
While Auto - tuned songs have dominated the Billboard charts for months now , I have wondered why this fad – and it is a fad , let ’s not kid ourselves here – is so damn popular .
Then about a few weeks ago it hit me : familiarity .
It really is that simple .
Lemme explain .
Any new trend or movement in popular music has always been new .
That is to say , said trend or movement has always been different than both what was popular at the time ( or , beginning a descent ) and what has come before it in music history .
The most recent example of a major fad in music , of course , was the teen pop explosion of the late ‘ 90s and into the first few years of the current decade .
Never before had pop music been so planned , processed , and packaged before .
Sure , pop music before could be seen as a corporate tool ( ahem , New Kids ) , but at least there was some artistic value in it .
But with Britney , Christina , * NSYNC and Backstreet , it was all about the money .
Yes , Max Martin is a genius and has a remarkable talent for melody .
That was never in question .
But it was all fluff .
Never before had music been purely about the money – right Mr. Pearlman ?
However , with the proliferation of Auto - tune , it ’s entirely different .
Well , almost .
While the use of the program has only been around since the late ‘ 90s ( and the vocal trick upon which it ’s based only since the late ‘ 80s ) , and aside from its use in Cher ’s “ Believe ” and its appearance in Daft Punk records , the program ’s prominence in the last year is pretty much all T - Pain ’s fault .
Thus , the trend of using Auto - tune is new .
But the importance of the program is n’t found in its trend - setting role .
No , instead Auto - tune has done what no other instrument , studio or computer program has ever done before : it has literally made songs – and , more specifically , singers – sound alike .
Critics of popular music trends have always had that complaint of band ‘ X ’ sounds like band ‘ Y ’ which sounds like band ‘ Z ’ because all of them have jumped onto whatever bandwagon was making money at the time .
And while that ’s a valid criticism to an extent , the chord progressions and the melodies were different .
Yet , T - Pain ’s Auto - tuning of vocals has amalgamated every single singer with a current hit into one massive vocal hook .
( For the purposes of this column , “ auto - tuning ” refers to the “ Cher effect ” and not simply using the program as pitch - correcting unless otherwise stated . )
Which brings me back to familiarity .
You see , songs that people love are the ones familiar to them .
They are the ones that people know , and know well .
The familiar makes people feel like they belong and , more importantly , it feels like home , the most recognizable of all places .
Familiar is comfortable because it is known .
It ’s understandable .
It ’s always been there and always will .
There ’s solace in that .
The significance of the familiar within the sphere of music is clear : people listen to the music they love the most .
To wit , my dad grew up listening to the Temptations and still loves ‘em four decades after the fact .
And I ’d bet that whatever music you , dear reader , discovered in high school and / or college is the music that has stuck with you , the music that you adore and spin more than anything else .
Thus : Auto - tune .
If the familiar is what ’s comfortable to people and what ’s comfortable is what people listen to the most often , then why not use a program that , in effect , makes new songs sound like ones that you ’ve heard and love already ?
It ’s so simple .
And so ingenious .
And so fucking evil .
Here ’s why :
For us music critics – and , really , music lovers in general – the thing about music that makes it so wonderful , above anything else , is the craft of songwriting .
But that ’s out the window with T - Pain and his one - trick pony .
Provided he ’s got access to a laptop , he ’s got a hit .
That ’s all he needs .
Sure , the melodies are different across Auto - tuned hits but with respect to their status as hits , it ai n’t about the catchy melody .
It ’s all about that goddamn sound , that one sound that everyone uses .
There ’s no skill , no technique , no talent .
It ’s just laziness .
A talented singer ’s vocal melody is irrelevant if you have Auto - tune .
And that ’s with a talented singer .
What about singers who ca n’t actually sing ?
Well , they get rewarded with airplay and digital downloads , too , thanks to Auto - tune because they do n’t have to be able to sing .
This , of course , raises the question of why anyone would bother using different singers ( in name ) on songs featuring Auto - tune since they sound the same anyway .
Well , that ’s part of the scam , part of the convincing that , yes , these songs are actually different when they ’re not .
It ’s sad that even professional singers admit to using Auto - tune , and not even for that trademark T - Pain sound .
No , actual singers like Faith Hill and Tim McGraw ( interesting how they ’re paired in the media as two different examples … ) have admitted to using the program ( for pitch - correction ) on albums and in concert but to ensure a bankable performance .
That ’s something that needs to be discussed but it ’s somewhat extraneous at this juncture since I ’m just discussing the “ Cher effect . ”
Suffice to say that the voice is an instrument just like any other .
Thus , mistakes , like being off - key , will occur .
But that ’s part of the fun of music .
Since music is a human entity , it is necessarily imperfect .
It should be no surprise , then , that Auto - tune has become quite the divisive issue among musicians .
There are those in support of it like the aforementioned country stars , as well as obvious examples like Will .
I. Am , Mary J. Blige , and Kanye , who , according to producer Mike Dean , “ fell in love ” with the program .
Those that are in Auto - tune ’s corner are ( quite literally ) on record .
Certainly , having a hit would constitute immediate respect .
But those against the program are also ‘ on record ’ about it .
Most notably is Jay - Z who wrote a song about the program ’s over - saturation and called it “ D.O.A. ( Death of Auto - tune ) . ” Moreover , Wyclef Jean also released an anti-Auto - tune song entitled “ Mr. Autotune ” [ sic ] , featuring the rather catchy chorus , “ I ’m Mr. Autotune / If you sing off - key / For a small fee / I can make you a celebrity ” to which Nick Cannon proclaims , “ I wanna make money ! ” to which Jean comes back with , “ Then all you gotta do is pay me /
And I will turn this thing into a karoke party / You ’ll be a superstar . ”
Maybe I ’m just making too big of an issue of this .
It ’s just the “ cool ” ( read : profitable ) thing to do for now .
The trend will die off eventually , so what ’s the harm ?
Honestly , that ’s a rather naïve view of this infection , this virus , this Bubonic plague of popular music .
Auto - tune could very well be the beginning of a much larger movement toward aural finger - painting , a song - craft Philistinism of the lowest order .
In five or ten years , we music critics may be begging for the return of T - Pain .
For now , let ’s hope I ’m wrong .

Nah , this one 's good .
Alright , so it was getting a little crowded in Heaven , so God decided to change the admittance policy .
The new law was that , in order to get into Heaven , you had to have a really bad day when you died .
The Angel at the gate said to the man , " Before I let you in , I need you to tell me how your day was going when you died . "
< ColonelCoroner >
" No problem , " the man said .
" I came home to my 10th floor apartment on my lunch hour and caught my wife half naked .
I knew she was fucking some bitch , I glanced out onto the balcony and noticed that there was a man hanging off the edge by his fingertips !
Well , I ran out onto the balcony and stomped on his fingers until he fell to the ground .
But would n't you know it , he landed in some trees and bushes that broke his fall and he did n't die .
This pissed me off even more .
I wanted to kill the fucker !
So I unplugged my refrigerator , pushed it out onto the balcony , and tipped it over the side .
It plummeted 10 stories and crushed him !
The excitement of the moment was so great that I had a heart attack and died almost instantly . "
< ColonelCoroner >
The Angel considers this , and let 's him in cuz it WAS a bad day ....
The next dude comes up , and is asked the same question .
So the dude replies , " But you 're not going to believe this .
I was on the balcony of my 11th floor apartment doing my daily exercises .
I was really pushing hard , and I guess I got a little carried away , slipped , and accidentally fell over the side !
Luckily , I was able to catch myself by the fingertips on the balcony below mine .
But all of a sudden this crazy man comes running out of his apartment , started cussing , and stomps on my fingers .
I fell and fucking hit some trees and bushes at the bottom which broke my fall so I did n't die right away .
As I 'm laying there face up on the ground in shock and in excruciating pain , I see this guy push his refrigerator , of all things , off the balcony .
It falls the 10 floors and lands on top of me , killing me instantly . "
< Piro-nuts > rofl ...
< ColonelCoroner >
So the Angel chuckles , thinks his job is pretty cool , and let 's this dude in ... the third dude comes up , and again the Angel asks him the same question about how he died .
So the dude goes , ' Okay , picture this , I 'm hiding in this refrigerator right ... "

There is no economy left to recover .
The US manufacturing economy was lost to offshoring and free trade ideology .
It was replaced by a mythical “ New Economy . ”
The “ New Economy ” was based on services .
Its artificial life was fed by the Federal Reserve ’s artificially low interest rates , which produced a real estate bubble , and by “ free market ” financial deregulation , which unleashed financial gangsters to new heights of debt leverage and fraudulent financial products .
The real economy was traded away for a make - believe economy .
When the make - believe economy collapsed , Americans ’ wealth in their real estate , pensions , and savings collapsed dramatically while their jobs disappeared .
The debt economy caused Americans to leverage their assets .
They refinanced their homes and spent the equity .
They maxed out numerous credit cards .
They worked as many jobs as they could find .
Debt expansion and multiple family incomes kept the economy going .
And now suddenly Americans can’t borrow in order to spend .
They are over their heads in debt .
Jobs are disappearing .
America ’s consumer economy , approximately 70 percent of GDP , is dead .
Those Americans who still have jobs are saving against the prospect of job loss .
Millions are homeless .
Some have moved in with family and friends ; others are living in tent cities .
Meanwhile the US government ’s budget deficit has jumped from $ 455 billion in 2008 to $ 2,000 billion this year , with another $ 2,000 billion on the books for 2010 .
And President Obama has intensified America ’s expensive war of aggression in Afghanistan and initiated a new war in Pakistan .
There is no way for these deficits to be financed except by printing money or by further collapse in stock markets that would drive people out of equity into bonds .
The US government ’s budget is 50 percent in the red .
That means half of every dollar the federal government spends must be borrowed or printed .
Because of the worldwide debacle caused by Wall Street ’s financial gangsterism , the world needs its own money and has n’t $ 2 trillion annually to lend to Washington .
As dollars are printed , the growing supply adds to the pressure on the dollar ’s role as reserve currency .
Already America ’s largest creditor , China , is admonishing Washington to protect China ’s investment in US debt and is lobbying for a new reserve currency to replace the dollar before it collapses .
According to various reports , China is spending down its holdings of US dollars by acquiring gold and stocks of raw materials and energy .
The price of one - ounce gold coins is $ 1,000 despite efforts of the US government to hold down the gold price .
How high will this price jump when the rest of the world decides that the bankruptcy of “ the world ’s only superpower ” is at hand ?
And what will happen to America ’s ability to import not only oil , but also the manufactured goods on which it is import - dependent ?
When the oversupplied US dollar loses the reserve currency role , the US will no longer be able to pay for its massive imports of real goods and services with pieces of paper .
Overnight , shortages will appear and Americans will be poorer .
Nothing in Presidents Bush and Obama ’s economic policy addresses the real issues .
Instead , Goldman Sachs was bailed out , more than once .
As Eliot Spitzer said , the banks made a “ bloody fortune ” with US aid .
It was not the millions of now homeless homeowners who were bailed out .
It was not the scant remains of American manufacturing — General Motors and Chrysler — that were bailed out .
It was the Wall Street banks .
According to Bloomberg.com , Goldman Sachs ’ current record earnings from their free or low cost capital supplied by broke American taxpayers has led the firm to decide to boost compensation and benefits by 33 percent .
On an annual basis , this comes to compensation of $ 773,000 per employee .
This should tell even the most dimwitted patriot who “ their ” government represents .
The worst of the economic crisis has not yet hit .
I do n’t mean the rest of the real estate crisis that is waiting in the wings .
Home prices will fall further when the foreclosed properties currently held off the market are dumped .
Store and office closings are adversely impacting the ability of owners of shopping malls and office buildings to make their mortgage payments .
Commercial real estate loans were also securitized and turned into derivatives .
The real crisis awaits us .
It is the crisis of high unemployment , of stagnant and declining real wages confronted with rising prices from the printing of money to pay the government ’s bills and from the dollar ’s loss of exchange value .
Suddenly , Wal - Mart prices will look like Nieman Marcus prices .
Retirees dependent on state pension systems , which cannot print money , might not be paid , or might be paid with IOUs .
They will not even have depreciating money with which to try to pay their bills .
Desperate tax authorities will squeeze the remaining life out of the middle class .
Nothing in Obama ’s economic policy is directed at saving the US dollar as reserve currency or the livelihoods of the American people .
Obama ’s policy , like Bush ’s before him , is keyed to the enrichment of Goldman Sachs and the armament industries .
Matt Taibbi describes Goldman Sachs as “ a great vampire squid wrapped around the face of humanity , relentless jamming its blood funnel into anything that smells like money . ”
Look at the Goldman Sachs representatives in the Clinton , Bush and Obama administrations .
This bankster firm controls the economic policy of the United States .
Little wonder that Goldman Sachs has record earnings while the rest of us grow poorer by the day .

And when high energy costs make it too expensive to get our manufactured goods from slaves in Asia or Central America , then what ?
– K.R .
In southern California 's Antelope Valley , 24,000 silver - bright mirrors have been positioned to reflect light on two 50 - meter - tall towers .
And at 11:08 A.M. local time Wednesday , this concentrated light heated steam in those towers to turn a turbine — the first " power towers " in the U.S. to convert the sun 's heat into electricity for commercial use .
Dubbed Sierra SunTower , the power plant can produce five megawatts , enough to power roughly 4,000 local homes at full capacity — and provide the modular blueprint for larger plants in California and New Mexico , according to eSolar , the Pasadena start - up behind the power plant .
" We call this a commercial demonstration , " says eSolar senior vice president of engineering Craig Tyner .
" A 46 - megawatt commercial design will incorporate 16 of these towers , two of which we have at Sierra " as well as more than 200,000 mirrors capable of generating at least 90 gigawatt - hours of electricity per year .
Harvesting the sun 's energy as heat is hardly a new idea : During the energy crisis of the 1970s , designs for solar thermal power plants took off .
And ever since 1984 , vast arrays of curved mirrors have been concentrating the sun 's rays on pipelines filled with synthetic oil at the Solar Energy Generating Systems ( SEGS ) power plant in California 's Mojave Desert .
But power towers , at least theoretically , would be more efficient than these so - called parabolic trough designs , because all the heating and fluid is contained in one central tower .
The key to eSolar 's design are the mirrors — known as heliostats in the concentrating –solar power industry .
By precisely calibrating the mirrors with computer algorithms driving shoe box–size motors , eSolar can build its sunlight - harvesting power plants with many more small , flat mirrors , roughly one square meter in size , as opposed to the large , curved specialty mirrors employed in other designs .
" We 're using more software algorithms and less steel , " says Bill Gross , CEO of the Google - backed solar company who , at the age of 15 in 1973 , started Solar Devices , a firm which sold plans and kits for solar power , before pioneering pay - to - click advertising for search engines in the 1990s .
But the multiplicity of mirrors could also prove the technology 's weakest link .
" The question is going to be the maintenance of all those heliostats , " says Mark Mehos , program manager for concentrating solar power at the U.S. Department of Energy 's National Renewable Energy Laboratory in Golden , Colo .
" You have orders of magnitude more heliostats that you 're going to have to maintain and that you 're going to have to track . "
Sierra SunTower has a number of environmental points in its favor in addition to the renewable energy it generates .
It employs reclaimed water for its cooling and was built near existing transmission lines on what used to be farmland rather than the pristine desert areas nearby that have provoked opposition to some other planned solar power plants .
" This model makes the destruction of public lands unjustified , " says David Myers , executive director of nonprofit environmental group the Wildlands Conservancy .
" There are 200,000 acres in southern California of lands that are degraded or disturbed that we support for solar electricity . "
Gross , for his part , estimates that the entire state of California 's peak electricity demand could be generated from an eSolar field of 65 square kilometers .
That electricity would cost no more than 13 cents per kilowatt - hour , the current average price of power in the state , although the company refused to reveal how much the existing plant cost to build or what price Southern California Edison is paying for the power .
" This is a second industrial revolution to power the planet cost - effectively from the sun , " Gross says .
Of course , the sun does n't always shine and , at present , the eSolar design has limited capacity to store energy — either as heat or electricity — nor does it supplement production by burning natural gas as some other existing concentrating solar power plants do .
" It 's 100 percent solar , " Tyner says , although he anticipates incorporating heat storage in molten salts or some other energy storage technology in the next generation design due in two years or so .
As it stands , eSolar expects to generate five megawatts of electricity with its refurbished 1940s - vintage General Electric steam turbines roughly 25 percent of the time , which coincides generally with peak demand for electricity , Tyner says .
And the efficiency with which a field generates electricity can be improved in the future by moving to higher temperature operation , he adds ; the current design employs steam at 440 degrees Celsius and 63 kilograms per square centimeter of pressure at peak capacity .
The company has paired with NRG Energy , Inc. , to develop two full - scale power plants totalling 92 megawatts in New Mexico as well as 337 megawatts of further power towers in California .
The company plans to begin construction of the New Mexico plant next spring and complete it by the summer of 2011 .
It has also partnered with the ACME Group in India to develop roughly one gigawatt of power tower capacity in that country .
And eSolar is not alone .
Rival developer BrightSource has contracted with Southern California Edison for 1,300 megawatts worth of similar power towers , among other projects gaining steam .
Whether this is truly the dawn of a new , cheap solar energy era will be proved at power towers like this one — as well as two operated by Abengoa in Spain .
After all , " the one hurdle towers still face is demonstrated performance and reliability .
This plant should help that , " NREL 's Mehos adds .
" It 's a big step forward for just demonstrating this technology .
Every mirror counts . "
We 've witnessed a very interesting development cycle with the Zune HD , getting to witness the software at various early stages of development , instead of a completed device all at once .
Our latest glimpse of the player is along the lines of what 's been cropping up the last week or so : wild transitions , fun motion graphics and plenty of beautiful media to show it all off with .
We did get to touch the new keyboard briefly , and while there 's no telling what sort of predictive text Microsoft has worked in , since we only had a URL bar to work with , it 's a passable ( and certainly beautiful ) attempt to cram a full QWERTY touchscreen keyboard into such a small device .
Reports are conflicting as to whether there will be a landscape keyboard in the final build of the device , but it 's been spotted in some iterations of the device -- it did n't show up when we tried to rotate the player , however .
Unfortunately , while the browser is up and running , the hotel we were at was n't able to offer us a working internet connection -- hopefully we 'll be able to rectify that soon .
For now hold tight , check out the gallery below and the peep the video after the break for a magical exploration of the Zune HD 's truly impressive interface .

On the left is a vehicle with a hydrogen tank , and on the right a vehicle with a standard gasoline tank .
Both tanks have been deliberately punctured and ignited .
The top panel shows the two vehicles 3 seconds after ignition .
We see that , due to the buoyancy of hydrogen , the flame shoots up vertically , whereas gasoline is heavy and spreads beneath the vehicle .
The bottom panel shows the two vehicles 60 seconds after ignition .
The hydrogen supply has burned off and the flame is diminished , whereas the gasoline fire has accelerated and has totally engulfed the vehicle on the right .
Note that hydrogen flames are not intrinsically visible , but salt and particles in the ambient air burn off giving color to the flame as seen above .

( PhysOrg.com ) --
As the world 's oil supply continues to dry out every day , the question of what will replace oil and other fossil fuels is becoming more and more urgent .
According to the World Coal Institute , at the present rate of consumption , coal will run out in 130 years , natural gas in 60 years , and oil in 42 years .
Around the world , researchers are investigating alternative energy technologies with encouraging progress - but the question still remains : which source (s ) will prove to be most efficient and sustainable in 30 , 50 , or 100 years from now ?
For Derek Abbott , Professor of Electrical Engineering at the University of Adelaide in Australia , the answer is clear .
In an invited opinion piece to be published in the Proceedings of the IEEE , Abbott argues that a solar - hydrogen economy is more sustainable and provides a vastly higher total power output potential than any other alternative .
While he agrees with the current approach of promoting a mix of energy sources in the transition period toward a sustainable energy technology , he shows that solar - hydrogen should be the final goal of current energy policy .
Eventually , as he suggests , this single dominant solution might supply 70 % of the world 's energy while the remaining 30 % is supplied by a mix of other sources .
" My starting point is as an academic who always thought nuclear was the answer , but who then looked at the figures and came to an inescapable conclusion that solar - hydrogen is the long - term future , " Abbott told PhysOrg.com .
" I did not come at this as a green evangelist .
I am a reluctant convert .
I deliberately do n't even mention the word CO 2 once in my paper , in order to demonstrate that one can justify solar - hydrogen simply on grounds of economic resource viability without any green agenda . "
In his paper , Abbott begins by providing an overview of the major non-renewable and renewable energy sources .
To briefly summarize :
Nuclear fission :
While nuclear fission power plants may at first seem to have the economic advantage , they have " hidden costs " ( the biggest being the $ 6 billion cost to decommission after a 30 - or 40 - year lifetime ) .
In addition , nuclear fission is n't sustainable : if fission hypothetically supplied the world 's energy needs , there would only be five years ' supply of uranium ; and thorium , a suggested substitute , has a recoverable supply of only half of the world 's uranium reserves .
Nuclear fusion : Abbott argues that nuclear fusion , which usually involves the fusion of deuterium and tritium , is not actually clean or sustainable .
In addition to suffering from the same hidden costs as fission , tritium is considered dangerous enough to require weekly cleaning ( as in the case of the International Thermonuclear Experimental Reactor ) .
Plus , tritium is bred by reacting neutrons with lithium ; Abbott estimates that the world 's lithium reserves would last about 100 years if it were to supply the world 's energy along with continuing use in industrial applications , such as batteries , glass , ceramics , and lubricants .
Wind : Abbott explains that wind actually comes from the sun ( since the sun heats the ground creating massive convection currents , meaning that wind is a diluted form of solar power ) , although he shows that wind power is economically uncompetitive with solar power in all locations except cold regions with poor sun levels .
Further , a typical 1.5 - MW wind turbine requires 20 gallons of lubricating oil every 5 years , which would become unsustainable in a few decades .

On a related note , Abbott emphasizes that we need to preserve at least some of our remaining oil for uses other than energy - such as lubricating the world 's engines , as well as for making dyes , plastics , and synthetic rubber .
Likewise , natural gas has industrial applications for making ammonia , glass and plastics , and coal for making soap , aspirin , tires , and other materials .
Hydroelectric : Hydroelectricity currently provides 20 % of the world 's electricity , with room for further growth .
However , hydroelectricity could not supply the whole world 's power due to the limited availability of waterways .
Plus , dams often have negative effects on aquatic ecosystems , as well as tourism , fisheries , and transport .
Abbott also notes that , like wind , hydroelectric power is ultimately powered by the sun ( via rain ) , a reminder that tapping the sun directly can offer large amounts of power .
Geothermal : Pumping water below the Earth 's crust to create steam that can be used to generate electricity , geothermal power has shown to be cost - effective and sustainable , due to the large amounts of heat contained in the Earth .
The downside , Abbott says , is that much of the energy is diffuse and unrecoverable , so that geothermal power could ultimately supply only a fraction of the world 's energy needs .
In some cases , geothermal is also known to trigger unwanted seismic activity , and can bring toxic chemicals , such as hydrogen sulphide , arsenic , and mercury , to the Earth 's surface .
Solar : For Abbott , the unambiguous leader of alternative energy sources is solar power , especially low - tech solar thermal collectors rather than high - tech silicon solar cells .
Today , the world 's energy consumption is currently 15 TeraWatts ( TW ) ( 15 x 10 ^ 12 watts ) .
The total solar energy that strikes the Earth is 166 Petawatts ( PW ) ( 166 x 10^15 watts ) .
Even with 50 % of this energy being reflected back into space or absorbed by clouds , the remaining 83 PW is more than 5,000 times our present global energy consumption .
In contrast , the above sources of renewable energy ( wind , hydroelectric , and geothermal ) can supply less than 1 % of solar power potential .
The challenge , of course , is how to harness this large source of renewable , sustainable solar energy .
" The fact that there simply is 5,000 times more sun power than our consumption needs makes me very optimistic , " Abbott said .
" It 's a fantastic resource .
We have the ingenuity to send man to the moon , so we definitively have the ingenuity to tap the sun 's resources . "
Despite the improvements in silicon solar cells , Abbott argues that they suffer from low efficiencies and high environmental impact compared with solar thermal collectors .
Solar cells require large amounts of water and arsenic ; Abbott calculates that manufacturing enough solar cells to power the world would require 6 million tonnes of arsenic , while the world 's supply is estimated at about 1 million tonnes .
Even the overall solar cell design is fundamentally flawed , he says .
Solar cell semiconductor reliability drops as temperature increases , yet large temperature differences are required to increase thermodynamic efficiency .
For this reason , semiconductor technology is much better suited to lower powers and temperatures , such as pocket calculators .
On the other hand , solar thermal collectors are specifically designed to operate under hot temperatures .
The idea is to use a curved mirror to focus sunlight to boil water and create steam , which is then used to power , for example , a Stirling heat engine to produce electricity .
The system has already been demonstrated in California 's Mojave Desert , which has been using a solar thermal system to heat oil in a closed - cycle instead of water for the past 20 years .
At the Stirling Energy Systems suncatcher dish farm being developed in California , 38 - foot - diameter dishes power track the sun and each power a 25 kW Stirling cycle generator .

Abbott calculates that , in order to supply the world 's energy needs , the footprint of such a system with pessimistic assumptions would be equivalent to a plot of land of about 1250 km by 1250 km - about 8 % of the land area of the hot deserts of the world .
With less pessimistic assumptions , the land area could be reduced to 500 km by 500 km , corresponding to 1.7 billion solar dishes that are each 10 meters wide .
At massive volumes , if these Stirling engine dishes could be produced at a cost of $ 1,000 each , the total world cost would be $ 1.7 trillion - " which is less than the going rate of a war these days , " Abbott noted .
He also believes that further cost savings can be made by considering 30 - meter diameter dishes , driving much larger Rankine engines , in order to reduce overhead and maintenance costs .
Ideally , Abbott says , solar farms should be distributed widely throughout the world in order to avoid geopolitical stresses and minimize transportation costs .
Solar farms of one or two square km could be built in deserts in many regions : the Americas , Africa , Australasia , Asia , and the Middle East .
Hydrogen :
After connecting these solar farms to the local electricity grid , the electricity could then be used to electrolyze water to produce liquid hydrogen to run our vehicles .
Abbott suggests that the next step would be to power public transport , such as buses , using liquid hydrogen .
Then consumers could buy liquid hydrogen cars and refuel at public transport depots for a transition period until existing gasoline stations begin providing liquid hydrogen refueling .
" Governments should begin by setting up sizable solar farms that supplement existing grid electricity and provide enough hydrogen to power buses , " Abbott said .
" Enthusiasts will then buy hydrogen cars , retrofit existing cars , and refuel at bus depots .
Then things will grow from there .
You gotta start somewhere . "
According to Abbott , running vehicles on hydrogen rather than electricity is superior in terms of sustainability .
The batteries in electric vehicles consume chemicals and finite resources such as lithium , and release high levels of toxic waste .
On the other hand , vehicles that burn hydrogen simply emit clean water vapor , and do not require the unsustainable use of chemicals .
Other advantages of hydrogen vehicles are that today 's gasoline combustion engines can be retrofitted to run on hydrogen , and the car manufacturing industry has infrastructure tailored to combustion technology .
" With solar - hydrogen , questions of safe handling are not the issue , " Abbott said .
" Industry already uses 50 million tonnes of hydrogen annually , and so storage and handling are well - trodden areas .
The BMW company has demonstrated the hydrogen combustion engine in a family - sized car [ the BMW Hydrogen 7 ] .
Also , 20 % of buses in Berlin use hydrogen combustion . "
Unlike many other current hydrogen - powered vehicles , the BMW Hydrogen 7 directly ignites the hydrogen in its internal combustion engine .

Despite the advantages , hydrogen fuel technology still faces challenges .
For instance , the electrodes used in water electrolysis are currently coated with platinum , which is not a sustainable resource , and researchers are currently investigating other materials .
Other issues include transporting hydrogen - a recent study has shown that it is more economical to deliver hydrogen by truck to refueling stations rather than perform on - site electrolysis .
Another hurdle is storage - in terms of sustainability , Abbott suggests that the most straightforward approach is to liquefy the hydrogen .
Although liquefying hydrogen requires an additional energy cost , Abbott argues that the scenario should not be mistaken for a zero - sum game as is the case with fossil fuels .
Since the sun supplies a virtually unlimited amount of energy , the solution is to factor in the non-recurring cost of extra solar collectors to provide the energy for liquefaction .
His calculations show that the cost of a solar collector farm used to produce hydrogen is still lower than a nuclear station of equivalent power .
Overall , Abbott 's message is that there exists a single technology that can supply the world 's energy needs in a clean , sustainable way : solar - hydrogen .
The difference in his approach compared to other analyses , he explains , is his long - term perspective .
While nuclear power is often cited to be the economically favorable technology in the short - term , Abbott argues that the long - term return on nuclear power is virtually zero due to its limited lifetime , while solar - hydrogen power can theoretically last us the next one billion years .
" The biggest challenge is escaping from the economic effects of vendor lock - in where large investments in nuclear and traditional energy sources keep us ' locked - in ' to feeding monsters that will bring us down an economic black hole , " Abbott said .
" It 's rather like the play The Little Shop of Horrors where a man-eating plant is initially fed small amounts , but then its voracious appetite sends it into a downward spiral swallowing up anyone that gets in its way . "
Of course , Abbott 's analysis is just one approach in the ongoing debate on the advantages and disadvantages of hydrogen .
Among several reviews published in a special issue of the Proceedings of the IEEE in October 2006 is an analysis by Ulf Bossel , which shows that a hydrogen economy is uncompetitive due to the energy costs of storage , transportation , etc .
Abbott agrees that hydrogen is not an efficient energy storage method , but he also points out that energy from the sun is virtually unlimited , and more solar collectors could make up for the inefficiency of hydrogen technology .
" The Bossel paper did not consider the case of using sun to generate the hydrogen , " Abbott said .
" So , of course all the inefficiencies added up and hydrogen looked bad compared to fossil fuels .
But the point about solar energy is that there is so much of it that you only have to tap 5 % of it at an efficiency as tiny as 1 % and you already have energy over 5 times the whole world 's present consumption .
" This demonstrates that efficiency is not the issue when you go solar .
There is so much solar that all you have to do is invest in the non-recurring cost of more dishes to drive a solar - hydrogen economy at whatever efficiency it happens to sit at .
I show in my paper that if you do this you come out cheaper than nuclear and you take up less than 8 % of the world 's desert area .
...
So let 's begin now , what are we waiting for ? "

Why a hydrogen economy does n't make sense
British scientists have appealed to the World Health Organisation to publicly condemn homeopathy as a treatment for serious diseases , such as HIV , TB and malaria .
The researchers , many of whom have worked in developing countries , called on the WHO to act amid fears that vulnerable patients are dying after turning to homeopathic preparations instead of effective medicines .
The WHO works with national organisations that promote homeopathy and other alternative medicines in their public health programmes .
Homeopathy practitioners have opened clinics throughout Asian and sub-Saharan Africa and offer to treat patients with HIV , malaria , influenza and childhood diarrhoea , none of which have been shown to respond to homeopathy .
Many patients are told that conventional drugs work only temporarily and that homeopathic preparations are cheap and effective alternatives with fewer side effects .
" Those of us working with the most rural and impoverished people of the world already struggle to deliver the medical help that is needed .
When homeopathy stands in place of effective treatment , lives are lost , " the scientists write in an open letter to the organisation .
Homeopathic medicines are made by repeatedly diluting preparations with water until there is no trace left of the original compound .
The overwhelming medical opinion is that homeopathic treatments are no more effective than placebos .
" The WHO 's strategy is very unclear on homeopathy and that is shocking .
They are supposed to be articulating evidence - based medicine , but their stance is very wishy - washy , " said Dr Daniella Muallem , a biophysicist at University College London , who signed the letter .
" Homeopathy is cheap , but there is no evidence that it works for these diseases , and the way they are being sold by practitioners is dangerous and completely unethical .
There are medicines that do work and we should be advocating trying to get those to people , " Muallem added .
According to WHO estimates , 33 million people were living with the HIV virus at the end of 2007 , and during that one year , 2 million people died of Aids , including 270,000 children .
Two - thirds of the world 's HIV cases are in sub-Saharan Africa .
The organisation recorded 247 million cases of malaria and nearly 1 million deaths in 2006 .
A child dies of the disease every 30 seconds .
In the letter , early career medics and researchers from the Voice of Young Science network highlight homeopathy projects in Kenya , Tanzania , Ethiopia , Ghana and Botswana that all offer to treat patients with HIV , malaria , diarrhoea or the flu .
" Many people in developing countries urgently need access to evidence - based medical information and to the most effective means of treating these dangerous diseases .
The promotion of homeopathy as effective or cheaper makes this difficult task even harder .
It put lives at risk , undermines conventional medicine and spreads misinformation , " the letter says .
Raymond Tallis , emeritus professor of geriatric medicine at Manchester University , said : " The catastrophic consequences of promoting irrational and ineffective treatments for serious illnesses have been demonstrated in South Africa , where Thabo Mbeki 's policies have led to an estimated 365,000 unnecessary premature deaths .
The prospect of replicating this reckless behaviour elsewhere in developing countries by advocating homeopathic treatments for AIDs and other potentially lethal conditions is appalling . "

Breathing in the hormone oxytocin has been shown in recent years to trigger all kinds of feel - good emotions in people , such as trust , empathy and generosity .
Now scientists find it might have a dark side : Snorting oxytocin might also incite envy and gloating .
Past studies have shown that oxytocin plays a wide role in social bonding in mammals — between mates , for instance , or mother and child — and recent work suggested the hormone was linked with pro-social behavior in people , such as altruism .
Still , neuroscientist Simone Shamay - Tsoory in University of Haifa in Israel and her colleagues noted that oxytocin was found to raise aggression in rodents , suggesting the hormone might play a wider role in social emotions in humans .
The researchers decided to investigate envy and gloating — feelings related to the tendency to compare oneself with others — to see if oxytocin ramped up these emotions or dialed them down .
The researchers gave 56 volunteers either oxytocin or a placebo and paid them to take part in a game of chance with another participant which , unknown to them , was a computer .
They were shown three doors on a video screen , either red , blue or yellow , and told that behind each door was a different sum of money they could keep after the game .
The computer was programmed to either win more money than the players to trigger feelings of envy , lose more money to elicit a form of gloating known as schadenfreude ( delight over another 's misfortune ) or to win or lose equal amounts of money .
To encourage these negative emotions , the researchers gave the computer player an arrogant " personality " .
They did this by asking the volunteers to appraise their chances of winning more money than the other player ; although nearly all volunteers predicted 50 – 50 odds , they were told their opponents gave themselves an 80 percent chance of winning .
When compared with a placebo , volunteers who inhaled oxytocin said they felt greater levels of envy or gloating when they lost or won more money than the computer , respectively — findings the researchers detailed online July 29 in Biological Psychiatry .
On the other hand , when the volunteers were questioned after the game , inhaling oxytocin apparently had no effect either following gains of equal amounts of money or on mood in general .
The researchers suggest oxytocin might promote the intensity of social emotions in general , leading to more generosity and trust in positive contexts and more envy and gloating in competitive situations .
Shamay - Tsoory notes that scientists are investigating oxytocin for a number of psychiatric treatments to enhance positive feelings in autism , social phobias and other disorders .
" We suggest that it is essential to also inventory potential undesirable effects of such treatments , " she says .
Psychologist Beate Ditzen at the University of Zurich , who did not participate in this study , notes this work does show that oxytocin does not have solely positive effects in humans .
She conjectures , however , that negative effects might still have pro-social effects in the long term — other studies hint that the threat of punishment may be key to cooperation .
To better understand these seemingly contradictory effects of oxytocin , cognitive neuroscientist Mauricio Delgado at Rutgers University suggests it would be interesting to see how the hormone 's effects on an emotional response such as envy might influence actual behavior , such as whether to trust money with a potential investor .
" Based on the current paper , you would expect a person with greater feelings of envy to also not ' trust ' or share money with another individual , therefore supporting the notion that oxytocin is not involved with pro-social behaviors exclusively , " Delgado explains .
" However , it is possible that oxytocin makes a person feel envious , but at the time of acting or making a decision they still display pro-social attitudes — sharing with the other individual — thus reconciling the discordant findings . "

Seeking Self - Determination Is Not Selfish
Two hundred years and 25 days before I was born , some wise men wrote the following stirring words :
We hold these truths to be self - evident , that all men are created equal , that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights , that among these are Life , Liberty and the pursuit of Happiness . —
That to secure these rights , Governments are instituted among Men , deriving their just powers from the consent of the governed , — That whenever any Form of Government becomes destructive of these ends , it is the Right of the People to alter or to abolish it , and to institute new Government , laying its foundation on such principles and organizing its powers in such form , as to them shall seem most likely to effect their Safety and Happiness .
Prudence , indeed , will dictate that Governments long established should not be changed for light and transient causes ; and accordingly all experience hath shewn that mankind are more disposed to suffer , while evils are sufferable than to right themselves by abolishing the forms to which they are accustomed .
But when a long train of abuses and usurpations , pursuing invariably the same Object evinces a design to reduce them under absolute Despotism , it is their right , it is their duty , to throw off such Government , and to provide new Guards for their future security .
And so the nation was founded on the principle of political self - determination via secession and settling the frontier .
Not abandoning law for anarchy , not might makes right , not selfishness and greed , but the simple idea that a group of people who feel their government is not serving them and will not change have not only the right but the duty to create a new system which will better effect their Safety and Happiness .
It is this tradition in which seasteading was conceived , and this tradition in which libertarians want to use it .
We are a small group with their own vision of a just society which is not shared by the majority , and thus we have little political influence in America .
Like anyone else , we do n’t like this , and would like to achieve political self - determination .
If we are so passionate about this vision and so dedicated to it as to be willing to leave our home country to achieve it , then to mock and prevent us is at best churlish and at worst a form of political imprisonment .
Brad Reed somehow fails to connect these dots in his Alternet piece : Seasteading : Libertarians Set to Launch a ( Wet ) Dream of ‘ Freedom ’ in International Waters .
With delightful candor , he states :
Before I continue , I ’d like to point out that while I ’m not a libertarian , I do value the contributions that they make to our political discourse .
Think of libertarians as the short - sellers of state power — the people in the back of the room who reflexively call “ Bullshit ! ” whenever the government tries to expand its reach .
While I think they ’re often misguided , their role as bipartisan skeptics of government intervention is a necessary and important component of any democracy .
That said , libertarians can get themselves in trouble when they fail to accept that they ’re doomed to be a frustrated minority who only score points when the government tries to overreach its authority .
While I share his viewpoint that libertarians are “ Doomed to be a frustrated minority ” , it makes his later perplexity about why libertarians would want to expatriate rather baffling :
In the end , the strangest part about the seastead project is n’t its founders ’ impracticalities but rather their base motivations .
Normally , when a minority of people want to break off from their homeland to form a new country it ’s because of genuine oppression such as religious persecution , ethnic cleansing or taxation without representation .
Thiel , on the other hand , lives in a society whose promotion of capitalism has let him grow rich enough to blow $ 500,000 founding his own personal no -girls - allowed treehouse in the middle of the Pacific Ocean .
What exactly does he have to be angry about , again ?
Now , I can understand him not finding the libertarian vision of a just society appealing .
Most people do n’t – that ’s why libertarians are doomed to be a frustrated minority .
But in a country founded on the idea that people should be free to determine their political destiny , what is strange about people who do n’t feel they have that freedom wanting it ?
I do n’t agree with the types of oppression which the author has determined are “ genuine ” , on a practical or historical basis .
First , his list neglects political self - determination , the principle that led the founding fathers to revolt , and one which modern American liberals have supported for a number of breakaway republics .
And second , he includes “ taxation without representation ” , yet does n’t seem to realize that someone in a tiny political minority in a democracy has little more effective representation than , say , a colonist ruled by a remote sovereign .
( Especially with FPTP voting ) .
If you have the good fortune to adhere to one of the two popular political belief clusters in America , try to imagine the situation of the libertarian .
Pretend that the only top - two Presidential candidate your party ever ran was way back in 1964 , and he was crushed in one of the most lopsided elections in the nation ’s history .
Pretend that your party is currently represented by a single Congressman , who had to run under a mainstream party to be elected to Congress , and who entered the Presidential primary , ran a massively successful campaign by your party ’s standards , and still only got a few percent of the primary vote .
Can you see why you might be a bit down on democracy – at least with this set of voters ?
There is something almost zen - like in Mr. Reed ’s ability to simultaneously hold these two contradictory thoughts : to be outraged about the idea of women having no political influence in a democracy , while being outraged that libertarians might object to having no political influence in a democracy .
Perhaps this is because he believes in the romance of democracy – that what matters is getting to vote , and not whether your vote ends up giving you a voice in government and giving you a country vaguely like the one you want .
Or perhaps it is simply that he likes women and hates libertarians .
Either way , let us have no more of this facile musing about what the silly privileged libertarians might possibly have to be angry about .
We are angry because we have no political influence and no chance at getting any via the current system , because we see through the ( admittedly brilliant ) mirage of the ballot box which makes everyone feel counted even when they never win .
Our movement is unusual in that it is based on beliefs , not ethnicity , and has no geographic center ( though NH is trying ) , but just like any other secession movement , it is based on the desire for political self - determination .
We may be a frustrated minority , but we do n’t have to be a doomed one .
Is that really so hard to understand ?

Tore waren gestern und Gleiches gilt für langweilige Wände , eintönige Türen und farblose Kühlschränke , denn nicht nur Garagen , sondern auch Innenbereiche lassen sich dank style - your - garage.com im Handumdrehen mit starken Bildern verschönern .
Die lichtechten , wetterfesten und aus hochwertigem Material gefertigten Garagenplanen werden mithilfe eines Spezialklettbands angebracht , Wandfolien sind selbstklebend gestaltet , doppelseitiges Klebeband fixiert die Türfolien , und Kühlschrankfolien haften von allein auf metallisch - magnetischem Grund .
Insgesamt stehen mehr als 350 Motive in sieben Standardgrößen zur Wahl .
Natürlich können alle Planen und Folien mühelos und rückstandsfrei entfernt werden - etwa dann , wenn man sie gegen ein neues Motiv austauschen will .
Dabei darf es sich sogar um ein selbstgeschossenes
Foto handeln , das - vergrößert und in perfekter Qualität gedruckt - auf Plane oder Folie prangt .
Der Fantasie sind dabei keine Grenzen gesetzt .
I have just upgraded to the latest version of Firefox .
While there are many new features in 3.5 , the one that you will probably notice first is the addition of a button to the right of your tabs that will open a new blank tab .
Since I use shortcut keys to open a new tab this button is pretty much useless to me .
I like to keep my browser as uncluttered as possible .
Fortunately , if you are n’t afraid of some minor text editing you can remove this button in about one minute .
You ’ll need to find your user profile for Firefox which contains the userChrome.css file .
On my XP computer it is located here :
C: \Documents and Settings\< your_account > \Application Data\Mozilla\Firefox \Profiles\ftz0ce5v.default\chrome
On OS X you will find this file here :
~/ Library / Application Support / Firefox / Profiles / ftz0ce5v.default/chrome /
On Windows 7 :
%appdata%/Mozilla/Firefox/Profiles/ftz0ce5v.default/chrome
Note that ‘ ftz0ce5 v ’ is randomly generated by Firefox so you will see something slightly different .
Once in this directory you should see a file named ‘ userChrome-example.css ’ .
Make a copy of this file in the same directory and rename it to ‘ userChrome.css ’ .
Open the file you have just created an add the following line :
.tabs-newtab-button {display : none}
Restart Firefox and you will see the button is gone .
IKEA Catalog anno 1965
My parents like to keep the annual IKEA catalogs – it says it is the most printed book ( edit : printed publication ) after the bible .
Yesterday my mum showed me this ….
the IKEA catalog from the year 1965 .
It is not in the best shape and the front cover is missing , but still an extraordinarie experience to look through .
“ Furnish 2 rooms , kitchen and hall for less than 3300 crowns ” it says here on the ad below .
Like something ?
You could try if this order form still works ….

Square Enix just recently revealed races and jobs in their next upcoming MMORPG titled ‘ Final Fantasy XIV ’ .
A user named Ryumihyoh on eorzeapedia forum has spotted the detailed information in a Japanese magazine with scans of pictures of the new races and classes .
The new races are pretty much the same as Final Fantasy XI , just with different longer names this time around .
Such as a Taru Taru will be named Lalafell , which makes no sense to me why would Square Enix change the race name ..
The new races ( names ) consist of the following Hyuran ( Humes in FFXI ) , Lalafell ( Taru Taru in FFXI ) , Elzen ( Elvaan in FFXI ) , Miqo’te ( Mithra in FFIX ) and Roegadyn ( Galkas in FFXI ) .
Also , you can customize your character ’s features in many ways as stated in the magazine :
I had to edit the dx tool to allow up to a 1024 M heap , since JRuby 's jar has a ton of stuff in it
I had to catch and swallow an ArrayIndexOutOfBounds exception coming out of Dalvik 's enum support .
Bug !
Ability to run 100 % precompiled with no runtime code generation
Strip out parser , interpreter , compiler , and bytecode - generation bits to shrink the jar
Tidy up the AOT compiler and wire it into the app build process
Generate some Ruby stub logic for the Android APIs , so they 'll work well from Ruby
Strip down the weirder and wilder Ruby features ( eval , etc ) to allow fastest - possible execution
Update : Good news , everyone !
First , the two bugs I 've encountered have both been previously reported and are due to be fixed in an upcoming Android release .
They are the enum bug and the reflection bug
Second , someone going by the handle of " Psycho " reports in the comments that the next version of the Android Scripting Environment ( ASE ) will include JRuby support !
Of course I 'm interested in more than just scripting applications with JRuby ... I 'd like to be able to write applications using only Ruby code , so I 'll continue working on this .
But JRuby support seems to be coming in from all directions .
It 's been a while since I was able to work on JRuby 's Android support , but tonight I managed to finally circle back .
And I 've got something much more impressive working today : a real IRB application !
( And yes , this works just fine on the phone too )
It turned out to be incredibly easy to get this working .
I 'm not using any stinking plugin because they all seemed to just get in my way .
So I generated a dummy application using the " android " tool , dropped the jruby jar in " libs " , wrote up a quick interactive console , built and signed it , and that 's all there was to it .
JRuby turns out to work very well for this sort of thing because we have an interpreter , so we can parse and execute code dynamically .
Hooray for interpreted support !
I had to tweak a couple things to work around shortcomings in Android :
This is of course a proof - of - concept .
Writing full applications in Ruby is n't far behind , but we 'll need a couple adjustments to JRuby to support it well : I know how to do all of this .
I 've pushed ruboto - irb to Github so you can check it out and play with it .
I welcome contributors :) Ruboto lives !
As soon as the first cool breeze blows a few crunchy leaves off their branches , horror fans come crawling out of the woodwork , eager to indulge their love of every movie that features a chainsaw , a massacre , or a chainsaw massacre .
Meanwhile , people who prefer to celebrate Halloween without having to sleep with the lights on return to a few safe favorites — classics like Hocus Pocus ( 1993 ) , Beetlejuice ( 1998 ) , and The Addams Family ( 1991 ) .
While your steel - nerved friends are busy with slashers and scream queens , here are 15 gently spooky movies for you to check out .
1. Halloweentown ( 1998 )
What Bette Midler did for Hocus Pocus , Debbie Reynolds does for Halloweentown ( though , regrettably , Reynolds does n’t get a chance to show off her singing chops beyond the odd incantation ) .
The Singin ’ in the Rain star plays a kooky , kindly witch whose three grandchildren follow her to Halloweentown — home to every magical creature imaginable — and battle evil forces with their newly discovered powers .
The film was first released as a Disney Channel Original Movie , and it quickly became a fan favorite among ’90s kids .
Unsurprisingly , Disney happily capitalized on this success :
By 2006 , three sequels had been made .
2. What We Do in the Shadows ( 2014 )
Taika Waititi and Jemaine Clement ’s 2014 mockumentary — the basis for the equally hysterical FX series of the same name — follows a few wacky vampires trying to navigate roommate conflicts , nightclub dynamics , and other modern - day situations without drawing attention to their more murderous predilections .
Not only will the film have you screaming for mercy ( due to laughter , not pain ) , it ’ll also make it impossible for you to ever fear a vampire again .
Warning :
Though the movie is undoubtedly a comedy , there is a lot of blood featured .
3. Young Frankenstein ( 1974 )
Mel Brooks ’s 1974 mock horror film stars Gene Wilder as Dr. Frankenstein ’s grandson , a doctor who has spent his life trying — and failing — to distance himself from his embarrassing elder relative .
The younger Dr. Frankenstein reluctantly takes a trip to Transylvania to scope out his inherited castle and ends up embroiled in experiments that involve several creepy servants ( played by Cloris Leachman and Marty Feldman , among others ) and , yes , an undead monster .
Wilder is wild - eyed , wild - haired , and side - splittingly hilarious throughout the film , making this a must - see for everyone who thinks all horror films should actually just be comedies .
4. The Phantom of the Opera ( 2004 )
Andrew Lloyd Webber ’s classic musical been acclaimed as a feat of theater for more than 30 years .
But not enough people appreciate Joel Schumacher 's 2004 film adaptation , which boasts earnest performances by Emmy Rossum , Patrick Wilson , and Gerard Butler ( plus Minnie Driver in a standing - ovation - worthy supporting role ) .
It ’s not exactly a ghost story , since the titular phantom is a real man , but it does have plenty of eerie organ music , secret passageways , and possibly the best underground lair of all time .
5. Practical Magic ( 1998 )
Sandra Bullock and Nicole Kidman star as spirited sister witches with cursed love lives ( literally — their beaus always die young ) in this big - screen adaptation of Alice Hoffman ’s beloved novel .
One accidental murder and an ill - advised resurrection spell later , the pair ends up being investigated by a dashing , steely - eyed detective played by Aidan Quinn .
Think Gilmore Girls , but with magic .
6. Death Becomes Her ( 1992 )
Meryl Streep and Goldie Hawn play aging frenemies who toss back questionable cocktails from the enigmatic Lisle Von Rhuman ( Isabella Rossellini ) , who promises them wrinkle - free eternal life .
They soon find out that “ alive ” and “ not dead ” are n’t exactly the same state , and plastic surgeon - turned - mortician Ernest Menvill ( Bruce Willis ) scrambles to keep them from ( quite literally ) falling to pieces .
It ’s equal parts campy and macabre , complete with creaky old mansions and dark stormy nights .
7. Little Shop of Horrors ( 1986 )
Some films may have a bloodthirsty talking plant , a sadistic dentist , or Rick Moranis , but the 1986 remake of 1960 ’s Little Shop of Horrors is the only one with all three .
Said dentist , by the way , is played by Steve Martin , and Levi Stubbs lends his bluesy baritone to the plant .
Bill Murray and John Candy both make memorable cameos , and Tisha Campbell heads up a ’ 60s - inspired trio that narrates the action , Greek chorus - style .
Did we mention that everyone is constantly singing ?
8. Mary and the Witch ’s Flower ( 2017 )
Based on Mary Stewart ’s 1971 children ’s book , this enchanting movie from a couple former Studio Ghibli filmmakers tells the story of a girl who stumbles upon a magical flower and gets carried off to a witch ’s school in the sky .
She has to fight a few evildoers , of course , but the film overall exudes the same curative charm as Ghibli projects like Howl ’s Moving Castle ( which easily could ’ve landed on this list , too ) .
9. Scooby - Doo ( 2002 )
Everyone ’s favorite inarticulate Great Dane and his meddling friends head to a theme park called Spooky Island to investigate possible demon activity .
The mystery itself is mildly engaging , but the cast ’s commitment to their caricature - ish roles is what does the heavy - lifting for this goofy movie : Linda Cardellini as Velma ; Sarah Michelle Gellar as Daphne ; Matthew Lillard as Shaggy ; and Freddie Prinze Jr. as Fred .
And in case you forget mid-movie that this takes place during the early 2000s , Sugar Ray ’s beach concert should help you remember .
10 . Van Helsing ( 2004 )
This kitschy monster mash features Dracula , Frankenstein , Mr. Hyde , some werewolves , and Kate Beckinsale ’s Transylvanian accent .
The unifying factor is Hugh Jackman ’s Van Helsing , an upstanding monster assassin with the swagger of Robin Hood and the general vibe of Viggo Mortensen ’s Aragorn in The Lord of the Rings .
It ’s almost as if writer / director / producer Stephen Sommers ( best known for 1999's The Mummy ) challenged himself to see how many monsters he could fit into one film in the same way that you might stuff your cheeks full of marshmallows .
The result is just as entertaining .
11 . The Witches of Eastwick ( 1987 )
A devilish stranger named Daryl Van Horne ( Jack Nicholson ) shows up in a small Rhode Island town and promptly begins seducing three local friends , played by Cher , Michelle Pfeiffer , and Susan Sarandon .
As the women grow closer to their mysterious new man , they start to discover some latent powers of their own .
( Their hair also gets significantly bigger , which seems to be some stylistic indication that magic is afoot . )
The film is n’t scary , but it will teach you not to enter into a polygamous relationship with a man who keeps hinting that he ’s the devil .
12 . Corpse Bride ( 2005 )
The Tim Burton - produced The Nightmare Before Christmas ( 1993 ) has all the obvious trappings of a Halloween film — pumpkins , skeletons , monsters , a town called “ Halloween Town , ” etc . — but his 2005 fantasy Corpse Bride is just as spooky .
Through almost no fault of his own , a spindly young groom ends up married to a dead , maggoty maiden , who leads him through the underworld to help him get back to his real bride .
It ’s very Gothic , vaguely Orphean , and much more quirky than scary .
13 . Beautiful Creatures ( 2012 )
In modern - day South Carolina , a teenage “ caster ” ( as in spellcaster ) races to break a curse that will determine whether she ’s good or evil as soon as she turns 16 years old .
Listening to Emma Thompson and Jeremy Irons drawl in syrupy Southern accents is a good enough reason to watch this box office flop , and the fact that there ’s a giant spell book with shadowy ink spilling from its pages ( among other seasonally appropriate special effects ) justifies doing it around Halloween .
14 . The Rocky Horror Picture Show ( 1975 )
When a doe - eyed young woman ( Susan Sarandon ) and her clean - cut fiancé ( Barry Bostwick ) run into car trouble , they happen upon a creepy old castle that they hope has a working telephone — so far , pretty predictable .
What follows is anything but .
Inside , a self - described transvestite named Dr. Frank - N- Furter ( Tim Curry ) is hosting various ghoulish punks for the Annual Transylvanian Convention , where he debuts a glistening , muscly boy toy of his own creation .
Innocence is lost , the Time Warp is performed with gusto , and this film ( which is celebrating its 45th anniversary this year ) is not appropriate for young kids .
It is , however , appropriate for Halloween .
15 . The Witches ( 1990 )
If 1991 ’s The Addams Family and its 1993 sequel made Anjelica Huston a Halloween icon , 1990 ’s The Witches set her on that path in the first place .
It ’s a Jim Henson - produced adaptation of Roald Dahl ’s novel , and Huston plays an elegant , cackling witch with big plans ( namely , to transform all children into mice ) .
By next year ’s holiday , you ’ll be able to compare Huston ’s performance to Anne Hathaway ’s — as she ’s reprising the role in a remake tentatively scheduled for 2021 .
Those convicted are likely to be given new identities upon release
The couple responsible for the death of 17 - month - old Baby Peter have been named after a court anonymity order expired .
He died in Haringey , north London , in the care of his mother Tracey Connelly , 28 , and her partner Steven Barker , 33 .
A third defendant in the case named as Jason Owen , 37 , is now identified as Barker 's brother .
Baby Peter 's surname , Connelly , has also been released .
In May , Connelly and Barker were given minimum terms of five and 12 years for causing or allowing the death of Peter .
In a separate court case , Barker was also given a life sentence for raping a two - year - old girl .
Peter had more than 50 injuries , including fractured ribs and a broken back , when he was found dead in a property in Penshurst Road , Tottenham , in August 2007 .
Jason
Owen changed his surname to avoid being linked to the killing
It emerged Owen had changed his name to avoid being connected to the killing of Peter .
Owen , 37 , who was jailed for three years , was staying at the home in Tottenham , which is within the borough of Haringey , with his 15 - year - old girlfriend .
Speaking to the BBC , Connelly 's grandmother Mary O'Connor said she still had contact with her , but did not know " what to believe " .
" She lied .
She lied to the police , she lied to me and to social services . "

We have a justice system in this country that says we must name the guilty .
But there 's a contradiction here because we also want it to protect the innocent .
The difficulty with this case was that there was a very clear contradiction - there were other children involved who were still alive and there is a significant risk .
Some believe that in identifying those responsible for the Baby Peter case that we risk identifying those children and making their lives more difficult .
However , the judge finally decided that their identities are available to those who want to know them and have been for many months on the internet .
I think that if there is a lesson to be drawn from this in terms of identification , it 's how can we better ensure that we have a proper criminal justice system that does punish those responsible for crimes but also protects other children .
It has also been revealed that the brothers were charged with assaulting their own grandmother , Hilda Barker , who lived in Whitstable , Kent , in 1995 , in an attempt to make her change her will .
That case was dropped when Mrs Barker , 82 , died before giving evidence , but she told police she had been locked in a wardrobe by the pair .
It can also be reported that Baby Peter had four siblings .
A judge had ordered none of the defendants could be named because the other children were still being placed with alternative carers .
Barker 's trial for rape also contributed to the delay in naming the defendants .
Now that all four children are being cared for , the guilty trio 's anonymity has ceased .
The notoriety of the Baby Peter case is such that all three convicted people are likely to be given new identities upon release to protect them from vigilante attacks , according to the probation union Napo .
Assistant general secretary Harry Fletcher said : " The question will be , how well known are they in five years ' time ?
Trio who caused death of Peter Protected life for Baby P pair ?
Why names were kept secret " And will Baby P still resonate with the public in terms of horrendous crime ?
" If it does - and I suspect it will - the probation service and police will have no choice but to put in place a protection plan . "
Liberal Democrat MP for Hornsey and Wood Green , Lynne Featherstone , said she believed there would be widespread public anger if Connelly and Barker were given police protection after their release from prison .
" There 's certainly a section of the public that think that they should be in jail for life and if they come out they should not receive any protection at taxpayers ' expense whatsoever , " Ms Featherstone said .
" I understand that anger and I hope that the indeterminate sentence is indeterminate and that the minimums that are mentioned are not what is served because I think the public would feel that that would be absolutely unacceptable .
"
Those responsible for Baby Peter 's death are thought to be planning an appeal against their sentences .

In an offbeat but somewhat fascinating article published by the Huffington Post this week , it 's revealed that LSD inventor Albert Hofmann penned a letter to Steve Jobs shortly before his passing , in which he asked the Apple co-founder for help in transforming his problematic psychedelic into a " wonderchild . "
Jobs ' experimentation with psychedelics as a young man is well documented in books , movies , and media reports covering Apple 's early years .
As part of his search for spiritual enlightenment during the mid-70s , he was known to have dropped LSD , and has since recalled it as " one of the two or three most important things I have done in my life . "
Aware of the positive effects in which the experience had on Jobs ' contributions to the world of technology , Hofmann — who was an age - defying 101 years old a the time of the letter in 2007 — reached out to the Apple luminary at the request of his friend Rick Doblin , who runs MAPS , an organization dedicated to studying the medical and psychiatric benefits of psychedelic drugs .
Once thought to be a promising psychiatric research medicine , LSD would ultimately follow a path that would see it transform into recreational drug sparking hysteria and prohibition .
This disheartened Hofmann , who from then on was known to refer to the drug as his " problem child . "
" I hope you will help in the transformation of my problem child into a wonder child , " Hoffman wrote in his letter to Jobs , roughly 14 months before he passed away in April of 2008 .
Specifically , he request that Jobs contribute to Swiss psychiatrist Dr. Peter Gasser 's proposed study of LSD - assisted psychotherapy in subjects with anxiety associated with life - threatening illness — said to be the first LSD - assisted psychotherapy study in over 35 years .
According to the Post , the letter would lead to a 30 - minute conversation between Doblin and Jobs but no contribution to the cause .
" He was still thinking , ' Let 's put it in the water supply and turn everybody on , ' " Doblin told the publication .
Still , Doblin has n't given up hope that Jobs will someday decide to contribute to the study .
The US is not the only place where a double dip downturn is to be feared .
China has its own economic imbalances to deal with .
Too much money is being thrown at the problem creating malinvestment and a bubble economy , shares having doubled this year alone .
Stephen Roach thinks much of the stimulus money in China has been wasted , potentially requiring a second stimulus package .
‘ The impact of the investment - led stimulus will fade and the Chinese growth rate will start to slip again some time towards the middle of 2010 , ’ Roach said , suggesting that slowing growth could lead to increased layoffs and thus social instability .
‘ That means , the Chinese authorities will be forced to contemplate another proactive fiscal stimulus . ’
In May , Roach had said China may face a ‘ W ’ - shaped economic recovery and had previously said that China ’s current stimulus is directed too much at the pace of growth rather than the quality of the growth .
The former global chief economist for the U.S. investment bank also reiterated his concerns about excessive investments in infrastructure , rather than on stimulating private consumption or bolstering health care or social safety nets for Chinese .
‘ Bottom line is they are creating a very unbalanced macroeconomic structure , ’ Roach said in the interview , estimating that investment spending in the first half of the year as a share of gross domestic product had exceeded 45 percent of the economy .
‘ This is a ratio unheard of in the annals of a modern , large developing economy , ’ he said .
These are much the same complaints that can be levelled against US policy makers .
However , the scale of the endeavour in China is truly breathtaking .
And while the growth potential in China is still very strong , the economy has a number of significant problems with which to deal , unemployment being one .
Another mentioned by Roach is the need for the Chinese to save huge sums in order to meet health care costs and to insure against economic misfortune because of the porous social safety net .
Were the government to put more emphasis on increasing economic security , many Chinese would feel more comfortable spending and the economy would be able to wean itself from its reliance on exports .
However , to date , infrastructure has been the name of the game in China ’s fiscal stimulus .
Come this time next year , we will have a much better handle on whether this growth dynamic is sustainable or whether the government needs to top up its stimulus with yet more money .

Duluh , Minnesota is the place to be for good food & good music .
At least that was the case the last time I was there .
I stopped in to Pizza Luce smack dab in downtown Duluth and had some lunch with a colleague .
It was a scouting mission in a way since I would be returning to Pizza Luce later that evening to take in a great local band — Cars & Trucks .
I ordered the Smoked Gouda Macaroni which comes with an ample amount of real bacon .
The menu description is as follows :
Creamy gouda cheese , broccoli and bacon tossed with macaroni and topped with toasted bread crumbs and our bruschetta .
Those ingredients combine to create a wonderfully light and tasty meal that I would gladly order again .
Of course , when I went back that evening it was pizza & beer that kept me going while listening to the band .
Next time I ’ll remember to hop across the bridge to the Anchor Bar in Superior , WI to grab some deep fried bacon to keep me going .

The US government 's annual information security briefing is making the rounds online thanks to a questionable slide or two that indicate that all music downloading is illegal and that government employees need to avoid it at all costs .
The slideshow is required for nearly all employees and is meant to drive home the importance of everyone taking basic security measures , but the hyperbolic examples have drawn negative attention to the government 's view of downloading and the Internet .
The music - related questions are found in the interactive portion of the presentation , where you are asked to help your buddy Miguel with some downloads on his computer .
The slide shows Miguel excitedly showing off all the downloadable music he just found — " and it 's free ! " — and asks what your response would be .
The options range from asking Miguel to e-mail you a link , asking whether it 's safe to download , handing over your thumb drive and telling Miguel to hop to it , or to declare , " That 's stealing ! "
Unsurprisingly , the government says that the fourth answer is the only correct answer .
If you select the second answer — to ask whether it 's safe to download — the presentation says that it seems like a good idea to ask that question , but it 's really not .
" It 's also illegal and prohibited on DoD networks , " the slide reads .
Technically speaking , of course , not all free music downloads are illegal — there are numerous sites that allow for free downloads that are completely legitimate , including an Ars favorite , Amie Street .
There are other amusing tidbits from the presentation , including the opening slide that suggests that worldwide rioting and military crackdowns could result thanks to someone with security access losing a laptop or PDA ( wow , talk about pressure ) .
However , it also encourages employees to exercise some common sense with their work computers , such as only enabling ActiveX for Department of Defense - related sites and to notify someone immediately if a laptop goes missing .
Indeed , with several high - profile laptop disappearances that have exposed personally identifiable information of citizens , it 's definitely not a good idea to sit on one 's hands on that one .
It 's clear that the presentation is aimed at keeping the government network and machines as secure as possible , so the fact that there 's no mention of public domain works and free licenses in the music section does n't come as much of a shock .
As an IT admin , would you trust average users to know the difference between a public domain work and a song from a P2P network that may not only be illegal , but could also be malicious ?
At the same time , as pointed by Slashdot commenters , this presentation is educating thousands of federal employees to be ignorant of the nuances in copyright .
There 's happy medium , but the government apparently is n't worried about finding it .
Black - ish star Tracee Ellis Ross pitched the idea of doing an animated special because she was worried about going back to set during a pandemic .

Links Desktop Teaser Screencast
In past blogs I 've hinted on the fact that I 'm working on a Javascript application in my spare time .
It 's not quite done yet , and wont be live for a few more weeks , but I do have something that I can show off .
This project is best explained in the form of a screencast .
This is the first screencast I have ever made and I 'm not sure if I have done it right , or if my humble server will cope with serving FLV files .
If the server does n't manage to keep up , I 'll probably Youtube it .
Update :
If for any reason the above player does n't work , you can view the screencast on Youtube .
The front - end uses nothing more than HTML and Javascript .
This project actually represents more Javascript than I have written in all my previous career .
I 've written so much JS lately that I have stopped hating it – but that may just be Stockholm Syndrome .
The back - end is a Django application that serves the content and the API that is used by the front - end JS .
I 've put together a nice simple mechanism for exposing an AJAX API in Django , that removes virtually all the boiler plate ; the API views are inspected , and the URLs created automatically .
I 'll probably blog about that at in the future .
Most of my recent experimentation in to caching has been with this project in mind ; I 've planned for large capacity , if it ever becomes really popular .
Virtually all the data can be moved to memcached and I can manage the browser cache with ETags .
Please leave a comment if you would like to be one of the beta testers , or have any other suggestions .
I 'm particularly interested in ideas for monetizing !

A massive tortoise who left the circus and took his show on the road for six days has been found and is expected to be back with his circus family soon .
The 114 - pound male tortoise named Berta did n't make it very far .
He had traveled just two miles when he was spotted on a golf course less than a week after his July 7 escape during a show in Madison , Wis .
Alain Zerbini , owner and producer of Florida - based Zerbini Family Circus , says he expects to have Berta back in a few days .
A friend of Zerbini picked up Berta from the Humane Society in Madison on Friday .
Zerbini says the tortoise has been " part of the family " for 10 years .--- Information from : Wisconsin State Journal , http://www.madison.com/wsj
In a move that may complicate the retrial of Steven Pomie in the 2005 attack on Dwan Prince , Prince sent Pomie a letter in which he blamed himself for the brutal , anti-gay assault and expressed the hope that Pomie serve just five years in prison , with five years post - release supervision for the crime .
“ First please allow me to deeply apology for my hated comment , ” Prince wrote in the July 20 letter , which Gay City News is quoting verbatim .
“ Please I do hope you know I am truly deeply sorry for what ever was sayed that night .
I have made some big mistakes in my life and that was the stupidiest and biggest one of all . ”
Pomie , now 26 , allegedly attacked Prince in Brooklyn ’s Brownsville section after the now 31 - year - old flirted with him .
Pomie first beat and kicked Prince with two other men , and then made a second assault with another man , witnesses said during Pomie ’s 2006 trial .
When Pomie returned alone to deliver a third beating , witnesses prevented him from attacking Prince , who was lying unconscious on the sidewalk .
One witness testified that as Pomie walked away from the scene , he quickly turned back and “ kicked [ Prince ] with his Tims , ” referring to the Timberland brand of boots .
“ Then blood started gushing , ” the witness said .
Nintendo Famicom / NES 101 : A Beginner ’s Guide
Note from racketboy : Special thanks goes to Radarscope1 ( check out his blog , Word Games ) for putting most of this guide together !
The RetroGaming 101 series is aimed at gamers who are just starting out in the classic gaming scene or are curious about an older console that they do n’t know much about yet .
The Nintendo Entertainment System is one of the most iconic video game consoles of all time and was the machine that got many 80s kids hooked on this interactive medium .
There ’s a lot of ground to cover when talking about this landmark console , but hopefully we cover the most important points here .
Historical Impact
Nintendo ’s first home console , launched in Japan as the Family Computer , or Famicom , in 1983 and as the Nintendo Entertainment System in the rest of the world statrting in 1985 .
Before the Famicom / NES , Nintendo ’s success in video games was mostly limited to a handful of hit arcade games , such as Donkey Kong and Mario Bros. , and the Game & Watch handheld LCD games .
Many of Nintendo ’s biggest franchises began life on the NES , including the Legend of Zelda , Metroid , and Kid Icarus , as well as Mother ( aka Earthbound in the West ) and Nintendo Wars ( aka Advance Wars ) .
Many long - running third - party franchises also started on the NES , including Final Fantasy , Dragon Quest , Castlevania , Mega Man , and Contra .
The popularity of the NES is often credited with reviving the North American video game market after the “ crash ” of the early 1980s .
The NES dominated the video game market in North America and Japan from the mid-1980s to the early 90s , stomping ut nearly all competitors during the 8 - bit era .
Nintendo leveraged that market share by pressuring third party game companies into contracts that limited how many games they could release in a year and required that Nintendo manufacture the cartridges for a fee .
The NES was the first home console to use a cross - shaped d-pad on its controller , a design that has since been imitated and used on nearly every console and portable gaming device since .
Before the NES controller was released , home console control inputs were a wide variety of hit - and - miss designs .
After the NES , most console controllers more or less followed and iterrated on the d-pad design .
The d-pad was taken directly from Nintendo ’s portable Game and Watch LCD games , which had a design that also eventually inspired the Nintendo DS .
The NES saw the first passwords and battery back - ups that allowed for game saves .
The NES introduced many gamers who did n’t have access to PCs to role - playing games .
Nintendo ’s huge give - away of Dragon Quest ( called Dragon Warrior in the west ) via Nintendo Power was especially key in getting players to try an RPG .
Final Fantasy , the Ultima games , the Legend of Zelda and Crystalis also played a role in expanding the genre .

Iconic & Nostalgic .
It seems that no matter what territory you live in or how old you are , if you have an NES in your home you can bet people will notice it when they come over .
They ’ll want to fire it up and have a go whether or not they ’re a hard core gamer or have n’t touched a controller in years .
Weaknesses
Control Deck Hardware Reliability : The original Control Deck — the front - loading “ toaster ” hardware that accounts for the vast majority of NES ’s — can be finicky and hard to operate due to flaws in the design .
To appeal to a North American market that had soured on the video game “ fad ” in the early 1980s , Nintendo redesigned the top- loading Famicom to look and feel more like a VCR than a traditional game console .
The design used an odd connection method that did n’t truly lock the cartridges into a receiving end , and even caused the connectors to bend over time .
Corroded connectors are also a problem .
Luckily , this can be fixed fairly easily and cheaply by replacing the 72 - pin connector inside the unit and simply cleaning the cartridges .

Inflated Collectors Prices on Complete Games : Nostalgia can have its price .
Because the NES is so highly collectible , complete - in - box copies of games are usually ridiculously over - priced on auction sites like eBay .
Games that carry recognizable names today such Final Fantasy , Super Mario Bros.
3 or Metroid can sell for $ 20 or $ 30 or more for complete copies .
These games are often advertised as “ rare ” but are far from it .
Most of the truly rare NES games are quirky titles like Princess Tomato in the Salad Kingdom or Bubble Bath Babes , and are the type of games only hard - core collectors would seek .
Collectors who are interested in simply owning and playing the best and most well - known NES titles should n’t be deceived by sales of supposedly “ rare ” games .

Inferior Arcade Ports :
While plenty of early 80s arcade ports on the NES are good , some arcade conversions from later in the NES lifecycle are pretty inferior ports .
The NES lived a long life , and by the late 1980s and early ’90s many arcade games were being programmed on 16 - bit architecture with more memory .
Though still a leading machine in the home market , the NES could n’t keep up with some titles like Strider , Smash TV , Double Dragon II , or Bad Dudes .
However this also means that some games such as Contra , Gradius and Bionic Commando were altered to better fit the hardware , with the results surpassing the cabinet - bound originals in many gamers ’ eyes .

Technical Details
The CPU in the Famicom and North American NES is an 8 - bit processor made by Ricoh , the RP2A03 , which runs at a 1.79 MHz .
The PAL version of the NES used a variant CPU that is identical except it runs at slower 1.66 MHz .
This CPU was based on the MOS Technology 6502 , a widely used processor introduced in the mid 1970s that powered a string of influential computing and gaming devices like the Apple I , Apple II , BBC Micro , the Commodore VIC - 20 and the Atari 400 and 800 .
A custom PPU was also made by Ricoh .
The NES can display 48 colors and 5 shades of gray .
It has a resolution of 256 horizontal pixels by 240 vertical pixels .
The NES uses five - channel sound with one waveform assigned to each .
There are two “ square ” waves , a “ triangle ” wave , and two other channels available for sound effects , often just static bursts .
All sound is mono , which while limited could be put to very good use by quality composers .
The Japanese Famicom had expansion slots allowing some cartridges to use extra sound chips ( originally a function of the Famicom Disk System , which connected via the cart slot ) .
This was n’t included in the NES , meaning a handful of games came to the West with inferior sound compared to their Eastern counterparts .
The NES Control Deck released in North America and PAL territories was capable of outputting both RF and composite video .
The original Japanese Famicom was RF - only .
The second - generation “ A/ V Famicom , ” released in 1993 , had composite - only audio and video output .
Curiously , the North American version of this remodeled NES ( the top - loading NES 2 ) was only capable of RF video .
Hardware Variations
What To Look For When Buying
There ’s the older , iconic Control Deck and the newer NES 2 .
For most , the Control Deck is the way to go .
The NES 2 is highly sought after because of higher reliability and collectability factors , but can be expensive , especially if you ’re buying online .
The extra cost and inferior connections of the NES 2 are big negatives .
On a purely aesthetic note , the NES “ game paks ” were n’t designed for the shorter form factor of a top - loading console , and so the carts look a bit odd sticking up out of the top of the machine ( which is also the reason for the rounded cover on the slot , which you do n’t see on the A/V Famicom ) .
The older models can be finicky , but if you replace the 72 pin connector they will likely work perfectly .
You can do this repair yourself , and most retro gaming shops worth their salt will be able to do it for you for a few bucks .
The new connectors usually cost $ 8 to $ 10 bucks , much less than the cost of an NES 2 on eBay .
The Control Decks can be cleaned fairly easily as well , which will improve reliability .
The best advice for buying an NES is to be sure you can test it yourself before purchasing if you ’re paying any real amount of money for it .
Make sure you do n’t get a bunch of black screens and blinking power lights when trying to turn it on .
If that ’s the case the connection is likely shot .
Also try to test the tray that holds the games and make sure it has a good amount of spring to it and is n’t worn out , as this can lead to poor connections .
A good trick for getting a finicky game to play is to pop it up , and gently wiggle it back toward you slightly , enough so that it just barely clears the plastic edge below when you push it down .
Blowing in the cart will only do so much good – you ’re better off cleaning with some 90 % rubbing alcohol and a q-tip .
If you need to blow dust out do it at an angle so you ’re not just blowing the dust — and your saliva — down into the cart .
Accessories
The NES had dozens of accessories , some truly useful and others truly odd .
Here are some of the highlights , starting with the peripherals that are most worth your time and money .
Emulation
Even without owning the machine , it ’s still possible to play the greats using Nintendo ’s Virtual Console .
But that ’s just the beginning .
Due to its popularity , there are a variety of ways to emulate NES games , for computers , consoles , and handhelds .
Just take your pick :
Nester is an open - source NES emulator for Windows , which has recently had its source code uploaded on Sourceforge .
net so public work can continue .
It was originally designed in 1999 by Darren Ranalli , and released for public use in 2000 .
Large sections of the emulator were also written by Matthew Comte , and the project was intentionally designed for stability and ease of transfer to other formats .
It was coded in C ++. NesterJ is an unofficial version with expanded featuers .
NESticle was a DOS - based emulator designed by Icer Addis , cofounder of Bloodlust Software .
Built using C++ and released in 1997 for DOS and Windows 95 , it was a freeware product that caught on rapidly and was one of the first really popular NES emulators .
Unfortunately for everyone , Addis ’ servers were hacked and the source code was stolen in 1998 .
Addis decided to stop work on the program , and discontinued work on the emulator .
NESticle was also well known for using a bloody , disembodied hand for a pointer , and an image of testicles for its Windows icon .
FCE Ultra is an incredibly widespread emulator for the NES , and functions in DOS , Windows , Mac OS X , and Linux X , while also being ported to the PSP , GP2X , and home consoles like the Nintendo Gamecube .
Officially updates were stopped in 2004 , but several modified versions have since appeared .
In 2006 these were combined to form FCEUX , which is still being updated .
The emulator offers save states , the ability to take screen shots , TCP / IP connectivity , and even a Game Genie Encoder .
Nestopia is another open source emulator .
While originally put out for Windows , it has since found its way to Mac and Linux operating systems .
It includes save states , the ability to “ rewind , ” controller emulation ( including the Power Pad ) , built in Game Genie , netplay , the ability to record gameplay , and even accurate emulation of videos .
It is still active .
Other emulators include It Might Be NES for the PlayStation , nesDS for Nintendo DS , iNES for iPod , Newtendo for the Apple Newton , NesterDC for the Dreamcast , and many more .

This is the followup to 2006 film “ 9/11 Dust and Deceit ” about the health effects from toxic dust of 9/11 .
The film seeks to show solutions and asks how those affected can heal from 9/11 .
The premier was three days in NYC as part of the " Pause || Press Play : Art Film and Spoken Word Collaborative . "
Thank you to all who helped make this possible !
9/11 Dust and Deceit This disturbing film by Penny Little “ 911 : Dust and Deceit at the WTC ” exposes the environmental disaster of 9/11 through interviews with scientists , waste management specialists , government workers , volunteers , first responders , the heros and victims of the dust which permeated the air after 911 .
Environmental Protection Agency ( EPA ) Administrator Christine Todd Whitman announced to New Yorkers , shortly after the 911 attacks on the World Trade Towers that “ . . I am glad to reassure the people of New York and Washington DC that their air safe to breathe ” and that we “ . . . need not be concerned about environmental issues as [ we ] return to [ our ] homes and workplaces ”
At that time , she did n't have the information to support those assurances or make recommendations .
The White House itself , through its Council on Environmental Quality ( CEQ ) , actually manipulated the statements being released by the EPA so as to soft - pedal health concerns .
Because of these misleading statements , and because the EPA bucked its legal responsibility and left the problem to the City , the public was put at risk .
This is true even though the EPA reversed course in May of 2002 and initiated an extremely limited and flawed voluntary cleanup .
There is evidence of a coverup , and a media blackout .

A report published today by the Linux Foundation provides insight into the state of the Linux kernel development community and includes statistics that reveal which companies are the most prolific contributors .
The study indicates that the project is attracting new programmers and has strong backing from a highly diverse assortment of hardware and software companies that actively participate in the development process .
The Linux kernel , with over 11.5 million lines of code , is arguably one of the largest and most significant open source software projects .
The health of the kernel development ecosystem is important to the growing number of Linux vendors and adopters .
The Linux Foundation , a nonprofit organization that coordinates kernel development , studies the matter closely .
In April 2008 , the organization released its first report with kernel contributor statistics .
The new report provides updated information and a view into the current state of the kernel .
According to the report , the number of kernel developers who contribute to each release has increased by approximately 10 percent since the 2008 study , with almost 1,000 developers participating in each released version of the kernel .
The entire code base has grown by over 2.7 million lines while the number of lines of code that are contributed ever day has nearly tripled .
An average of 5.45 patches are accepted every hour .
Part of the increase in total code base size is attributable to the inclusion of the - staging tree , which allows incomplete or unstable ( " crap " ) drivers to be merged into the mainline kernel .
It was introduced in version 2.6.28 which was released in December .
The contents of the staging tree have received a significant number of improvements this year .
One of the most significant aspects of the report is its analysis of corporate involvement in kernel development .
The report reveals that an average of 200 companies are involved in development for any given version of the kernel and that they are responsible for developing roughly 70 percent of the code .
The leading code contributor is Red Hat , whose involvement accounts for roughly 12 percent of code contributions .
Other leading corporate contributors are IBM and Novel , which each contribute 7.6 percent and Intel , which contributes 5.3 percent .
Linux Foundation executive director Jim Zemlin commented on the implications of the report in a statement .
He believes that the current trend of rapid growth will continue .
" This paper shows that the pace of Linux development continues to grow , with more individuals and more companies supporting Linux kernel development with every release cycle , " Zemlin said .
" With the increasing use of Linux in new markets and the dedication of the development community and corporate sponsors , the number of contributors will continue to grow , ensuring a vibrant ecosystem to support the platform . "
At the Linux Collaboration Summit earlier this year , Zemlin characterized Linux as the " fastest growing platform " during his keynote presentation .
His lofty expectations for Linux growth were supported by an IDC study that was unveiled during the conference which predicts that Linux will withstand the current economic recession better than its proprietary competitors and will emerge in a stronger position .
Linux is also getting a boost from the mobile market where it is attracting a lot of major hardware and software vendors .
It 's got a foothold in the netbook space and could see broader adoption as new ARM - based netbooks begin to emerge .
The Linux kernel ecosystem is clearly stronger than ever and benefits from the enthusiastic support of a multitude of major technology companies .
The new kernel status report shows who the major players are and casts a light on the kernel 's rapid rate of growth .
For more details , you can download the report from the Linux Foundation website .

Here is another great one from Martin Kimeldorf , converting a LumiQuest popup diffuser into a softbox thingy .
This will work great to add some direct flash fill in .
Now , I am not saying that you should run and buy one of those just to mod it , you can start with silk and some black Bristol and get the same place .
I liked the LumiQuest Diffuser for Pop Up flashes except that the diffuser panel hung rather limply on my camera and thus produced an unreliable surface shape .
Also , I wondered about the light escaping the sides .
Then I thought , I could add sides and create a miniature soft box , especially if the inside had a silvered lining .
Parts
LumiQuest pop up flash diffuser
Black core foam and silver facing cardboard .
Hot glue gun
Velcro
Scissors and knife or cutter
Assembly Steps
1 ) The OUTSIDE of the diffuser showing the beginner part , a LumiQuest Pop Up Diffuser .
One could create this part on their own if they chose , but I liked the LumiQuest diffuser panel over all material I created or substituted .
There is no single design because every camera will be different .
I can show you how I assembled mine and then you can use this to guide your creation .
Typically , it takes me about 3 tries to get it right , so us a mock up of the LumiQuest before using the real thing .
2 ) INSIDE showing the mirrored side panels .
First cut out black core panels so they rest on your camera and hold the panel out where you want .
Then cut out shaped material from silver backed card stock .
Then attach entire panel with hot glue and black tape along the edges where panels meet back side of LumiQuest .
3 ) Add thing Velcro strips along edges so the panel can detach and fold up flat .
This shows the edges where the front diffuser meets the side panels , I glued in a thin Velcro strip .
One part is on the diffuser and the other on the panel edge .
4 ) There are many ways to attach the soft box to the camera .
Velcro is one option .
The LumiQuest has a built in tab for inserting into the hot shoe .
5 ) Mounted on the camera .
It is easy to lift if you do n’t want the effect , or just drop it down for the next shot .
6 ) When attaching side panels with glue and tape , make sure they lie flat first , otherwise it will never fold up into this low profile .
It can be used straight on the camera ’s pop up when you do n’t want to lug around a strobe .
This diffuser lets you get close without risk of hot spots or harsh shadows .
An even better way to use the popup softbox is to use it as an on axis fill in a scene with another flash .
I have also used the diffused pop up to fill Christina ’s face which was also lit by a diffused strobe on the left using The ( Really HUGE ) Kimel Bouncer .

Few people know what VPNs are .
And yet , you do n’t have to be a computer expert or a computer genius to get the most out of these useful tools .
A VPN is a virtual private network – from English : virtual private network – through which Internet users can access the internet .
In general , when you connect to the internet , you do so by sending certain information from a device , which can be a mobile phone , a tablet , a computer , a smartTV … to servers where the landing pages are hosted .
In less than a second , an information exchange occurs .
On the other hand , when you connect to the internet through a VPN , the connection is not made directly , but before establishing the connection , our data is sent , encrypted and filtered through another server : the virtual private network .
A small modification occurs in the path so that the level of browsing security is much higher than that experienced on a public network .
Advantages of accessing the internet through a VPN
A VPN server can achieve that you can access the internet completely anonymously , something that is enhanced if you use some type of cryptocurrency , such as bitcoin or ethereum , in your transactions and purchases .
Intimacy and privacy are very precious assets that are worth preserving .
And in the internet age , even if we are not aware of it , we are constantly leaving information about ourselves .
So the more jealous we are of our intimacy , the better .
Regardless of whether you want to surf anonymously , you can prevent your internet provider from accessing your data .
Your internet provider has a complete record of your browsing history , although it is true that it is private and no one should be able to access that history .
Using a VPN is a good way to make it difficult to track your browsing data : what pages you visited , what keywords you enter in search engines , what time you connect , what documents , photos or files you have seen and / or downloaded and a long list of information .
It provides a different IP address than the real one of your device , which provides different advantages .
Lets skip locks .
There are certain countries that limit browsing and access to certain pages and applications .
The paradigmatic case can be found in China , which , among other pages , prohibits access to Facebook .
In the hypothetical case that you are in China , you could access Facebook using a VPN that assigns you an IP address from another country .
As in the case of China , it is applicable to any country , place and website on which there is some kind of limitation .
Protection against possible threats .
Public networks are a very insecure point and the vulnerability of those who connect to the internet through them is very high .
A large number of hackers and hackers take advantage of this weakness to carry out their cyberattacks .
Remote access to your office to telework .
VPNs allow access to work networks remotely , without the need for a physical connection .
This is a very important advantage to take into account after what happened with the coronavirus health crisis , in which thousands of workers have been forced to work from home , something that , on the other hand , has long been demanded by a large number of workers .
Teleworking is a labor modality more in line with the present and allows for better family reconciliation and more efficient time management , two fields in which we still have to evolve a lot as a society .
It allows access to content available in countries other than the one where you are actually located .
Audiovisual content platforms such as HBO or Netflix do not have the same catalog for all the countries in which they operate .
Each country has its own series and movies ; some coincide in different countries and others do not .
By using a VPN you can change the location of your device – IP address – and take advantage to access new content : if you connect from a computer located in Spain , through a VPN you can get your IP address to be located , for example , in the U.S.
If you access a platform like Netflix in this way , you will have at your disposal the offer that Netflix has in the United States and not in Spain .
This is ideal for watching series or movies that do not appear in your country ’s catalog and you do n’t even know when they will arrive .
There are a large number of VPNs at your disposal .
You can take a look on this website and compare some of the options that will broaden your experience as an internet user .
Lastly , although there are similarities between them , it is necessary to point out that a proxy and a VPN are not the same thing .
You can access here to get information about what a proxy is and how it differs from a private virtual network .
Berlusconi will keine Kritik des staatlichen Senders RAI an der Regierung mehr dulden Florian Rötzer
Der Medienmogul und Regierungschef sieht sich als den beliebtesten und effizientesten Staatsmann des Westens .
Silvio Berlusconi ist weiterhin unangefochtener Politiker der Italiener , so scheint es. Seine Eskapaden , die Affären , der autokratische Stil , alles kein Problem für den italienischen Sonnenkönig , der sich mittlerweile seine eigene Partei zurechtgezimmert hat und politische Opposition zur Zeit nicht fürchten muss .
Das dürfte mit die Folge sein , dass Berlusconi nicht nur Milliardär ist , sondern auch Herr über drei private Fernsehsender .
Zudem kann er die drei öffentlich - rechtlichen Fernsehsender kontrollieren , zumindest über die Besetzung der Direktoren .
Am Freitag machte Berlusconi während einer Pressekonferenz wieder einmal deutlich , wie gut es Italien doch unter seiner Führung gehe , dass er mit einem allerdings leicht gefallenen Popularitätswert von immerhin noch 68,2 Prozent der beliebteste Staatsmann der westlichen Demokratien sei und dass er Kritik nicht ausstehen kann .
Das schon auch deswegen nicht , weil er prinzipiell nichts falsch macht .
Es gebe nichts , wofür er sich entschuldigen müsse – auch nicht bei seiner Familie , erzählte er in einem Monolog von fast einer Stunde , an dessen Schluss er den Medienvertretern gnädig gerade einmal drei Fragen gestattete .
Eine Journalistin von TG3 griff er an , weil der Sender den Tag zuvor vier regierungskritische Nachrichten hatte .
Des Weiteren erzürnte der Cavaliere sich über die Verleumdungskampagnen der ( nicht ihm gehörenden )
Presse und des öffentlich - rechtlichen Fernsehsenders und erklärte , er werde in Zukunft keine Kritik des Senders an der Regierung mehr dulden .
Der Sender habe nicht den Auftrag , die Regierung anzugreifen , sondern der Öffentlichkeit zu dienen ( womit er offenbar in erster Linie sich selbst meint ) .
Überhaupt sei die RAI der einzige staatliche Fernsehsender der Welt , die mit Steuergeldern die Regierung angreife .
Er habe aber " jede Kritik an mir , der Regierung und der Opposition " zu unterlassen .
Schon in der Vergangenheit hat Rai einige Sendungen aus dem Programm genommen , die zu kritisch gegenüber Berlusconi waren .
Für das eigene Lob sorgt er schon selbst .
Keine Regierung habe in 14 Monaten Amtszeit so viele wie die von ihm geführte erledigt , sagte er . Den sozialen Frieden habe er gesichert und die Sicherheit erhöht , beispielsweise durch den Einsatz von Soldaten in den Städten .
Und er will nun auch die Atomenergie ausbauen .
In der Technik seien die Italiener angeblich mal führend gewesen , aber man habe den Umweltschützern nachgegeben , weswegen die Italiener heute mehr für Energie ausgeben müssten .
INDIANAPOLIS --
Do Americans believe controversial assertions about health care reform including death panels , threats to Medicare , abortions , illegal immigrants , and other claims which the White House have labeled as untrue " myths ? "
Findings from a national survey of Americans by researchers from Indiana University Center for Health Policy and Professionalism Research ( CHPPR ) and the Indiana University Center for Bioethics says that Americans do believe the " myths " about health care reform , confirming that the White House may indeed be losing this battle .
" A surprisingly large proportion of Americans believe what the White House has dubbed ' myths ' about health care reform , " said CHPPR director Aaron Carroll , M.D. , M.S. " Ironically , we found that the least believed myths , such as those related to mandatory end - of - life decisions and euthanasia counseling , are those that have gained the most traction in the media and have resulted in changes to the House bill . "
From Aug. 14 - 18 , a random sample of 600 Americans in the 48 contiguous states and the District of Columbia were asked 19 questions about their personal beliefs concerning health insurance reform assertions .
A majority believed most of these statements to be true , with an overwhelming number of Republicans and -- for many issues -- Independents finding truth in the controversial assertions .
Who and what types of services will be covered if the proposed reforms are passed : 67 percent of Americans believe that wait times for health care services ( such as surgery ) will increase ( 91 percent of Republicans , 37 percent of Democrats , 72 percent of Independents ) .
Roughly 6 out of 10 Americans believe that taxpayers will be required to pay for abortions ( 78 percent of Republicans , 30 percent of Democrats , 58 percent of Independents ) 46 percent believe that reforms will result in health care coverage for all illegal immigrants ( 66 percent of Republicans , 29 percent of Democrats , 43 percent of Independents ) .
Level of government involvement with health care if the proposed reforms pass : 5 out 10 believe the federal government will become directly involved in making personal health care decisions ( 80 percent of Republicans , 25 percent of Democrats , 56 percent of Independents )
However only 3 out of 10 Americans believe that the government will require the elderly to make decisions about how and when they will die ( 53 percent of Republicans , 14 percent of Democrats , 31 percent of Independents ) - a topic that has received a considerable amount of media attention .
Impact on current health insurance coverage if the proposed reforms are passed : Interestingly , fewer people surveyed believe statements regarding the impact of proposed reforms on current health insurance coverage .
Only 29 percent of respondents believe that private insurance coverage would be eliminated ( 44 percent of Republicans , 11 percent of Democrats , 33 percent of Independents ) and only 33 percent believed that reforms would result in the elimination of employer - sponsored health insurance coverage ( 56 percent of Republicans , 14 percent of Democrats , 31 percent of Independents ) .
Additionally , only 36 percent of Americans believes that a public insurance option will put private insurance companies out of business ( 56 percent of Republicans , 18 percent of Democrats , 35 percent of Independents ) .
Costs of the proposed reforms and how the reforms will be paid for :
Almost 6 out of 10 Americans believe that a public insurance option as proposed would be too expensive for the United States to afford ( 84 percent of Republicans , 27 percent of Democrats , 58 percent of Independents ) .
51 percent believe that the public insurance option will increase health care costs ( 79 percent of Republicans , 21 percent of Democrats , 53 percent of Independents ) , and 54 percent believe that the public option will increase premiums for Americans with private health insurance ( 78 percent of Republicans , 28 percent of Democrats , 58 percent of Independents ) .
5 out of 10 Americans think that cuts will be made to Medicare in order to cover more Americans ( 66 percent of Republicans , 37 percent of Democrats , 44 percent of Independents ) .
" It 's perhaps not surprising that more Republicans believe these things than Democrats , " said Dr. Carroll .
" What is surprising is just how many Republicans - and Independents - believe them .
If the White House hopes to convince the majority of Americans that they are misinformed about health care reform , there is much work to be done . "

It is the goal of CHPPR to serve as an objective source of information for both policymakers and health care professionals .
The mission of the IUCB is to provide leadership to advance the academic and public understanding of bioethics and to inform the development of social and public policy in health research , and related fields .
Too much , too fast , too expensive .
Those are some of the objections lawmakers have voiced against the healthcare overhaul Democrats are attempting on Capitol Hill .
But many Americans think Congress is out of touch .
How , they wonder , can lawmakers empathize with the underinsured or those lacking insurance when they receive a benefits package -- heavily subsidized by taxpayers -- that most of us can only envy ?
Among the advantages : a choice of 10 healthcare plans that provide access to a national network of doctors , as well as several HMOs that serve each member ’s home state .
By contrast , 85 % of private companies offering health coverage provide their employees one type of plan -- take it or leave it .
Lawmakers also get special treatment at Washington ’s federal medical facilities and , for a few hundred dollars a month , access to their own pharmacy and doctors , nurses and medical technicians standing by in an office conveniently located between the House and Senate chambers .

In all , taxpayers spent about $ 15 billion last year to insure 8.5 million federal workers and their dependents , including postal service employees , according to the Office of Personnel Management .
Generous plans are available in private industry .
But the federal coverage far surpasses that enjoyed by 70 million Americans who are underinsured and at financial risk in the event of a major health crisis -- not to mention the estimated 46 million who have no medical insurance .
“ For the average worker , the Federal Employees Health Benefits Plan would probably look quite attractive , ” said Pete Sepp , a spokesman for the National Taxpayers Union , a pinch - penny advocacy group .
Indeed , a question often surfaces :
Why ca n’t everyone enjoy the same benefits as members of Congress ?
The answer :
The country probably could n’t afford it -- not without reforms to bring costs way , way down .
Advertisement
Given their choices , lawmakers can tailor coverage in a way most Americans cannot .
If a child has asthma , for instance , a federal employee might opt for coverage that costs a little more but has a bigger doctor network and lower office - visit fees .
The plan most favored by federal workers is Blue Cross Blue Shield , which covers a family for about $ 1,030 a month .
Taxpayers kick in $ 700 , and employees pay the rest .
Seeing a doctor costs $ 20 .
Generic prescriptions cost $ 10 .
Immunizations are free .
There is no coverage limit .
Federal employees also enjoy a significant benefit denied the average American :
There is no such thing as a preexisting condition , which keeps many sick people from obtaining insurance .
Once hired , federal workers are eligible for coverage no matter their health , with no waiting period .
Voters sense a disconnect .
A recent Gallup Poll found that about half of those surveyed said they have “ a good understanding ” of the issues involved in the healthcare debate .
By contrast , respondents believe that fewer than three in 10 members of Congress share that understanding .

Lawmakers ’ ample benefits make a ripe target .
Sen . Tom Coburn ( R - Okla . ) sponsored an amendment requiring members of Congress to forgo their current health coverage and enroll in any government plan they pass to compete with private insurers .
“ Let ’s demonstrate leadership and confidence in the system , ” Coburn said before his amendment squeaked through the Senate Health Committee .
A similar measure was defeated in the House .
A spokesman for Speaker Nancy Pelosi demurred when asked if she would sign up for a government - run plan .
The San Francisco Democrat joined President Obama in pushing unsuccessfully for passage of a healthcare bill before lawmakers headed home for their summer recess .

“ The point is to give people a choice , ” said Pelosi ’s communications director , Brendan Daly .
“ If you like what you have now , you can keep it .
If you do n’t like it , you ’ll have other choices that are available to you . ”
Virtually every president since Franklin D. Roosevelt has considered expanded or universal medical coverage .
President Eisenhower , a famous cost- cutter , signed into law the legislation giving federal employees their generous benefits .
His reasons were partly personal :
His mother - in - law ’s illness required two years of medical care that took a steep financial and emotional toll on the president .
Politically , the hope was to spur more private employers to follow the government ’s lead .
Obama , wielding his own prod , opened a recent news conference with a pointed reference to the disparity between lawmakers and those they serve .
“ I have great health insurance and so does every member of Congress , ” Obama said , noting he also has a doctor standing by around the clock .
“ This debate is about the letters I read when I sit in the Oval Office every day , and the stories I hear at town hall meetings . ”
Advertisement
Antonia Ferrier , a spokeswoman for House Republican Leader John A. Boehner -- a leading opponent of Democrats ’ overhaul efforts -- said the Ohio congressman hears “ the exact same concerns that Democrats hear ” from constituents .
“ There ’s no question he wants to do something , ” Ferrier said .
“ He also is concerned , though that , whatever we do , we do it right and do n’t exacerbate the economic downturn and make it worse . ”
But Rep. Steve Kagen , for one , is skeptical .
The Wisconsin Democrat has refused to accept federal healthcare benefits , making him the only member of Congress to do without .
He will continue , he said in an interview , until every American can enjoy the same coverage as federal lawmakers .
Advertisement
Kagen recently had knee surgery , writing checks for more than $ 4,500 after bargaining for a reduced - rate MRI and a 50 % discount on the operation .
( He is still dickering over the hospital bill . )
“ If every member of Congress put their heads on their pillow every night like I do . . . knowing this could be the night I lose my house , we ’d fix healthcare in a week , ” said Kagen , who spent decades as a doctor in the Green Bay area before winning office in 2006 .
Kagen said his wife and three of his four children have health coverage .
But not his oldest daughter , 28 , who ca n’t afford insurance .
She ’s a nurse in Miami .

Study : Only 58.5 % of Houston freshmen graduate Diploma rate : ' A crisis of graduation '
Study : 58.5 percent of area freshmen finish high school
As thousands of Houston - area high school seniors prepare to accept their diplomas in the coming weeks , a study released Friday shows that only 58.5 percent of the region ’s freshmen make it to graduation day .
Children at Risk , a Houston - based advocacy group , commissioned the Texas Education Agency to conduct study of six - year graduation rates for the region ’s 130 high schools .
They learned that 53 percent of the students who begin as ninth - graders in the Houston Independent School District had not graduated from any Texas high school in six years .
The combined graduation rate for the entire region ’s high schools is 58.5 percent .
The 12 noncharter high schools with the worst graduation rates , the study concluded , are all Houston ISD campuses .
“ There is a real crisis , a crisis of graduation , ” Children at Risk president and CEO Robert Sanborn said , pointing out the link between poverty and education levels .
“ We really do n’t think the TEA and the school districts are being honest with the public . ”
Sanborn said HISD estimates it graduates as many as 77 percent of its students within four years .
That number is based on faulty data that does n’t count as dropouts students who claim they ’re going to be home schooled , attend private school or move out of state or country , he said .
Sanborn said the first step in fixing high schools is admitting the severity of the problem .
He called for the Legislature , the TEA and individual school districts to become more transparent and use the graduation rate calculation formula Children at Risk used in this study .
Several area school districts posted graduation rates that were worse than Houston ’s , including North Forest ( 45.7 percent ) , Dickinson ( 46.4 percent ) , Channelview ( 48.5 percent ) , and La Marque ( 51.8 percent ) .
Though alarming , Sanborn said he wants schools to keep track the way his group did so people are spurred to take action to better the schools through longer school days , extended school years , smaller learning communities and other methods he said are proven to help students learn and stay in school .
Karen Garza , HISD ’s chief academic officer , said the district sees dropouts as an important problem that they are working to address .
She suggested the Children at Risk numbers fail to consider how mobile the population of this urban school district is by excluding students who may start here but graduated in Oklahoma or Mexico or anywhere outside of Texas .
“ We acknowledge this is a major issue .
We ’ve got to get better at keeping kids in school , ” Garza said .
“ We want solutions .
We offer more and more options , things like flexible hours and on - line courses . ”
But , Garza said , HISD uses the formula prescribed by the TEA , and she does n’t see the Children at Risk calculation as being any more reliable .
Sanborn said they followed the suggestions of former U.S. Education Secretary Margaret Spellings ’ administration .
The group had the TEA analyze the 2001 - 2002 class of freshmen and track them through six years and count them if they graduated from a high school anywhere in Texas .
They were not counted as graduates if they went to private school , left the state or were home schooled .
Linda Roska of the TEA said her agency follows guidelines from the National Governors Association but might alter the math if the new federal administration adopts some of Spellings ’ suggested changes .
But Roska was unsure whether what Children at Risk did was what the federal government might want .
Sanborn acknowledged he does n’t expect the state Legislature to address this statistical issue this session , which ends June 1 .
Urban schools in the region graduated 55 percent of freshmen under the advocacy group ’s method and suburban schools graduated 68.6 percent .
The highest local graduation rate in Sanborn ’s study was at Friendswood ISD with 78.4 percent and the lowest was North Forest ISD with 45.7 percent .
Friendswood reported a 94 percent four - year graduation rate to the state in 2007 , the same year the Children at Risk study ended .
Among school districts with multiple high schools , Katy , Fort Bend and Cypress - Fairbanks posted the highest graduation rates .

Stop bothering them about health care -- our public servants are too busy with other affairs to bother about you and your family
ARKANSANS CAN’T AFFORD THE STATUS QUO
Roughly 1.5 million people in Arkansas get health insurance on the job , where family premiums average $ 11,486 , about the annual earning of a full - time minimum wage job .
Since 2000 alone , average family premiums have increased by 81 percent in Arkansas .
Household budgets are strained by high costs : 27 percent of middle - income Arkansas families spend more than 10 percent of their income on health care .
High costs block access to care : 17 percent of people in Arkansas report not visiting a doctor due to high costs .
Arkansas businesses and families shoulder a hidden health tax of roughly $ 1500 per year on premiums as a direct result of subsidizing the costs of the uninsured .
AFFORDABLE HEALTH COVERAGE IS INCREASINGLY OUT OF REACH IN ARKANSAS
18 percent of people in Arkansas are uninsured , and 69.5 percent of them are in families with at least one full - time worker .
The percent of Arkansans with employer coverage is declining : from 57 to 53 percent between 2000 and 2007 .
Much of the decline is among workers in small businesses .
While small businesses make up 75 percent of Arkansas businesses , only 29 percent of them offered health coverage benefits in 2006 -- down 3 percent since 2000 .
Choice of health insurance is limited in Arkansas .
Blue Cross Blue Shield AR alone constitutes 75 percent of the health insurance market share in Arkansas , with the top two insurance providers accounting for 81 percent .
Choice is even more limited for people with pre-existing conditions .
In Arkansas , premiums can vary based on demographic factors and health status , and coverage can exclude pre-existing conditions or even be denied completely .
ARKANSANS NEED HIGHER QUALITY , GREATER VALUE , AND MORE PREVENTATIVE CARE
The overall quality of care in Arkansas is rated as “ Weak . ”
Preventative measures that could keep Arkansans healthier and out of the hospital are deficient , leading to problems across the age spectrum :
20 percent of children in Arkansas are obese .
26 percent of women over the age of 50 in Arkansas have not received a mammogram in the past two years .
45 percent of men over the age of 50 in Arkansas have never had a colorectal cancer screening .
70 percent of adults over the age of 65 in Arkansas have received a flu vaccine in the past year .
Roughly 9.8 million people in Florida get health insurance on the job , where family premiums average $ 12,780 , about the annual earning of a full - time minimum wage job .
Since 2000 alone , average family premiums have increased by 88 percent in Florida .
Household budgets are strained by high costs : 21 percent of middle - income Florida families spend more than 10 percent of their income on health care .
High costs block access to care : 15 percent of people in Florida report not visiting a doctor due to high costs .
Florida businesses and families shoulder a hidden health tax of roughly $ 1400 per year on premiums as a direct result of subsidizing the costs of the uninsured .
AFFORDABLE HEALTH COVERAGE IS INCREASINGLY OUT OF REACH IN FLORIDA
21 percent of people in Florida are uninsured , and 73 percent of them are in families with at least one full - time worker .
The percent of Floridians with employer coverage is declining : from 57 to 54 percent between 2000 and 2007 .
Much of the decline is among workers in small businesses .
While small businesses make up 78 percent of Florida businesses , only 39 percent of them offered health coverage benefits in 2006 -- down 7 percent since 2000 .
Choice of health insurance is limited in Florida .
Blue Cross Blue Shield FL alone constitutes 30 percent of the health insurance market share in Florida , with the top two insurance providers accounting for 45 percent .
Choice is even more limited for people with pre-existing conditions .
In Florida , premiums can vary based on demographic factors and health status , and coverage can exclude pre-existing conditions or even be denied completely in some cases .
FLORIDIANS NEED HIGHER QUALITY , GREATER VALUE , AND MORE PREVENTATIVE CARE
The overall quality of care in Florida is rated as “ Weak . ”
Preventative measures that could keep Floridians healthier and out of the hospital are deficient , leading to problems across the age spectrum :
18 percent of children in Florida are obese .
18 percent of women over the age of 50 in Florida have not received a mammogram in the past two years .
36 percent of men over the age of 50 in Florida have never had a colorectal cancer screening .
56 % of voters in Iowa favor the public option .
But Chuck Grassley does n't give a hoot .
He 's taken $ 1,927,679 from the Medical - Industrial Complex and $ 888,724 from Insurance companies and even though he has to face the voters next year , he 's confident that he can pull the wool over their eyes once again .
He 's a die hard opponent of any kind of real health care reform and , as the ranking Republican on the Senate Finance Committee , he 's been working assiduously with his crony , Max Baucus ( D - MT ) , the committee 's chair , to perform a late term abortion on anything that even smells remotely like a public option .
When Washington was overwhelmed with demonstrators from all over America yesterday , it was obstructionists like Grassley and Baucus who drew them to the nation 's capital .
Everything was peaceful ... for now .
But if corrupt senators like Chuck Grassley and , Blanche Lincoln , Joe Lieberman , Ben Nelson , Mitch McConnell , Richard Burr and Max Baucus manage to carry out orders from the Insurance Industry and wreck the bill , no telling how Americans could react -- even before election time .
And you might not guess it from multimillionaire Dianne Feinstein 's tepid , grudging support for health care reform by 85 % of Californians also support helath care reform that includes ata public option -- if not single - payer .
Is it possible that the 15 % who favor the status quo all live in the congressional districts represented by virulently anti-reform congressmen like Dan Lungren , Darrell Issa , Brian Billbray , John Campbell , Ken Calvert , Elton Gallegly , Mary Bono Mack , Wally Herger , Duncan Hunter , Jerry Lewis , Gary Miller , Ed Royce , Dana Rohrabacher , George Radanovich , Devin Nunes , Tom McClintock , Kevin McCarthy and Buck McKeon ?
Actually , not .
It 's statistically impossible -- especially when you factor in that 55 % of registered Republicans in California favor the public option !
These members of Congress do n't represent their constituents in the most important issue in front of the American people .
They represent the campaign contributors and Insurance Industry CEOs who have pumped millions of dollars into their campaign chests .
If California voters decide to withdraw support from all opponents of the public option supported overwhelmingly by Californians , 2011 will begin with a state congressional delegation clean of Republicans .
Today HHS Secretary Katherine Sebelius released a state by state report of the health care situation Americans are facing .
Since Blue America is in the midst of a Campaign for Health Care Choice that starts in Arkansas , let 's take a look at the situation reactionary Democrats Blanche Lincoln and Mark Pryor are ignoring when they accede to the demands of their donors in the Medical - Industrial Complex .
Keep in mind that Blanche Lincoln has solicited and accepted the most funding from the Medical Industrial Complex ( $ 218,850 ) in the current election cycle .
Widely thought to be more a representative from WalMart and the Walton family than of the average families of Arkansas , Lincoln is one of the most corrupt members of Congress when it comes to taking money from CEOs and Big Business and then serving their special interests and spitting in the face of her constituents .
Lincoln must have thrown a fit when she saw Sebelius ' report today : Arkansas is in bad shape but they 're not alone .
With virtually no Republicans agreeing with their own constituents that a public option is the way to go , you can take any state in the Union ( and especially in the Old Confederacy ) and find a disconnect between members of Congress following a lock - step anti-family ideology and average families wanting the reasonable health insurance like the rest of the industrial world already has -- and for far , far less money than the U.S. spends on health care .
Take Florida for example .
Mel Martinez is retiring from the Senate , but not before he votes against a public option .
The two Republicans seeking his seat -- Governor Charlie Crist and far right extremist Marco Rubio , both oppose a public option .
This despite the findings in Sebelius 's report : Take a look at this outrageous video .
Lisa of Lake Worth , FL has hydrocephalus or water on the brain and several other health ailments that require regular monitoring and care .
Like millions of Americans , when Lisa lost her job , she also lost her health insurance .
Lisa was unable to afford COBRA , but when she called around to inquire about coverage from private insurers she was categorically denied .
As soon as I told them about my situation , Lisa says , they said forget it ; they absolutely wouldnt even go any further .

Scenes from the Violent Twilight of Oil
Across the globe , oil is invoked as an agent of destiny .
Oil will make you rich , oil will make you poor , oil will bring war , oil will deliver peace , oil will shape our world as much as the glaciers did in the Ice Age .
But how ?
Oil is not a machine that can be disassembled or schematized for comprehension .
It is a liquid .
How do you coax secrets from a liquid ?
To know a person , you talk to him .
To know a country , you visit it .
To know a religion , you study sacred texts .
Oil defies these norms of interrogation .
It is a commodity that is extracted , refined , shipped , and poured into gas tanks with few people seeing it .
It has no voice , body , army , or dogma of its own .
It is invisible most of the time , but like gravity , it influences everything .
Over the course of eight years , I tried to solve this puzzle by talking with people who worked in the industry , visiting people who were touched by its operations , and taking a look not only at oil fields but the battlefields they have spawned .
I met with oilmen in Houston , princes in Riyadh , lobbyists in Washington , roughnecks in Baku , warlords in the Niger Delta , leftists in Caracas , billionaires in Moscow , environmentalists in Quito , generals in Baghdad , traders in Manhattan , wildcatters in Midland , and diplomats in London .
If you have conversations with people such as these , the topics you discuss include not just politics and economics but history , geology , geography , chemistry , engineering , physics , climatology , ecology , accounting , law , corruption , culture , psychology , anthropology , greed , envy , disease , ego , and fear .
The world of oil is an intellectual as much as a physical space , and my years of journeying took me through a crude world that is as dark and amazing as the liquid that casts a spell on all of us .
NIGERIA
The canoe that carried me into the Niger Delta had an outboard engine that conked out several times before reaching Tombia , which was then the latest target in Nigeria ’s long - running oil war .
Tombia was a shambles , half its homes burned or bombed beyond repair .
A dozen survivors came to the creek , and their manner was not warm .
They were young men , fighters , some with soiled bandages .
Fingers and hands were missing ; limbs were swathed in pus-caked gauze .
Government forces had attacked Tombia in the brutal way they usually do , with helicopter gunships strafing anything that moved and speedboats disgorging soldiers who shot their way through town .
A dozen people were reported killed , and most of the town ’s population was too frightened to return — but in any event , there was not much to return to .
The leader of these survivors , whose nickname was Prince , angrily pointed out the town ’s destruction with the stump of what used to be his right hand .
Even the Lutheran cathedral , St. Stephen ’s , was destroyed .
Its timid pastor , living in a shack and shivering from malaria or fear of the bitter youths who now ruled this wasteland , said it had been constructed by British missionaries in 1915 .
A sign by the church declared in English , “ Tombia is dedicated to God.
Jesus the King over the land .
Holy ghost in charge . ”
A boy who looked 12 years old and was blind in one eye stood in front of a house that had burned to its concrete foundation .
His older brother had been killed , he said , and the town was now dead and his river was dead too , tainted by oil .
Because of the pollution , he could not possibly catch enough fish to nourish himself and his dead brother ’s family .
He was angry and hopeless ; the result was listlessness .
The government , the Army , Royal Dutch / Shell , the warlords , the writer who would leave in a few minutes — they would not help .
His only hope was , it seemed , the Holy Ghost .
I returned to the canoe and it was not long , just an hour or so , before I reached Oro Sangama .
Its defining feature was apprehended on first inhalation — a heavy odor of sewage that had fused with humidity to form a fecal mist .
It existed because Sangama ’s residents relieved themselves in a creek just a few steps from their homes ; the creek was dead , or nearly so , as was the sickly jungle around it .
Oro Sangama had another peculiar feature :
There was a steady roar around it , like the sound of a giant flamethrower .
Across the fetid creek stood a natural gas plant operated by Shell .
The village was in the shadow of its largest flare , which shot into the air a plume of fire .
As darkness fell , Sangama became illuminated by the flare ’s reddish glow and remained lit in this fashion until the sun rose in the morning .
The Martian light was deadly rather than helpful because the flare spews into the air a cocktail of toxic substances .
Soon I was greeted by King Tom Mercy , leader of the local Ijaw community .
He wore a T - shirt and a frown .
“ This is where the oil and gas comes out , ” he said .
“ They could give us water , give us light , give us scholarships , give us jobs .
We would not quarrel with anyone again .
We have tried everything , used lawyers and dialogue , and we see there is no way .
The next thing is violence .
We do n’t care if everyone dies ; we will burn it . ”
Aboard his canoe the next day , we moved through mangrove creeks in which there was no screeching of monkeys , no hippos or crocodiles in the water , no butterflies floating in the air .
Between the war and the pollution , this was both a dead zone and a killing zone .
At some spots , the shoreline was shaved of vegetation and fenced off , to protect flares and pits that burned off excess oil and gas .
The earth in these places was , quite literally , on fire .
This journey required , for comprehension , the imagination of a science fiction devotee .
We passed a small island known as Little Russia .
The origin of its name was not clear , but the island served a distinct purpose — it was where prostitutes lived , servicing the needs of soldiers and oil workers .
On its shore , young women stood in the shade of shacks fronted with empty beer bottles and off - kilter picnic tables .
The girls waved .
The smell of oil was strong , even when wells or flares were not visible .
Where did it come from ?
I looked down and saw a film of oil on the river .
At a flow station where fluids dripped into the water from a tangle of metal pipes that had the appearance of industrial art , a Shell sign said , “ Keep Nigeria Safe and Clean . ”
The canoe stopped in front of six wellheads coated in oil that fell , drop by drop , into the water .
If a match was thrown into the river , we would be engulfed in flames .
“ How can we expect to catch fish ? ” King Tom asked .
His anger was no performance .
“ Let ’s go , ” he ordered .
We soon passed a patrol boat with unsmiling soldiers .
“ You see how we live . ”
HOUSTON
One evening I joined more than a thousand oil executives in a Houston ballroom that was large enough for a jumbo jet or two .
The pinstriped diners were served plates of mixed salad , grilled salmon , and chocolate mousse by overworked waiters whose service was as gentle as cowboys heaving bales of hay to livestock .
This was the gala evening of an annual oil conference at the Westin hotel .
Drawn from across the globe , the men and just a few women in the chandeliered cavern constituted an oilpalooza .
The attraction on this February evening in 2003 was a chemical engineer from South Dakota .
Since 1963 he had worked for just one company , eventually becoming its chairman and chief executive .
He made everyone else in his hard - bitten industry seem gentle .
He was gruff even to members of Congress and scoffed at global warming long after scientists proved it .
Greenpeace called him the “ Darth Vader of global warming . ”
He was superficially unappealing too , with a misshapen lip , an ample belly , and a set of jowls that cartoonists would judge absurd .
But in the oil industry you do not need to be pretty or kind to succeed , and this oilman had succeeded beyond anyone ’s imagining .
Lee Raymond had turned ExxonMobil into the largest and most profitable corporation in the United States .
He was rewarded with an astounding $ 686 million in compensation during his 13 - year tenure as chief executive , which breaks down to about $ 144,000 a day , or more than $ 6,000 for every hour he worked , slept , ate , or golfed .
But Raymond was nearly unknown outside the environmental lobby that despised him , the financial industry that swooned over him , and the oil industry that feared him ( Exxon ’s executive suite was known as “ the God Pod ” ) .
Think of the tycoons who are part of the contemporary lexicon — Gates , Murdoch , Buffett , Jobs — and realize that absent from their ranks is the man who oversaw one of the most profitable multinationals of the 20th century .
I wanted to see him on this evening because he was not just at the highest echelon of his industry ’s ruling class , but seemed its epitome .
After the mousse plates were cleared , Raymond lumbered onto the ballroom stage .
The crowd offered a round of applause that was more akin to a handshake than a hug .
In this industry , there was no need to feign love ; grudging respect would do .
His speech was an industrial mission statement .
His listeners , who included ministers , princes , and CEOs , were reminded of how vital their work was , how underappreciated they were , how they must labor harder than ever , how the future will be grander than the already - blessed present .
A video screen enlarged Raymond ’s presence to superhuman proportions .
It was part Tony Robbins , part Billy Graham , with a whiff of a mumbling Leonid Brezhnev .
Invoking a sacred industrial purpose , Raymond recited his version of the inspirational commandments of the oil world :
“ We all have a tremendous opportunity and a responsibility to improve the quality of life the world over .
Virtually nothing is made without our energy and our products .
“ Our industry ’s best years lie ahead , surpassing even the greatest achievements of the century gone by .
“ We condemn the violation of human rights in any form and believe our stand on human rights sets a positive example for countries where we operate . ”
The audience ’s reaction was ritualized , less a genuine wave of applause than an obligatory simulation .
I was reminded that in this brutal business , it was best to save your enthusiasm for crushing a rival rather than congratulating him .
VENEZUELA
Venezuela , which has the world ’s seventh - largest oil reserves , is a classic example of what economist Joseph Stiglitz calls “ a rich country with poor people . ”
Caracas , the capital , is surrounded by coils of barrios ; voters from these impoverished areas are the electoral base for President Hugo Chávez , who promises to create true prosperity from the oil riches .
I stopped by Miraflores , the presidential palace , to see how Chávez was performing the trick that eluded so many of his predecessors .
The Miraflores event was part of the great game of our times — the superpower search for steady supplies of energy .
China , which did n’t import much petroleum until 2000 yet is now the second - largest importer after the United States , was doing whatever it could to win the friends and resources it needed .
To woo Caracas , China had just agreed to help launch a communications satellite on favorable terms .
In a conference hall at the palace , Chávez was getting ready to break this news to the world .
Onstage , several executives from the China Great Wall Industry Corporation sat beside the stout Venezuelan president .
After the Chinese and Venezuelan anthems were sung , Chávez launched into a speech of the sort that is his trademark — a presidential stream of consciousness .
He congratulated the Chinese for being clever at math and saluted their women for being so beautiful .
He thanked the Chinese government for training Venezuelans in satellite technology , saying they were teaching Venezuela “ how to fly . ”
As a visual aid , he flapped his arms like wings .
He added that the Chinese had learned to fly under “ the great Mao Zedong , ” and because Chávez drew inspiration from Mao ’s one - party , one - truth pedigree , he smiled broadly and exhorted , “ Long live the Chinese revolution ! ”
The Chinese businessmen , as rigorously mercantilist these days as John Rockefeller was in his time , gazed at Chávez .
They did n’t seem to know whether the desired response was sardonic smiles or clenched fists , but their expressions veered toward the safe harbor of nodding approval .
One of them adjusted the volume on his translation headset as Chávez said , “ We do n’t want to earn money out of this .
We ’re not capitalists .
This is about the survival of our country and the destruction of capitalism .
Capitalists are generating death ! ”
Yet capitalists are still buying oil from Venezuela , and lots of it ; most of Venezuela ’s oil exports go to the United States .
A president can flap his arms in Caracas and hold his nose at the United Nations and promise to remake his nation , but reality is crude in many ways .
There is a saying that Venezuela does not have good or bad presidents , just presidents who serve at times of high or low oil prices .
Chávez , running for president in 1998 as the main political parties all but collapsed from decrepitude , had the great luck of being elected when oil sold for $ 12 a barrel .
As his presidency began , prices started climbing , on their way to more than $ 140 by 2008 .
Venezuelans had seen this before — presidents who became popular by increasing public spending and who became unpopular when the oil boom ebbed .
Chávez ’s announcement at Miraflores — indeed , his entire presidency — had the feel of what Venezuelan scholar Fernando Coronil described as a state limited to “ magic performances , not miracles . ”
Magic can obscure reality but not make it disappear .
SAUDI ARABIA
When our paths crossed , Mohammed Ibrahim Abdul Aziz was 20 years old .
He seemed young for his age — his sparse facial hair gave him the look of a teenager .
He had studied at King Saud University in Riyadh but had not been inspired by his teachers and had not been hopeful of finding work after graduation .
The paradoxes of Saudi Arabia include the fact that it has oceans of oil but not an economy that offers jobs its citizens want .
This is one of the problems of the oil industry :
It generates lots of cash but very little work .
Mohammed dropped out of school and like many Saudi youths spent his spare time cruising the Internet .
When I asked which fundamentalist Web sites he ’d visited , Mohammed could n’t remember precisely because there were so many , all extolling the glory of doing battle against infidels .
I met Mohammed in Samarra , Iraq , where he had gone to fight Americans in 2005 .
He had been captured a few days before our encounter , and he had certainly seen better days .
He was wearing a green frock covered in mud and his eyes were bloodshot .
He had been interrogated almost nonstop .
A soiled bandage was wrapped around his head ; he said he was injured when the car he was traveling in , with two members of his insurgent cell , was attacked by Iraqi soldiers .
It was just as probable that he had been roughed up but did not want to say so .
We talked in an office in a library that had been converted to a detention center .
A desk in our midst had bloodstains down its side .
From parts of the detention center I was not allowed to visit , I could hear prisoners screaming and retching .
Mohammed ’s career as a holy warrior had lasted a few weeks .
He had no skills to offer the insurgency because he had never fired a weapon or built a bomb , did not know his way around Iraq , and could not even blend into a crowd because his Saudi accent gave him away .
When he realized his insurgent cell was led by a man who seemed more interested in stealing cars than killing Americans , he wanted out .
His capture came as a relief , which is why he had not been tortured to the edge of death — he was more than happy to tell everything he knew .
“ I made a mistake , ” Mohammed said .
“ I just hope I will be allowed to go back to Riyadh .
I want to leave . ”
He would not be going home soon .
A U.S. military advisor , dressed in jeans and with a pistol strapped to his thigh , was monitoring my talk with Mohammed .
The Iraqi who interpreted , also with a pistol on his hip , was an overweight police official .
The Saudi , the American , and the Iraqi in this room were in a deep mess , as were their homelands .
There were many reasons , and a core one was evoked when Mohammed ventured a guess as to why Iraq had been invaded .
“ The Americans want to control Iraq ’s resources , ” he said .
“ They came here for oil . ”

Only a few hours left to Double your gift
On a frigid January night some years ago , a friend and I snuck into a Massachusetts state preserve , stripped naked , and charged into Walden Pond .
For a few exhilarating , painful moments we swam , and I imagined some hard - to - name kinship with the pond ’s most famous neighbor , the 19th century eccentric Henry David Thoreau .
It was a climax in my relationship with Thoreau and his Walden .
When I read the book for the first time at age 17 , it reawakened the intellectual curiosity that I tried to bury in high school .
( It did n’t seem useful for attracting girls , not that anything else worked better … ) .
Thoreau ’s reflections on nature inspired me to take a notebook out to the forest preserves that dot suburban Chicago , determined to think deep naturey thoughts of my own .
Thankfully , that notebook ’s been lost .
In college I made my pilgrimage to Walden — hence the dip .
But somewhere around then Thoreau ’s uncompromising social critique grew tiresome .
Like plenty of Walden readers before me , I came to see the great champion of American individualism less as a prophet than as a self - righteous crank .
In praising the bright fire within each soul , I concluded , he failed to see the profound ways our lives are connected to others .
The famous proof for his hypocrisy is that while philosophizing about self - sufficiency in his solitary shack , he would drop off his laundry at his mother ’s place back in town .
Lately , trying to make sense of the deeply un-philosophical threat of climate change , I ’ve wondered if Thoreau has anything to say to the movement to halt greenhouse gas emissions .
Back - to - nature environmentalists of the ’60s and ’ 70s embraced Thoreau ’s skepticism toward technology — he distrusted even the telegraph and the railroad .
Organic gardeners approved of his bean field .
His contemplative habits seemed to fit the spiritual strain of the era .
But now ?
Environmentalists have largely cast off their crunchy garb in favor of business suits , the better to woo lawmakers and venture capitalists .
This is especially true of climate - minded activists .
As Time magazine ’s Bryan Walsh wrote last winter about a renewable energy summit in Abu Dhabi , “ There ’s little about trees or wildlife , nothing about environmental sacrifice — this is about the business of getting the carbon out of our energy supply as quickly as possible . ”
All of that suggests the movement has outgrown Thoreau , just as I thought I had myself .
I ’ve been prompted to reconsider by Robert Sullivan ‘s recent book The Thoreau You Do n’t Know : What the Prophet of Environmentalism Really Meant .
Sullivan , who has written unusual “ nature ” books on rats and the Meadowlands dumping grounds outside New York City , tries to rescue Thoreau from the humorless image that turned off so many high school English students and the cloud of reverence cast by those who would see Thoreau as a patron saint of wilderness preservation .
I think Sullivan does a great job .
In place of the crank Thoreau , he offers evidence for a dancing Thoreau , one who played ditties on his flute , got along well with children , and wrote with his tongue in cheek .
In place of the wilderness saint ( and hermit ) image , Sullivan introduces a Thoreau just as interested in the peopled world as in the natural world , a distinction he did n’t buy into anyway .
“ Today , adults force high school students to read him , though he critiques the life - in - a - rut grown - up and might prescribe a little teenagerness , ” writes Sullivan .
“ He loved nature , but if we read him closely … we see him cutting down trees , polluting ponds , working with land developers and miners . ”
It ’s not hard to see how the humor suffers over the years .
Thoreau has a line about eating rice because he likes the philosophy of India .
I misread it as deadpan until Sullivan pointed out the joke , uncovering a bit of Thoreau ’s mischievous streak .
The simplest reason to reconsider Walden ‘s relevance might be its economic context — Sullivan argues the book was written after a recession as bleak as our own .
New England ’s dominant agricultural industry was unsmoothly giving way to the early stages of a manufacturing economy .
Thoreau no doubt had money on his mind at Walden .
For much of his adult life he casted about , struggling to make it as a schoolteacher , poet , lecturer , or in the family pencil - making business ( where he gladly embraced advances in pencil - tech ; it was the uncritical embrace of technology he opposed ) .
To miss the recession context of Walden is like reading the Grapes of Wrath without considering the Great Depression , Sullivan says .
The United States had reached middle age , its political parties grown bloated , and a variety of reformers were grasping about for various fixes .
“ America needed a kick in the pants and a lot of people knew it , ” Sullivan writes , “ though all those people had very different ideas of where and how to deliver the kick , resulting in no one effective boot . ”
With that familiar situation in mind , I ’d suggest three reasons Thoreau is still worth engaging .
The stunt
Key to Sullivan ’s interpretation is the idea of the Walden years as a stunt , with a book deal always in mind .
Think No Impact Man , Julie and Julia , The Year of Living Biblically , even Supersize Me .
These are undertaken as journeys of self - discovery , sure , but also out of full knowledge that the hero is on camera , so to speak .
Same with Walden .
Thoreau ’s itemized list of costs for his hut — with second - hand materials , it totaled $ 28.12 and 1/2 cents — parodied the lists in house pattern books fashionable at the time .
The hut ’s lack of ornamentation rejected the way housekeepers had begun to stylize their homes .
In his writing at the pond , Thoreau could describe his own strange life and the reasons he chose it .
He knew readers would listen .
The cheap lesson for climate change activists is something about being media savvy .
Perhaps there ’s a bigger message : People look at how you live .
Even a stunt shows some investment .
That ’s why David de Rothschild builds his plastic boat .
There ’s an undeniable power in preaching something by living like you believe it .
Solitude
What first hooked me with Walden was the chapter on solitude and the author ’s story of returning to the pond after a late dinner with friends to paddle alone and fish .
At 17 , this deliberate aloneness seemed like an appealing alternative to lame old loneliness .
Withdrawing from a society that was “ commonly too cheap ” felt more noble than tripping around awkwardly inside it .
But Thoreau was n’t looking for zero company ; he was looking for encounters that let him give and receive full attention : “ We meet at the post - office , and at the sociable , and about the fireside every night ; we live thick and are in each other ’s way , and stumble over one another , and I think that we thus lose some respect for one another . ”
Dealing with climate change — through legislation , international treaties , renewable energy projects , green entrepreneurship — is all about playing well with others .
Thoreau - as - misanthrope is n’t much help .
But the Thoreau who praised periods of contemplative solitude because they allowed him to present a more fully awake self when interacting with others — there ’s something useful in that .
Civil Disobedience
I have n’t even mentioned “ Civil Disobedience , ” the essay in which Thoreau explains why he went to jail instead of paying taxes to fund the Mexican War , seen in its day as an effort to expand the reach of slavery .
Here lies the strongest proof that Thoreau ’s politics were about engaging , not escaping , society and government .
“ Let your life be counter friction to stop the machine , ” Thoreau writes in the piece that Gandhi and Martin Luther King , Jr. found deeply influential in the following century .
He is not demanding no government but better government : “ I have never declined paying the highway tax , because I am as desirous of being a good neighbor as I am of being a bad subject . ”
Civil disobedience still finds some expression in the climate change movement , in demonstrations against coal power and nowhere in the country more than in Appalachia .
In their appeal to moral authority , these demonstrators are saying something considerably more difficult than “ we all win with green jobs . ”
They ’re saying , if we do n’t do anything , some people wo n’t win .
They ’ll die .
I ’m all for doing the easy stuff first .
By all means , let ’s take the nearly painless gains to be gotten through weatherizing and retrofitting jobs and saving easy money through energy efficiency .
There ’s money lying on the ground and we may as well pick it up .
But once that ’s done , there ’s still Thoreau in his hut with his confounding instruction to “ simplify ” and his aphorisms : “ Under a government which imprisons any unjustly , the true place for a just man is also a prison . ”
He spoke in glaring moral terms , and that ’s always a risk .
It gets tiresome .
It ’s like the wrong kind of song stuck in your head — catchy and unrelenting both at once .
Sullivan makes a good case that Thoreau was n’t quite as irritating as he ’s been made out to be .
But he was still irritating .
Still is .
That ’s why he ’s hard to ignore .
Continuing a recent tradition , Google Inc. Chief Executive Eric Schmidt held court with the press Thursday at the Allen & Co. conference in Sun Valley , Idaho , where he called the current economy “ the new normal . ”
Companies need to “ figure out how to be happy and get our lives together in this new configuration , ” Schmidt said , adding , “ You ca n’t waste money , credit is tight . ”
Schmidt , who was joined by Google co-founder Larry Page , spoke on a variety of topics , including Apple Inc. CEO Steve Jobs ’ health , concerns about Google ’s power in Washington and whether Twitter and Facebook are hurting the Internet search giant .
Schmidt , who is on the board of Apple , said he was “ well informed ” about Jobs ’ condition .
He declined to comment on whether Apple should have been more forthcoming about Jobs , who underwent a liver transplant that was not disclosed to shareholders until after it was performed .

As for regulators ’ worries about Google ’s market power , Schmidt said competitors are trying to stir things up .
“ We now expect governments to look at what we ’re doing , ” he said .
“ We respect their role . ”
Schmidt said he still believes in MySpace , the struggling social networking site owned by News Corp. that Google struck a $ 900 - million advertising deal with several years ago .
“ We like MySpace a lot , ” Schmidt said , although he declined to say whether his company would renew the ad deal when it expires next year .
Schmidt expressed admiration for Hulu , the video site that carries episodes of new and old TV shows and whose owners include News Corp. , NBC Universal and Walt Disney Co .
He said he hoped to get more professional content on YouTube , the Google - owned site that is dominated by amateur videos .
Asked when YouTube , which Google acquired in 2006 for $ 1.65 billion , would make money , Schmidt said he would n’t make predictions .
Page added that a timeline for its profitability was “ just not that important . ”

The tone of the conference on Day 3 continued to be somber .
On a panel about global management , General Electric Co. Chief Executive Jeff Immelt lamented the state of education in the U.S. , complaining that his company has to go outside the country for the best people .
As for the economy , Martin Sorrell , the chairman and chief executive of advertising conglomerate WPP Group , told reporters , “ We do n’t see things improving . ”
News Corp.'s Rupert Murdoch was also bearish .
“ I ’m shocked at the business mood , ” he told his Fox Business Network .
“ It ’s going to take years and years , like five years at least , before we see any real growth coming out of this . ”
The conference was not without its light moments .
Microsoft Corp. Chairman Bill Gates was walking out to lunch past a gaggle of reporters who were asking about Google ’s plans to launch an operating system to rival Windows when a voice behind him said , “ Better if you not comment . ”
It was Google ’s Schmidt .
Sony Corp. Chief Executive Howard Stringer may have had the best quip of the day .
Asked about the success of Twitter and other social networking sites , Stringer said : “ A lot of people are doing very well at making very little money .
It ’s not a club I ’m looking to join . ”

The International Space Station 's Expedition 20 crew , the first - ever full six person team , share a meal in the Unity node of the International Space Station .
This Fourthof July weekend will be filled with dazzling fireworks displays for manyAmericans , but not for NASA astronaut Michael Barratt , who is flying high aboveEarth on the International Space Station .
Barratt is theonly American on the spacestation ?s six - man crew , which includes two Russian cosmonauts and astronautsfrom Japan , Canada and Belgium .
But while astronauts can see an amazing amountof detail on the Earth from the station ?s unique vantage point , spotting thetraditional U.S. Independence Day fireworks is not among them .
? It ? sbeyond the capability of human eye apparently to see manmade fireworks from orbit , ?NASA spokesperson Kelly Humphries told SPACE.com .
?
It ?s 200 miles away , you know .?
The spacestation orbits in the Earth at an altitude of about 220 miles ( 354 km ) .
It caneasily be seen as a bright , fast - moving light in the night sky by the unaidedeye .
NASA said this Fourth of July weekend will offer many Americans a chanceto seethe station for themselves if weather permits .
SPACE.com ?s SatelliteSpotting Guide has full details .
From itsorbit , the station is close enough to Earth that astronauts can spot thepyramids of Egypt and large ships on the ocean , but too high up to see Fourthof July light shows .
The station ?s most recent American skipper Michael Finckeof NASA said he was unable to spot the trademark New Year ?s
Eve fireworks thatmarked the start of 2009 around the world , Humphries said .
Fincke commanded thestation from October 2008 to last April .
Lightning , which astronauts can see flashing in clouds during thunderstorms , can make fora natural stand - in for artificial fireworks , Humphries said .
Fireworks andother open flames are not allowed inside the station ?s main cabin as a safetymeasure , though astronauts canlight fires inside a special sealed box as part of an ongoing science experiment .
Manymanmade structures are visible from Earth orbit , among them cities , highwaysand some of the vehicles that traverse them .
The GreatWall of China is visible from orbit , but can be an elusive target since iteasily blends in with the background scenery when seen from the space station , astronautshave said .
Former NASA astronaut Leroy Chiao listed his view of the Great Wall asone of his 10 favorite photographs from the more than 24,000 images he took whilecommanding the station ? s Expedition 10 mission between 2004 and 2005 .
No humanconstructs are visible from the moon , which is about 238,900 miles ( 384,402 km ) from Earth on the average .
While Barrattmay not get a chance to see fireworks , he will be able to spend some time withhis family through a video or radio link , Humphries said .
The father of fivefrom Camas , Wash . , and his fellow station crewmates will have some freeoff - duty time to contact their respective families or rest this weekend inaddition to their regular schedule of station cleaning , exercise and planningconferences .
? They ? vegot time off to enjoy the day , ?
Humphries said .
Lead story : Lower job loss and Obama 's White House response .
Financial correspondent reported as well .
Good stuff .
NEXT UP : Teabag story .
YES they actually suggested that it 's unclear whether the " outrage " is genuine or staged by Republican groups ( yes they said " republican groups " ) YES they show pictures of teabaggers with posters of Obama painted with a Hilter mustache .
YES they showed a progressive saying it seemed people were there to shout and not learn or ask questions .
YES they showed RUSH LIMBAUGH comparing Obama 's health care reform logo to the Nazi " logo " .
They talked about it for a second .
YES even Chuck Todd seemed his old self when he mentioned that Gibbs was saying that the Nazi symbolism is just too far .
YES they actually mentioned that perhaps this might backfire on the GOP .
YES they did .
Those are actually the words they used .
I knew this would happen .
I hate to say I told you so , but in this case , I 'll gladly say it .
This thing is flaming out and once again the GOP may be " overplaying their hand " ( as Brian Williams and Chuck Todd speculated )

The next story was about the " very popular cash for clunkers program " being approved in the Senate .
The next was about the killing of the head Taliban leader in Afghanistan .
THIS is what people who have normal lives saw tonight .
10 MILLION + of them .
The tide is turning and it's going to be a great month after all .
PS
By the way , my local Tampa news broadcast was about the same .
Only the Fox affiliate presented it as if it was semi-legitimate ( at 6 p.m. , anyway ) .
The NBC affiliate was less " kind " .
I think decent Floridian broadcasters are embarrassed by these idiots .
PS 2 : This morning on the Today Show ( the most viewed morning show ) there was NO mention of any resistance to health care reform or teabaggers .
They DID however , mention the hostage release , the popular cash for clunkers program and the killing of the Taliban leader in Afghanistan ( the lead story ) .
It ’s pretty much a distortion per day with these people .
Jonah Goldberg , editor - at - large of National Review Online , went on Fox News today to fan the flames of the latest fabricated “ death panel ” controversy .
Goldberg equated a Veterans Affairs pamphlet — one that ’s reportedly no longer being used — with Nazi eugenics , saying “ death panels may not be too far off the horizon . ”
The pamphlet in question is one that , Fox reported this weekend , encourages disabled veterans to decide whether their lives are worth living .
Tammy Duckworth , an assistant secretary of the VA , told Fox on Sunday that the department instructed VA doctors to stop using the pamphlet in 2007 .
It never stops .
Manna could fall to all hungry people , and the righties would all it socialism , unless , of course , they could somehow take credit for it during a Republican administration .
Some days you really wonder if the Democratic leadership understands that they are not facing a traditional opposition political party .
We ’re facing a senseless , radical authoritarianism that lost power and now wants it back .
This month proves that beyond all doubt , and Democrats and their allies forget that at their own peril .
You do n’t debate these people , you do n’t compromise with these people , you either beat them or you lose .
It ’s really that simple .
( Props to TPM . )
Say goodbye to Konami ’s much - despised online ID system .
Beginning with Pro Evolution Soccer 2010 the system is no more , and online gamers are free to play to their heart ’s content .
Much publicized in the Metal Gear Online debacle , the Konami ID system required every user to individually sign up with Konami , and create a user ID that would work for all Konami games .
The system was designed to work around PSN ’s guidelines , allowing Konami free reign over their games .
In principle , it seemed like a good idea .
However , especially with the release of Metal Gear Solid 4 and Metal Gear Online , the registration site was bombarded with users and reports arose that it took several days for some users to complete their registration .
We all at PlayStation LifeStyle are happy that their horrific online system is being abolished , and hopefully so are you .

One of Obama ’s campaign promises was to stop federal raids on medical marijuana dispensaries which were allowed by state law .
Many pundits ( myself included ) have been lambasting him for not living up to that promise based upon stories like these :
Police raids on medical marijuana dispensaries continue–and continue with federal help , despite an Obama promise to end federal raids on state - legal medical pot dealers .
Of course , Obama gave his Justice Department a loophole , with Attorney General Eric Holder saying back in March that his DEA ’s resources would “ go after those people who violate both federal and state law … .
Given the limited resources that we have , our focus will be on people , organizations that are growing , cultivating substantial amounts of marijuana and doing so in a way that ’s inconsistent with federal and state law . ”
This was a way to live up to Obama ’s promise that federal raids on people who were not violating their own state ’s law regarding medical marijuana would cease .
Unfortunately , so far it ’s hard to know how serious to take this promise in relation to these latest L.A. raids , since the federal agents ’ role in the raids on two Westside pot dispensaries ( and their owners ’ private homes ) is still unexplained as of this writing .
As the San Jose Mercury News reports .
Authorities are not saying why they raided two medical marijuana clinics and arrested the operator at his Los Angeles home .
Jeffrey Joseph was free on bail Thursday , one day after local and federal agents searched his home and the dispensaries in Los Angeles and Culver City .
Agents seized 450 plants and hundreds of pounds of marijuana products .
Spokespeople for the Drug Enforcement Administration , Los Angeles police , and the U.S. attorney say they do n’t know what Joseph was book on .
County prosecutors released no details .
Distributing medical pot is legal under California law but it ’s a federal crime .
However , the U.S. attorney general has said he would n’t target distributors unless state and federal laws were broken .
County prosecutors say the task force was acting on a state warrant .
There ’s a little history here .
Medical Marijuana dispensaries have become much more common in Los Angeles over the last few years due to several loopholes and exemptions that made it possible for them to open quickly .
The city council has been trying recently to cut down on these loopholes in order to reduce the number of operating dispensaries , but their own legal exemptions are making it very hard to do this quickly .
So how to close these shops without having to go through arduous examinations of dispensaries ’ “ hardship exemption ” applications ?
Simple , prove they ’ve been doing something else to break the guidelines .
On the bright side , they can then call in the big guns at the DEA to lend a hand !
It ’s win-win for the City Council and the Feds ( and a big LOSE for the dispensary owners and their customers , of course ) .
Sadly , many of the dispensaries are making the job easy on the city .
A personal acquaintance of mine is a CPA and runs the books for several of these dispensaries , and this is his take on the matter :
The more I interact within this industry the more I realize how illegal most of these operations are .
The state attorney general set up specific guidelines , as did the state board of equalization , that would allow an owner to operate freely without fear of raids & prosecution .
The key issue in these operations is transparency , which most dispensaries fail to realize .
Those operations that have their doors and books open to state and city regulators are never harassed .
The clubs that operate outside of the guidelines are always targeted .
And from a accounting and tax standpoint , it ’s extremely simple to figure out who is operating by the book and who ’s not .
I tell all my new clients to always be aware of the fact that the board of equalization is keeping a close eye on the industry to ensure that every sale is taxed and that every penny is sent to the state .
The state BOE is in bed with the Feds and have no problem calling for the leg - breakers ( the IRS ) when they feel they ’re being ripped off ; which in most cases they are .
These raids are a violent and disruptive elucidation of one critical aspect of business in our government - dominated world — your business exists at the pleasure of the state .
If they want to find a reason to come after you , they will find a reason to come after you , or manufacture one .
There are a lot of regulations attached to any business , and even more to the medical marijuana industry .
If they ’re watching , they ’ll catch you breaking one of them :
The only power any government has is the power to crack down on criminals .
Well , when there are n’t enough criminals , one makes them .
One declares so many things to be a crime that it becomes impossible for men to live without breaking laws .
- Ayn Rand
This is the modern equivalent to catching Al Capone on tax evasion , when there was n’t enough to bust him on the charges of bootlegging ( and everything else he was involved in ) .
Obama ’s not technically breaking his promise here , but he ’s still offering to bring in the big guns and prosecute pot dispensaries if they violate tax laws .
He ’s violating the spirit of the promise .
Luc Vandal :
You see , we independent developers rarely get any positive feedback .
A lot of it is composed of bad reviews ( that are actually support or feature requests ) with the occasional pat on the back .
I ’m also a consumer and , like most of you , I rarely take the time to write a review for apps I use daily .
I ’m also guilty of leaving bad reviews that may not have been deserved or did n’t bother to contact the developer first .
With over one million apps on the App Store , it ’s getting harder and harder to have your app stand out in such a crowded market .
This is a good idea .
Most people do n’t know how positive ratings and reviews can help in the App Store .
The fact that users tend to publicly point out the things they do n’t like rather than describe the ones they enjoy does n’t help either .
If apps make your personal life or work even just a little better every day , consider using 10 minutes of your time to rate them on the App Store .
If you have more detailed feedback or feature requests , send an email to the developers directly .
I know what I ’m doing tonight .
So good .
Brainstorming Reloaded
· Why brainstorming is ineffective and how to fix it .
Brainstorming was once thought a fantastic way for groups to generate new ideas .
Although not as fashionable as it once was , brainstorming is still frequently used in business and , often inadvertently , for all sorts of personal decisions ; people happily brainstorm for holiday destinations , restaurants and even new careers .
Brainstorming certainly looks like a great way of dealing with some of the problems associated with decision - making and creativity in groups , such as groupthink and people ’s failure to share information effectively .
By suspending evaluation , encouraging a relaxed atmosphere and quantity over quality , the brainstorming session is supposed to foster creativity .
But now we know that brainstorming does n’t actually work that well .
Experiment after experiment has shown that people in brainstorming sessions produce fewer and lower quality ideas than those working alone ( Furnham , 2000 ) .
Here ’s why :
Social loafing : people slack off to a frightening degree in certain types of group situations like brainstorming .
Evaluation apprehension : although evaluation is n’t allowed in a traditional brainstorming session , everyone knows others are scrutinising their input .
Production blocking : while one person is talking the others have to wait .
They then forget or dismiss their ideas , which consequently never see the light of day .
So if groups need to generate new ideas , new connections between old ideas and new ways of seeing the world , how should they proceed ?
The answer is that brainstorming needs a tweak .
Brainstorming reloaded
Inspiration for ways to get around these problems comes from the research on electronic brainstorming .
Gallupe and Cooper ( 1993 ) found that electronically mediated brainstormers generated more high quality ideas than face - to - face brainstomers .
In this research brainstormers typed in their ideas to a computer which also displayed other people ’s ideas at the same time .
This rather neatly gets around the social loafing and production blocking problems .
These ideas can be used to motivate face - to - face brainstormers to produce better results ( from Furnham , 2000 ) :
People should be encouraged to list ideas before coming to brainstorming sessions .
The number of ideas produced by each person should be monitored .
Problems should be broken down and group members should brainstorm components .
Groups should take breaks from each other .
High standards should be set for the number of ideas .
But why bother to try and ‘ fix ’ brainstorming at all ?
Why not just send people off individually to generate ideas if this is more efficient ?
The answer is because of its ability to build consensus by giving participants the feeling of involvement in the process .
People who have participated in the creative stage are likely to be more motivated to carry out the group ’s decision .
Also it emerges that groups do have a natural talent , which is the evaluation of ideas , rather than their creation .
The conclusion of the psychological literature , therefore , is that people should be encouraged to generate ideas on their own and meetings should be used to evaluate these ideas .
The same rule applies in business as in your personal life .
Generating ideas about where to go on holiday , what to write that new sitcom about , what question your research should address , and so on , are best done alone .
Groups are n’t where ideas are born , but where they come to sink or swim .
By By Andrew Moran Aug 30 , 2009 in Politics Currently the Republican base has remained stagnant by being disorganized and no clear leader in sight .
Could the possible Senator from Connecticut Peter Schiff be the one to take the Republicans out of this hole they are in ?
A recent Peter Schiff , the Republican Senate candidate for the Connecticut seat in 2010 , could be the perfect fit .
Peter Schiff believes in limited government , sound money and Austrian Theory economics , which is the platform the Republican Party used to promote but never abide by .
Most important of all , he understands economics and foresaw this global financial collapse for several years when the majority in Washington continued to tell their constituents that everything was fine .
Ron Paul ’s 2008 Presidential economic advisor has been telling Americans all along that they need to begin saving again and start producing and that a consumer economy is not a real economy .
He has also been a key proponent of Ron Paul ’s
In an interview in 2008 , Peter Schiff compared the Federal Reserve system to a kindergarten class , ‘ If a kindergarten school teacher leaves the classroom and gives the kids pixie sticks and soda pop and when the teacher comes back and sees the classroom wrecked and all the kids have gone wild , who are you going to blame ? ’
Earlier in this month , Schiff held a Schiff has been critical of both Presidents George W. Bush and Barack Obama over their economic and foreign policies .
He was able to foresee every move the government was going to do with the global economic downturn and worse , the ramifications that could persist long after government meddling .
Similar to Texas Republican Congressman Ron Paul , Schiff wants to return back to a Constitutional Republic and put the economy back into the hands of free markets and not centralized planning .
If Peter Schiff can win the Republican Senate nomination and defeat incumbent Democrat Chris Dodd , he may be a force to reckon with in the Senate because he will continue to relay his message of : ‘ There are five on a deserted island .
To create a functioning society , each one is assigned tasks .
Four of the five people ( the Asians ) work : one goes and finds fish , another collects berries and veggies , another hunts and the last one collects firewood and cooks .
The one person left ( the American ) - his job is to eat and consume . ’
Is Peter Schiff the one to lead the Republican Party in 2010 and beyond ?
While the Republican base is pretty bland and with no clear leader right now , Peter Schiff , President of Euro - Pacific Capital and author of Crash Proof , could be the one who could take the Republicans out of the slump they are in .
A recent survey showed that Democratic approval rating is down but Republican approval rating has stayed consistently flat since the 2008 Presidential and Congressional elections .
This is the time where the Republicans need a decisive and bold leader .

Scales of Injustice : Fish Feel Pain , Too
An Animal Rights Article from All - Creatures.org
FROM
Jenny Moxham
As published in Sidney Morning Herold
August 18 , 2009
WHAT bugs me is fishermen who claim they fish because it's a ' ' relaxing ' ' pastime .
One fisherman I know says angling allows him the time to '' reflect on the hustle and bustle of life ' ' .
What ?
Torturing defenceless animals does that ?
How fishermen can have such weird ideas is mind - boggling .
If we saw someone shoving a hook into a puppy 's mouth and yanking him aloft we'd be livid .
We 'd call the police or the RSPCA .
Yet we have fisherfolk sticking hooks into the throats of other equally sensitive creatures and dangling them in the air and somehow it 's viewed as fun .
Not only that , it 's supposedly '' relaxing ' ' .
Come on .
Research has shown that , anatomically and biologically , the pain system in fish is virtually the same as in birds and mammals .
Being hooked hurts fish as much as it would hurt us .
You'd think this knowledge would make any sensible person realise fishing is unacceptably cruel .
Well , the Victorian Government did n't see it that way .
It decided to spend $ 3.2 million dollars of taxpayers ' money on promoting angling as a ' ' fun and healthy outdoor activity for the entire family ' ' .
So now they stage regular free family fishing events where children as young as four attend workshops that teach them how to hook and asphyxiate fish .
To make sure many children experience the fun of impaling and suffocating a fish , hundreds of large , farm - raised fish are deposited at the venue .
These fish farms are much like the factory farms in which broiler chickens , battery hens and pigs are kept .
Fish are tightly confined in filthy enclosures , and many suffer from diseases and debilitating injuries .
When they are finally released into a lake it must feel like heaven .
( Much the same as when a battery hen is rescued and allowed to walk around for the first time in her life . )
How heartless then to deposit these fish at venues where they will be tricked into swallowing barbed hooks and suffocated .
Professor Bill Runciman , of Adelaide University , says fishing constitutes the greatest source of confused thinking and inconsistency on earth with respect to pain .
He points out people get very excited about dolphins , but have no qualms about fishing competitions at which thousands of people snare fish with hooks and allow them to asphyxiate .
Come on , fisherfolk - it 's time to acknowledge the truth .
Fishing hurts !

Gay rights activists said the law could ban the discussion of homosexuality Lithuania 's parliament has backed a bill that censors certain information , including on homosexuality , from reaching minors .
MPs overturned a presidential veto of the child - protection law , which critics say could institutionalise homophobia .
The legislation would ban the public dissemination of information considered harmful to minors .
This covers material on homosexuality , bisexuality and polygamy , as well as depictions of violence and death .
Eighty - seven of the 141 MPs supported the bill , while only six were against .
Correspondents say homosexuality is frowned upon by many in Lithuania , where the majority of the 3.3 million population is Catholic .
The authorities have in the past prevented gay rights activists from holding public gatherings , or struggled to protect them from attack .
' Rotten culture '
Last month , MPs approved the " law on the protection of minors against the detrimental effect of public information " , but outgoing President Valdas Adamkus refused to sign it before he left office .
This law is a clear infringement of freedom of expression and non-discrimination rights and should be repealed immediately
Kim Manning - Cooper
Amnesty International
His successor , Dalia Grybauskaite , is not able to re-impose the veto on the legislation and is required to sign it within three days , after which it will take effect .
The head of the Lithuanian Gay League ( LGL ) , Vladimir Simonko , said parliament had " demonstrated its will to institutionalise homophobia " .
The human rights group , Amnesty International , meanwhile warned that the law could be used to prohibit any legitimate discussion of homosexuality , impede the work of human rights defenders and further the stigmatisation of and prejudice against lesbian , gay , bisexual and transgender people in Lithuania .
" This law is a clear infringement of freedom of expression and non-discrimination rights and should be repealed immediately , " said Amnesty International UK's LGBT Campaigner Kim Manning - Cooper .
The legislation also bans material that " encourages gambling , encourages and suggests participation in the games of chance and lotteries " , " promotes bad eating , sanitary and physical passivity habits " , or gives credence to paranormal phenomena and hypnosis .
The text does not define " public information " in detail , although it makes references to TV programmes , films , computer games and advertising as well as online and print media accessible by children .
Petras Grazulis , a right - wing MP who co-sponsored the bill and is also seeking an outright ban of homosexuality in Lithuania , insisted it was a necessary measure to defend traditional family values .
" We have finally taken a step which will help Lithuania raise healthy and mentally sound generations unaffected by the rotten culture that is now overwhelming them , " he said .

Hillary Clinton snapped at a Congolese student on Monday after he asked her what her husband thought about an international matter .
On her first visit to Africa , Clinton made a stop in The Democratic Republic of Congo to highlight sexual abuse and corruption in the country .
During a question and answer session at a university in Kinshasa on Monday , one student asked about former president Bill Clinton 's view on Chinese contracts in Africa .
Here 's Clinton 's response :
It later emerged that the student had wanted to know what President Obama thought about the issue , and that the translator had made a mistake .
Too late - Clinton had already moved on to the next question .
Only a week ago Bill Clinton stole his wife 's spotlight after negotiating the release of two US journalists on a secret mission to North Korea .
Although the secretary of state applauded the work , she did add that it had nothing to do with her own business .
A worthy reaction ?
Tell us what you think .
Here 's something that might have slipped passed while you were postponing the weekend by working so very late Friday night .
First , to state the obvious :
In the 50 states , everyone has two senators and one House member representing them in Washington .
Those members of Congress are presumably back home now getting an earful in public meetings from both sides about the hot summer 's hottest issue , the broad healthcare reform legislation favored by President Obama , who was going to bring folks together .
There was much talk from the same two sides all last week about packing of those local get - togethers that Investor 's Business Daily so deliciously calls " clown hall meetings . "
Supporters and opponents charged that the other side was busing in adherents and packing the sessions , and even being anti-American with their dissent .
The president , who held three healthcare talk - fests himself , also complained about the media focusing mainly on the disorderly sessions .
How strange !
That would be like the media focusing on one lousy plane crash instead of the thousands of safe flights each day .
Or residents gossiping about a neighborhood divorce , instead of the dozens of happy nearby marriages .
Anyway , here are some startling lesser - known facts , pulled together by two diligent Bloomberg News reporters , Lizzie O'Leary and Jonathan Salant :
Every one of those 534 members of Congress now has six ( 6 ! ) lobbyists working on them -- and that 's just for healthcare .
A total of 3,300 lobbyists have registered to drive the sizzling healthcare issue in Washington -- three times the brigade of lobbyists representing the entire defense industry .
And three more healthcare lobbyists join the ongoing fray every day .
They reported spending more than $ 234 million massaging and informing and persuading those legislators during the first six months of this year , way more than a million bucks a day , seven days a week .
So , whatever your side , who do you suppose will still be standing -- and talking -- when the congressional recess is over and the elected representatives return to their safe homes inside the Beltway ?

Police say a grower could be responsible for the theft of more than $ 10,000 worth of cucumbers in Adelaide 's north .
There have been 12 separate cucumber robberies during the past three months , the most recent involving 150 bags on Tuesday night .
Chief Inspector Kym Zander says detectives are working with the Adelaide Produce Market to try to solve the case .
" We 're looking at the possibility that it may be a grower that 's had a failed crop and he 's substituting through theft , or it may be you know somebody that knows cucumbers are being grown , they 're ready for picking , and they 're taking the cucumbers and then selling at those weekend markets across the metro area of Adelaide , " he said .
Inspector Zander says the thefts are challenging for investigators .
" It 's certainly a unique theft and the volume is something that we 're having difficulty establishing where they 're going , " he said .
" It 's obvious or evident that it is somebody in the know to establish which glasshouse is growing cucumbers , tomatoes , etcetera .
" We find that the cucumbers are being picked , they 're being either packed in bags or in buckets ready for the market the next morning and when the growers turn up with their vehicles the glasshouse is bare . "
While we were busy paying attention to Sony and Nintendo last Tuesday , Legacy Interactive quietly announced a video game that will kill your console nine times before finally saving its life .

Yes , House is getting his own game for the PC , Nintendo Wii , and DS , courtesy of the company that brought you Mean Girls and Pretty in Pink , and while fans of the award - winning medical drama may be groaning , Legacy Interactive president
Ariella Lehrer assures me that they 'll do the franchise proud .
In fact , with a long history of producing both detective adventures and games like Emergency Room : Code Red , you could say that House falls right in their sweet spot .

I sat down with Ariella for breakfast on the Friday following E3 , not quite knowing what to expect .
The announcement of House , as well as a PC game based on Murder She Wrote , managed to slip by last Tuesday , with Nintendo and Sony press conferences neatly smothering the news , so I had no idea the announcement had even been made .
As a pretty huge fan of House , I was at first surprised , but soon started asking obscure questions that Ariella was n't prepared to answer .
Which cast were they including ?
Would the dead guy be in the game ?
Will Wilson just pop up in the middle of each case to say " It is n't cancer " and then disappear ?
Will anyone have lupus ?
She could n't answer those , but she did have some information to share .
The game will consist of five cases for House and his team to solve , which will involve actual medical procedures , as well as questioning patients , breaking into their houses ... you know , all the fun differential diagnosis techniques that House has taught us .
Unfortunately they 'll be using sound - alikes for the actors , as Hugh Laurie alone would probably double the development budget for the game , but I am assured they will find the best sound - alikes available .
Ariella understands how important the tone is to the success of the show .

Plus , NBC / Universal is watching them like a hawk .
Every bit of art , every background , and every game asset has to be approved before it makes it into the game , and no one knows what video game players want like television executives , right ?
Okay , perhaps not , but at least everything will be authentic .
Legacy Interactive is taking the House game very seriously .
So seriously that they are holding off on the Wii version of the game until next year in order to make sure they put out the best possible product , despite the fact that there 's a built - in audience that would buy it even if it turns out to be terrible .
That sort of dedication is inspiring , and as a fan of the show I am overjoyed that Legacy is handling the game ... though it might just be an obscure island fugus affecting my emotions .

Look for House to hit PC and DS this holiday , with the Wii version tentatively scheduled for the next .

SACRAMENTO —
In a decision that could dramatically reshape California ’s criminal justice system , a panel of federal judges Tuesday ordered Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger and state legislators to find ways to cut the prison population by 40,000 , or about one - quarter of all inmates .
The ruling was a stark milestone in the years - long saga of two lawsuits charging that California allows inhumane conditions to fester in its prisons because of severe overcrowding .
Law - and - order advocates say such cuts would result in inmates being returned to the streets early or being turned over to cash - strapped counties to jail .
The Schwarzenegger administration signaled that it would likely appeal the case to the U.S. Supreme Court .
The three - judge panel gave the governor and lawmakers 45 days to present a plan to cut the inmate population from about 150,000 to 110,000 over two years .
The judges delivered a stern message about conditions that are so poor in some prisons that they violate inmates ’ constitutional rights .
“ The medical and mental health care available to inmates in the California prison system is woefully and constitutionally inadequate , and has been for more than a decade , ” the judges wrote in a 184 - page ruling .
“ Tragically , California ’s inmates have long been denied even ( a ) minimal level of medical and mental health care , with consequences that have been serious , and often fatal . …
A significant number of inmates have died as a result . ”
The judges described some prisons operating at nearly 300 percent of capacity , with inmates housed in triple bunk beds placed in gymnasiums and day rooms .
“ In these overcrowded conditions , inmate - on - inmate violence is almost impossible to prevent , infectious diseases spread more easily , and lockdowns are sometimes the only means by which to maintain control , ” the judges wrote .
In general , the 33 - prison system is at nearly double its capacity .
Even under the judicial order , the system would remain overcrowded , at 137.5 percent of capacity .
Matthew Cate , secretary of the Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation , acknowledged that the prisons are severely overcrowded and that conditions in many facilities have been substandard .
But the situation has improved dramatically in recent years , he argued , enough so that the federal courts should not be dictating how California runs its correctional system .
“ We ’ve made enough progress to turn this back over to the state , ” Cate said .
He said the administration has plans to alleviate overcrowding by building more prison facilities , arranging with other states to house more of California ’s inmates and changing sentences for some crimes .
Schwarzenegger also recently called for deporting illegal immigrants serving time in California prisons for nonviolent crimes .
The governor ’s proposal also would allow some low - level offenders to serve the last 12 months of their sentences on house arrest or , in the case of elderly , infirm inmates , in medical facilities .
Others convicted of nonviolent crimes would be given credit for time served .
But in the best case , the governor ’s plan would trim the prison population by about 27,000 , well short of the federal judges ’ demand .
And Republican legislators have vowed to resist cuts of even that amount .
The three - judge panel — Stephen Reinhardt , U.S. Circuit Judge for the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals ; Lawrence Karlton , U.S. District Judge for Eastern District Court of California ; and Thelton Henderson , U.S. District Judge for Northern District of California — did not directly mandate that California reduce its inmate population .
But it came close , ordering that Schwarzenegger and legislators deliver a plan to do so within 45 days .
If after that period the judges remain dissatisfied and order a cap on the prison population , the administration would appeal to the U.S. Supreme Court , Cate said .
“ To the extent it requires us to open the gates ( to state prisons ) , we ’re going to appeal , ” he said .
As it happens , state lawmakers are expected this month to debate how to trim the state corrections budget by $ 1.2 billion .
A cut of that size was mandated by the recently approved budget plan , but the proposal left for later details on how to realize the savings .
While the federal judges opined that the prison population could be pared without endangering public safety — through sentencing and parole reform , among other changes — critics were not convinced .
“ I just think these judges are totally out of touch and overstepping their bounds , ” said state Sen.
Bob Huff , R - Glendora .
“ Are they then going to be responsible for the increase in crime that will inevitably happen or the increased costs of apprehending and imprisoning criminals ? ”
State Senate Leader Darrell Steinberg , D - Sacramento , said in a statement that lawmakers would return from their summer recess later this month “ to produce reform that saves money , protects public safety , and takes back the control of our prison system . ”
Dissension in the Legislature has stifled prison reform in California for years .
Tuesday ’s ruling creates a major test for the state ’s political system and its ability to fix what even defenders of the prison system concede are serious shortcomings .
“ They ’re really under the gun now , ” said Don Specter , director of the Prison Law Office , which has long advocated for improved prison conditions .
Robert Weisberg , a law professor and director of the Stanford Criminal Justice Center , said the governor and legislators may have to confront California ’s high rate of recidivism , which leads all states .
Parolees , he said , are routinely sent back to prison for technical violations such as missing meetings with their parole officers .
That drives up the prison population and unnecessarily costs the state a lot of money , said Weisberg , who served on a panel that advised a federal judge who oversaw one of the cases that resulted in Tuesday ’s ruling .
“ This is kind of stern reminder , ” Weisberg said , “ that the problem has to be solved .
But it gives them a fair amount of time and flexibility to reduce the ( prison ) number without a threat to public safety . ”

Whistleblower 's Attack on the Fed
by George F. Smith
Exclusive to STR
August 30 , 2006
The July , 2006 issue of Whistleblower magazine , a monthly publication of WorldNetDaily.com , is devoted to educating its readers about ' America 's all - powerful banking cartel , the Federal Reserve . '
It relies heavily on articles by G. Edward Griffin and Rep. Ron Paul of Texas to tell us where the Fed came from , how it works , and what we ought to do about it .
Griffin 's essays are excerpted from his masterwork on the Fed , The Creature from Jekyll Island : A Second Look at the Federal Reserve , while Paul 's articles were previously published on LewRockwell.com .
Together their writing provides a devastating indictment of the Federal Reserve System .
In a lead editorial , editor / publisher Joseph Farah describes the Fed as 'a legalized counterfeiting operation -- pure and simple . '
He says further that ' rarely in the history of American journalism has this topic been so fully , factually and courageously explored ' as it has in this 47 - page issue of Whistleblower .
In a section called ' Voices from the past , ' which runs beneath the articles beginning on page 22 , readers are hit with pithy quotes on money and banking from familiar figures in history .
A personal favorite comes from Sir Josiah Stamp , a former central banker in England :
Bankers own the earth .
Take it away from them , but leave them the power to create money and control credit , and with a flick of a pen they will create enough to buy it back .
One of Ron Paul 's articles refers readers to Murray Rothbard 's book , What Has Government Done to Our Money ? , for an explanation of the origin of money as the market 's preferred commodity for exchanging up through its takeover and gradual destruction by bankers and politicians .
The July Whistleblower also includes a brief speech Paul delivered on the House floor in 2002 in which he introduced legislation to abolish the Fed .
He includes with his bill Lew Rockwell 's article on the benefits of a genuine gold standard called ' Why Gold ? '
Griffin on the Fed 's origin and methodology
In the first of his essays , Griffin explains why the world 's leading banking dynasties -- Morgan , Rockefeller , and Kuhn , Loeb -- wanted a central bank and how they had to promote it to win public support and get it through Congress .
Representatives from each banking group , along with two government sponsors , gathered in secret on Jekyll Island , Georgia in 1910 to devise a system that would address the following problems :
1 . How to thwart competition from small banks .
2 . How to create a more ' elastic currency .'
3 . How to coordinate the rate of inflation for each of its member banks .
4 . In the event the whole banking system fails , how to make the taxpayers pay for the losses .
5 . ' How to convince Congress that the scheme was a measure to protect the public . '
As Griffin writes :
To cover the fact that a central bank is merely a cartel which has been legalized , its proponents had to lay down a thick smoke screen of technical jargon focusing always on how it would supposedly benefit commerce , the public and the nation ; how it would lower interest rates , provide funding for needed industrial projects and prevent panics in the economy .
There was not the slightest glimmer that , underneath it all , was a master plan which was designed from top to bottom to serve private interests at the expense of the public .
This was , nevertheless , the cold reality , and the more perceptive bankers were well aware of it .
In his other article , Griffin describes in detail the Fed 's practice of converting debt into money , a process he calls the Mandrake Mechanism .
As with all his writing , it is presented with clarity and relevant references , making his call to abolish the Fed all the more compelling .
Overall , this special issue of Whistleblower -- thanks mostly to heavy hitters Griffin and Paul -- fights a good fight against one of the most nefarious scams ever created .
Nor is this WND 's first major assault on the Fed .
In March , 2001 , while Alan Greenspan was trying to inflate the economy out of its necessary period of readjustment following the boom of the '90s , WND published another issue on the Fed written by Anne Williamson in which she concluded ' that [ perhaps ] somewhere in America 's near future awaits a war that will be fought for no other purpose than to re-establish the financial elite 's profits and the political elite 's pride of place . '
Two years later Bush invaded Iraq to the hosannahs of WND , apparently forgetting the prophetic analysis of a veteran journalist .
Why Milton Friedman ?
The July Whistleblower also includes some remarks from Milton Friedman criticizing Federal Reserve policies of the early Thirties , seemingly as part of the argument for abolishing the Fed .
Whistleblower editor David Kupelian tells us that 1 ) according to the Noble - Prize winning Friedman , who Kupelian openly admires , the Fed caused the Great Depression , and 2 ) Fed chairman Ben Bernanke admitted the Fed 's culpability in a 2002 speech in honor of Friedman 's 90th birthday .
It sounds like an editorial fit until you examine the details .
Kupelian 's article includes an excerpt from a 2000 PBS interview with Friedman in which he makes a few comments on the relationship between the Fed and the Depression .
The Fed had been established to avoid ' what actually happened , ' according to Friedman , by which he means the Fed should 've prevented the recession following the Crash from turning ' into a major catastrophe . '
Yet from 1929 to 1933 , the Fed allowed the money supply to shrink by a third , he points out .
In Friedman 's view , this was the Fed 's great failing because it triggered bank failures that resulted in heavy losses for millions of people who trusted the banks to keep their money safe .
The Fed had the knowledge and the power to prevent such a calamity , but failed to do so .
Kupelian quotes Bernanke as telling Friedman , ' You 're right , we [ brought on the Depression ] .
We 're very sorry .
But thanks to you , we wo n't do it again . '
Let 's clarify Bernanke 's remark .
When he says ' thanks to you , we wo n't do it again , ' he means he 'll follow Friedman 's general advice and try to destroy the dollar at a low and steady rate ( which he calls ' inflation targeting ' ) , but if the dollar should threaten to recover in value , he 'll bring in the helicopters and dump money in the laps of preferred investors .
The dollar will thus continue on its course to oblivion , but most people wo n't notice because it could take years to accomplish , and very importantly , it might postpone an economic collapse .
If the Fed is eager to follow Friedman 's advice , and if Kupelian believes his advice is correct , why is this presented as consistent with the views of Paul and Griffin ?
Friedman is a friend of the Fed. Paul and Griffin want it abolished .
They will never be the guests of honor at a dinner in which a Fed bigwig apologizes for its very existence .
Furthermore , Friedman likes fiat money .
He rejects gold because people have to dig it out of South Africa only to bury it in Fort Knox -- a waste of real resources .
Both Paul and Griffin want a free market dollar , and when people were ' free to choose , ' they chose gold and silver .
Yes , they require ' real resources , ' but they 're worth the price .
As Rothbard notes , gold ' must be extracted from the ground , by the same costly process as governs the supply of any other commodities on the market .
Essentially the choice is : gold or government .'
Or as Walter Block eloquently states :
[ G] old is like an insurance policy .
Just as locks , fences and doors are used to preclude losses from theft -- even though they come only at the expense of real resources -- so , too , does the costly use of gold attain something desirable , namely , protection from statist monetary depredations .
Though marred by the inconsistent discussion of Friedman 's views , the July Whistleblower is a gold mine of information about the founding of the Fed and the intricacies of its counterfeiting process .
Even if you 've read Griffin 's book and Paul 's many articles on the Fed , I strongly recommend it .
