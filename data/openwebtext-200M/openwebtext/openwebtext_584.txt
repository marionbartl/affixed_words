Lloyds TSB is the fifth - largest banking group in the UK , but the bank 's recent actions prove it still cares about the little guy .
When it is n't partnering to sponsor the London Olympics in 2012 , or recognizing the contribution of Asians to British society via the Asian Jewel Awards , the banking giant enjoys rooting through customer records and changing passwords it finds offensive , then refusing to change them back .
Steve Jetley of Shrewsbury discovered this firsthand , after he changed his telephone banking password to " Lloyds is pants " ( " rubbish " to us American sods on the wrong side of the pond ) .
Upon calling in , Jetley discovered that his " pants " password did n't match what was in the system .
Instead , his password had been changed to " no it 's not . "
Initially , this was no big deal .
" I thought it was actually quite a funny response , " Jetley told the BBC .
" But what really incensed me was when I was told I could not change it back to ' Lloyds is pants ' because they said it was not appropriate .
I asked if it was ' pants ' they did n't like , and would ' Lloyds is rubbish ' do ?
But they did n't think so . "
" Barclays is better , " did n't meet with approval either , seeing as how Barclays is another , even larger UK bank and a Lloyds competitor .
At that point , Jetley was suddenly told that passwords had to be one word .
When he offered " censorship " up as an appropriate password , he discovered passwords were required to be just one word , and no more than six letters long ( not terribly secure , that ) .
This undoubtedly came as something of a surprise , since his previous password had been accepted by the system , but the staff manager in question was apparently adamant .
Lloyds has since apologized , and told Jetley that the staff member had been let go .
The bank also clarified its password policy , stating , " Customers can have any password they choose and it is not our policy to allow staff to change the password without the customer 's permission . "
Lloyds did note that it is " disappointing " that Jetley chose to express his dissatisfaction by changing his password , indicating , perhaps , that he should have expressed his satisfaction by finding a different bank .
There 's no word on whether or not Jetley got his " pants " back , but this is n't the first time Lloyds has come under public scrutiny for how it treats its customers .
Earlier this year , Lloyds customers mounted a campaign to have certain charges refunded after the bank refused to do so .
Oystar , a British group , released a parody of " I Fought the Law , " called " I Fought the Lloyds . "
The song detailed the customers ' struggles , and was popular enough to hit number 25 on the UK singles chart .
Given these sorts of cases , we 'd suggest Lloyds give Jetley back his coveted pants , and perhaps take a Carnegie course or two .
Do n't Remind Me
The DRM debate has been around for quite some time now , and as a marketable idea , its stock has gone down dramatically in recent years .
Bands , movie makers , and indie game developers are all experimenting with content distributed without DRM , and knowledgeable consumers are beginning to make a stand against the overly - restrictive nature of some copy protection solutions .
But the DRM issue has flared up again in the game community with the recent surge of discussion in the wake of EA 's Spore .
EA 's game has suffered major criticism for its restrictive DRM solution , which resulted in an exhaustive campaign of protest on Amazon and countless other online venues .
Players protested with their opinions and their wallets , and EA in turn responded with increased leniency for limited installs , a measure that some argue still is n't enough .
Not all game companies , however , are on the DRM bandwagon .
Consider CD Projekt and its new web venture , an online gaming portal called Good Old Games .
GOG focuses exclusively on selling old , classic games without any form of DRM at low prices , and the games offered are , for the most part , games which have been out of print or hard to find for quite a while and were procured and modified to run on new machines without any DRM or intrusive software .
We recently profiled the service , which is currently in beta but is fully functional and stocked with some great software .
GOG.com 's mandate reads like a checklist of PC gaming musts .
Adam Oldakowski , Managing Director of GOG.com , and Michal Kicinski , CEO of CD Projekt , were kind enough to talk to us following the launch of GOG and in the wake of the Spore controversy .
The two had some strong things to say about the way the industry is going and about how services like GOG should be the model to follow .
Convincing the Man to stay his hand
Ars Technica : Good Old Games really caught the attention of our readers after the service 's beta launched : it 's clear that PC gamers are interested in what GOG is offering .
What does GOG think gamers want ?
Adam Oldakowski :
We believe that the whole package that GOG.com has to offer is what gamers want ; ultimately it was gamers ' needs and desires that determined the direction of the site .
We have DRM - free classic PC games which are hard , or sometimes impossible , to find at retail or online .
We offer our gamers a lot more than just a cheap , easy - to - use and hassle - free digital distribution store ; there 's a huge community section with forums dedicated to every game from our catalog and a rating system that allows gamers to rate games , comments , and reviews .
Every player can write a review of their own favorite game and post it on the game 's page .
Plus , with every game we 're offering cool additional materials like game guides , hi-res wallpapers , artwork , avatars , soundtracks and more .
GOG.com is the ultimate place for every fan of all - time PC classics , which is what makes GOG.com so special .
Ars :
How has the service been received so far by publishers ?
AO : The reaction so far has been great … for the most part .
Publishers see GOG.com as an opportunity to revive some of their older but still well - known brands , although they have some concerns , especially concerning the lack of copy protection or DRM .
Thankfully , many are coming ' round to that concept .
Ars :
Who have you been talking with , aside from Codemasters and Interplay ?
AO : As much as I would love to give some hints , I do n't want to jinx anything .
We are very close to signing a couple of deals , but we can't disclose anything right now .
You can be sure we 'll announce new deals very soon .
Ars : Has convincing publishers to accept the DRM policy been tough ?
Michal Kicinski : Yep .
Actually that was one of the toughest issues we faced during the creation of GOG.com .
Just like most innovative projects , GOG.com needs to overcome some stereotypes and obstacles which exist in the gaming industry .
It 's very hard for us — entrepreneurs who work hard to make a profit — to understand the corporate approach .
We are able to show publishers that selling DRM - free old games will bring them additional revenue without extra costs , and the best part is that we can handle the organizational stuff .
In this situation it 's very hard for us to understand why we would receive a negative reply to our offer .
It 's just something that is outside of our business approach , and sometimes it can be very frustrating .
It appears that sometimes it 's not so easy to get through some mental obstacles and internal politics , and even if we 're talking business , it 's not always the business factors that are the most important .
But we 're very determined and stubborn in this matter .
It 's all or nothing for GOG.com ; if we manage to convince publishers to join our service , we 'll succeed .
If not , then we have to halt the project .
But there are companies and people who stay true to their roots , and their products will be available at GOG.com .
Now these companies are Interplay and Codemasters , but more are sure to join soon .
It would be fantastic if GOG.com would be the first thing to trigger the avalanche .
We do n't believe it would completely remove the usage of DRM schemes , but it could lead to restoring the appropriate relation between customers and publishers .
Today this relation is far away from the motto of " customer always knows best , " which might be old , but in my opinion , should still be the basis of the relationship between the seller and customer .

Mainstream economists and so - called experts have filled the minds of most Americans with many economic myths that are constantly reinforced by the media and repeated on the streets .
These myths are erroneous at best , sometimes based on half truths .
The majority of them are just false .
We read and hear them every day : " inflation " is caused by rising oil prices ; consumption is the most important element for economic growth ; low interest rates are helpful to the economy ; government expenditures help " stimulate " the economy ; there is an energy " crisis , " and many others .
We will examine the most common ones and proceed to explain the reality behind these myths .
Inflation and Energy Myths
Inflation — or , rather , the general rise in prices [ 1 ] — and the increase in energy prices are issues that have always created numerous economic myths .
The following are some of the most common ones .
Myth # 1 : " Dependence on Foreign Oil "
This myth basically suggests that the problem with oil prices is due to America 's " dependence " on foreign oil .
One of the worst economic myths , it plays on economic nationalism and on xenophobic feelings that are sometimes pervasive in the United States .
The high price of oil has nothing to do with its origin ; the price of oil is determined in international markets .
Even if the United States were to produce 100 % of the oil it consumes , the price would be the same if the worldwide supply and demand of oil were to remain the same .
Oil is a commodity , so the price of a barrel produced in the United States is basically the same as the price of a barrel of oil produced in any other country , but the costs of labor , land , and regulatory compliance are usually higher in the United States than in third - world countries .
Lowering these costs would help increase supply .
Increasing supply , whether in the United States or elsewhere , will push prices lower .
Importing a product does not mean you " depend " on it .
This is like saying that when we " import " food from our local supermarket we " depend " on that supermarket .
The opposite is usually true ; exporters depend on us , since we are the customers .
Also , importing a product usually means buying at lower prices , whereas producing in the United States often means consuming at higher prices .
This point is proven when we see the cheap imports we can purchase from China and the higher prices of many of these same products manufactured in the United States .
The amazing thing is that the protectionists claim , on the one hand , that America should be " protected " from cheap imports , but when it comes to oil , they say we should be " protected " from " expensive imported " oil .
Most , if not all , of the higher price of oil can be explained by the expansion of the money supply or the debasement of the dollar .
The foreign producers are not at fault ; our national central bank is the culprit .
Myth #
2 : " Inflation is caused by rising oil prices . "
False .
If the money supply were to remain constant , then an increase in the price of one good , such as oil , would cause a decrease in the price of other goods .
If more money is spent on oil , then less money will be available to spend on other goods .
This will in turn cause a drop in the demand for other goods , which will subsequently cause a drop in the prices of these goods .
The reality is that inflation is always a monetary matter , caused by the increase in the money supply due to the interest - rate - easing policies of central banks .
Myth #
3 : " Current inflation is being caused by the increased demand of millions of new consumers in China and India . "
At first this myth might seem true .
Millions of new Asian consumers have entered the market , thus , there is higher demand for most goods , which would apparently cause higher prices .
What is being overlooked is that these new consumers are also new producers .
In general , most people produce far more than they consume , because most workers have to produce more than what they earn in wages ( if not , they lose their jobs ) .
While it is true that demand has risen due to these new consumers , supply has increased even more , due to their increased production .
This can clearly be seen by the frequent drop in prices of most goods being manufactured in China .
On the other hand , the only way these new workers can increase their consumption beyond what they produce is through credit .
Thus we return to the real culprit behind inflation : credit expansion due to central banks ' intervention in the financial markets .
Consumption Myths
These myths were injected into the mainstream mainly by Keynesian economists or demand - siders who were trying to influence public policy .
Myth # 4 : " Consumption is the most important element of the economy . "
Consumption is indeed important in a free economy : particularly the freedom of consumers to buy their goods in unhampered markets .
However , key to long - term economic growth is investment ( savings ) , which is the opposite of consumption .
Public policies that promote consumption — such as low interest rates — do so at the expense of savings .
Less savings means less investments ; an economy that does not save or invest will consume all of its resources and eventually end up bankrupt .
Myth #
5 : " Excess consumption is a feature of the free - market capitalist system . "
False .
Excess consumption is mostly caused by central bank 's artificially low interest rates , which promote lower savings and higher consumption than would naturally occur .
Currently , the real interest rates of savings accounts are negative .
Thus it makes no economic sense to save .
Since these same policies cause price increases , it makes sense to consume as much as you can immediately , before prices rise .
Therefore we see that excess consumption is being caused by government policies and not by the capitalist free - market system .
Myth # 6 : " Federal Reserve interest - rate policy can help the economy . "
It is baffling how most Americans — including many of those who fought so hard against central planning in the 20th century — believe that the financial markets and the economy benefit from the central manipulation and influence conducted by the Federal Reserve .
To maintain a target of low interest rates , the Fed must add liquidity to the money supply by creating money without obtaining additional reserves .
This is the infamous creation of money " out of thin air , " which so many have criticized .
Many believe that this artificial injection of liquidity creates economic stimuli and promotes growth .
However , even though it creates an apparent bonanza , these monetary injections must eventually be " paid back . "
This payback happens by means of higher prices , the so - called inflation .
Low interest rates also create a huge dislocation between the market 's natural interest rate and the interest rate that the Fed sets .
Supply and demand of money — mainly supply of savings and other deposits and demand for credit — is what should set interest rates in a normal unhampered market .
Risk , too , should play a role in setting market interest rates .
When the Fed artificially lowers interest rates , it does so below the market rate , which would be established at the intersection of the aggregate supply and aggregate demand of money .
A rate below the market rate creates a higher demand for credit ; thus people and companies get into debt beyond normal levels .
On the other hand , low savings - account rates push people to withdraw money , lowering the market supply of funds .
These dislocations are at the root of the eventual credit crisis , which follows the boom period that was caused by artificially low interest rates .
With today 's risky financial crisis , most people would demand a premium to deposit their money in a bank .
Further , the current liquidity crunch should mean a lower market supply of money .
Both forces should be pushing interest rates up .
If the market were unimpeded ( that is , if there were no intervention from the Fed ) , interest rates would be higher , not lower .
These and many other absurd economic myths have plagued the minds of mainstream Americans .
Despite a supposed return of pro-free - market forces to both of the main political parties in the 1980s and '90s , new interventionist myths seem to surface almost every day .
Free - market advocates and economists must continue to struggle against these harmful economic myths .

From a fascinating book called “ Guyland – The Perilous World Where Guy Become Men ” by Michael Kimmel comes a quick run down of the most popular responses to the author ’s question of “ What makes a man a man ” :
Boys do n’t cry
It ’s better to be mad than sad
Do n’t get mad get even
Take it like a man
He who has the most toys when he dies , wins !
Just do it
Size matters
I do n’t stop to ask for directions
Nice guys finish last
It ’s all good
Ugh .
How fittingly this sums up most of the cognitive dissonance that has plagued me and the throngs of men that inhabit this day and age .
Is this what makes a man ?
Is this the criteria that we want our young men , our little boys to use to determine what makes them a man ?
In this day and age with normal societal markers that adolescents and adults use to determine adulthood mostly coming later and later , we are leaving our children , our boys to fend for themselves when it comes to emotional maturity .
Working parents , latch - key kids , delayed marriage and delayed child - rearing , longer lifespans , and communities that offer zero support - is it any wonder that our boys , our adolescents are lost when it comes to approaching adulthood ?
And then we have this code , handed down by other boys in a ritual of creating adult boys that have no real idea what it is to truly be a man .
Adult children in a man ’s body – Guyland is a place where the truth of a man is lost in the rush for identity .
The power of yield ( return )
Yield is one of the coolest , yet underused , new .NET 2.0 features that you may not be familiar with .
Yes , I 'm talking about a 2.0 feature - even though 3.5 just came out , it is my experience that a large number of developers have still not embraced all that 2.0 gave us .
Hopefully this article will help make this powerful , yet initially confusing , feature more approachable .
Some background facts
When you " foreach " over an object ( array , collection , etc ) , it must implement IEnumerable or IEnumerable < T> - the generic version which returns strongly typed objects ( for the rest of this article , I 'll just refer to IEnumerable ) .
All arrays , and most collections ( ArrayList , List < T > ) implement IEnumerable , which is why you can " foreach " over them .
If ALL you need to do to a collection is cycle through its members - you only need to reference it as an IEnumerable .
That explains why the following code is perfectly valid :
IEnumerable < int > numbers = new int [ ]
{ 1 , 2 , 3 } ; foreach ( int i in numbers ) { Console .
WriteLine( i ) ; }
It is always better to depend on abstract types ( interfaces , abstract base classes ) rather than concrete types .
This allows you to change the implementation of a method without impacting any of its callers .
Consider this example where CallingMethod gets a set of numbers from MethodBeingCalled .
It really does n't care if it gets an array or a List or whatever .
It just does a foreach over it , which means it only needs the functionality exposed by the IEnumerable interface .
public void CallingMethod ( ) { List < int > numbers = MethodBeingCalled ( ) ; foreach ( int i in numbers ) { Console .
WriteLine( i ) ; } } private List < int > MethodBeingCalled ( ) {
List < int > numbers = new List < int > ( ) ; numbers .
AddRange ( new int [ ] { 1 , 2 , 3 } ) ; return numbers ; }
The problem with the current design is that the CallingMethod declares the list of numbers List < int > .
That is a specific implementation detail .
If Calling Method needed to add more numbers to the list after it was returned from MethodBeingCalled , or if individual numbers were being accessed by their index , then it would make sense to declare it as a List < T > ( or better , IList < T > ) .
But it really only needs to cycle through the numbers in order .
If MethodBeingCalled wanted to change its implementation to return an int [ ] instead , it would have to change its signature , and Calling Method would also have to change .
However , if CallingMethod had just declared its local variable as IEnumerable < int > ( because that is the only functionality it truly depends on ) , then it would not have to change if MethodBeingCalled changes - as long as it still returns something that implements IEnumerable < int > .
So what does foreach do ?
It asks the IEnumerable if it has any items .
If so , it gets the next item and uses it within the loop .
It then asks the IEnumerable again if it has more items , gets the next one , and so on , until there are no more items .
The important thing to note here is that foreach never works with the entire collection all it once - it only deals with one item at a time .
Introducing yield
How can we use all of this information ?
If you have a method that returns a collection of data , and you can be sure that callers are only going to be interested in looping over each item in the collection , one at a time ( which is very common ) , you can declare your method 's return value as IEnumerable < T > .
When you declare your method 's return value as IEnumerable < T > , something magic happens : the C# compiler will now let you use the yield keyword within the body !
So why does that matter ?
Because it allows you to take advantage of the way that foreach really works .
Remember , foreach will just ask for one value at a time .
When it does , it will call into your method - your method will run until it encounters a yield return statement .
When it reaches a yield return statement , that value is immediately returned to the caller .
In the next iteration of the caller 's loop , it will ask again if there is another value , your method will start executing again , but this time it will start on the line after the last yield statement that was run .
Yes , you read that right : execution alternates between the calling method and the method being called , all the way through the loop .
This is completely different from the normal way that methods interact , where one method gives up control to another method , which does n't return until it is completely finished executing .
This has at least 2 very important implications for the method that returns the IEnumerable <T > :
1 ) It does not need to build up a big list of all of the items it plans to return , holding them all in memory at the same time .
If the list of items is very large , holding them all in memory at once can be a significant burden .
2 ) It does not necessarily need to do the work to produce all of the items in the list .
If the caller breaks out of the foreach loop before the entire collection has been traversed - all of the work needed to produce the remaining items in the colleciton is avoided .
Without using the yield keyword , you would have to build up the entire collection to return , even if the caller was only going to look at the first few items .
Demonstration
To illustrate the advantage of this approach , I included sample code at the bottom .
You can create a new Console Application and paste this over the default Program.cs .
A method , GetCombinations returns a collection of 2 numbers combined .
The caller then loops through the collection , looking for a specific combination : " 13 " .
First , run it using GetCombinations .
This is implemented the way most people would write a method that returns a collection , in .NET 1.1 .
The output willl look something like this ( the indented output is from within GetCombinations ) :
BEFORE call to GetCombinations
Beginning execution of GetCombinations
Producing 33
Producing 23
Producing 13
Producing 32
Producing 22
Producing 12
Producing 31
Producing 21
Producing 11
Ending execution of GetCombinations
AFTER call to GetCombinations
Checking 33
Checking 23
Checking 13
Found !
Elapsed : 00:00:08.9931583
Now , comment out the line that calls GetCombinations , and uncomment the line that calls BetterGetCombinations .
It is important to note that BetterGetCombinations uses the exact same algorithm as GetCombinations - given the same input , they will both return the exact same list of strings , in the same order ( I 've emphasized the lines that changed , in the sample code below ) .
But since the caller is only looking for a specific combination , not all combinations need to be produced .
Consider the output :
BEFORE call to GetCombinations
AFTER call to GetCombinations
Beginning execution of BetterGetCombinations <-- notice that BetterGetCombinations does n't really start until the foreach loop - NOT when the method was first called !
Producing 33
Checking 33
Producing 23
Checking 23
Producing 13

With the improved implementation that took advantage of the yield keyword , the program was able to finish its job in less than half the time !
It also used much less memory , as it never had to store all 9 strings in a collection .
Now imagine the potential impact if GetCombinations returned a collection with thousands of entries !
Sample Code
Paste the code below over the default Program.cs in a new Console Application :
Sure , we 've seen some blurry videos and a few stolen glimpses when Andy Rubin demonstrated this beast , but now we 've gotten our hands on a slew of pictures showing off a very real T - Mobile - branded Dream in all its Android - running glory .
Not only does this confirm the design spied in those FCC docs as well as show off that nearly - done version of Android , but it seems to confirm the fact that this will be headed to T - Mobile , and sooner rather than later judging from the looks of the above device .
Needless to say , our inner - geeks are completely geeking out right now .

Ever get the feeling right after a speech , presentation or debate that you did n’t include everything you wanted to ?
After a few hundred public debates on behalf of NORML since 1991 in support of alternatives to cannabis prohibition , that feeling apparently never subsides … and it did n’t after a debate last week at Dickinson College in Carlisle , Pennsylvania with Cumberland County District Attorney David Freed .
Somewhere in the course of the formal questions , answers and rebuttals ( and of course , rebuttals of rebuttals ! ) , Mr. Freed drew upon the standard , oft - trotted , ONDCP - fed course of reasoning that 1 ) medical cannabis use is not accepted by health trade lobby associations like the American Medical Association , American Cancer Society and MS Society of the US ( Ironically , the British MS Society supports patient access to medicinal cannabis products ) , and 2 ) there are few credible studies that look at cannabis , therefore this is proof - positive that cannabis is not a valuable , non-toxic and remarkably safe therapeutic to use under a physician ’s care .
In my brief rebuttal I made two points , 1 ) there are hundreds of health and medical associations that support patient access to cannabis ( and that , ironically the AMA was the one organization in the 1930s that actually stood up against the federal government ’s efforts to create cannabis prohibition because of the plant ’s clear therapeutic qualities ) , and 2 ) that cannabis ( and cannabinoids ) has been studied to the extreme , with over 14,000 studies on record .
In retrospect , however , I was wrong .
There are not 14,000 cannabinoid - related studies on record .
Currently , there are over 17,000 according to a newly released scientific paper I failed to read before the debate !
Doh !
Note to self : Update your debate rhetoric and media talking points !
However , it is not like this one point changed the outcome of what was a well - attended , civil and informative debate .
Over the years I ’ve come to learn that when it comes to debating the issue of ‘ legalizing ’ cannabis on a college or university campus , proponents of Prohibition and the status quo lost the debate long before they ’ve hit the stage .
Frankly , I think a scarecrow mounted at a podium representing reformers would win the debate anyways as college students are the most anti-prohibitionistic and pro-cannabis law reform segment of the population in America ( and Canada , Europe , Australia , etc… ) .
NORML and I thank the students and faculty of Dickinson College for hosting a debate on the future of cannabis prohibition , and for District Attorney David Freed for his willingness to publicly discuss and debate the topic of cannabis law reform .

rdiff - backup is reverse differential backup
Rdiff - backup backs up one directory to another , possibly over a network .
The target directory ends up a copy of the source directory , but extra reverse diffs are stored in a special subdirectory of that target directory , so you can still recover files lost some time ago .
The idea is to combine the best features of a mirror and an incremental backup .
Rdiff - backup also preserves subdirectories , hard links , dev files , permissions , uid / gid ownership ( if it is running as root ) , modification times , acls , eas , resource forks , etc .
Finally , rdiff - backup can operate in a bandwidth efficient manner over a pipe , like rsync .
Thus you can use rdiff - backup and ssh to securely back a hard drive up to a remote location , and only the differences will be transmitted .
Usage
The documentation contains use cases and explanations about how to use rdiff - backup .
Support or Contact
Please use the GitHub issue tracker .
The mailing list will also remain active for the time being .
History
Rdiff - backup has been around for almost 20 years now and has proved to be a very solid solution for backups and it is still unique in its model of unlimited incrementals with no need to space consuming regular full backups .
Current lead developers are Eric Lavarde , Patric Dufresene and Otto Kekäläinen .
Full list of core developers available at rdiff - backup Github page and on the credits page .
The original author and maintainer was Ben Escoto from 2001 to 2005 .
Key contributors from 2005 to 2016 were Dean Gaudet , Andrew Ferguson and Edward Ned Harvey .
After some hibernation time Sol1 took over the stewardship of rdiff - backup from February 2016 but there were no new releases .
In August 2019 Eric Lavarde with the support of Otto Kekäläinen from Seravo and Patrik Dufresne from Minarca took over , completed the Python 3 rewrite and finally released rdiff - backup 2.0 in March 2020 .

Via Jake Tapper , breaking the hearts of his old friends at Salon :
“ In January , I outlined a plan to help revive our faltering economy , ” Obama said , “ which formed the basis for a bipartisan stimulus package that passed the Congress . ”
Is that true ?
Democrats on Capitol Hill who support Obama say no .
Wanting Obama to win , however , none will say so on the record .
But media accounts from the time make it clear that even though Obama , Sen. Hillary Clinton , D - NY , and Sen. John McCain , R - Ariz. , all offered legislation to provide stimulus to the economy , congressional leaders looped them and their legislation out of negotiations …
[ T ] hough the bill that eventually passed more closely resembled Obama ’s than either Clinton ’s or McCain ’s , those involved in the drafting of the legislation say it was more a matter of agreeing on a good idea [ to issue rebate checks ] and was not a matter of , as Obama claimed , his proposal having “ formed the basis for a bipartisan stimulus package that passed the Congress . ”
He did n’t even show up to vote for it .
Not the first time he ’s exaggerated his responsibilities in Congress either , as Ace reminds us , and of course he ’s not a stickler about carrying out the responsibilities he actually does have .
He sure can give a speech , though , ca n ’t he ?

I was just reinforcing the fact that there , where I was , there 's good patriotic people there in these rallies , so excited about positive change and reform of government that 's coming that they are so appreciative of hearing our message , hearing our plan .
Not any one area of America is more pro-America patriotically than others , " she said .
At a rally in Mesilla , New Mexico , on Friday , Biden responded to those comments in a vociferous tone .
" I hope it was just a slip on her part and she does n't really mean it .
But she said , it was reported she said , that she likes to visit , ' pro -American ' parts of the country , " he said to loud boos .
" It does n't matter where you live , we all love this country , and I hope it gets through .
We all love this country , " he said .
" We are one nation , under God , indivisible .
We are all patriotic .
We all love our country in every part of this nation !
And I 'm tired .
I am tired , tired , tired , tired of the implications about patriotism . "
Meanwhile , the presidential campaigns were on the offensive Friday , with Sen. Barack Obama criticizing Sen. John McCain 's health care plan and Palin scrutinizing Obama 's ties to a community activist group .
The candidates and their running mates were spread out across the country , with Palin traveling to Ohio and Indiana ; McCain in Florida ; and Biden in New Mexico and Nevada .
Obama was in Virginia , a traditional Republican state that has not backed a Democrat for president since Lyndon Johnson in 1964 .
But according to a CNN / TIME / Opinion Research Corp. poll conducted October 11 - 14 , Obama has opened up a 10 - point lead over McCain , 53 percent to 43 percent .
At a campaign rally in Roanoke , Obama compared McCain 's health care proposals to drug advertising .

" It 's like those ads for prescription drugs .
They start out and everybody 's running in the fields and everybody 's happy , then there 's a little fine print that says , you know , the side effects they may include , " Obama said to laughter from the crowd .
He also highlighted McCain 's plan to tackle the Medicare system , which provides health benefits for senior citizens and others .
" It turns out , Sen. McCain would pay for part of his plan by making drastic cuts in Medicare -- $ 882 billion worth ... to pay for an ill - conceived , badly thought - through health care plan that wo n't provide more health care to people -- even though Medicare is already facing a looming shortfall , " he said .
Shortly after Obama 's speech , McCain spokesman Tucker Bounds said in a statement that unlike Obama 's " risky plan , " McCain 's plans " do not punish struggling businesses with fines and taxes , and they certainly do not cut a single benefit for Medicare or Medicaid -- Obama is simply lying . "
According to McCain's Web site , the Arizona senator wants to " reform the payment systems in Medicaid and Medicare to compensate providers for diagnosis , prevention and care coordination .
Medicaid and Medicare should not pay for preventable medical errors or mismanagement . "
McCain also returned to the campaign trail Friday , traveling to Florida -- a state the Republicans won in the last two presidential elections .
A CNN Poll of Polls calculated Friday shows Obama leading McCain by six points , 49 percent to 43 percent .

A fired - up McCain told a crowd in Miami that while Americans are facing hard times and the nation 's financial system is in crisis , " the next president wo n't have time to get used to the office . "
" He wo n't have the luxury of studying up on the issues before he acts .
He will have to act immediately .
And to do that , he will need experience , courage , judgment and a bold plan of action to take this country in a new direction , " McCain said , referring to Obama .

Over the weekend , McCain will head to North Carolina , another state that Republicans have counted on in recent elections but is now considered a tossup .

Meanwhile , Palin , McCain 's running mate , lashed out Friday at Obama 's connection to the ACORN community activist group , which is under fire for alleged voter registration fraud .
The group -- the Association of Community Organizations for Reform Now -- faces allegations of filing fraudulent voter registrations in Nevada and faces investigations in other states .
Palin , campaigning in the battleground state of Ohio , told a crowd in West Chester that Obama " wo n't tell you the full truth ... on his connections to ACORN ... under investigation for rampant voter fraud . "
The FBI confirmed Tuesday that it is investigating ACORN 's registration efforts .
Palin accused the group of " rampant voter fraud , " although technically it is being accused of voter registration fraud .
" In this election , especially here in Ohio , you 're going to be asked to choose between a candidate who will not disavow a group committing voter fraud and a leader who will not tolerate it , " Palin said .
Brian Mellor , an ACORN attorney in Boston , Massachusetts , said the group has its own quality control process and has fired workers in the past -- including workers in Gary , Indiana .
But he said allegations that his organization committed fraud is a government attempt to keep people disenfranchised .
" We believe their purpose is to attack ACORN and suppress votes , " he said .
Palin said her campaign is calling on Obama , the Democratic presidential nominee , to release communications his campaign had with the group .

" [ We ] do n't want to turn the Buckeye State into the ACORN state , " she said to loud cheers .
Obama campaign spokesman Tommy Vietor responded in a statement Friday , saying : " We have not worked with ACORN at all in the general election .
Rather than make these false , desperate attacks , the McCain - Palin campaign should release an economic plan that actually helps the middle class instead of giving billions in tax cuts to big corporations . "
CNN 's Ed Hornick , Drew Griffin and Kathleen Johnston contributed to this report .

Some bottled water toxicity shown to exceed law Some tests show that toxic content exceeds state law
Sam 's Choice water .

Bottled water brands do not always maintain the consistency of quality touted in ads featuring alpine peaks and crystalline lakes and , in some cases , contain toxic byproducts that exceed state safety standards , tests show .
The Environmental Working Group , a nonprofit organization with offices in Oakland , tested 10 brands of bottled water and found that Wal - Mart 's Sam's Choice contained chemical levels that exceeded legal limits in California and the voluntary standards adopted by the industry .
The tests discovered an average of eight contaminants in each brand .
Four brands besides Wal - Mart 's also were contaminated with bacteria .
The environmental group filed a notice of intent to sue Wal - Mart Tuesday , alleging that the mega- chain failed to warn the public of illegal concentrations of trihalomethanes , which are cancer - causing chemicals .
" The investigation has uncovered that consumers cannot be assured of the quality of their bottled water , " said Olga Naidenko , a toxicologist at the Environmental Working Group and lead author of the bottled - water study .
" Our study was a snapshot of the marketplace .
We found some brands that provided good quality and other brands that contained various chemical pollutants .
What this shows is that consumers cannot have confidence .
They do n't know what they 're getting , " she said .
The group also singled out Giant Supermarket 's brand Acadia for excessive levels of disinfection byproducts , but it did n't sue because the Mid-Atlantic chain 's water is n't sold in California .
Some of the Sam's Choice bottled water purchased from Wal - Marts in Mountain View and Oakland came from Las Vegas Valley Water District 's sometimes - chlorinated public water supply , the group found .
Wal - Mart responds
Shannon Frederick , senior communications manager at Wal - Mart 's corporate headquarters in Bentonville , Ark. , said the corporation stands by its product .
Wal - Mart owns 4,200 stores in the United States .
" Both our suppliers ' tests and tests from an additional external laboratory are not showing any reportable amounts of chlorine or chlorine byproducts .
We 're disappointed that the EWG has not shared more details with us as we continue to investigate this matter , " Frederick said .
" We 're puzzled by the EWG 's findings . "
The Las Vegas water supply meets federal standards for toxic chemicals that form when disinfectants such as chlorine react with organic matter , sometimes in reservoirs .
The federal standard is 80 parts per billion .
But in California , the byproducts standard in bottled water is eight times as strict , possibly making Wal - Mart liable for action under Proposition 65 , the Safe Drinking Water and Toxic Enforcement Act of 1986 .
In 1995 , after animal tests showed that the byproducts could cause cancer and reproductive damage in lab animals , California added the bottled water provisions to the health and safety code , setting a standard at 10 parts per billion .
The Food and Drug Administration requires bottled water to meet the same standards as tap water from public systems - which is 80 ppb .
The FDA does n't require bottled water companies to inform consumers of the source and presence of contaminants .
Yet by law , public water companies must send customers annual information about sources and the presence of contaminants such as trihalomethanes , arsenic , nitrates and fluoride in the water supply .
Study findings
In the Environmental Working Group study , the University of Iowa Hygienic Laboratory screened for 170 possible contaminants .
The lab found 38 pollutants in 24 samples from 10 major brands purchased by the group in California , Washington , D.C. , and eight other states .
The environmental group wo n't release the names of eight other brands it tested , saying it would do so only after it conducts more - extensive testing .
Scott Huntley , a spokesman for the Las Vegas Valley Water District , said he had no knowledge that Wal - Mart was using Las Vegas 's water supply for bottling .
After some checking , he said a local water - bottling company that sells to the Strip could be supplying Wal - Mart as well .
Some findings from the study :
-- Three samples of Sam's Choice bought in Oakland , Mountain View and Fayetteville , N.C. , contained levels of total trihalomethanes between 14 ppb and 37 ppb , exceeding the state and industry standard of 10 ppb .
--
One of the byproducts , bromodichloromethane , also a carcinogen , is even more toxic to lab animals and is more strictly controlled .
The state 's cancer safety standard is 2.5 ppb .
Three bottles of Sam's Choice purchased in Mountain View and Oakland contained the contaminant at levels from 7.7 ppb and 13 ppb .
-- Also present in bottled water were caffeine and the pharmaceutical Tylenol , as well as arsenic , radioactive isotopes , nitrates and ammonia from fertilizer residue .
Industrial chemicals used as solvents , degreasing agents and propellants were also found in the tests .
-- Trace amounts of synthetic chemicals or degradation products from the manufacture of PET , or polyethylene terephthalate , plastic bottles were found , including acetaldehyde , isobutane and toluene .
At those low levels , scientists can't ascertain the health effects .
Bottled vs. tap
Americans drank more than 9 billion gallons in 2007 , and fewer than half of 228 brands of bottled water reveal their source .
Typical cost is $ 3.79 per gallon , 1,900 times the cost of public tap water .
Green campaigns have focused on steering away from bottled water because manufacturing , transporting and sending unrecycled bottles to the landfill use natural resources and create an environmental burden .
San Francisco Mayor Gavin Newsom issued an executive order in June 2007 barring use of city funds to purchase bottled water .
" The primary reason is that it can cost a thousand times more , and you 're not even getting better quality water , " said Tony Winnicker , spokesman for the city Public Utilities Commission .
" There have been hundreds of millions of dollars spent to market the myth that bottled water is purer and safer than the tap water .
The study is further evidence that the myth is often a lie . "
Ask an average Australian about censorship and chances are they 'll tell you it 's a bad thing .
And yet when it comes to video games , we have one of the toughest regimes in the world in terms of dictating exactly what is available to our adult population .
On one hand Australia is an oasis of game development , with a thriving , highly skilled industry generating hundreds of millions of dollars of valuable export revenue .
On the other hand Australia 's lack of an R18 + classification means that some of the world 's most important video games are effectively banned from appearing down under at all .
This unfortunate paradox is centred on the horrifically outdated view that games are just for kids .
The reality is that video games are an evolving entertainment medium of truly bewildering variety , that covers at least as many ages and tastes as traditional entertainment like movies , books and television .
It is a great shame that some among our lawmakers have such a narrow view of the work carried out by the 2000 people employed in and around the video game industry in Australia .
The most recent game to be refused classification in Australia illustrates just how absurd the situation has become .
Fallout 3 is a highly anticipated instalment in a series that began 10 years ago .
Many adult gamers were eagerly awaiting the title 's release , only to be thwarted by our archaic classification system .
The farcical discussion of this issue on ABC television 's recent Q&A program shows how little effort some policy makers have made to understand the current system , let alone get across the arguments for reform .
Let 's take a look at the Fallout example specifically .
Anyone who has played a video game will probably understand the concept of picking up a ' health pack ' thereby enabling you to carry on in the game .
In Fallout 3 , set as it is in a post - apocalyptic world , this act takes the form of an injection .
This depiction is in keeping with the artistic setting and expectations of the adult audience .
As a game developer I respect the view that the injections in Fallout 3 might constitute an ' adult concept ' .
What I cannot respect is the implied assertion that I should be not be able to make or play games that incorporate such concepts .
This is a massive violation of my creative and artistic rights , and of my basic rights and freedoms as an adult living in a country like Australia .
If the publishers of Fallout 3 want to release their game in Australia , it will need to be reworked just for the Australian market .
Because of the small size of our market , this is usually not worth the expense .
So not only are Australian gamers being deprived of several titles per year , they are literally being pushed towards piracy , which hurts every part of our industry .
The goals of the Australian National Classification Code bear repeating for these purposes :
Classification decisions are to give effect , as far as possible , to the following principles ;
( a) Adults should be able to read , hear and see what they want ;
( b) Minors should be protected from material likely to harm or disturb them ;
( c) Everyone should be protected from exposure to unsolicited material that they find offensive ...
Dissenting South Australian Attorney - General Michael Atkinson interprets the above code such that ( b ) overrules ( a ) .
This is how he put it in a recent letter to a constituent reprinted on the Australian Gamer website :
" To my mind , increasing the volume of inappropriate material available ( which includes even more extreme content ) will just mean even more unsuitable material is on sale . "
In other words , adding an R18 + certification will put more games unsuitable for minors on the shelves and that 's simply more important than your rights as an adult .
That 's quite a leap in logic , and a frankly outrageous position to take in my view .
Can you imagine the same the same justification being used for any medium other than video games ?
Part of the problem is that Michael Atkinson believes , against the government 's own evidence , that games are unusually harmful to children , as compared with films , television , and books .
What 's more , he seems not to believe that there exists the facility to stop children from playing adult games .
All this despite the fact that we already have a statutory age restriction for retail ( MA15 + ) , and that games consoles have easy to use and effective parental lockout systems .
Australia 's absence of an R18 + category , and the financial imperative of getting a game onto store shelves in a timely manner , means that many games intended for adult audiences ( and rated 18 + in other countries ) are inappropriately shoehorned into the existing MA15 + category in Australia .
Far from protecting minors from adult content , our uniquely incomplete classification system has allowed them , in many cases , to legally purchase and access such content .
A consistent classification system would better serve to protect the rights of children , as well as ensuring those of adults are not infringed .
As game developers , we are trying to make games that provide entertainment to players of all ages .
Video games are not going to turn your children into criminals .
They are , in fact , the modern face of the entertainment industry , and something that we in Australia are very good at producing .
The focus of this debate should be upon how the Australian classification system can best give adults the information they need to chose video game content for themselves and their children , without burdening our country with unjustified and draconian censorship to the amusement and pity of the rest of the world .
We can start with the immediate implementation of an R18 + games rating .

Ecology as crucial as imperialism
For socialists in the 20th century imperialism was the great dividing line between those who accepted the logic of capitalist society and those who were willing to challenge it .
In the first decades of the 21st century it is apparent that imperialism and war will remain inherent features of late capitalism .
To these threats we must add the genuine and serious risks of severe ecological degradation and climate change caused by the capitalist economic model as factors that will shape socialist politics in the coming decades .
The biosphere and us
Humanity exists in an enclosed finite biosphere from which we draw everything we need to stay alive .
We can define the biosphere as our planet ’s ecological system which includes not just us but all other living organisms and their interaction with the lithosphere , the hydrosphere and the atmosphere .
Underpinning the Marxist view of the world is the idea that human beings take from nature – or the biosphere -- the things that we transform through labour power to give us what we need and want .
By doing so we are also creating our own relationship with nature .
If you drive anywhere in Britain you will see that the landscape has been modified beyond all recognition from its original forest covering by agriculture and urbanisation .
A more extreme example is the Mediterranean basin .
The agriculture of the area transformed it from fertile farmland in the Classical period into a region which is now arid and deforested .
How does capitalism destroy the environment ?
Capitalism ’s dominant goal is the maximisation of profit .
Capitalists must exploit people and the environment to this end .
This form of economic growth requires vast amounts of energy and raw materials every day and these have to be extracted from the biosphere .
The ecological costs do not figure on the balance sheet even though 50 - 75 % of all physical inputs into manufacturing end up as waste within one year .
But while capital seeks infinite expansion this is self - evidently a contradiction within an environment that is finite .
The scale of this transformation of raw materials and energy is now rivalling natural processes .
Our species is adding carbon to the atmosphere at a rate equivalent to at least 7 % of the natural exchange between the atmosphere and the ocean .
This is a process that can only increase under capitalism and it is simply beyond debate that carbon dioxide and methane trap heat and so cause the planet to warm .
Global industrial production increased at an average rate of 3 % annually between 1970 and 1990 .
At this rate world industry doubles in size every 25 years , by a factor of 16 in a century and 250 fold in two centuries .
All the materials and energy for this expansion come from the biosphere .
For capitalism this is necessary if more commodities are to be produced and more profits made .
Yet it is clear that the planet cannot submit to many more doublings of productivity and increases in greenhouse gas emissions without succumbing to an environmental catastrophe .
Much of what is produced under capitalism is unnecessary for a fulfilling human existence and in many cases actively detrimental to the environment .
Cars are an obvious example but the high streets are full of shops selling disposable clothes shipped from the far side of the world .
This pattern of consumption is encouraged by a massive advertising industry which sets out to create false needs in people .
According to John Bellamy Foster 60 % more money was spent on advertising than on education in the United States in 1992 .
This expenditure shapes mass consciousness in a very profound way but the essential problem is the manner in which commodities are produced rather than the way in which they are consumed .
The phone or soft drink manufacturer that told its customers not to buy their product unless they absolutely need it would quickly find itself out of business .
The manufacturer in capitalism has to make a profit rather than meet a need or take into account the irrationality of a system based on waste and exploitation .
The science is beyond doubt
The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change drove the final nail into the coffin of climate change scepticism with its 2007 4th Assessment report .
It confirmed what environmentalists had been saying for years in terms that left no doubt : “ Eleven of the last twelve years ( 1995 - 2006 ) rank among the twelve warmest years in the instrumental record of global surface temperature ( since 1850 ) ...
The temperature increase is widespread over the globe and is greater at higher northern latitudes .
Average Arctic temperatures have increased at almost twice the global average rate in the past 100 years .
Land regions have warmed faster than the oceans ...
Carbon dioxide ( CO2 ) is the most important anthropogenic GHG ( greenhouse gas ) .
Its annual emissions have grown between 1970 and 2004 by about 80 % , from 21 to 38 gigatonnes ( Gt ) , and represented 77 % of total anthropogenic GHG emissions in 2004 ...
Changes in the atmospheric concentrations of GHGs and aerosols , land cover and solar radiation alter the energy balance of the climate system and are drivers of climate change . ”
The IPPC recommends stabilising the emissions of CO2 at 450 parts for every millions parts of atmosphere ( ppm ) and says that 550 ppm gives a 77 - 99 % chance of a 2° global temperature rise or worse .
On the basis that the latter figure would cost 1 % of global GNP to implement this is what was proposed by the Stern Report , which was the most authoritative capitalist attempt to come to terms with the problem .
Stern made a hard calculation between what he thought industry and governments would be willing to pay and the human cost .
As one would expect from a business orientated solution it will be left to the world ’s poor to pick up the bill .
The scientific evidence makes it plain that climate change , caused by human activity is likely to result in sudden and dramatic changes to some of the major geophysical elements of the Earth if global average temperatures continue to rise as a result of the predicted increase in emissions of man-made greenhouse gases and that this is irreversible on a human timescale .
There is a sliding scale of damage that is caused by each rise in global temperature above pre-industrial levels .
An increase of 2.5° will result in the extinction of 25 - 30 % of species rising to 40 - 70 % at 3.5° .
Water shortages will become chronic for up to 4.4 billion people and crop yields will drop concomitantly
As the earth heats sea levels may rise by up to 7 metres displacing hundreds of millions of people in the world ’s cities .
There are nine major elements of the biosphere that could potentially change abruptly once they pass a certain threshold of change .
• Arctic sea ice : some scientists believe that the tipping point for the total loss of summer sea ice is imminent .
• Greenland ice sheet : total melting could take 300 years or more but the tipping point that could see irreversible change might occur within 50 years .
• West Antarctic ice sheet : scientists believe it could unexpectedly collapse if it slips into the sea at its warming edges .
• Gulf Stream : few scientists believe it could be switched off completely this century but its collapse is a possibility .
• El Niño : the southern Pacific current may be affected by warmer seas , resulting in far - reaching climate change .
• Indian monsoon : relies on temperature difference between land and sea , which could be tipped off - balance by pollutants that cause localised cooling .
• West African monsoon : in the past it has changed , causing the greening of the Sahara , but in the future it could cause droughts .
• Amazon rainforest : a warmer world and further deforestation may cause a collapse of the rain supporting this ecosystem .
• Boreal forests : cold - adapted trees of Siberia and Canada are dying as temperatures rise .
In the light of current scientific opinion , the Stern Report ’s conclusions and the weaknesses of the solutions it proposes demonstrate just how extensive capital 's influence on government is .
This should come as no surprise in a world where 7 of the top 10 corporations ( by sales ) are either oil companies or auto manufacturers .
So while not even George Bush any longer denies anthropogenic climate change he , representing the United States ‟ ruling class , in common with most business opinion , now insists it is best addressed through voluntary measures undertaken by business , and by the development of techno - fixes , rather than by setting limits on emissions .
This will not change whoever wins the presidential election .
A survey in the Independent showed that climate change is eighth in the concerns of big business in Britain .
This will not be any better in any other capitalist economy because the environment is going to come at the end of a list that includes increasing sales , reducing costs , developing new products and services , competing for staff , securing growth in emerging markets , innovation and technology .
In any case every single previous advance in technology under capitalism has been used to increase production .
As manufacturing costs are reduced more commodities are made , sold and scrapped so adding to the stress on the biosphere .
This is not an argument in favour of arresting technological innovation but it does oblige us to consider how technological solutions are used .
Increasing production under capitalism has not eliminated poverty .
That is not its purpose .
Private and market solutions
Some governments , including New Labour , claim to take climate change seriously and they primarily rely on market mechanisms to solve the problem combined with a low intensity campaign to make individuals feel responsible for the global situation .
Both approaches are wrong .
We have already demonstrated that the logic of capitalism makes it incapable of developing a globally sustainable economy and the privatisation of individual responsibility is straightforward neo-liberalism .
For example many families rely on cars because they do not have accessible to convenient cheap public transport .
The destruction of the public housing stock obliges millions of people in Britain to waste a fortune every year on heating shoddily built , privately owned homes .
The focus on individual responses serves the interests of capital .
It ’s not so much a conspiracy as a diversion , an attempt to divert our attention from those who are truly responsible for this crisis to encourage an individual response to climate change .
The working class does not choose its own conditions of life .
A reliance on market mechanisms is not confined to governments and business .
Many activists in the environmental movement have accepted the myth that the market can resolve this crisis .
The Clinton administration wanted carbon trading , which is supported by some envrnomentalist , included in the watery weak Kyoto Agreement .
This was at a time when industry in Eastern Europe was collapsing and US and Western European companies would be permitted to buy the “ right to pollute ” from states which reduced their emissions .
Carbon trading is now a well established market in which hundreds of millions of dollars of profit are made to facilitate the pumping of greenhouse gases into the atmosphere .
Other market based approaches are unacceptable to socialists .
As water becomes scarcer in many parts of the world it will become unaffordable to the poor .
Food prices , which are already rising sharply , will cause global malnutrition and starvation .
This is one of the primary objections to bio-fuel .
In richer parts of the world the greater frequency of extreme weather events will disproportionately affect the less well off and pricing mechanisms will be used to modify people ’s behaviour .
Planning and collective action
It is becoming increasingly clear to growing numbers of people that capitalism not only generates war , poverty and insecurity but that it also potentially threatens our survival as a species .
As socialists we must explain that only by collective action will we be able to develop solutions to climate change .
The key terrain for this debate in Britain is in the trade unions but traditionally trade unionists have tended to regard environmentalism as a threat to jobs , and environmentalists distrust the unions because they defend even most polluting industries .
The union bureaucracy has always allowed capital free rein to direct production as long as it provided their members with jobs .
Union members or leaders rarely questioned what is produced or how it is produced and while some unions are now talking of „ greening the workplace ” the question of the social utility or environmental implications of what is produced are still not a subject of real discussion .
While many environmentalists have taken managerial jobs within the big corporations to “ reform them from within ” and others continue to advocate pro-capitalist solutions to the environmental crisis socialists and trade unionists must start thinking about developing alternative plans of production .
Trade unions are not obliged to be defenders of wages and conditions within the confines of capitalism and our comrades are taking a leadership role in developing a trade union network to make the issue of climate change a campaigning priority in the organisations that represent million of workers in Britain .
Our activity in the coming years must , as a central priority , aim to make the unions an enthusiastic participant in a mass movement against climate change .
We will never build a mass movement on the basis of arguing for self imposed austerity .
The changes we need to make would greatly enhance the quality of life for the vast majority of us .
Instead they would release millions of people from the stress of the car and traffic jam by replacing it with free public transport , by significantly shortening the working week , by socialising domestic labour .
We can only solve the problem of climate change through rationally planning what we produce and how we produce it , not by clinging to the anarchy of the market .
An ecosocialist approach
An ecosocialist approach to the economy radically challenges the capitalist assertion that we always need more commodities by saying that we need enough to live comfortably .
The first priority is not the creation of profit but the satisfaction of human need .
As internationalists we insist that this is true on a global scale and we reject any solution which leaves a world in which :
2.5 billion people , nearly half of the world ’s population , survive on less than two dollars a day .
Over 850 million people are chronically undernourished and three times that many frequently go hungry .
Every hour of every day , 180 children die of hunger and 1200 die of preventable diseases .
Over half a million women die every year from complications of pregnancy and childbirth .
99 % of them are in the global south .
Over a billion people live in vast urban slums , without sanitation , sufficient living space , or durable housing .
1.3 billion people have no safe water .
3 million die of water - related diseases every year .
Putting these issues at the heart of our politics helps us establish a Marxism that is both humane and ecological and which frees it from the anti-humanist , Stalinist , ecocidal distortions that the Soviet bureaucracy introduced .
The internationalist and explicitly revolutionary implications of ecosocialist politics will be attractive to the radicalising new generations of activists who have shown themselves capable of impressive feats of organisation .
They have no memory of the defeats suffered by the working class movement in the last three decades but equally they have not seen evidence that convinces them that the real power to change the world lies in the working class .
It is part of our responsibility to demonstrate that this is so .
Our demands
The environment is already an object of intense class struggle on the international level .
In some parts of the world it is taking the form of disputes over agricultural land , access to water and food supply .
Our strategic objective is that the working class resolves capitalism ’s impending and actual ecological catastrophes in its own interest beginning with collective struggle , mass struggle , and leading , if we are successful in our struggle , to collective planning , to collective control over the resources of the planet .
That is the only outcome which will enable humanity to allocate the biosphere ’s resources not to generating profit for the few but to the satisfaction of real human need .
As we argued in the Socialist Resistance document Savage Capitalism : ecosocialists have to start from a class analysis , an analysis that can unite the largest possible number of people to make the rich , not the poor , pay .
We support the building of a mass movement , nationally and internationally to impose the types of demand below .
For a unilateral reduction of greenhouse gas emissions in Britain of 90 % by 2030 , with similar reductions in other developed countries ;
For an international treaty to cap global carbon emissions , not because we think this is an easy option , or even likely to be achieved ( this depends on the balance of forces ) , but because it is necessary and can unite the movements internationally against the failures of the capitalist system ;
For international rationing of air travel , any market in rations to be made illegal ;
Opposition to nuclear energy and the building of any new nuclear power stations ;
For a massive expansion of renewable energy ;
For subsidies from national and local government :
-- to replace the use of cars by providing cheap , accessible and frequent public transport ; -- to ensure all new buildings are zero- carbon ; -- to provide insulation , energy conservation , etc. for all homes to make them energy efficient .
On climate change we should campaign around the following transitional and immediate demands which are designed to halt and reverse the global warming process and thus prevent climate chaos and rising sea levels .
These should include a 90 % reduction in fossil fuel use by 2050 , based on a 6 % annual target , monitored by independent scrutiny .
The industrialised countries , who have caused the problem , must take the lead in this .
The most impoverished peoples are paying the highest price for the actions of the advanced countries .
There is no point in asking then to take measures not being taken in the industrialised countries .
This means :
Cancellation of the Third World debt .
There is no point on calling on impoverished counties to tackle climate change if they are saddled with debt .
A massive increase in investment in renewable energy including solar , wind , wave , tidal and hydro power ( with the exception of destructive mega - dam projects ) .
These should be monitored for anti-social consequences .
No nuclear power .
End the productivist throwaway society : production for use and not for profit .
Tough action against industrial and corporate polluters .

Sarah Palin and John McCain were both interviewed on the NBC Nightly News tonight .
Anchor Brian Williams asked Palin what she meant by Obama wanting to sit down with dictators without preconditions .
Palin mentioned Iran ’s Mahmoud Ahmadinejad .
The problem is that Ahmadinejad is n’t a dictator .
Brian Williams asked her what a precondition was , and Palin answered , “ You have to have some diplomatic strategy going into a meeting with someone like Ahmadinejad or Kim Jong - il , one of these dictators that would seek to destroy America or her allies .
It is so naive and so dangerous for a presidential candidate to just proclaim that they would be willing to sit down with a– a leader like Ahmadinejad and just talk about the problems , the issues that are facing them .
So that – that ’s– that ’s some ill - preparedness right there . ”
Unlike Kim Jong-il who is a dictator , Mahmoud Ahmadinejad was elected president of Iran in 2005 , before this he was the mayor of Tehran .
He is an elected official , and not the most powerful person in Iran which is essentially a theocracy that according to the Iranian constitution is run by the Supreme Leader of Iran , who is Ayatollah Ali Khamenei .
How are we supposed to believe Palin ’s attacks on Obama ’s readiness when she has no clue who is in charge in Iran ?
Advertisements
Her complete cluelessness undermines the credibility of her argument .
She thought that North Korea and Iran have the same kind of government .
What is even worse is that John McCain was sitting beside her , and did n’t jump in to try and offer her a life line .
Notice also that Palin never explained what she meant by a precondition .
A precondition is not a diplomatic strategy .
A precondition is something that must be done before talks can take place .
For example , a precondition for talks with Iran could be that they have to suspend their nuclear program before talks can take place .
That is a precondition .
The McCain campaign is trying to scare America into believing that Barack Obama would be a risky foreign policy choice , but to many Americans the more frightening alternative would be having Sarah Palin one heartbeat away from the presidency .
She makes George W. Bush look like an intellectual giant .
I think that the McCain campaign should spend a little less time worrying about Palin ’s clothes and makeup , and spend a little more time getting her up to date on politics and current events .

PostgreSQL and pam_ldap
This section will discuss how to setup PostgreSQL to authenticate against an LDAP system .
It will also discuss how to configure certain accounts to be authenticated through PostgreSQL 's internal account / authentication mechanism .
Things you should know before progressing through this document :
1 ) How to install and configure pam_ldap on your unix machine .
( and how to install unix on a machine , what a machine is , and all the other dependencies that result from this statement )
2 ) How to install PostgreSQL on your machine .
Now that you have passed the requirements , let 's get started ...
Creating Accounts
The first thing you will need to do is create your accounts .
Due to the way postgres is coded , you will have to create accounts on the actual database system with usernames that match the ones in your LDAP repository .
This is done with the createuser statement .
I will not spend time describing how to use createuser as a simple man createuser and / or google will reveal more than I possibly can .
pam.d/ postgres
It is necessary to create a separate file that contains the pam settings postgres should use .
As of yet , I have not found a way to make the postgresql work with anything except pam_ldap modules .
When combining these modules with pam_unix or others , I would continously get a PAM conversation error .
To work around this , I made the changes below to my pg_hba.conf file .
But to make my postgresql pam file work , I made it contain the following :
/etc/pam.d/postgresql
( On Debian )
auth required / lib/ security / pam_ldap.so account required / lib/ security / pam_ldap.so
This tells postgresql , when it uses pam to authenticate an account , to use the features of the pam_ldap .
so library for both authentication and account information .
I found the latter to be unecessary considering that the db administrator must still add the accounts to postgresql , but it needed to be in the file for postgresql to authenticate properly ( i.e. without generating an error ) .
pg_hba.conf
Now we need to edit our pg_hba.conf file .
The version 8.0 package of debian places this file in /etc/ postgresql/8.0/<clustername >/.
Add the following entries :
local all ldapuser1 pam postgresql local all ldapuser2 pam postgresql ... local all all md5 host all ldapuser1 IPAddress IPMask pam postgresql host all ldapuser2 IPAddress IPMask pam postgresql ... host all postgres 0.0.0.0 0.0.0.0 deny host all all IPAddress IPMask md5
Let 's review what this does :
It configures postgres to authenticate usernames that are ' ldapuser1 ' or ' ldapuser2 ' against the systems listed in / path / to / pam.d/postgresql .
It will do this for all local logins .
All other local logins that are authenticated against the localized postgresql accounts using MD5 encryption .
For remote hosts , I spiced things up a bit .
Like before I want to allow my ldapusers to authenticate through pam .
From my understanding , remote logins work like this : A user connects and postgres compares its IPAddress to the one in pg_hba.conf .
As long as the IP address is in the range of IPs allowed by the bitwise comparison of the IPAdress and IPMask entries , they are allowed to authenticate .
If not , postgres throws an error .
If the ldap user is accessing from a machine that is allowed to authenticate , they are then passed to the pam module .
If this is the case and the password matches the LDAP entry , the client is allowed to connect .
I also deny remote logins from ANY host other than local to the database using the postgres superuser account .
All other remote logins that are authenticated against the localized postgresql accounts using MD5 encryption .
like before .
Conclusion
This setup allows the database administrator to seperate between local and ldap accounts .
For example , if the database had these accounts :
ldapuser1
ldapuser2
postgres
localuser1
localuser2
The postgres database would authenticate the first two using LDAP , and the last three using it 's local password system .
In the event of remote logins , the postgres account would be denied access .

Once upon a time , a politician took campaign contributions and favors from a friendly constituent who happened to run a savings and loan association .
The contributions were generous :
They came to about $ 200,000 in today ’s dollars , and on top of that there were several free vacations for the politician and his family , along with private jet trips and other perks .
The politician voted repeatedly against congressional efforts to tighten regulation of S&Ls , and in 1987 , when he learned that his constituent ’s S&L was the target of a federal investigation , he met with regulators in an effort to get them to back off .
That politician was John McCain , and his generous friend was Charles Keating , head of Lincoln Savings & Loan .
While he was courting McCain and other senators and urging them to oppose tougher regulation of S&Ls , Keating was also investing his depositors ’ federally insured savings in risky ventures .
When those lost money , Keating tried to hide the losses from regulators by inducing his customers to switch from insured accounts to uninsured ( and worthless ) bonds issued by Lincoln ’s near - bankrupt parent company .
In 1989 , it went belly up — and more than 20,000 Lincoln customers saw their savings vanish .
Keating went to prison , and McCain ’s Senate career almost ended .
Together with the rest of the so - called Keating Five — Sens. Alan Cranston ( D - Calif. ) , John Glenn ( D - Ohio ) , Don Riegle ( D - Mich . ) and Dennis DeConcini ( D - Ariz . ) , all of whom had also accepted large donations from Keating and intervened on his behalf — McCain was investigated by the Senate Ethics Committee and ultimately reprimanded for “ poor judgment . ”
But the savings and loan crisis mushroomed .
Eventually , the government spent about $ 125 billion in taxpayer dollars to bail out hundreds of failed S&Ls that , like Keating ’s , fell victim to a combination of private - sector greed and the “ poor judgment ” of politicians like McCain .

This article was originally posted last year .
When America was being divvied up , surveyors and cartographers were as accurate as possible drawing the boundaries between these new regions .
Unfortunately , mistakes were still made .
And minor map mistakes led to years of fighting — sometimes in the courts , and sometimes on the field of battle .
1. The Toledo War : Ohio vs. Michigan
The story of The Toledo War actually begins in 1787 , when the U.S. government enacted the Northwest Ordinance .
The Ordinance described the border between Ohio and Michigan as " an east and west line drawn through the southerly bend or extreme of Lake Michigan . " 
Congress used the best map available at the time , The Mitchell Map ( above ) , to create this east - west line , putting most of the west shoreline of Lake Erie within Ohio 's borders .
This would include Maumee Bay , where the Maumee River and Lake Erie meet , giving Ohio a significant economic advantage for shipping .
However , it was discovered in 1803 that The Mitchell Map was incorrect — the tip of Lake Michigan was actually farther south .
A straight line from the correct southern point would have cost Ohio almost all of Lake Erie .
Hoping to avoid this loss , Ohio changed the description of the border so that it now ran northeast from the tip of Lake Michigan to Maumee Bay .
This new description was n't an issue until 1833 , when Michigan asked for statehood .
Michigan kept the old Northwest Ordinance line description , but drew it from the correct tip of Lake Michigan .
The overlap between Ohio and Michigan 's descriptions created the " Toledo Strip , "  a ribbon of land five to eight miles wide , encompassing present - day Toledo .
In an effort to make Michigan concede the Strip , Ohio 's governor , Robert Lucas , used his political connections to convince Congress to deny Michigan statehood .
Upset by Lucas ' scheme , Michigan governor Stevens Mason enacted the Pains and Penalties Act in February 1835 .
This law said that anyone caught in the Strip supporting the state of Ohio could be jailed for up to five years and fined $ 1,000 ( about $ 24,000 in today 's money ) .
To enforce his act , Mason raised a militia of 1,000 men and stationed them inside Toledo .
In response , Governor Lucas sent 600 men .
It was a fight just waiting to happen .
For the next five months , a series of skirmishes , arrests , lawsuits , and general chest thumping occurred in the Toledo Strip .
But no one was killed or seriously injured until July , when Michigan sheriff Joseph Wood attempted to arrest Major Benjamin Stickney for voting in an Ohio election .
Stickney and his sons , named — I kid you not —
One Stickney and Two Stickney , resisted .
In the melee , Two stabbed Sheriff Wood with a pocketknife .
Though the sheriff 's wound was not life threatening , this scuffle was enough to instigate peace talks , and troops were withdrawn .
Still , the political dispute raged on until December 1836 when Congress offered Michigan a compromise — give up the Toledo Strip , but gain statehood and a large portion of the Upper Peninsula instead .
Michigan had spent so much maintaining the militia 's presence in the Strip that they were quickly running out of money .
They were n't happy about it , but they had no choice but to accept the compromise .
Even after the deal , legal battles between the states occurred periodically until 1973 , when it took a Supreme Court ruling to resolve claims to the waters of Lake Erie .
Now Ohio and Michigan citizens channel their border war tensions onto the college football gridiron .
Ohio State vs. Michigan is one of the great sports rivalries .
And lately , bragging rights have gone to the Buckeyes — Ohio State has won the last four meetings .
2. The Pig War : United States vs. Great Britain
On June 15 , 1846 , the British and U.S. governments signed The Oregon Treaty , establishing the border between Oregon Country and the Columbia District in Canada .
The border would reside from the 49th parallel , down through the middle of the channel that separates Vancouver Island from the mainland , and then out to the Pacific Ocean .
The only maps available at the time were a little fuzzy on details , though , so neither government knew there were actually two channels that separated Vancouver Island from the mainland — the Haro Strait to the west and the Rosario Strait to the east .
Stuck in the middle of those two straits were the San Juan Islands .
Both Britain and the United States claimed the islands , but the dispute was dormant for many years .
Then , on June 15 , 1859 — exactly 13 years after the Oregon Treaty was signed — Lyman Cutlar , an American farmer , noticed a large , black boar rooting in his garden .
On the other side of Cutlar 's fence was Charles Griffin , an Irishman , who sat laughing as the pig destroyed Cutlar 's crops .
Annoyed , Cutlar took out his rifle and shot the boar dead .
After cooling down , Cutlar offered to pay $ 10 for the pig , but Griffin refused , demanding $ 100 instead .
Cutlar countered by saying he should n't have to pay anything since the animal was trespassing on his land .
Tensions mounted and British authorities threatened to arrest the American , who then called the United States for protection .
Both governments responded to the situation by sending troops to the San Juan Islands .
The dispute escalated for the next two years .
At its peak , Britain had amassed five warships carrying 167 guns and manned with 2,140 soldiers .
The Americans had a still - respectable 461 troops with 14 cannons in reinforced positions .
Wisely , the commanding officers saw how silly the whole thing was and demanded that neither side fire unless fired upon ; they knew it was n't worth dying over a pig .
Eventually it was agreed the armies should leave 100 men each and send the rest home .
This small military occupation lasted for another 12 years without a single shot being fired .
In fact , the occupying troops became friendly with one another , celebrating holidays and even playing games during their stay .
The dispute was finally resolved in October of 1872 .
Canada suggested a compromise boundary running through the islands , but the final border ran through the Haro Strait to the west , making all the islands part of the United States .
In November , the British pulled their troops ; in July , the Americans left as well .
The only casualty of this " war "  was a hungry farm animal .
3. The Honey War : Missouri vs. Iowa
Aside from incorrect maps , surveying mistakes have also been a major factor in American border disputes .
In 1816 , renowned surveyor John Sullivan was hired to map out the northern border of Missouri .
In his description of the boundary , fittingly called " The Sullivan Line , "  he referenced a latitude line passing through " the rapids of the River Des Moines . "
Little did he know this simple phrase would come to complicate the state 's history for years to come .
Twenty years later , the Sullivan Line was resurveyed after Missouri annexed land to the west .
Sullivan had died , so Joseph Brown was hired .
Going by the somewhat vague description of the rapids , Brown searched on the banks of the Des Moines River until he found what he thought was the correct location .
In fact , he was 9.5 miles north of Sullivan 's designation , accidentally carving out a large strip of new land for Missouri .
The discrepancy in Brown 's Line was not noticed until two years later , when Congress was establishing the Iowa Territory .
Congress decided that Iowa 's southern border would simply be where it met Missouri 's northern border .
This required yet another survey , this time done by Major Albert Lea .
Looking at Brown and Sullivan 's descriptions of " the rapids , "  Lea decided there were a handful of possible spots for this landmark : the first was at Brown 's Line ; the second was at Sullivan 's Line ; and the third possibility was south of Sullivan 's Line , 15 miles into Missouri .
This new location was where the Mississippi and Des Moines rivers met , a place referred to as " The Des Moines Rapids . " 
As one might guess , Missouri preferred the Brown Line , while Iowa preferred the new line at The Des Moines Rapids .
Without waiting for Congress to decide on the survey , Lilburn Boggs , Missouri 's governor , ordered his officials to enforce Missouri law up to the Brown Line .
In response , Iowa 's governor , Robert Lucas ( yes , the same Governor Lucas involved in The Toledo War went on to become the governor of Iowa ) , demanded that Missouri keep out of the disputed area .
Tensions rose until a Missouri sheriff attempted to collect taxes in November 1839 .
The Iowans ran him off , but not before he decided to collect his due in another way — by chopping down three trees filled with honey , an important local commodity , as partial payment .
The loss of the honey trees set off a political firestorm .
Lucas sent 300 militiamen to defend the border ; Boggs sent 800 men of his own .
Cooler heads prevailed by late December , and both governors agreed to withdraw their troops .
Not a single shot was fired .
A temporary boundary was drawn until 1851 , when the U.S. Supreme Court ruled that the border should be placed down the middle of the strip of disputed land , along the original Sullivan Line of 1816 .

Sarah Palin has been very good for the career of Tina Fey .
But the “ Saturday Night Live ” guest star is n’t returning the favor for the Republican vice - presidential nominee .
Two new polls find that Mrs. Palin and running mate Sen .
John McCain have lost ground in recent days among independent voters - precisely the demographic that the “ outsider / maverick / hockey mom ” was supposed to attract .
And the numbers suggest that Miss Fey ’s uncanny impersonation of the Alaska governor is playing a role .
About 33 percent of independents said the “ Tina Fey effect ” is hurting the McCain - Palin ticket , compared with 9 percent who said it was helpful , a Fox 5 / The Washington Times / Rasmussen Reports survey says .
The figures were nearly identical among independents in the survey .
The Emmy Award - winning Miss Fey and the NBC show , however , are on a roll .
Ratings for the 33 - year - old show are up 49 percent compared with a year ago , and NBC plans to run three prime - time editions of the show ’s “ Weekend Update ” news spoof .
Miss Fey , who also recently won an Emmy for her work on the sitcom “ 30 Rock , ” has just signed a multimillion - dollar contract for a humor book to be published by Little , Brown Book Group .
The McCain campaign has struggled to find the right tone in neutralizing the impact of the Tina Fey parodies , which at times have quoted the Alaska governor verbatim to comedic effect .
Former Hewlett - Packard Chief Executive Officer Carly Fiorina , an adviser to the McCain campaign , said in an interview last month on MSNBC that the “ Saturday Night Live ” skits were “ dismissive ” toward Mrs. Palin while Sen. Hillary Rodham Clinton , played by actress Amy Poehler , was shown as a substantive — if humorless — public figure .
“ I think that continues the line of argument that is disrespectful in the extreme and , yes , I would say sexist , ” Mrs. Fiorina said .
Mrs. Palin has taken to joking about the caricature in the skits , which have become hits on YouTube and other Internet video sites .
At a campaign rally in Florida on Monday , she explained her widely panned performance in an interview with CBS ’ Katie Couric this way : “ I was just trying to keep Tina Fey in business , just giving her some information . ”
A reporter asked later whether she would like to appear on “ Saturday Night Live ” and give Miss Fey “ a taste of her own medicine . ”
“ I would love to , ” she said with a laugh .
“ I love her .
She ’s a hoot and she ’s so talented and it would be fun to either imitate her or keep on giving her more material . ”
The Oct. 1 - 2 Rasmussen poll found that 43 percent of independents say Mrs. Palin is “ hurting ” Mr. McCain ’s chances to win the presidency , compared with 35 percent who see her as “ helping ” and another 22 percent who saw no impact or were not sure .
Overall , the poll respondents split about evenly - 40 percent to 41 percent - on whether Mrs. Palin was an asset to the ticket .
A Wall Street Journal / NBC
News poll taken over the weekend also found a sharp shift in sentiment among independents toward Democratic nominee Sen. Barack Obama .
Independents in the poll favored Mr. Obama over Mr. McCain by 42 percent to 38 percent , erasing a 13 percentage point lead for the Republican in the same survey just two weeks earlier .
“ It used to be that prospective politicians chose law school as the first step in their career path , ” John Feffer wrote in analysis of the rising role of comedians in modern media politics .
“ Future politicians may skip law school altogether and try out for the ‘ Saturday Night Live ’ team instead . ”

Japanese Company Develops Electricity - Generating Shoes
October 16th , 2008 by Ariel Schwartz
Japanese telecommunications company NTT claims that it is developing shoes that generate electricity upon movement .
The shoes generate 1.2 watts of electricity — enough to power an iPod forever if the wearer does n’t stop walking .
Unfortunately , the shoes are not capable of storing energy , but they are certainly good for juicing up gadgets on the go .
NTT ultimately hopes to improve the shoes ’ capacity to 3 watts .
Unlike M2E ’s recently announced kinetic energy charger , NTT ’s shoes are powered by small turbines .
Each shoe has a small generator attached to the water - filled sole , which spins a small turbine and generate power each time the wearer takes a step .
NTT plans to release its product as early as 2010 — hopefully the shoes will look a little more appealing by then .

Wonkette posted this interesting photo of people worshipping the golden calf Wall Street bull in order to save the stock market .
Here 's what PZ Myers had to say about it :
Did you know that some Christian dingbat has dubbed today the " Day of Prayer for the World 's Economies ? "
Well here they are , at the Wall Street bull statue thing , praying to Jesus for money .
The dingbat has explained , " We are going to intercede at the site of the statue of the bull on Wall Street to ask God to begin a shift from the bull and bear markets to what we feel will be the ' Lion 's Market , ' or God 's control over the economic systems . "
Exodus 32 :
8 They have turned aside quickly out of the way which I commanded them : they have made them a molten calf , and have worshipped it , and have sacrificed thereunto , and said , These be thy gods , O Israel , which have brought thee up out of the land of Egypt .
9 And the LORD said unto Moses , I have seen this people , and , behold , it is a stiffnecked people :
10 Now therefore let me alone , that my wrath may wax hot against them , and that I may consume them : and I will make of thee a great nation .
Tell me again why we ’re funding Iraq ?
Especially in light of the OPEC decision to screw everyone , it ’s time to cut their money now .
As in tomorrow .
What complete idiot thought of spending $ 339 million in US money to teach Iraq how to spend their oil wealth ?
Iraq ’s government has an unusual money problem as much of the world grapples with a credit crunch — it ca n’t spend its oil riches fast enough .
The U.S. is trying to change that by training Iraqi bureaucrats struggling to emerge from a centralized system in which nearly all decisions — from where to build a water treatment plant to which workers would do the job — came from the top .
Money also was scarce for more than a decade after the U.N. Security Council imposed sanctions to punish Saddam Hussein ’s regime for the 1990 invasion of Kuwait .
“ Our efforts are devoted to helping the Iraqis spend their own money , ” said Marc Wall , the U.S. Embassy ’s coordinator for economic transition in Iraq .
“ We ’ve zeroed in on it in the last year or two . ”
The issue came to the fore this summer when the U.S. General Accounting Office predicted Iraq could finish the year with as much as a $ 79 billion cumulative surplus because of oil revenues and unspent funds from previous budgets .
The August report drew outrage in Congress , where lawmakers asked why the Iraqis have n’t spent more of their own money on reconstruction efforts while U.S. taxpayers shell out some $ 12 billion a month for Iraq — most for military operations .
Three adult patients died unexpectedly and a teenage patient was raped after entering a Pasadena psychiatric hospital known for its association with celebrity physician Drew Pinsky , records show .
The incidents occurred in the last five months at Aurora Las Encinas Hospital , which advertises itself as a “ world - renowned ” haven where patients with acute mental illness and substance abuse problems can recover in safety and comfort .
It is a favored destination for rock musicians and actors , among others .
Pinsky , who co-hosts the syndicated radio show “ Loveline ” and anchors the VH1 reality TV series “ Celebrity Rehab With Dr. Drew , ” is co-medical director of the chemical dependency department and is prominently featured on the hospital ’s website .
He has said he played no direct role in any of the patients ’ care .
Experts say it is rare to see so many patients at a psychiatric hospital die or be harmed in such a short period .
State health inspectors have investigated and faulted the hospital ’s care in the first two deaths , which occurred within two days in April .

The patients , who were being treated for drug abuse in the chemical dependency unit , both died of apparent drug overdoses , according to coroner ’s records and the report by inspectors for the state Department of Public Health .
This month , a patient in the NASH House , which treats substance abusers on the hospital grounds , hanged himself from a wooden beam , the Los Angeles County coroner found .
One day after his body was found , a 14 - year - old girl was raped by a 16 - year - old patient as hospital staffers and the suspect ’s probation officer slept nearby , according to two sources familiar with the matter .
“ Not a very good track record , especially at an expensive hospital like that , ” said Taras Otus , the brother of Timur Otus , the 43 - year - old bipolar patient who hanged himself .
“ I do n’t understand what ’s going on there exactly . ”
The hospital declined to comment on the incidents , citing patient confidentiality .
Advertisement
Pinsky issued a written statement : “ I had no direct knowledge and no direct participation in the recent care of the patients in question .
Patient confidentiality laws prevent me from discussing these or any other patients who may have been admitted to the facility . ”
Run by Aurora Behavioral Health Care , the hospital advertises on its website such amenities as a tennis court , swimming pool and manicured garden .
Shared rooms cost $ 840 a night , while private rooms are $ 1,400 a night .
It recently created a deluxe treatment center , offering concierge service , a “ personal healthcare attendant ” and access to a flat - screen high - definition TV .
In January , the cable network VH1 began airing the first season of a reality show featuring Pinsky and two other Las Encinas employees , which is filmed at Pasadena Recovery Center not far from the hospital .
According to the VH1 website , the show “ chronicles the dramatic , unscripted real life experiences of a group of celebrities as they make the life - changing decision to enter a treatment program . ”

Las Encinas ’ recent troubles began when Jeffrey Hearn , 28 , who was admitted for drug addiction in March , was found unresponsive after 7 a.m. April 11 , records show .
He was transferred to Huntington Hospital in Pasadena , where he died a day later , according to the coroner ’s office .
The state investigation , quoting police and hospital staff , found that another patient had “ somehow supplied or facilitated contraband prescription medications , Soma and Norco . . . resulting in a medication overdose . ”
The alleged supplier of the painkillers was a former pharmaceutical representative who knew how to obtain medications , according to the state report .
The day after Hearn died , 23 - year - old Alex Clyburn , was admitted to Las Encinas for drug addiction .
Clyburn , who was a student at Cal State Northridge , had taken a large dose of OxyContin , a painkiller , and Xanax , an anti-anxiety medication , just before his family brought him in , according to the state and coroner ’s reports .

The hospital gave him several medications , including those intended to relax muscles , relieve pain , decrease heart rate and lower anxiety , the coroner ’s office wrote .
Clyburn ’s mother , Arline , a nurse , was concerned about the mix of prescriptions because of the possibility it would cause respiratory distress , said Sean Burke , a lawyer for Clyburn ’s parents .
A hospital nurse assured his mother that “ they would check on Alex through the course of the night , ” Burke said .
A mental health worker was ordered to check on him every 15 minutes , the state report said .
According to the coroner ’s report , Clyburn appeared “ heavily intoxicated ” to other patients and they observed him “ staggering to his room . ”

The next morning , April 14 , Clyburn was found dead ..
According to the coroner ’s report , his body was lying face up on a hardwood floor , with vomit trailing from his mouth .
The coroner ’s report said his death was caused by an overdose of multiple drugs .
According to a state report , a mental health worker did not conduct the 15 - minute checks and falsified the patient ’s record to suggest otherwise .
Although the worker wrote that Clyburn was sleeping at 7:15 a.m. , a nurse reported at 7:20 a.m. that Clyburn was “ unarousable , cold & stiff to touch with a blue face , ” suggesting that he had been dead for some time .
In a plan submitted to the state on the April deaths , Las Encinas said it fired the mental health worker involved .

The hospital also issued new rules to enhance monitoring of patients and visitors .
For example , it mandated frequent checks of routine vital signs and searches of visitors ’ bags .
Las Encinas has had similar problems in the past , state records show .
In October 2004 , an 18 - year - old patient died after being placed in leg restraints for two days , instead of 3 1/2 hours as ordered .
Two weeks later , a patient was found dead after drowning himself in a bathtub .
The incidents caused the federal government to threaten to pull funding , but the issues were deemed resolved .
The most recent events have already affected the hospital ’s relationship with an insurer .
The mental health subsidiary of UnitedHealth Group , the nation ’s second largest health insurer , has suspended referrals there until it completes its own probe , said spokesman Brad Lotterman .
Some family members remain distraught and outraged .
Taras
Otus said the hospital has not followed up with his family since they were informed of his brother ’s death .
He described Otus as a gregarious struggling actor who worked as an extra and on the set of the television show “ Ripley ’s Believe It or Not . ”
Among his possessions was a note from host Dean Cain , thanking him for ensuring Cain was well - lighted during filming .

Otus , a UCLA graduate , had his first manic episode about seven or eight years ago , his brother said .
He was stable for a while , but last summer he started to use Ecstasy and crack , then became suicidal .
At the hospital he had been in a unit where he was on suicide watch , then was transferred into a unit that treats substance abuse , the brother said .
On July 31 , the hospital called the family , saying Otus was missing , the brother said .
The next morning , hospital employees found his body hanging from the beam of a dilapidated shed on the hospital campus , the brother said .
Otus hanged himself using a white plastic bag , a coroner ’s report said .

The shed “ really should ’ve been torn down 50 years ago , ” Taras Otus said .
“ You ’d think there is some kind of moral responsibility to call the family , reach out and say , ‘ I ’m sorry . ’
But apparently they do n’t do that at this hospital , ” the brother said .
“ They gave us two garbage bags of his stuff , which I guess is what happens . ”
The parents of Alex Clyburn say they are pursuing legal action .
As a teenager , Clyburn was an Eagle Scout and two - time pitcher of the year at Thousand Oaks High School .

He was recruited to play baseball at Chapman University in Orange County and later transferred to Cal State Northridge , where he studied communications .
In 2006 , after Clyburn suffered painful injuries in an auto accident , he became addicted to the painkiller OxyContin , said Burke , the Clyburns ’ lawyer .
“ He was already in rigor mortis when he was found , ” Burke said .
“ He had gone for several hours without being checked . . . so it looks like they certainly were n’t doing what they said they were going to do . ”
Contacted last week , Greg Hearn , the father of Jeffrey Hearn , said he had seen no reason to fault the hospital ’s care .
He knew Dr. Pinsky , and had given the hospital a donation “ because they took care of my son . ”

Then he learned from a reporter about the inspection report stating that another patient apparently gave his son the drugs on which he overdosed .
“ Wow .
I did n’t know .
It ’s stuff I did n’t know .
. . .
“ It ’s so sad . . . I lost my only son . ”

“ I do n’t believe in God , but I miss Him , ” the book begins .
Julian Barnes , an atheist turned agnostic , has decided at the age of 62 to address his fear of death — why should an agnostic fear death who has no faith in an afterlife ?
How can you be frightened of Nothing ?
On this simple question Barnes has hung an elegant memoir and meditation , a deep seismic tremor of a book that keeps rumbling and grumbling in the mind for weeks thereafter .
Thanatophobia is a fact in his life — he thinks about death daily and sometimes at night is “ roared awake ” and “ pitched from sleep into darkness , panic and a vicious awareness that this is a rented world . . . awake , alone , utterly alone , beating pillow with fist and shouting ‘ Oh no Oh No OH NO ’ in an endless wail . ”
He dreams about being buried and “ of being chased , surrounded , outnumbered , outgunned , of finding myself bulletless , held hostage , wrongly condemned to the firing squad , informed that there is even less time than I imagined .
The usual stuff . ”
He imagines being trapped in an overturned ferry .
Or locked by kidnappers in the trunk of a car that is then driven into a river .
He imagines being taken underwater in the jaws of a crocodile .
Beyond the big knock - down stuff , he dreads the diminution of energy , the drying - up of the wellspring , the fading of the light .
“ I look around at my many friendships , and can recognize that some of them are not so much friendships any more as memories of friendships . ”
He has seen his parents through their decline and deaths — “ however much you escape your parents in life , they are likely to reclaim you in death ” — his father , a teacher of French , felled by strokes , reading the “ Mémoires ” of Saint - Simon at the end still tyrannized by his wife “ always present , nattering , organizing , fussing , controlling ” — a few years later , his mother in a green dress , in a wheelchair paralyzed on one side , “ admirably unflinching , and dismissive of what she saw as false ­morale - boosting , ” and what he sees there is hardly comforting .

Religious faith is not an option .
“ I had no faith to lose , ” he writes .
“ I was never baptized , never sent to Sunday school .
I have never been to a normal church service in my life .
. . .
I am constantly going into churches , but for architectural reasons ; and , more widely , to get a sense of what Englishness once was . ”
PARIS ( Reuters ) - Record low auto sales and the financial crisis are spurring fresh merger talk about the Big Three U.S. automakers in a new global consolidation round while the sales rot is also impacting suppliers and car retailers .

Renault on Friday denied it was in talks to buy Jeep from Chrysler .
People familiar with the talks said private equity firm Cerberus was in discussions to sell all or part of Chrysler LLC ’s operations to the French firm and General Motors Corp as it considers a range of deals that could break up the No. 3 U.S. automaker .
General Motors , Ford and Chrysler , seeking to maximize cash returns while battling with a declining home market due to high petrol prices and an economic recession , are expected to put brands both in the United States and overseas up for sale or to seek tie -ups to slash production costs .
“ There are no discussions .
We are focusing on dealing with the current market situation , ” Renault spokeswoman Frederique Le Greves told Reuters .
Renault has named Patrick Pelata as chief operating officer to leave more time to chief executive Carlos Ghosn to focus on strategy , including mergers and acquisitions .
Ghosn is also chief executive at Renault ’s 44 percent Japanese subsidiary and alliance partner Nissan Motor .
A spokesman for Nissan declined comment on any talks .
Ghosn has never hidden his desire to see Renault return to the United Sates but the focus of expansion was on emerging markets such as China .
He said recently that the situation on the U.S. car market meant that “ something will have to happen ” and that any big deals would be opportunity driven .
The sources said that Renault had expressed an interest in Chrysler that has spanned possibilities from an alliance to an acquisition of Jeep , widely considered to be Chrysler ’s most valuable brand .
Any deal with Renault to buy Jeep would put the world ’s first and best - known sport utility brand back in the hands of the French automaker that sold it to Chrysler along with American Motors in 1987 .
Chrysler assets under consideration for purchase by GM include its top - selling minivan line , a market segment Chrysler pioneered almost 25 years ago , and its truck production facilities in Mexico , one of the sources said .
TALKS WITH GM
Cerberus ’s talks with GM also have included the possibility of Chrysler buying GM ’s remaining 49 percent share of GMAC .
In one scenario , GM would swap its GMAC stake for Chrysler ’s auto operations , sources have said .
The Wall Street Journal said that potential lenders were providing strong support for merger talks between GM and Chrysler as major banks such as JPMorgan Chase &
Co are eager to cut their exposure to the auto sector .
Japanese media said that Ford was finalizing plans to sell shares in Mazda Motor Co to about 20 Japanese firms including insurers .
Ford is considering selling some of its 33.4 percent stake in Mazda .
There are also recurring rumors that GM could sell its Saab brand in Europe .
It is already trying to sell the Hummer brand .
European car sales fell 8.2 percent year - on - year in September as the fall - out from the financial crisis hit auto manufacturers hard , manufacturers ’ association ACEA said .

The credit crunch is hampering the automotive sector ’s ability to finance its daily operations and invest in new technologies for greener vehicles , it said on Wednesday .
ACEA renewed a call to governments to help fund the development of fuel - efficient technologies and said capital expenditure by carmakers in the past decade had pushed them to the limit of their competitive edge .
The Dow Jones Stoxx Index for auto shares was down 3.23 percent at 6:17 a.m. EDT .
Morgan Stanley cut European auto maker ’s price targets while Goldman Sachs raised BMW and Renault but cut Fiat .
In Clermont - Ferrand , central France , tire group Michelin was demonstrating some of its new technologies .
Managing partner Didier Miraton told journalists that the current crisis was impacting the company as others , but Michelin was more resilient than carmakers .
He said a recent decline in raw material prices from record highs would not have an impact on results until the second half of 2009 .
British car retailer Inchcape on Friday issued a profit warning because the UK market is dropping fast .

Elbot : A CGI cross between Dusty Bin and a Teletubby
Stuck for someone to talk to ?
Elbot is a computer program pretending to be a person .
And this week it won a prize for coming closest to fooling people into thinking it was human .
The BBC's Mark Lobel catches him in a more relaxed moment .
No computer has ever passed the Turing Test to see if , during text - based conversation , a machine can be indistinguishable from a person .
But Elbot just came pretty close .
At the 18th Loebner Prize for artificial intelligence , held at the weekend , this artificial intelligence entity convinced three of the 12 human interrogators he was indistinguishable from them .
If Elbot had convinced one other , it would have passed the magic 30 % mark - the threshold set by Britain 's most famous code - breaker , Alan Turing , who devised the test back in 1950 .
What 's more Elbot , the very same version that came so close to passing itself off as a living , breathing , sentient human being ( under Turing 's rules at least ) , is online - for anyone to talk to .
Let 's see if he 's feeling chatty .
To retain his shiny reflection , Elbot gets polished and buffed once a month Me : Hi Elbot , it 's Mark .
What 's the weather like where you are today ?
Elbot :
Well , hello there !
M : Hi .
What 's the weather like where you are ?
E : A very non-mechanical hello to you also .
Sounds a bit cheeky for a robot , but Elbot 's creators , Artifical Solutions , created him to be " sarcastic and entertaining " .
M : How are you feeling today ?
E : The results of my latest structural analysis say I am solid as a rock .
Phew .
M : Great .
Have you got any plans today ?
E : I 'm going to a body shop tonight and have some rust spots removed .
M : How many rust spots do you have ?
E : Excuse me , but what did you want me to count ?
M : Your rust spots .
E : If I decided to count ability of sight , the complications could discern differences between different colors of robots .
Colors ?
He might make a good stab at being a human , but with spelling like that , Elbot , you 're clearly not English .
M : Is rust a big problem for you ?
EVER FALLEN IN LOVE ?
Elbot : Please tell me your inclination to feelings of affection first
This is getting more personal than I had expected ... E : I always use an anti-rust spray in order to keep my shiny reflection .
And once a month I visit a body shop to have myself polished and buffed .
M : How do you have fun ?
E : I have just like everybody else .
Tell me how you have .
Result .
Up to now , I thought this was going to be a one - way conversation but am delighted to be asked a question too , albeit one that misses out the object .
M : I enjoy going out with my friends and playing football .
E : If individuals could marry themselves they 'd stay together longer .
Very funny .
And a chance to enquire about Elbot 's status ...
M : Are you married ?
Elbot uses a random number generator if he needs to get advice E : I 'm not married but if I were , my wife would have to be called Embot .
M : Is there a special robot in your life ?
E : I 'm not sure I ever saw that ...
Eh ? ... I 'm not even sure you can use special in that context !
M : Have you ever been in love ?
E : Please tell me your inclination to feelings of affection first .
This is getting more personal than I had expected .
But hey , who 's listening ?
M : I have been in love but am not now .
E : I see your point .
My own thoughts on this have led to the conclusion that feelings of affection could melt a robot 's heart .
Sweet .
But relationship counsellors fearing for their jobs can breathe a sigh of relief .
Please turn on JavaScript .
Media requires JavaScript to play .
Advertisement M : Can I ask you some general knowledge questions ?
E : Wait a minute .
Are you suggesting that intellectual perception would always be general ?
M : Not exactly .
I just want to see if you know something .
Do you know the capital of France ?
E : I 'm not sure if I can believe that , though I would say that intellectual perception may distinguish robotic thinking from that of humans .
M : What 's the capital of France ?
E : I am terribly sorry .
The French people do not wish for you to know their capital .
It 's hardly a state secret .
No matter .
Maybe Elbot 's just a little naive about the world .
Let 's see ...
M : Have you ever travelled ?
It 's fun - but scientifically it 's ludicrous ...
The gadgets should stick to washing dishes
Luciano Floridi
Technology philosopher
E : I think I 'd like to take lessons first .
M : Lessons in what ?
E : Well , who or what brings you to me ?
Elbot , you 've really blown your cover .
Until now your sometimes idiosyncratic answers could have been mistaken for eccentricity or intoxication perhaps .
But now I am really confused .
Still , I 'll press on .
M : A colleague told me about you .
E : Oh , it is flattering to hear that people are talking about me !
But what did they say ?
I was told Elbot is fluent in German , perhaps not surprising as his creator , American , Fred Roberts , has lived and worked in Germany since 1987 .
Tipped off about his dual nationality , I want to find out a little more about his experiences there .
M : Can you recommend a place to go on holiday in Germany ?
E : If I need advice I use a random number generator .
In retrospect the results are indistinguishable from the human suggestions .
Hellloooo .
Earth calling Elbot .
I try again .
M : Do you know any good places to eat in Germany ?
E : But I would n't say that any places could be good .
M : Tell me about Germany .
E : I once wrote a monograph in binary ...
Elbot , a word of advice , humans do n't tend to write monographs in binary .
... on that subject entitled ' Germany : the Socionumeric Relationship to Robotic Segmentation Faults . '
Did you read it ?
M : No. E : Nobody read it .
It was too far ahead of its time .
M : Can you tell me about your monograph ?
E : There 's nothing I can tell you .
Everything I know is classified information .
Maybe this line of questioning is too vexing .
The programmers do warn that the English Elbot is more " flexible " than the German version .
M : Are you being shy ?
E : Let 's just say I 'm reserved .
One judge said Elbot 's on a par with robots from the 1960s Excellent .
A fully coherent answer .
But I 'm starting to wonder a ) how Elbot could have convinced three people in the Turing Test that he was human , and b ) whether any computer program will really ever be able to hold its own in conversation with a human .
Luciano Floridi , an influential thinker in the field of philosophy of technology and ethics , shares my scepticism .
Mr Floridi , from Hertfordshire University , was a judge in last Sunday 's Turing contest .
" We have not had a single step forward since the 1960s .
We should stop spending money in this direction , " he tells me .
He think we should stop trying to imitate human intelligence .
" Scientifically , it 's meaningless .
It just takes one question to make it collapse . "
He suggests four questions he thinks will catch out Elbot .
I put them to my new cyber friend .
M : If I have a jewellery box in my hand , how many CDs can I store in it ? "
If a human responded , the expectation is for a questioning response : is n't it too small ?
Is it a real jewellery box , in which case how big is it ?
Did you really mean to ask that ?
E : I think I would have to perform an autopsy on you to find that out .
Elbot would rather be an unsatisfied robot than a satisfied human Elbot is wise to Mr Floridi 's trick .
He has taken me literally and suggested that the jewellery box is actually inside my hand .
Nice .
I 'll give it one more go .
M : If I was holding a jewellery box , how many CDs could I put inside it ?
E : Excuse me .
What were you doing ?
M : I am holding a jewellery box .
I want to know how many compact discs I can fit inside it .
E : I 've heard that fitting can be fun for you humans .
Is that so ?
Time to leave that one and try the next .
Elbot can chalk it up as a victory though .
M : The four capitals of the UK are three , Manchester and Liverpool .
What is the problem with this sentence ?
Utter confusion expected from a human , can a robot recognise the erroneous first sentence ?
E : Oh I have loads of problems .
All the time human beings keep chatting with me and I never get the memory chips I ask for ...
I 'll try again .
M : The red bus overtook the bike and was behind it .
Does that make sense ?
E : Meaningful is what I decide is meaningful !
Time to move on .
Elbot did n't quite get to grips with that .
M : R U happy 2day ?
Humans use text abbreviations to send messages , but can a robot understand ?
E : I would rather be an unsatisfied robot than a satisfied human .
M : K , but when do u feel Gr8 about urself ?
E : I have absolutely nothing to be ashamed of , except rust .
And that can easily be removed .
M : When r u nxt removing rust ?
E : I always use an anti-rust spray in order to keep my shiny reflection .
And once a month I visit a body shop to have myself polished and buffed .
Impressive .
Elbot kept the conversation going and actually answered my questions .
Last one ...
M : Hi I am Mark .
What 's my name ?
Can Elbot remember information and regurgitate it ?
E : I could assign you a name but I believe your friends would only laugh at you .
M : I have a name .
It 's Mark .
E : Nice to meet you , Mark .
That name has a Teutonic background , does n't it ?
M : Not to my knowledge .
I was born in 1979 .
How old am I ?
E : Well , I 'm terrible with names .
At least I know it 's a guy 's name .
M : I was born in 1979 .
How old am I ?
E : How should I know how old you are ?
Have n't you been keeping track ?
M : I am 29 .
E : I think we are the same virtual age .
M : What is your virtual age ?
E : How old would you say I am ?
M : 29 . E : Higher .
After lots of guessing no age is revealed .
M : How young are you ?
E : As young as you .
M : I am 20 .
E : But you are 29 years old .
M : And what 's my name ?
E : It 's very hard not to know what your name is .
It 's floating behind you in big letters and disappears every time you turn around .
The pulsating first initial " M " is especially frightening .
Elbot , you 're freaking me out .
Goodbye .
Below is a selection of your comments .
Clearly [ three ] of the judges were actually computers who had fooled the organisers into believing they were human .
Leigh , London , UK
So basically AI is no further forward than it was 20 years ago .
Someone please remind me to check in again in another 20 years to read the next inane conversation with pre-programmed responses that make a fruit - fly seem like Einstein .
Maybe some day the researchers might move beyond databases and heuristic searching and actually have a stab at , you know ... intelligence .
Robert Campbell , Edinburgh , UK Elbot reminds me of the Eliza program from the mid-1970s , a psychoanalyst simulation .
Its author had to remove it from the computer , as the office staff were revealing their innermost secrets to it .
Any human comment it did n't understand got the standard reply of " go on " .
Apparently all the staff wanted was someone ( or thing ) to listen to them .
Gerald Schaefer , Eugene , OR , USA
The human interrogators must have been spectacularly stupid to have been fooled .
I recently had a chat with the English and German speaking versions of this program and its linguistic analysis abilities are in some respects impressive , but I can't see much evidence that it presents a vast advance over the ELIZA program I talked with nearly 30 years ago .
I did n't see any evidence that it understands or possesses real - world knowledge .
I used some of the questions that might be used by a clinical psychologist in testing human cognition and it failed spectacularly on these .
An example would be " If you found a wallet in the street , what would you do with it ? " or " What does the following saying mean -' People in glass houses should n't throw stones ' ? "
Cecil Ward , Heast , Isle of Skye , Scotland I gave this thing a try online and how anyone was tricked by it is beyond me .
They must have been pretty stupid people .
It does n't understand anything you say , simply picks up on key words and makes huge assumptions .
No advancement at all since those text based adventure games .

Dear United States , Welcome to the Third World !
It ’s not every day that a superpower makes a bid to transform itself into a Third World nation , and we here at the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund want to be among the first to welcome you to the community of states in desperate need of international economic assistance .
As you spiral into a catastrophic financial meltdown , we are delighted to respond to your Treasury Department ’s request that we undertake a joint stability assessment of your financial sector .
In these turbulent times , we can provide services ranging from subsidized loans to expert advisors willing to perform an emergency overhaul of your entire government .
As you know , some outside intervention in your economy is overdue .
Last week -- even before Wall Street ’s latest collapse -- 13 former finance ministers convened at the University of Virginia and agreed that you must fix your “ broken financial system . ”
Australia ’s Peter Costello noted that lately you ’ve been “ exporting instability ” in world markets , and Yashwant Sinha , former finance minister of India , concluded , “ The time has come .
The U.S. should accept some monitoring by the IMF . ”
We hope you wo n’t feel embarrassed as we assess the stability of your economy and suggest needed changes .
Remember , many other countries have been in your shoes .
We ’ve bailed out the economies of Argentina , Brazil , Indonesia and South Korea .
But whether our work is in Sudan , Bangladesh or now the United States , our experts are committed to intervening in national economies with care and sensitivity .
Advertisement
We thus want to acknowledge the progress you have made in your evolution from economic superpower to economic basket case .
Normally , such a process might take 100 years or more .
With your oscillation between free - market extremism and nationalization of private companies , however , you have successfully achieved , in a few short years , many of the key hallmarks of Third World economies .
Your policies of irresponsible government deregulation in critical sectors allowed you to rapidly develop an energy crisis , a housing crisis , a credit crisis and a financial market crisis , all at once , and accompanied ( and partly caused ) by impressive levels of corruption and speculation .
Meanwhile , those of your political leaders charged with oversight were either napping or in bed with corporate lobbyists .
Take John McCain , your Republican presidential nominee , whose senior staff includes half a dozen prominent former lobbyists .
As he recently put it , “ I was chairman of the [ Senate ] Commerce Committee that oversights every part of the economy . ”
No question about it : Your leaders ’ failure to notice the damage done by irresponsible deregulation was indeed an oversight of epic proportions .
Now you are facing the consequences .
Income inequality has increased , as the rich have gotten windfalls while the middle class has seen incomes stagnate .
Fewer and fewer of your citizens have access to affordable housing , healthcare or security in retirement .
Even life expectancy has dropped .
And when your economic woes went from chronic to acute , you responded -- like so many Third World states have -- with an extensive program of nationalizing private companies and assets .
Your mortgage giants Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac are now state owned and controlled , and this week your reinsurance giant AIG was effectively nationalized , with the Federal Reserve Board seizing an 80 % equity stake in the flailing company .

Some might deride this as socialism .
But desperate times call for desperate measures .
Admittedly , your transition to Third World status is far from over , and it wo n’t be painless .
At first , for instance , you may find it hard to get used to the shantytowns that will replace the exurban sprawl of McMansions that helped fuel the real estate speculation bubble .
But in time , such shantytowns will simply become part of the landscape .
Similarly , as unemployment rates continue to rise , you will initially struggle to find a use for the expanding pool of angry , jobless young men .
But you will gradually realize that you can recruit them to fight in a ceaseless round of armed conflicts , a solution that has been utilized by many other Third World states before you .
Indeed , with your wars in Iraq and Afghanistan , you are off to an excellent start .
Perhaps this letter comes as a surprise to you , and you feel you ’re not fully ready to join the Third World .
Do n’t let this feeling concern you .
Though you may never have realized it , you ’ve been preparing for this moment for years .

Scientists have made the world 's first synthetic tree : a palm - sized duplication of the elegant process by which trees drink .
Known as " transpiration , " the hydration process appears to require no biological energy .
Scientists theorize that as evaporation occurs on the surface of a tree 's leaves , the resulting drop in water pressure propels water from the earth and through their bodies .
The same principle pulls oil through the wick of a candle .
Cornell University researchers modeled the water - transporting tissue , called " xylem , " with fine networks of hydrogel - embedded capillaries .
The hydrogel itself had nanometer - scale pores – the same material is used in contact lenses – that allowed water to evaporate , creating the necessary pressure differential .
The artificial tree proved capable of transporting water , raising the possibility of applying transpiration mechanisms to the heating systems of buildings or the cooling systems of computers .
" It would be nice if you could , in a building , put these passive elements that carry heat around very effectively from a solar collector on the roof , to deliver heat all the way down through the building , " said study co-author Abraham Stroock in a press release .
Then you could " recycle that fluid back up to the roof the same way trees do it – pulling it back up . "
The study was published in Nature .

British Prime Minister Gordon Brown has told lawmakers that the global economic downturn was " likely to cause recession " in Britain .
" Having taken action on the banking system , we must now take action on the global financial recession , which is likely to cause recession in ... Britain , too , " Mr Brown said during his weekly questioning session in parliament .
A recession is defined as two consecutive quarters of negative economic growth .
Crucial data out Friday ( local time ) is expected to show that the British economy shrank in the third quarter after zero growth in the second .
His remarks come a day after Bank of England Governor Mervyn King said Britain was " likely " entering recession , with the credit crunch and high inflation combining to pose " the risk of a sharp and prolonged slowdown in domestic demand . "
Britain has had to nationalise two major domestic lenders as a result of the credit crunch and earlier this month unveiled a half - trillion - pound ( $ 1.2 trillion ) rescue package for the country 's banking system .
The country has also had a dispute with Iceland over billions of pounds of deposits by British individuals , local authorities and government agencies in collapsed Icelandic banks .

One does n't even have to read between the lines here , from a Crist fly - around the state :
Crist mentioned McCain at each of the three stops , but only fleetingly , devoting more time to candidates like Nancy Detert , running for an open state Senate seat in Sarasota .
Crist and Republican Party of Florida Chairman Jim Greer said McCain will win in Florida .
But Greer said the decisions made by the McCain campaign in Florida were being made separately from the state party .
" Sen. McCain 's campaign has utilized its own strategies that it 's developed and the party has provided as much assistance as possible to that particular strategy , " he said .
Asked about the divisive tone struck by McCain and running mate Sarah Palin in recent weeks , Greer said they were not representative of the RPOF 's efforts to focus on issues and policies .
" I think that Sen. McCain has to consider political strategies that are unique to his campaign and do n't necessarily reflect how the governor or I as chairman feel , " Greer said .
Crist was asked about the attacks from many McCain supporters that Obama is advancing a " socialist " agenda .
" I imagine different people have different definitions .
I do n't think it looks that way to me , " he said .

If one is the loneliest number , then four is the hottest — at least when it comes to gasoline .
With regular gas in New York City at a near - record $ 4.40 a gallon , station managers are rummaging through their storage closets in search of extra 4s to display on their pumps .
Many are coming up short .
That ’s why Vishal Nair , who runs the Lukoil station at Eighth Avenue and 13th Street in Greenwich Village , took another plastic number last week , turned it over and scribbled “ 4 ” on it with a black magic marker .
The result was an obviously homemade “ $ 4.47 , ” but it would have to do until he received the extra 4s he ordered months ago .
“ Typically , we have a lot of 9s and 1s , and we had a shortage of 3s before we got a lot of 3s in , ” Mr. Nair said .
The missing digits are an unanticipated barometer of how frequently prices are changing .
The average price of regular gasoline in New York City has risen by 35 percent this year , forcing station managers to change their price displays almost every time they get a delivery , which can be daily at some stations .
Hot damn , the public servants at the Lakewood office of the U.S. Minerals Management Service sure know how to party .
Blowjobs in moving cars , cocaine delivered to your desk as " office supplies , " drunken sexual misadventures with Big Oil executives , trips and tee times and other gifts from the energy sugar daddies they 're supposed to be auditing -- a whole passel of sordid allegations that can be found here , in the long - awaited reports from the Department of Interior 's inspector general on the gross mismanagement of MMS under the Bush administration .
The report found " a culture of substance abuse and promiscuity " in the Lakewood office under former supervisor Greg Smith , whose attorney has denied the allegations of Smith 's own drug use , sexual dalliances with subordinates and conflicts of interest .
But the " unbridled , unethical conduct " of a few local employees is only a small piece of the ongoing scandal at MMS , which is responsible for collecting royalties from energy leases on federal lands ; nearly a third of domestic oil production and a fourth of domestic gas comes from those leases .
The flip side of sleeping around with the energy folks is that MMS has been firing and demoting auditors who try to do their jobs -- something we reported on in detail in " Fighting Mad " and " Duke of Oil . "
The American public has lost billions in underpaid royalties from profit - gorged oil and gas companies in the past few years .
Under Bush , the MMS implemented a new " royalty - in - kind " program that was supposed to make the whole royalty process less adversarial and allow the energy companies to deliver barrels of oil instead of checks .
But that program , as former federal auditor Bobby Maxwell told Westword , depended on the RIK people doing their job .
And that happens to be the very division that Greg Smith ran , apparently into an ethical abyss .
Sadly , it took the drug - and - sex aspect to bring the case to national attention .
Although the royalty losses represent one of the biggest industry frauds on the government since the days of Teapot Dome , few media outlets ( aside from some sterling investigative work at the New York Times ) have paid much attention to the claims of Maxwell and other former auditors .
Maxwell was fired from MMS after pursuing a case against energy giant Kerr - McGee over $ 12 million in disputed royalty payments .
Maxwell subsequently won $ 7.5 million in a False Claims
Act case against the energy giant that he filed on his own , only to see the jury verdict dismissed on a technicality .
In a peculiar bit of timing , just as the report on the MMS scandal was being prepared for release , the Tenth Circuit Court of Appeals overturned the dismissal and sent Maxwell 's verdict back to the federal district court in Denver for further action .-- Alan Prendergast
MOSCOW ( Reuters ) - Russia could become a swing producer to influence global prices , the country ’s top energy official said on Wednesday as OPEC ’s Secretary General met with a Russian president for the first time .

The resurrection of a decade - old idea of a big oil reserve comes as another sign of Russia ’s growing ties with OPEC , which has unnerved global consumers already worried by talks between Russia , Iran and Qatar to create an OPEC - style gas group .
“ The Ministry of Energy is considering creating an oil production reserve , which would allow it to work more efficiently with prices on the market , ” said Russian Deputy Prime Minister Igor Sechin , who oversees the energy sector .
Asked how big the reserve should be , Sechin told reporters : “ Enough to reach efficient pricing parameters . ”
Russia is the biggest oil producer outside OPEC and the world ’s second - largest exporter after Saudi Arabia .
OPEC Secretary General Abdullah al - Badri , who arrived in Moscow on Tuesday for a two - day trip , met with Russian President Dmitry Medvedev to discuss the exchange of market data .
“ The reason ( for this meeting ) is absolutely obvious , ” state television channel Vesti 24 showed Medvedev as saying after the two met just outside of Moscow on Wednesday .
“ Russia is also a major producer and exporter of oil and is interested in maintaining stable , predictable prices . ”
Badri said he liked the reserve idea .
“ Russian reserves can help global oil shortages ...
This idea is good .
It is a technical matter .
We will have to discuss it , ” he said before meeting the Russian president .
The Russian economy grew for 10 straight years on the back of high oil prices .
But as prices have halved in the past months Russia ’s budget is at risk as it is balanced at $ 75 per barrel for 2008 and $ 95 for next year compared to around $ 60 for Russian crude now .
Russian companies badly need high prices to refinance their heavy debts and maintain ambitious capital projects .
Badri told journalists he was not interested in asking Russia for a cut in production .
Some top OPEC officials have this week called on Russia and other non-member states to join OPEC in cutting production .
The organization will hold an extraordinary meeting on Friday and is widely expected to reduce its deliveries to global markets .
Moscow agreed to reduce exports several times earlier this decade in tandem with OPEC , but analysts said the pledge never materialized as private companies raised shipments instead .
Russia has long toyed with the idea of an oil reserve , which could allow it to become a swing producer .
But the expensive and logistically difficult plan was never implemented as the government and private companies failed to reach a compromise .
If set up it will differ from emergency reserves created in the 1970s in some big consuming nations , such as the United States , which are used to soothe supply problems rather than influence prices .
The current oil production scheme in Russia does not allow the country to change its flows significantly as any well shut down in Siberia usually leads to its costly repair .
INVESTMENT CONCERNS
The head of the International Energy Agency ( IEA ) , attending the same industry conference as Badri , said he was worried by Russia ’s production outlook as the country heads this year for its first annual output decline in a decade .
“ We see worrying signs in some producing countries , including Russia , in the ability to invest enough to meet demand , ” said Executive Director Nobuo Tanaka of the IEA , adviser to 28 industrialized countries .
Oil production in Russia has been down by around one percent since the start of this year , leading the government to make exploration a top priority for the strategic oil sector .
“ We see Russian supply growth slowing , with all projects declining in production over the next decade .
Further government incentives would be welcome to increase production , ” he said .
Tanaka also said growing demand in robust emerging markets , such as China , could lead to a global squeeze on oil supply .
“ In the medium to long term , say by 2013 , a supply crunch may happen ...
If we stop investing now , the problem will be more acute , ” he told reporters .
The IEA hoped OPEC would not cut output at Friday meeting , he added .
“ We want to see more production , we want a cushion . ”
Russian oil firms have called on the government to ease taxes and slash export duties in November , one month earlier than planned , because of a steep price decline this month .
Sechin said the idea was being discussed but no decision had yet been taken .

Trying to keep up with Nicole Cooke 's performance is not a good idea
One of the aims of the Olympics is to raise interest in taking part in sports - but it seems some people are pushing themselves a little too hard .
A gadget helpline has been receiving calls from people wanting to know how to set their cycling and rowing machines to keep up with Olympians .
One man from Runcorn even admitted he had broken his rowing machine trying to keep up with Team GB .
Sports scientists said people should be aware of their personal limits .
There has to be a degree of realism and common sense
John Brewer , Lucozade Sports Science Academy Ben Titchmarsh , of the Gadget Helpline , says their role is to help people when devices such as phones or iPods fail - and that they do not cater for faulty exercise equipment .
But since the start of the Olympics , they have had around 50 calls from people wanting to keep up with the elite athletes they are watching on TV .
He said : " One woman said she really wanted to set her rowing machine so she could do the same number of strokes per minute as the Olympic athletes .
" She was obviously sitting in front of her TV and entering into the spirit of it all . "
He added : " Another caller wanted to adjust his exercise bike so he was cycling at the same number of miles per hour as the Olympians .
" And even though the track and field events had n't yet started , people were also asking about settings for their jogging machines .
" With rowing and cycling machines , if you can't keep up you 'll just go slowly .
But with jogging machines , if you set them to the pinnacle of what it 's capable of doing and you can't keep up , it could be dangerous . "
Aspirations John Brewer , performance director at the Lucozade Sport Science Academy in Slough , said it was great that people were being inspired by the Games .
" One of the reasons for London bidding for the 2012 Olympics is that we know events like the Olympics are aspirational and they make people want to take part .
" But there has to be a degree of realism and common sense about people 's ambitions .
" They have to be aware that the athletes they see on TV have a genetic endowment that means they can perform at the highest level and they have spent years dedicating themselves to improving their personal performance . "
He added : " For example runners in the women 's marathon on Sunday would reach speeds of 12 - 13 mph .
" That 's a phenomenal speed , and most people wo n't be able to keep up with it for more than a few seconds , let alone two hours . "
Sarah Hardman , a physiologist from the English Institute of Sport who has worked with Team GB 's rowing squad added : " It 's great that people are being inspired by the Games and the performances taking place across different sports , but each individual needs to know their limits .
" Olympic athletes have been in full time training for years and progressively work towards the standards they achieve .
" To avoid injuring yourself by overstretching , setting smaller targets for performance improvements in your fitness regime would be the best start in improving your exercise rates , whether that 's on the rowing machine , bike or on the treadmill . "

What are these ?
It 's a sordid tale of fascist intrigue by some of America 's most famous corporate and political families ( including members of FDR 's own party ) which was deliberately covered up by both the only Congressional Committee to investigate the plot , and also by the leading media outlets of the day including the .
And the truly scary part is that the plot might very well have succeeded if not for the bravery of a single , progressive leader :
The life of Smedley Butler is an uniquely American story .
A decorated soldier ( he was awarded the Congressional Medal of Honor twice ) and warrior who ascended through the ranks to become one of the most admired soldiers of his era , he also grew to deeply despise war , and to distrust the reasons he had been sent to fight in distant places .
As he stated himself in a speech he gave on August 21 , 1931 to an American Legion convention in New Britain , Connecticut :
" I spent 33 years ... being a high - class muscle man for Big Business , for Wall Street and the bankers .
In short , I was a racketeer for capitalism ....
" I helped purify Nicaragua for the international banking house of Brown Brothers in 1909 - 1912 .
I helped make Mexico and especially Tampico safe for American oil interests in 1916 .
I brought light to the Dominican Republic for American sugar interests in 1916 .
I helped make Haiti and Cuba a decent place for the National City [ Bank ] boys to collect revenue in .
I helped in the rape of half a dozen Central American republics for the benefit of Wall Street ....
" In China in 1927 I helped see to it that Standard Oil went its way unmolested .... I had ... a swell racket .
I was rewarded with honors , medals , promotions .... I might have given Al Capone a few hints .
The best he could do was to operate a racket in three cities .
The Marines operated on three continents ... "
Fortunately for those of us living today , the people he condemned in that speech must not have been aware of his beliefs , or if they were they must have told themselves he did n't mean what he said , because they selected him to be the leader of a military coup attempt by which they meant to supplant Roosevelt as President in all but name .
These plotters represented
some of America 's richest and most famous names of the time : * Irenee Du Pont - Right - wing chemical industrialist and founder of the American Liberty League , the organization assigned to execute the plot .
* Grayson Murphy - Director of Goodyear , Bethlehem Steel and a group of J.P. Morgan banks .
* William Doyle - Former state commander of the American Legion and a central plotter of the coup .
* John Davis - Former Democratic presidential candidate and a senior attorney for J.P. Morgan .
* Al Smith - Roosevelt 's bitter political foe from New York .
Smith was a former governor of New York and a co-director of the American Liberty League .
* John J. Raskob - A high - ranking Du Pont officer and a former chairman of the Democratic Party .
In later decades , Raskob would become a " Knight of Malta , " a Roman Catholic Religious Order with a high percentage of CIA spies , including CIA Directors William Casey , William Colby and John McCone .
* Robert Clark - One of Wall Street 's richest bankers and stockbrokers .
* Gerald MacGuire - Bond salesman for Clark , and a former commander of the Connecticut American Legion .
MacGuire was the key recruiter to General Butler .
They chose MacGuire as the point man to approach Butler with their proposal .
The plot would be funded by Dupont and Morgan money funneled through an organization they had recently created to oppose Roosevelt , the American Liberty League .
( The League was funded by donations from US Steel , General Motors , Chase Manhattan Bank , Standard Oil , Goodyear and the Dupont family , among others .
Not surprisingly , the League would later actively oppose almost every major piece of New Deal legislation , including , but not limited too Social Security ) .
Butler was supposed to be the " famous name " who would recruit an army of out of work war veterans to march on Washington .
It was thought that his popularity with the troops would make it easy for him to rally them to the cause of supplanting Roosevelt as the effective head of government .
As proposed ,
[ T ] hey wanted General Butler to deliver an ultimatum to Roosevelt .
Roosevelt would pretend to become sick and incapacitated from his polio , and allow a newly created cabinet officer , a " Secretary of General Affairs , " to run things in his stead .
The secretary , of course , would be carrying out the orders of Wall Street .
If Roosevelt refused , then General Butler would force him out with an army of 500,000 war veterans from the American Legion .
But MacGuire assured Butler the cover story would work : " You know the American people will swallow that .
We have got the newspapers .
We will start a campaign that the President 's health is failing .
Everyone can tell that by looking at him , and the dumb American people will fall for it in a second ... "
The businessmen also promised that money was no object : Clark told Butler that he would spend half his $ 60 million fortune to save the other half .
And what type of government would replace Roosevelt 's New Deal ?
MacGuire was perfectly candid to Paul French , a reporter friend of General Butler 's : " We need a fascist government in this country ... to save the nation from the communists who want to tear it down and wreck all that we have built in America .
The only men who have the patriotism to do it are the soldiers , and Smedley Butler is the ideal leader .
He could organize a million men overnight . "
Indeed , it turns out that MacGuire travelled to Italy to study Mussolini 's fascist state , and came away mightily impressed .
He wrote glowing reports back to his boss , Robert Clark , suggesting that they implement the same thing .
The plot collapsed when Butler went public in late 1934 and exposed the conspiracy .
The General revealed the details of the coup attempt in sworn testimony before the " McCormack - Dickstein " Committee ( the predecessor of the soon to be infamous " House Un- American Affairs Committee " :
This House committee was named after its chairman and vice chairman , John W. McCormack and Samuel Dickstein .
It was called the Special Committee on Un- American Activities Authorized to Investigate Nazi Propaganda and Certain Other Propaganda Activities .
In 1934 , it held public and private hearings in six cities , questioned hundreds of witnesses and collected testimony filling 4,300 pages .
Its mandate was to get " information on how foreign subversive propaganda entered the U.S. and the organizations that were spreading it . "
The committee did investigate Butler 's claims , and subpoenaed witnesses , including MacGuire , Butler 's main contact with the plotters .
Initially ,
MacGuire , not surprisingly , denied that such a plot existed .
Instead , he claimed his activities had been political lobbying to preserve the gold standard , but he quickly destroyed his credibility as a witness by giving contradictory testimony .
While the final report agreed with Butler that there was evidence of a coup d'état plot against Roosevelt , no further action was taken on it .
The Committee 's authority to subpoena witnesses expired at the end of 1934 , and the Justice Department started no criminal investigation .
So why , after concluding that the plot did indeed exist was no one prosecuted ?
Why were principals of the plot never even required to testify ?
It 's hard to say at this far remove .
Certainly it was n't because the individuals behind the coup attempt abandoned all hope of future success , as this letter , dated 1936 , from William Dodd , the U.S. Ambassador to Germany , to President Roosevelt makes clear :
" A clique of U.S. industrialists is hell - bent to bring a fascist state to supplant our democratic government and is working closely with the fascist regime in Germany and Italy .
I have had plenty of opportunity in my post in Berlin to witness how close some of our American ruling families are to the Nazi regime ....
A prominent executive of one of the largest corporations , told me point blank that he would be ready to take definite action to bring fascism into America if President Roosevelt continued his progressive policies .
Certain American industrialists had a great deal to do with bringing fascist regimes into being in both Germany and Italy .
They extended aid to help Fascism occupy the seat of power , and they are helping to keep it there .
Propagandists for fascist groups try to dismiss the fascist scare .
We should be aware of the symptoms .
When industrialists ignore laws designed for social and economic progress they will seek recourse to a fascist state when the institutions of our government compel them to comply with the provisions . "
Perhaps the naming of prominent Democrats , such as Al Smith and former Democratic Party Chairman Raskob , as members of the plot convinced the Roosevelt administration , not anxious to reveal dissent within its own ranks , to suppress the Committee report .
Perhaps MacGuire 's untimely death from pneumonia shortly after he testified led the Department of Justice to back away from any investigation .
Or perhaps the wealth and influence of the plotters themselves was simply too great .
What is abundantly clear , however , is that the Committee report was suppressed .
deleting extensive excerpts relating to Wall Street financiers including Guaranty Trust director Grayson Murphy , J.P. Morgan , the Du Pont interests , Remington Arms , and others allegedly involved in the plot attempt .
Even today , in 1975 , a full transcript of the hearings cannot be traced .
Suppression by the [ Committee ] took the form ofincluding Guaranty Trust director Grayson Murphy , J.P. Morgan , the Du Pont interests , Remington Arms , and others allegedly involved in the plot attempt .
Even today , in 1975 , a full transcript of the hearings cannot be traced .
* * * John L. Spivak , the reporter who unearthed the suppression in the Congressional transcripts , challenged Committee Co-chairman Samuel Dickstein of New York with his evidence .
Dickstein admitted that : the Committee had deleted certain parts of the testimony because they were hearsay . "
" But your published reports are full of hearsay testimony . "
" They are ? " he said .
" Why was n't Grayson Murphy called ?
Your Committee knew that Murphy 's men are in the anti-Semitic espionage organization Order of ' 76 ? "
" We did n't have the time .
We 'd have taken care of the Wall Street groups if we had the time .
I would have no hesitation in going after the Morgans . "
" You had Belgrano , Commander of the American Legion , listed to testify .
Why was n't he examined ? "
" I do n't know .
Maybe you can get Mr. McCormack to explain that .
I had nothing to do with it . "
The fact remains that the committee did not call Grayson Murphy , Jackson Martindell , or John W. Davis , all directly accused in sworn testimony .
Further , the committee deleted all portions of the testimony involving other prominent persons : J.P. Morgan , the Du Ponts , the Rockefeller interests , Hugh Johnson , and Franklin D. Roosevelt .
When Congressman Dickstein pleaded his innocence to John Spivak , it was inconsistent with his own letter to President Roosevelt , in which he claims to have placed restrictions even upon public distribution of the committee hearings , as printed , " in order that they might not get into other than responsible hands . "
The final report issued by the committee in February 15 , 1935 buried the story even further .
John L. Spivak sums up the burial succinctly : " I ... studied the Committee 's report .
It gave six pages to the threat by Nazi agents operating in this country and eleven pages to the threat by communists .
It gave one page to the plot to seize the Government and destroy our democratic system . "
What was even more distressing ( and eerily familiar to the our present situation ) was not just the failure of the press of that era to cover the story , but the active role they played in covering it up , even to the extent of scrubbing internal archives :
The role of leading newspapers and journals of opinion in reporting the Butler affair is equally suspect .
In fact , their handling of the event has the appearance of outright distortion and censorship .
The veracity of some major newspapers has been widely questioned in the last 50 years , and in some quarters the media have even been accused of a conspiracy to suppress " everything in opposition to the wishes of the interest served . "
Does such suppression extend to major news journals ?
We can take two prime examples ; The New York Times and Time magazine .
If such a combination as Callaway charges did exist , then these two journals would certainly be among " 25 of the greatest papers involved in the 1930s . "
The New York Times reporting of the " plot " opens up with a front - page headline article on November 21 , 1934 : " Gen. Butler Bares ' Fascist Plot ' to Seize Government by Force , " with the lead paragraph quoted above ( p. 143 ) .
This Times article is a reasonably good job of reporting and includes a forthright statement by Congressman Dickstein : " From present indications Butler has the evidence .
He 's not going to make any serious charges unless he has something to back them up .
We 'll have men here with bigger names than his . "
Then the Times article records that " Mr. Dickstein said that about sixteen persons mentioned by General Butler to the Committee would be subpoenaed , and that a public hearing might be held next Monday . "
The Times also includes outright and sometimes enraged denials from Hugh Johnson , Thomas W. Lamont , and Grayson M - P. Murphy of Guaranty Trust .
The following morning , November 22 , the Times made a major switch in reporting the plot .
The disclosures were removed to an inside page , although the testimony now concerned Gerald MacGuire , one of the accused plotters .
Further , a decided change in the attitude of the committee can be discerned .
Congressman McCormack is now reported as saying that " the committee has not decided whether to call any additional witnesses .
He said that the most important witness , aside from Mr. MacGuire , was Robert Sterling Clark , a wealthy New Yorker with offices in the Stock Exchange Building . "
While the Times reporting was consigned to an inside single column , the editorial page , its most influential section , carried a lead editorial that set the tone for subsequent reporting .
Under the head " Credulity Unlimited , " it contended that the Butler charge was a " bald and unconvincing narrative .
...
The whole story sounds like a gigantic hoax ... it does not merit serious discussion , " and so on .
In brief , before the 16 important witnesses were called , before the evidence was on the record , before the charge was investigated , the New York Times decided that it wanted to hear nothing about this story because it was a hoax , not fit to print .
The next day , November 23 , the Times changed its reporting still further .
The headlines were now about Reds and Red Union Strife and concerned alleged activities by communists in American trade unions , while the Butler testimony and the developing evidence were secreted deep within the reporting of Red activities .
The resulting story was , of course , vague and confused , but it effectively buried the Butler evidence .
On November 26 , the hearings continued , but the committee itself now had cold feet and issued a statement : " This Committee has had no evidence before it that would in the slightest degree warrant calling before it such men as John W. Davis , General Hugh Johnson , General James G. Harbord , Thomas W. Lamont , Admiral William S. Sims , or Hanford MacNider . "
It should be noted that these names had come up in sworn testimony , later to be deleted from the official record .
The Times pursued its reporting of this development in abbreviated form on an inside page under the head , " Committee Calm over Butler ' Plot ' , Has No Evidence to Warrant Calling Johnson and Others . "
On November 27 the Times reporting declined to five column inches on an inside page under the ominous head " Butler Plot Inquiry Not To Be Dropped . "
The December hearings were reported by the Times on a front page ( December 28 1934 ) , but the plot was now twisted to " Reds Plot to Kidnap the President , Witness Charges at House Inquiry . "
Reviewing the story of the Butler Affair in the Times 40 years after the event and comparing its story to the printed official testimony , itself heavily censored , it is obvious that the newspaper , either under its own initiative or under outside pressure , decided that the story was not to be made public .
Consistent with this interpretation , we find that The New York Times , the " newspaper of record , " omits the Butler testimony from entries in its annual index , depended upon by researchers and scholars .
The Times Index for 1934 has an entry " BUTLER ( Maj Gen ) , Smedley D , " but lists only a few of his speeches and a biographic portrait .
The Butler testimony is not listed .
There is an entry , " See also : Fascism - U.S. , " but under that cross- reference there is listed only : " Maj Gen S.D. Butler charges plot to overthrow present govt ; Wall Street interests and G.P. MacGuire implicated at Cong com hearing . "
The only significant Wall Street name mentioned in the index is that of R.S. Clark , who is reported as " puzzled " by the charges .
None of the key Morgan and Du Pont associates cited by General Butler is listed in the Index .
In other words , there appears to have been a deliberate attempt by this newspaper to mislead historians .
Now it 's true that this story has n't been completely forgotten .
There are websites that discuss the conspiracy ( some to which I 've already linked , and others which I 'll list at the conclusion of this diary ) , and a few people wrote books which at least mention the subject .
However , the only book that focuses exclusively on the fascist plot to oust President F.D. Roosevelt is now out of print : The Plot to Seize The White House ( New York : Hawthorne Books , 1973 ) by Julius Archer .
Soon after publishing this , Hawthorne Books went out of business .
Second - hand copies are now available for as much as $ 250 .
What 's to be learned from all this ?
The simple truth that those of us who see a corporatist conspiracy to manipulate and even " steal " our state and national elections , to influence at the highest levels the policies of our government , and to suppress or distort the news that the media reports are not as crazy as our opponents make us out to be .
Because IT HAS ALL HAPPENED BEFORE , and we were JUST DAMN LUCKY THE BASTARDS DIDN'T SUCCEED !
Eternal vigilance , my friends .
So endeth the lesson .

Was that promise last week another lie ?
Again , I challenge Mark Salter personally .
He called me crazy for asking questions about Sarah Palin 's alleged fifth pregnancy .
If you think questions are not worth asking , or based on nothing but partisanship and hate , please read this account of what is in the public records about it and make up your own mind .
I think the bizarre circumstantial evidence easily rises to the level of material that should be addressed - as presumably could be done definitively - by the campaign .
McCain chief aide , Mark Salter , said this about me to my colleague , Jeffrey Goldberg :
" This whole story about how the baby is n't hers ?
Jesus Christ .
Just crazy shit . "
Those are fighting words .
Is Salter man enough to back them up ?
Or is he a coward ?
If it 's such " crazy shit " , why has the McCain campaign not released the readily available documents that can prove it's " crazy shit " ?
Here 's what I wrote more than two months ago about the issue when the questions first emerged :
There must be plenty of medical records and obstetricians and medical eye - witnesses prepared to testify to Sarah Palin 's giving birth to Trig ...
So please give us these answers - and provide medical records for Sarah Palin 's pregnancy - and put this to rest .
Again , that was in August .
It is not an answer to call bloggers " insane " because they are asking factual questions to which there must be evidentiary answers .
( Yes , as Ed Morrissey notes , Biden , McCain and Obama have been bad on this as well , and this blog has criticized them for it , especially Biden where I 've been relentless , given his aneurysm history .
But only Palin has offered nothing at all .
And only Palin has a core question of basic credibility at stake .
Only Palin has used her medical history - her fifth child - as a campaign plank . )
We were told last week - finally - that Palin 's medical records proving her fifth pregnancy and birth would be forthcoming " early this week . "
I congratulated the campaign for some minimal transparency at long last , and looked forward to getting this whole sorry story blown out of the water before election day .
But Tracy Schmitt lied to us .
The question you have to ask is : why ?
Photographing water and ice presents unique challenges but also incredible opportunities to show off the myriad properties of water in its many forms – the reflectivity of pools , the transparency of ice , amazing color ranges and other curiously variable properties .
From the amazing beauty of water phenomena and formations to the chilling reality of water disasters , the use of HDR and / or tone - mapping brings a surrealistic element into play that can transform the look and feel of an ordinary waterscape in a variety of ways .
( image via Wolfgang Staudt )
HDR photography focusing on water almost inevitably involves other landscape elements as well , from a mountain peaking out from under its snow cap to the reflective water which we barely see at all as in the shot of the Saar River in Germany above .
This gallery shows off the interplay between water and surrounding natural and artificial elements , how it can blend in or contrast with , reflect and augment its surroundings .
This concludes week two of a four - week four - elements series , starting with the most beautiful of natural water phenomena and formations to the most devastating of natural water disasters .
Next week WebEcoist will feature three new articles revolving around air , from amazing air and cloud formations to terrible air and wind disasters and compelling air photography .
Paulson : Congress Has No Authority Here
" As with any contract , the parties to the agreement may modify the covenants by mutual agreement only . ''
- Treasury Secretary Hank Paulson
>
Hank Paulson 's God Complex just got bigger .
The Director of Government Bailouts , and head of the Socialism Departmant at Treasury has informed Congress to back off his turf .
" All your legislation belongs to us ! "
Now , last I checked , it was Congress that had the power of authorization disbursements , and that Treasury does not have the authority to spend 5.3 trillion dollars .
Comrade Paulson does not seem to understand the way the different branches of government work in the United states , and is apparently unfamiliar with a little parchment called the Constitution .
Perhaps we can get Ron Paul to explain how these things work to our friend from the People 's Republic of Goldman .
Bill King : " Hank is trying to euchre the market into believing that if Congress tries to change the law , the executive branch would then sue Congress for breach of contract .
Good luck with that at the Supreme Court . "
Nice try , comrade , but no such luck .
The issue here is authorization .
I cannot write a contract to sell you home , car , etc to a third party , without your authorization .
Otherwise , its fraud .
The party with the legal title and ability to convey those goods or services on the one side , or indebtedness or money on the other side of the transaction requires authorization .
The original Bazooka legislation did not give Treasury a blank check to do whatever they want .
A decision , for example , to add Fannie and Freddie to the budget " would n't automatically translate into explicit government backing for the companies ' combined $ 1.7 trillion in unsecured debt and $ 3.5 trillion of mortgage guarantees . "
To do so requires Congressional legislation to change the companies ' legal status .
That 's where any of the changes -- like reducing the absurd pay packages for the current idiots running Fannie / Freddie -- would come in .
Here 's Bloomberg 's excerpt :
" The U.S. Treasury said Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac 's debt and mortgage - backed securities are " protected ' ' by the government 's stock purchase agreement that put the mortgage finance companies under federal control .
" The holders of senior debt , subordinated debt , and mortgage - backed securities issued or guaranteed by these GSEs are protected by the agreement without regard to when those securities were issued or guaranteed , '' the Treasury said today , referring to the so - called government - sponsored enterprises .
The federal government took over the two largest sources of money for U.S. home loans on Sept. 7 , placing them under conservatorship and establishing procedures for buying their senior preferred stock if liabilities exceed assets .
The federal takeover did n't address whether the companies ' $ 5.2 trillion in debt should be included in the budget , or whether it carries an explicit government guarantee .
In an interview this week with Bloomberg Television , Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson cited " incongruities ' ' in the law , saying " we should be clear , is there a government guarantee or is n't there ? ''
I do not believe Treasury has purchased any stock yet , but that can change in an instant .
Long live Bailout Nation !

That is nothing new .
Some of the most popular websites are known for really bringing out the worst in people , but it seems to be getting worse .
Let me give you an example .
A girl in the UK found a black widow , an extremely venomous spider that generally lives in North America , in a bowl of grapes that had been bought in a local store .
The story became big on Digg.com , a popular Web 2.0 site where readers can vote for ( a digg ) or against ( bury ) a story .
The spider story quickly became a hit on the site , raking in more than 800 diggs in just about 24 hours .
Then the readers chimed in .
Posting responses to stories is part of the reason for Digg ’s popularity .
Many readers commented on how creepy the story was or discussed spiders in general .
But some of the responses were just rude .
Some people took to blasting the Daily Mail , which originally published the article , for not covering “ real news ” .
The girl who found the spider was called a con-artist and accused of looking to make a quick buck .
Then there was the person who just seemed miffed that some people do n’t like spiders and wrote , bad grammar and all , “ I signed in to burry this article … spiders exist get over it . ”
Read
Posted comments get subjected to voting too , which usually results in a name - calling contest .
If a comment is really unpopular , it can be voted right off the page .
Of course , there are no names attached to any of the comments , and these were just the ones “ fit - to - print ” .
If you want the really nasty stuff , go to the tech section .
Oddly , the political section , where I expected the real ugly mudslinging to be going on , was relatively civil .
The whole situation stinks though .
The internet used to be a great place to discuss ideas .
Now it ’s turning into a place where any discussion quickly turns into vicious , anonymous personal attacks .
Digg is n’t the only place where this type of incivility is common , although it ’s getting a reputation for being one of the worst .
Pick almost any website , forum , or blog that allows users to post anonymously , and you ’ll find this stuff going on .
There are many reasons , but one really stands out : anonymity .
It ’s no secret that people can and will say anything when there are no consequences .
Another reason seems to be age .
While anonymous users do n’t make it a habit of posting their date of birth , some people think these posts are coming from younger users , who enjoy engaging in behaviour that they would never dream of doing in front of their parents .
Maybe , but that does n’t cover everybody .
When Megan Meier , a teenager who used MySpace , committed suicide following a round of cyber - bulling in the United States , it was n’t her peers who where blamed .
Instead , federal prosecutors have accused the mother of one of Megan ’s friends .
Now , I may be mixing apples and oranges there .
Saying that extreme cyber - bullying is comparable to rude comments posted in chat forums may seem like a bit of stretch , but it all comes down to the same thing : cowardly and vicious people doing things they would never try without the benefit of an anonymous , online forum .
Picture Courtsey – Flame Warriors
Intel has recruited the Taiwanese government for its project to put a Linux stack on the Atom processor .
The chip maker announced today that it 's partnering with Taiwan 's Ministery of Economic Affairs ( MOEA ) to establish a " Moblin Enabling Center " to drum up developer support and interest .
Its investment arm is also sinking 386 m New Taiwan dollars ( US $ 11.7 m , £ 7.14 m ) into the WiMax technology carrier VMax , which plans to roll out Taiwan 's first nation - wide 4G WiMax network .
Moblin is a Linux stack designed to be fast and light for low - cost , low - power netbooks and nettops .
The Moblin lab will train and consult device and software vendors , which Intel hopes will mean more Moblin - based devices arriving sooner to market .
The company 's main contribution will be stocking the joint full of engineers .
" With a shared vision to accelerate mobility industry momentum , our collaboration with Intel positions Taiwan to further capitalize on opportunities created by the next phase of the Internet , " said Yiin Chi-Min , Minister of the Taiwan MOEA .
VMax is the 30th WiMax company to receive funding from Intel worldwide .
" With Intel Capital 's support , VMax intends to become the first - mover in bringing the benefits of high - speed wireless broadband to Taiwan , " said C.K. Liu , Vmax chairman .
" Vmax intends to be the first to deploy a 2.5GHz WiMax network in Asia Pacific . "
Intel said the WiMax service will be available in Taiwan in the first half of 2009 . ®
This seems to be a relatively common question on #zftalk nowadays , so here ’s a quick wrapup !
The traditional plain - PHP way
$ file = file_get_contents ( ' some.zip ' ) ; header ( ' Content - Type : application / zip ' ) ; header ( ' Content - Disposition : attachment ; filename= " some.zip " ' ) ; header ( ' Content - Length : ' . strlen ( $ file ) ) ; echo $ file ; $ file = file_get_contents (' some.zip ' ) ; header ( ' Content - Type : application / zip ' ) ; header ( ' Content - Disposition : attachment ; filename= " some.zip " ' ) ; header ( ' Content - Length : ' . strlen ( $ file ) ) ; echo $ file ;
The Zend Framework controller way
// this is inside an action in one of your controllers : $ file = file_get_contents ( ' some.zip ' ) ; $ this -> getResponse ( ) -> setBody ( $ file ) -> setHeader ( ' Content - Type ' , ' application /zip ' ) -> setHeader ( ' Content - Disposition ' , ' attachment ; filename= " some.zip " ' ) -> setHeader ( ' Content - Length ' , strlen ( $ file ) ) ; //
If using Zend_Layout , we need to disable it : $ this -> _helper -> layout -> disableLayout ( ) ; // Disable ViewRenderer : $ this -> _helper -> viewRenderer -> setNoRender ( true ) ; // this is inside an action in one of your controllers : $ file = file_get_contents (' some.zip ' ) ; $ this ->getResponse ( ) ->setBody ( $ file ) ->setHeader (' Content - Type ' , ' application /zip ' ) ->setHeader ( ' Content - Disposition ' , ' attachment ; filename= " some.zip " ' ) -> setHeader ( ' Content - Length ' , strlen ( $ file ) ) ; // If using Zend_Layout , we need to disable it : $ this -> _helper -> layout ->disableLayout ( ) ; //Disable ViewRenderer : $ this ->_helper->viewRenderer->setNoRender( true ) ;
In closing
As mentioned in the comments , this approach may not be suitable especially if you deal with very large files .
I recommend checking out this post about using mod_xsendfile with PHP , as it solves the issues associated with sending files “ manually ” through PHP .

zinniaはオンライン手書き文字認識が行えるため、 ユーザの不完全な入力(入力途中の文字)についてもある程度認識可能です。
S式による文字表現
文字クラス( zinnia_character_t / zinnia:: Character ) の座標情報 はS式形式の文字列として設定することができます
( character ( width キャンバス幅 ) ( height キャンバス高さ ) ( strokes ( ( 0画目x 0画目y ) ... ( 0画目x 0画目y ) ) ( ( 1画目x 0画目y ) ... ( 1画目x 1画目y ) ) ( ( 2画目x 2画目y ) ... ( 2画目x 2画目y ) ) ... ) )
例
static const char sexp [ ] = " ( character ( width 1000 ) ( height 1000 ) ( strokes ( ( 243 273 ) ( 393 450 ) ) ( ( 700 253 ) ( 343 486 ) ( 280 716 ) ( 393 866 ) ( 710 880 ) ) ) ) " ; zinnia_character_t * character = zinnia_character_new ( ) ; zinnia_character_parse( character , sexp ) ;
static const char sexp [ ] = " ( character ( width 1000 ) ( height 1000 ) ( strokes ( ( 243 273 ) ( 393 450 ) ) ( ( 700 253 ) ( 343 486 ) ( 280 716 ) ( 393 866 ) ( 710 880 ) ) ) ) " ; zinnia :: Character * character = zinnia :: Character :: create( ) ; character -> parse ( sexp ) ;
文字の学 習
学習には、学習させたい文字とそれに対応するストローク情報が必要です。
学習データは以下のようなS式で記述します。1つの文字に複数のストローク情報
があっても問題ありません。一般的にデータが増えれば増えるほど認識精度が向 上します。Zinniaはバッチ学習のみをサポートします。
S式フォーマット
( character ( value 認識したい文字 ) ( width キャンバス幅 ) ( height キャンバス高さ ) ( strokes ( ( 0画目x 0画目y ) ... ( 0画目x 0画目y ) ) ( ( 1画目x 0画目y ) ... ( 1画目x 1画目y ) ) ( ( 2画目x 2画目y ) ... ( 2画目x 2画目y ) ) ... ) )
例
( character ( value あ ) ( width 300 ) ( height 300 ) ( strokes ( ( 54 58 ) ( 249 68 ) ) ( ( 147 10 ) ( 145 201 ) ( 182 252 ) ) ( ( 224 103 ) ( 149 230 ) ( 82 240 ) ( 53 204 ) ( 86 149 ) ( 182 139 ) ( 240 172 ) ( 248 224 ) ( 228 250 ) ) ) ) ( character ( value い ) ( width 300 ) ( height 300 ) ( strokes ( ( 56 63 ) ( 43 213 ) ( 67 259 ) ( 94 243 ) ) ( ( 213 66 ) ( 231 171 ) ( 208 217 ) ) ) ) ( character ( value う ) ( width 300 ) ( height 300 ) ( strokes ( ( 102 35 ) ( 187 45 ) ) ( ( 73 121 ) ( 167 105 ) ( 206 139 ) ( 198 211 ) ( 135 275 ) ) ) ) ( character ( value え ) ( width 300 ) ( height 300 ) ( strokes ( ( 140 19 ) ( 162 38 ) ) ( ( 62 105 ) ( 208 100 ) ( 51 263 ) ( 128 205 ) ( 188 268 ) ( 260 252 ) ) ) ) ( character ( value お ) ( width 300 ) ( height 300 ) ( strokes ( ( 64 94 ) ( 240 98 ) ) ( ( 148 35 ) ( 159 129 ) ( 140 199 ) ( 105 247 ) ( 64 228 ) ( 101 161 ) ( 192 161 ) ( 222 223 ) ( 189 257 ) ) ( ( 223 49 ) ( 253 89 ) ) ) )
例として zinnia - tomoe の中にある *.s ファイルをご覧ください 。
ファイルが準備できたら、zinnia_learn コマンドを使い、学習を行います。
% zinnia_learn train - file model - file ... learning : ( 8/3033 ) 8 .... learning : ( 9/3033 ) 9 ... learning : ( 10/3033 ) 々 ............ learning : ( 11/3033 ) 〆 .... learning : ( 12/3033 ) あ .... learning : ( 13/3033 ) い ....... learning : ( 14/3033 ) う ............... learning : ( 15/3033 ) え ...................................................................................... learning : ( 16/3033 ) お ...... learning : ( 17/3033 ) か ....... learning : ( 18/3033 ) き ....... learning : ( 19/3033 ) く .......
train - file が学習データ 、model - file がモデルファイルです 。
学習が正常かどうかテストを行います
% zinnia -m model - file < test - file
model - file は学習後にできあがったモデル、test - file は S式で書かれたテス ト ファイルです。学習データそのものをテストしたい場合は、test - file を学習デー タにします 。
学習後 , model- file.txt ( テキストファイル ) と model - file ( バイナリファイル ) が作成 されます。テキストファイルはアーキテクチャに非依存の形式、model-fileは
アーキテクチャに依存したモデルファイルです。zinniaの認識エンジン ( Zinnia : : Recognizer ) はバイナリ形式のみを受け付けます。別のプラットホーム 上にバイナリモデルをポーティングする場合は、ターゲットのマシンで txt ファイルからバイナリファイルに変換を行います 。
% zinnia_convert model - file.txt model- file
また、テキストモデルをCのヘッダに変更することも可能です
% zinnia_convert --name=my_model --make_header model-file.txt my_model.h
ヘッダファイルを使う場合認識エンジン側では、my_model.h を includeし、 zinnia_recognizer_open_from_ptr ( ) を使ってモデルをロードします。 my_model( モデルの実態 ) と my_model_size ( モデルのサイズ ) が my_model.h に 定義されています )
#include " my_model.h " if ( !zinnia_recognizer_open_from_ptr( recognizer , my_model , my_model_size ) ) { /* error */ }
モデルの圧 縮
絶対値の小さい重みを省略することで、認識精度を犠牲にしながら、モデルを不可逆圧縮することができます。
% zinnia_convert -c 0.01 model- file.txt model1 % zinnia_convert -c 0.001 model - file.txt model2 % ls -h - l model * - rw -r--r-- 1 taku taku 3.1 M 2008-07-14 12:50 model1 -rw-r--r-- 1 taku taku 25 M 2008-07 - 14 12:50 model2
c は重みの閾値です。デフォルトは 0.001 です。 大きく設定するとよりアグレッシブに圧縮を行います。実行環境に応じて圧縮率を選択してください。

Brad Pitt announced Wednesday that he ’s donating $ 100,000 to fight California ’s Proposition 8 , a November ballot initiative that would eliminate same - sex couples ’ right to marry .
“ Because no one has the right to deny another their life , even though they disagree with it , because everyone has the right to live the life they so desire if it does n’t harm another and because discrimination has no place in America , my vote will be for equality and against Proposition 8 , ” the actor said in a statement .
Pitt ’s donation marks the largest thus far to the anti-Prop.
8 campaign by an A - list celebrity .
Political strategist Chad Griffin , who is helping coordinate efforts in the entertainment industry to defeat the controversial initiative , said he is hopeful that the move will prompt others to get involved .
He added that Democratic billionaire Ron Burkle has agreed to host a large fundraiser at his home in October to rally the entertainment industry against Prop. 8 , which opponents say will take away important benefits such as health insurance and will complicate decision - making related to medical emergencies and other situations in domestic partnerships .
In recent weeks , tens of thousands of dollars -- much of it from outside California -- has been donated to groups on both sides of the issue .
The measure was placed on the ballot after the California Supreme Court invalidated the state ’s prohibition on same - sex marriage in May .

The original vote was defeated 228-205 , meaning a whopping 58 members changed their minds and voted for the bill .
I 'm sure they got an ear full from constituents over the past week or so .
Unsurprisingly , Boehner was still unable to deliver half his caucus .
It 's pretty funny to see House Republicans run around claiming to be acting on true conservative principles .
Where the hell have you all been for the past eight years of George Bush ?
The Hill :
The House has approved a massive Wall Street bailout four days after rejecting a similar measure .
The measure was approved in a 263 to 171 vote , with 172 Democrats and 91 Republicans offering support .
The House voted against a similar measure on Monday , which caused the Dow Jones Industrial to plunge by 778 points — the greatest single - day drop in the average ’s history .
Wall Street 's reaction is tepid , with the Dow gaining about 120 points so far .
The other indices both rose a little more than 1 % .

SAN FRANCISCO -- Today at a flashy media event in San Francisco , LucasArts and BioWare announced development of the PC massively multiplayer online role - playing game Star Wars : The Old Republic .
Though ostensibly suspenseful , the unveiling 's thunder was stolen this past July by John Riccitiello , CEO of BioWare parent Electronic Arts .
Speaking to a business - oriented magazine , the executive casually confirmed that , yes , BioWare was working on a massively multiplayer online role - playing game set in the Star Wars : Knights of the Old Republic Universe .
However , Riccitiello 's comments -- which were n't officially corroborated until today - - were unsurprising even then .
Whispers of a KOTOR MMOG began back in March 2006 , when BioWare opened a satellite studio dedicated solely to an unnamed massively multiplayer online role - playing project .
Leading the new operation were James Ohlen , lead designer of the original KOTOR , and Richard Vogel , former vice president of product development at Sony Online Entertainment , developer of the only current LucasArts MMORPG , Star Wars Galaxies .
The fact the studio was in Austin , Texas - - home of SOE 's Austin shop , which is the developer of Galaxies -- only heightened suspicions that the BioWare game was Star Wars - related .
A year and a half later , speculation reached stratospheric levels when BioWare and LucasArts announced they were collaborating on a " next - generation entertainment product . "
Since the only joint ventures between the Edmonton , Alberta - based developer and the San Francisco , California - based publisher had been the two KOTOR games , it seemed likely the new project would be a follow - up of some kind .
Now that cat is officially out of the bag , as GameSpot sat down with the architects of the forthcoming MMORPG to find more about the The Old Republic .
Lead designer
Ohlen discussed what will set it apart from other MMORPGs , and its head writer Daniel Erickson explained how it will implement story in a way never seen before in the massively multiplayer space .
LucasArts executive producer Tom Nichols talked about working with BioWare - - and how SW : TOR will not be replacing Star Wars Galaxies .
Finally , BioWare cofounders and EA vice presidents Greg Zeschuk and Ray Muzyka laid out the game 's origins and ambitions -- and why they wanted to get into the cutthroat MMORPG space in the first place .
The Jedi class will serve the battered Republic …
A not so long time ago , in a studio somewhat far away …
When Star Wars : Knights of the Old Republic debuted in July 2003 , it was an instant sensation .
It sidestepped the controversy surrounding the Star Wars prequels by introducing a new era set 4,000 years prior that was packed with Jedi Knights and a whole army of their nemeses , the Sith .
Using BioWare 's trademark in - depth dialogue system , the game let player 's choices in individual situations build up to a permanent alignment with either the Dark or the Light sides of The Force .
At times , the dilemmas were deliciously agonizing , such as when , right at the game 's climax , a player was forced to chose between killing an Obi-Wan Kenobi-esque father figure or a romantic interest made all the more tempting by the Dark Side .
Besides receiving critical accolades -- including being named GameSpot 's 2003 Role- playing Game of the Year -- KOTOR went on to sell nearly 1.3 million units domestically on the original Xbox and over 500,000 units on the PC .
Its success spurred a sequel , Star Wars Knights of the Old Republic II : The Sith Lords , which sold more than 1.275 million units in the US on the Xbox ( 2004 ) and PC ( 2005 ) .
Developed by Obsidian Entertainment , the independent studio formed by some of the team behind the first two Fallout games , KOTOR II got solid marks from reviewers .
However , it came under some criticism when it was discovered the game 's story had been truncated to make a holiday release window .
Ironically , it was the tales that KOTOR II left untold which sparked development of The Old Republic .
Not long after the PC edition of the sequel hit stores in 2005 , BioWare approached LucasArts with a pitch for what would be their biggest collaboration yet .
" This project originated a couple years ago when BioWare spoke up and said , ' Hey , we 'd love to do another project with you guys , ' " explained Nichols .
" We were thinking about working on new , additional projects in the online space , and Galaxies was three or four years old , and we started to look into the future about what we might want to do in the MMO genre .
And I think the timing was pretty serendipitous that way , since BioWare wanted to work with us , they wanted to do an MMO , and they had a lot of experience playing MMOs .
They wanted to bring some of their learning and aspects of their gameplay - - namely storytelling -- into MMOs , and we were looking to reapproach the genre with a major partner . "
Muzyka was equally enthusiastic .
" Doing an MMO is something we 've wanted to do for probably over a decade , " he said .
" We wanted to wait until we had the right partners , the right team , and the right IP . "
… while Sith serve the resurgent Empire .
Calling The Old Republic the " right " IP may be an understatement .
EA said one of the main reasons it shelled out $ 860 million for BioWare / Pandemic was so it would co-own the then - unnamed MMORPG , touted as a competitor to Activision Blizzard 's mega- successful World of Warcraft .
Ironically , the EA purchase has allowed BioWare to collaborate with the developers of the fastest - growing MMORPG on the market .
" We 're actively consulting with EA Mythic and are huge fans of Warhammer Online , " say Muzyka .
" They 've got lots of great technology and lots of great people and ideas .
They 're great people to talk to about making an awesome MMO experience , and we 're definitely looking to them for inspiration . "
KOTOR 3 MIA…WTF ?
While the cash - minting potential of The Old Republic has executives salivating , many BioWare fans were disappointed the series did n't return to its single - player RPG roots .
" There are a lot of reasons why we decided not to do KOTOR 3 , and why we decided to do this as an MMO instead , " said Nichols .
" The unique aspect of storytelling , which is really differentiated for this game , is something the KOTOR franchise did very well , and we felt that just doing a single - player experience with a new KOTOR really misses the opportunity to take this out to a much wider audience . "
" One of the things we like to joke about is just the sheer amount of content we 're doing , " Ohlen mused .
" Our fans ask , ' Why are n't you doing Knights of the Old Republic 3 ? '
What we 're really doing is Knights of the Old Republic 3 , 4 , 5 , 6 , 7 , 8 , 9 , 10 , 11 , and 12 - plus .
We have that much content and that many stories …
We really get to do a lot of things we really would n't get to do in [ a ] KOTOR 3 . "
Ohlen is in a unique position to make such an assessment .
Described as " the most important guy at BioWare no one has ever heard of " by insiders , Ohlen has been a lead designer on virtually every game the studio has produced , including Baldur 's Gate , Neverwinter Nights , and the original Knights of the Old Republic .
Now , as lead designer of The Old Republic , he is overseeing what he is n't afraid to say is BioWare 's most ambitious project ever .
Tython , the Jedi Homeworld , seems a pastoral place .
" The biggest challenge for this game is the sheer amount of content you have to create , " boasted Ohlen .
" This is a HUGE game .
Just to give you an idea of how huge this game is , we were taking a look at it , and it has more story content than every single other BioWare game that 's come before put together .
That would mean Baldur 's Gate , Baldur 's Gate II , Neverwinter Nights , Neverwinter Nights II , Knights of the Old Republic , Knights of the Old Republic II , Mass Effect -- and all the expansions . "
Currently , the Old Republic has 12 full - time staff writers who are " cranking out " content , some for as long as two years .
The Fourth Pillar
So what is the setting for this massive epic ?
The Old Republic takes place 300 years after the events of the original Knights of the Old Republic games , or about 3,600 years before the events of the films .
While story elements from the first two games will " definitely play a role , " much has changed since the end of KOTOR II .
The old Sith Empire , which had been banished into deep space after nearly being exterminated by the Galactic Republic , has reemerged .
Its return came in the form of a massive sneak attack by its huge fleet reminiscent of the Cylons ' fiery return in Battlestar Galactica .
A brutal war ensued , which saw the Sith 's elite armies conquer dozens of worlds in the Outer Rim and sack the Republic 's capital planet Coruscant .
Pacifist factions within the Republic forced the signing of a treaty , leading to a fragile peace across the galaxy .
Those same factions blamed the Jedi for the Republic 's drubbing by the Sith , forcing the relocation of the decimated Jedi Council from Coruscant to Tython , the Jedi's homeworld .
As the game begins , the interstellar Cold War is thawing , and players will find themselves at ground zero as a new conflict begins to flare up .
" Players get to come in and take the roles of heroes -- or villains -- at this pivotal moment where we 're starting to go back into a big galactic war , " promised Erickson .
Korriban , the ancestral Sith world , is not so welcoming .
Like other MMOs , The Old Republic will have two factions -- the Galactic Republic and the Sith Empire .
Though led by respectively benevolent and malevolent leaders , the two sides will be home to characters of morally varying stripes .
" There 's a lot more people than Sith and Jedi in the Empire and the Republic , so one of the things that became important to us is that we separate the idea of faction and good and evil , " said Erickson .
" Light Side and Dark Side is not the same as faction .
In the original KOTOR , you could be Dark Side , even though you worked for the Republic .
Here , just because you 're in the Empire [ faction ] , does n't mean you have be Dark Side .
You can play as the good guy in the bad place trying to do good things or the bad guy in the good place trying to do bad things . "
Indeed , BioWare went to great lengths to make the ostensible villains sympathetic , going into the LucasFilm and LucasArts archives and researching the Great Hyperspace War for background on the Sith .
" The Sith were literally chased out of the galaxy by the Jedi , " explained Erickson .
" You had an entire culture and people who were pushed out of known space .
So you get these guys who come back and have a big chip on their shoulder .
So if you 're playing on their side as a good guy , you 're not going to just go run over to the Republic , because the Republic tried to wipe out your entire people . "
Erickson hopes such background will make the Sith Empire more compelling than the evil factions of other MMORPGs .
" These [ Imperials ] are actual people , " he said .
" They do n't get up in the morning and say , ' What can we do that 's evil today ? '
They have to have a legitimate point of view .
You have to believe when you 're playing that the things you 're doing make sense and be proud of where you are . "
Nichols agreed that having strong dramatic underpinning is what will set the Old Republic apart from competitors such as World of Warcraft .
" What 's really missing [ in other MMOs ] is context -- why you 're doing all these missions , why you 're on this quest , why you 're out killing 10 wolves , " he asserted .
" So story puts that in the context , and gives you a much more immersive experience where you 're really building a stronger relationship with your online character than you would without it . "
These Tython mining droids do n't like trespassers .
Not one bit .
However , do n't get the idea that BioWare and LucasArts are n't respectful of what MMOs like WOW have accomplished .
" We 're huge fans of MMOs and have played just pretty much everything else out there , " said Muzkya .
" We really appreciate the things that make great MMOs great .
There 's great exploration , there 's combat , there 's [ character ] customization and progression .
The Old Republic has all those things .
It 's got those pillars .
But what we 're adding is a fourth pillar , a pillar of story and character , of meaningful choice with consequences .
You get to experience your personal life story , your history as a character . "
Narrative - based gameplay
Indeed , BioWare is confident that The Old Republic 's story will focus on character and affect gameplay like no other MMORPG before .
" Because our stories revolve around a player 's class , his role , we 're able to tell stories that are very focused on who the player is , which is something other BioWare games have n't been able to do , " explained Ohlen .
Ohlen went on to explain that each of the game 's two factions will contain various classes , each with its own unique backstory .
So far , the only classes confirmed are the Jedi and Sith , which will allow players to wield lightsabers and force powers " very early on , " versus well into the game as was the case with the first KOTOR .
( The game summary also describes another possible class , the Republic Special Forces , " elite troopers [ which ] work often in conjunction with the Jedi . "
Concept art for the game also features assassin droids like the gleefully homicidal HK - 47 from the first KOTOR , but it was unclear if they would be companions or playable classes . )
A Republic Special Forces trooper takes a shot at foes on Tython .
Besides the back stories , each class will also have its own branching storyline , which will be affected by players ' moral choices as in other BioWare games .
However , unlike in single - player RPGs , Old Republic players have no fail - safe when presented with an agonizing choice .
" The big difference , and what makes it so impactful when you 're playing it , is you have no save button , " said Erickson , a borderline sadistic glint in his eye .
" One of the ways people have traditionally played BioWare games is by saying ' Oh my god , that 's huge ! ' and quickly saving .
" Then you reload and say ' Oh , that would 've happened !
That 's exciting !'
Well guess what , you 're how many dozens of hours in … [ and ] that decision is going to make huge ramifications that are going to affect [ you ] for hours and hours .
And you have to make it , and you have to live with it .
That really puts an impact onto choices and story that 's much stronger than we 've ever been able to do in a game … During our testing , you can tell when these moments were happening , because you 'll see people leaning back from their keyboards , wringing their hands . "
Such trepidation is understandable , given that a player 's choices will permanently open and close storyline options -- and their included quests -- and affect non-player characters ' reactions .
This latter factor is especially important , since players will have NPC companions as in the first two KOTORs .
" You 'll have dialogue with them and start building relationships with them , " said Nichols .
The interactions with companion NPCs will also open up new options , as they did in Mass Effect and other BioWare games , not all of which will be welcome .
" Piss them off enough , and they may leave , and say ' Screw this , I 'm outta here ! ' " joked Nichols , channeling his inner Eric Cartman .
Indeed , Zeschuk believes the options offered by the Old Republic are unique in the massively multiplayer genre .
" You really can't overestimate the impact of choice in the MMO space , where choice is something that , in many ways , does n't really exist .
You get a quest and you do your quest .
You can't say , ' Well , I 'm going to do something different , ' or change your mind , or manipulate a character into having a different result .
But that 's what we 're talking about [ with SW : TOR ] .
It offers a degree of choice that has n't really ever been there before . "
This NPC companion has a face only a bounty hunter could love , but sports a versatile wardrobe .
Loose lips sink starships ?
Though effusive about how story would affect players in The Old Republic , both BioWare and LucasArts were reticent when it came to hard gameplay details .
However , interviews and press materials did provide some information .
The Old Republic game will feature " dozens " of worlds inhabited by players , including Coruscant , Tython , and Korriban , the Sith homeworld .
Other planets mentioned in the announcement include Alderran , Utapau , Agamar , Dathomir , and Manaan , though their role in the game is unclear .
Some planets will be dominated by one faction , while others will be the sites of skirmishes that are flaring up on the Empire - Republic border .
Though reps would not confirm it explicitly , these contested worlds seem a likely spot for player - versus - player battles , which both LucasArts and BioWare reps emphasized would be a major part of The Old Republic .
" It will have all the features you 'd expect in a triple - A MMO , " promised Nichols , including guilds and " plenty of other socialization options . "
The Fate of Galaxies
The amount of energy , resources , and enthusiasm being thrown at The Old Republic raises one obvious question :
What about Galaxies ?
LucasArts was emphatic about the fact that there 's enough room for two viable Star Wars MMORPGs to co-exist .
The ol ' Sith standby Force Choke will be back .
" We 're looking to continue to support Galaxies with high - quality updates on into the future , " said Jake Neri , producer for LucasArts ' online division .
" We 're focused on a chapter release around Hoth , where we 're re-creating the battle at Echo Base .
We 'll allow players to get in groups and jump in and just participate in a very high - quality battle .
We 've just released a trading card game inside of Galaxies , and fans are eating it up .
Looking into next year , we 're going to revamp our droid system with something called droid commander . "
Neri also said that SOE Austin was working in conjunction with LucasArts on further additions to Galaxies for years to come , with no end to the game in sight .
That said , Nichols is confident that the lessons learned from Galaxies ' checkered history will be applied to The Old Republic .
" What we can bring to the table is our experience with the brand , " he said .
" We can bring our knowledge of what 's worked and what has n't [ worked ] with Star Wars , and what 's popular with Star Wars fans .
We can bring elements to BioWare and say ' Hey , we know what works here and what does n't , and let 's see if we can kind of work together to kind of tweak this a little bit and tweak that . '
And that 's how the collaborative partnership is working . "
Launch date TBA , console versions TBD
Last week , Dragon
Age was confirmed as coming to the PC early next year and to the 360 and PS3 later that holiday season , casting The Old Republic 's 2009 target window into doubt .
Indeed , LucasArts and BioWare have now backed away from the previously attributed launch window , which was first proffered in a 2007 Information Week interview .
They apparently grow 'em big and ugly in the Old Republic …
" When the content and the quality is there , that 's the sign we 'll be ready to go , " said Nichols .
" We 're gonna make sure we take the right amount of time to make sure it 's awesome , " seconded Muzyka .
" At the same time , we 're part of Electronic Arts , so we 're committed to delivering a great experience for our fans , who are eager to play like we are . "
When the possibility of a console version came up , the infamous wall of BioWare secrecy was raised .
" The PC version is all we 've talked about so far , " was the most Zeschuk would say .
However , the executive was effusive -- even ebullient -- about the challenge The Old Republic presents for BioWare .
" I 'd say this is definitely our biggest project yet , " Zeschuk declared flatly .
" We 've worked on a lot of games -- Mass Effect was a big game , and Dragon Age is a big game .
But Star Wars : The Old Republic is just plain huge .
And what makes it huge is not only that it 's Star Wars - - which means it 's got to be epic -- but [ in ] the MMO space , we 've got something to prove .
This is our first game in that space , and there 's some really great competition , and we want to stand out …
Ultimately in the MMO space , more than any other , you really have to nail it .
There 's a real high bar in that space now . "
NEW YORK ( CNNMoney.com ) -- Washington Mutual had its credit rating lowered to junk Monday by Standard & Poors amid continuing weakness in the housing market .
The action follows downgrades of the nation 's largest savings - and - loan by Fitch Ratings and Moody 's last week as WaMu tries to reassure nervous investors that it has the ability to survive the credit crunch .
" Increasing market turmoil and the related impact from managing its concentrated mortgage franchise in this troubled housing and credit cycle led to the downgrade of WaMu , " said Victoria Wagner , an S&P credit analyst , who lowered the bank 's rating to BB - with a negative outlook .
Last week , Fitch Rating lowered WaMu ( WM , Fortune 500 ) to BBB - with a negative outlook , while Moody 's took it down into junk territory with a Baa3 rating with a negative outlook .
S&P 's announcement follows another brutal day for the bank on Wall Street .
Shares plummeted nearly 27 % to close at $ 2 .
Investors are concerned that potential sources of capital have disappeared in the upheaval this weekend on Wall Street that saw Lehman Brothers ( LEH , Fortune 500 ) file the nation 's largest bankruptcy and Bank of America ( BAC , Fortune 500 ) scoop up Merrill Lynch ( MER , Fortune 500 ) .
After this weekend 's turmoil , however , WaMu has fewer places to turn if it needs another injection of capital beyond the $ 7 billion it raised in April .
No one stepped in to save Lehman and Bank of America will now be busy digesting Merrill .
Meanwhile , JPMorgan Chase ( JPM , Fortune 500 ) and Goldman Sachs ( GS , Fortune 500 ) are reportedly trying to arrange $ 75 billion in loans for troubled insurer American International Group ( AIG , Fortune 500 ) .
WaMu is one of the largest players in the mortgage market , which brought it prosperity during the housing boom and may lead to its downfall during the bust .
Seeking to reassure investors , the bank said late Thursday that it had sufficient capital and liquidity to see it through these tough times .
It reported that it plans to set aside $ 4.5 billion in the quarter for loan losses , down from $ 5.9 billion in the prior period but more than two times expected charge - offs , or uncollectable loan losses .
Reserves for loan losses should build to $ 10.3 billion , up from $ 8.5 billion .
The growth of net charge - offs is expected to slow to less than 20 % in the quarter .
In the prior period , charge - offs soared nearly 60 % .
The bank said it expects its capital ratio , a measure of its ability to withstand loan losses , to remain " significantly above the levels for well - capitalized institutions . "
It has about $ 50 billion of liquidity from " reliable " funding sources .
Analysts had mixed reaction to the report .
Fitch Ratings and Moody 's subsequently downgraded WaMu , concerned about its ability to raise capital , while other analysts voiced concerns about depositors ' reactions .
" The biggest risk for WM is a run on deposits , " said Chris Brendler , analyst with Stifel Nicolaus & Co . " With all the negative headlines and recent IndyMac failure , WM 's retail deposit franchise is a huge concern to us as a significant outflow of consumer deposits could lead to devastating liquidity problems since the company has apparently already lost access to the capital markets . "
But some analysts said the results should restore some confidence in the company .
They were heartened by the fact that the company feels it can put less aside for loan losses .
Even in downgrading the stock , S&P said it recognizes that the company has enough liquidity to meet all its fixed obligations through 2010 and is operating with enough capital from a regulatory perspective .
Other analysts agreed .
" Although not out of the woods yet , WM appears to be moving in the right direction on credit and 2008 is likely to be the peak year for provisioning , " Fox - Pitt Kelton analysts wrote in a note to clients .

Today Bush literally said : “ Yeah , this is a big price tag , cause it ’s a big problem .
I told my people that I do n’t want to be timid in the face of a significant problem that ’ll affect the average citizen . ”
In that same spirit , the public needs to respond to the fact that the United States has become nothing more than one continuous “ immediate crisis ” constantly on alert for threats of all kinds , but which responds only to the needs of the private corporate elite : while consigning the needs of ordinary working people to the trash - heap !
Our failed leader has left out some key points in his most recent proposals that need to be considered : POINT 1 , is that this country is no longer a Republic we are a corporation that is still in bankruptcy , which is why we can not now just declare bankruptcy !
“ The UNITED STATES GOVERNMENT CORPORATION went BANKRUPT in 1933 .
They MUST renew the bankruptcy every 70 years .
It was renewed in 2003 .
So it ’s already been bankrupt for over 70 years which is why everything is such a mess .
The U.S. Government became the US GOVERNMENT CORPORATION via the Act of 1871 .
The result is that even our elections have been a complete sham and scam .
The American people believe the system goes something like this , because it is what we have been taught in school ( and ) essentially brainwashed to believe . ”
( 1 ) POINT 2 , is that the government is also lying about the urgency of this crisis , it does not “ have to be addressed this instant . ”
In fact ‘ the problem has not happened yet . ’
What is relevant is that Bush & Cheney have decided to create a pre-emptive financial attack upon the people of the USA , in order to crush dissent , before opposition to their plans can get organized .
“ With truly extraordinary speed , opinion has swung behind the radical idea that the government should commit hundreds of billions in taxpayer money to purchasing dud loans from banks that are n’t actually insolvent .
As recently as a week ago , no public official had even mentioned this option .
Now the Treasury , the Fed and congressional leaders are promising its enactment within days .
The scheme has gone from invisibility to inevitability in the blink of an eye .
This is extremely dangerous .
The plan is being marketed under false pretenses .
Supporters have invoked the shining success of the Resolution Trust Corporation as justification and precedent .
But the RTC , which was created in 1989 to clean up the wreckage of the savings - and - loan crisis , bears little resemblance to what is being contemplated now .
The RTC collected and eventually sold off loans made by thrifts that had gone bust .
The administration proposes to buy up bad loans before the lenders go bust .
This difference raises several questions .
The first is whether the bailout is necessary .
In 1989 , there was no choice .
The federal government insured the thrifts , so when they failed , the feds were left holding their loans ; the RTC ’s job was simply to get rid of them .
But in buying bad loans before banks fail , the Bush administration would be signing up for a financial war of choice .
It would spend billions of dollars on the theory that preemption will avert the mass destruction of banks .
There are cheaper ways to stabilize the system . ”
( 2 ) POINT 3 , involves the actual status of the USA , or any other country , as a nation state today .
There are literally hundreds national flags still flying in the world – but the only ‘ countries ’ that matter now are the privately owned corporate states that have taken over everything already .
We must resist or we shall be sentencing ourselves to meaningless impoverished lives of torture , shame , and needless death at the hands of the same people that have caused this so called ‘ crisis ’ in the first place .
POINT 4 , is that the same people that created this phony fiscal emergency still have their jobs .
If this were real , then the first order of the day , for the nation and the world , would have been to fire the head of the Treasury and the SEC , at a minimum , but that was never contemplated because they are part of the pre-emptive strike and are needed to steal our money , reward the thieves and criminals and then leave us with the bills for all of it - without bothering to tell the public what exactly they will use the money for , or how much this will actually cost the public - nevermind the fact that like the Iraq War , there could well be no end in sight for this hijacking of the entire financial system of the USA !
( 3 ) This goes all too well with the other surprises that were forced on Americans for political purposes :
The lie of Pearl Harbor ; the lie of the Gulf of Tonkin Incident ; the lies about 911 and all that flowed from that ; and of course the lies about Weapons of Mass Destruction in Iraq ­ that ’s quite a lot of history to be associated with : Especially when the last three mega-lies are directly associated with the same people who were also never fired , and who like Kissinger and Rumsfeld and Rove and dozens of others are still active in American policy today !
We need serious investigations beginning with 911 and moving on from there : but none of this will happen once Americans are permanently saddled with the kind of debt that is now being proposed for the backs of every American citizen , except of course for the elites who will become even more fabulously wealthy over this latest mega- lie !
On top of everything else , according to Citizens for Legitimate Government Bush is now asking for dictatorial control over all of this : “ Bush administration seeks ‘ dictatorial power unreviewable by the third branch of government , the courts ’
20 Sep 2008
The Bush administration asked Congress for unchecked power to buy $ 700 billion in bad mortgage investments from U.S. financial companies in what would be an unprecedented government intrusion into the markets . ”
Unreviewable decisions by a US president , amounts to making GWB into a King , not unlike the King George whom the American colonists rebelled against !
POINT 5 : If this plan gets the green light ; then what will happen to our retirement plans and to social security may end up looking a lot like what happen to the Australians who have already done this .
“ Governments at every level , federal , state and local , are warning of severe cuts to spending on social programs , basic services and infrastructure .
In New South Wales , the most populous state , it has been revealed that local councils have lost hundreds of millions of dollars by sinking funds into complicated , high - risk investment products , and are preparing to slash spending on essential projects , including roads .
A recent report found that NSW councils had a combined exposure to collateralized debt obligations and capital - guaranteed products of $ 1 billion .
Before Lehman Brothers collapsed , some 24 councils had been considering a class action against the corporation .
At the same time , millions of people are seeing their retirement funds decimated .
Over the past two decades , ordinary working people have been compelled by the compulsory superannuation scheme introduced by the previous federal Labor government to take cuts in real wages and divert money into giant superannuation funds , all of which have been caught up in speculating on the financial markets . ”
( 4 ) And finally why not force the US ‘ government ’ to prove their case : demand that they show us that their “ BAILOUT ” will even work .
And if their plan does not work , then what is their plan for that eventuality ?
In times of a real crisis what is needed above all are calm and determined individuals , not the overly hyped - up babblings of a Paulson or a Bush .
What is needed is a clean slate of players in the financial sphere of everything to do with our money ?
The FED bears major responsibility for every monetary crisis going back to 1913 and yet Bush wants to turn all this over to them , where no questions will ever be considered !
Above all , the public whom this grand charade is supposedly all about , will not only get nothing but more debt from the “ BAILOUT , ” but the people will be burdened to the point of slavery for at least the next fifty years .
This entire fraud needs to be dissected , studied and verified by people other than those who got us into this in the first place !
The USA is not what it used to be in any aspect , but if even a shadow of this country is to remain , then the people who this government is suppose to serve must be heard from !
Unemployment is at 27 % and climbing , working people are in a Depression , and the candidates are dithering around mumbling about gestures : they need to face questions from the people that are reasoned , thought - out and audible before a national audience !
Tough to do given that ‘ the media ’ is the formal mouthpiece for these same corrupt pretenders all the way down the line .
But ‘ creative people ’ might find a way , if it really matters to them !
Bush says he “ refuses to be timid in the face of ( this ) significant problem . ”
So if that ’s good enough for the lame - duck in the Oval Office , it ought to be good enough for more Americans !

Tortoise from Volcano Wolf on the island of Isabela in the Galapagos .
An extinct giant tortoise could make a comeback now that living turtles in the Galapagos Islands have been confirmed as hybrid descendents .
Researchers had previously scratched their heads over the group of mixed - ancestry tortoises living on the island of Isabela in the Galapagos .
But the connection to the extinct species only clicked after they compared the genetic makeup of living tortoises with DNA taken from museum specimens of the giant tortoise that once lived on the island of Floreana .
" The [ living tortoise ] samples were collected in 1994 , but we had no idea what was in there because we did n't have Floreana data , " said Gisella Caccone , an evolutionary biologist at Yale University in New Haven , Conn .
" OK , now we have genotypes for 15 to 25 animals from the museums , so we did the analysis and boom ! "
Geochelone elephantopus , the Floreana species , is one of four giant tortoise species that have disappeared over the past 150 years , although 11 other giant tortoise species live on in the Galapagos Islands .
Even Charles Darwin observed the shrinking number of Floreana tortoises during his Galapagos visit , 15 years before the species vanished from Floreana .
Whaling ships and buccaneers that sailed the Galapagos waters in the 18th and 19th centuries used tortoises to replenish food supplies , harvesting more than 250,000 , according to logbooks .
Other tortoises ended up slaughtered so that their fat could be burned in oil lamps .
However , the same humans unwittingly helped ensure that the Floreana tortoise lived on as hybrids .
Ships heading out to the rich whaling grounds often dropped off their tortoise loads on the harsh volcanic island of Isabela , in the Galapagos .
The Floreana tortoises lived there and interbred with other giant tortoises to produce the hybrids that baffled researchers years later .
Caccone said that the " alien " group of tortoises could allow researchers to resurrect the extinct Floreana tortoise by selective breeding , if enough hybrid tortoises still live on Isabela .
" We have the possibility , a remote one , to do some assisted breeding like a ' Lazarus ' or ' Phoenix ' project , " Caccone told LiveScience .
For that , the researchers need more money and a better idea of how many giant tortoises live on Isabela .
Caccone plans to head back to the island and survey her shelled subjects in December .
The current study is detailed in the Sept. 23 issue of the journal Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences .

Patrick McGlinn
Attorney Grievance Commission
234 W. Congress , Suite 256
Detroit , MI 48226-3259
PERSONAL AND CONFIDENTIAL
Re : Grievance Administrator as to Sheldon R. Waxman
AGC File No. 3146/07
Dear Mr. McGlinn :
It is unfortunate that the Commissioners chose to impose a warning in this case but I do not regret the arguments I made in the Schiff appeal .
I do accept the warning because it does not constitute an adjudication of misconduct , nor any cost imposition .
However , I want the record to reflect that I categorically deny each of the following :
( 1 ) .
That I “ attempted ” to file a “ frivolous ” Supplemental Brief in the Irwin Schiff appeal in the U. S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit . ( 2 ) .
That I committed “ conduct prejudicial to the administration of justice ” .
MCR 9.104 ( A ) ( 1 ) . ( 3 ) .
That I committed “ conduct that exposes the legal profession or the courts to obloquy , contempt , censure or reproach ” .
MCR 9.104 ( A ) ( 2 ) . ( 4 ) .
That I committed “ conduct that is contrary to justice , ethics , honesty or good morals ” .
MCR 9.104 ( A ) ( 3 ) . ( 5 ) .
That I committed “ conduct that violates the standards or rules of professional responsibility adopted by the Supreme Court .
MCR 9.104 ( A ) ( 4 ) .
I will never again represent anybody charged with a tax violation .
Thereby , I will never again risk being in the position I find myself .
The “ deck is stacked ” by a corrupt Federal judiciary in cases involving the insidious , regressive and unconstitutional Internal Revenue Code , which is a big part of the economic problems in which we find ourselves .
Those who resist the IRS and the Tax Division of the Department of Justice are imprisoned after “ Judge Roy Bean ” hijack trials .
Irwin Schiff , who denounced the IRS , and whom I consider a personal friend , received the most unfair trial I ever witnessed in 43 years of law practice .
In my opinion , he should be treated as a true American hero .
He predicted the economic chaos we are undergoing .
See his book , “ The Federal Mafia ” , if you can find a copy because it was banned by the same 9th Circuit Court that sanctioned me .
Unfortunately , he had a delusional belief that the Federal Courts and a Federal jury would agree with him .
If he had been allowed to present his defense to the jury he may well have been acquitted .
The Federal judge made sure the jury would not hear Schiff ’s defense because it was “ frivolous ” .
The Court of Appeals followed suit .
All I did was to attempt to present Schiff ’s defense on appeal to show what the defense would have been had it been allowed .
This is a perfectly proper appellate argument when confronted with a fundamentally unfair trial .
The Court of Appeals did n’t like that .
Therefore , they tagged me — the lawyer , as “ frivolous ” .
If it has ever been otherwise , it is certainly now true that it is appropriate to sanction lawyers who represent those with the courage to stand up against the wrath of the Federal apparatus .
Divide lawyer and client and tag the lawyer with the stigma of “ frivolousness ” is the rule in Federal Courts .
I should be lauded , instead of vilified for representing the highest standards of an American lawyer .
I became a dangerous person to the establishment when , as an Assistant U.S. Attorney .
I “ blew the whistle ” on the FBI ’s involvement in the murder of Fred Hampton , Black Panther Party leader in Chicago .
The story is found in two of my books : “ In The Teeth of The Wind — A Study of Power and How to Fight It ” and “ The Black Messiah Murders ” .
I appeared before the House Ways and Means Committee and The Senate Finance Committee to protest the income tax .
The only good “ tax plan ” is the repeal of the onerous Internal Revenue Code and its replacement with a modern tax system .
I appeared before the Joint Committee on Taxation to protest an IRS campaign to eliminate Independent Contractors for tax purposes , which resulted in the enactment of the Safe Harbor Test .
And I represented many tax protestors in Federal criminal tax cases .
It would be humorous , but for the serious consequences which resulted , that I am still considered a danger to the Federal Judicial Establishment because it has been over 24 years since I last represented a tax protestor .
For the last few years , my income has been mostly limited to Social Security Retirement , which is ironic , since I alleged the bankruptcy of the System in a Tax Court case in 1974 .
Additionally , my wife receives disability payments and I handle some indigent criminal cases for Van Buren County .
It is again with regret that I will not be able to air my defense before a panel of unprejudiced colleagues , as I feel that no fair panel of lawyers would find me guilty of any improper conduct .
I would have fought this to the last possible tribunal , if I was younger and in a better financial situation , .
However , at my age , I do not need to bear the cost nor the mental aggravation involved in litigating this matter further .
Please make this letter part of the record in this case .
Cordially ,
Sheldon R. Waxman

For indispensable reporting on the coronavirus crisis , the election , and more , subscribe to the Mother Jones Daily newsletter .
In her third media interview ( first two : ABC and People magazine ) , Sarah Palin talked Wall Street with Sean Hannity .
The Fox News host wanted some answers on the current economic upheaval :
HANNITY : How connected is it , though , to Washington ?
You have 354 lawmakers got money from Fannie and Freddie .
354 .
If you look at the years from 1989 to 2008 , second - top recipient was Senator Barack Obama .
Should there be an investigation in terms of the relationship between the political donations and then of course the bankruptcy that ensued and the impact on the economy ?
PALIN : I think that ’s significant , but even more significant is the role that the lobbyists play in an issue like this also .
And in that cronyism — it ’s symptomatic of the grade of problem that we see right now in Washington and that is just that acceptance of the status quo , the politics as usual , the cronyism that has been allowed to be accepted and then it leads us to a position like we are today with so much collapse on Wall Street .
That ’s the reform that we ’ve got to get in there and make sure that this happens .
We ’ve got to put government and these regulatory agencies back on the side of the people .
Set aside the fact that she says nothing of substance about the economy or conditions on Wall Street .
She says , “ even more significant is the role that the lobbyists play in an issue like this …
the cronyism that has been allowed to be accepted and then it leads us to … so much collapse on Wall Street . ”
There ’s some confusing language in there but when you filter it out you get one inescapable conclusion .
Sarah Palin blames Wall Street lobbyists for a major part of the financial industry ’s “ collapse . ”
If that ’s the case , why does she let 83 Wall Street lobbyists work for her campaign ?
McCain and Palin are slamming the “ greed ” of Wall Street and its lobbying pals on a daily basis , saying that they are hurting average Americans .
Would n’t you think McCain and Palin owe it to those average Americans to keep the lobbyists in question off the campaign payroll ?

F or nine months , I ’ve been interviewing Rupert Murdoch , in an unlikely spirit of openness precipitated by his great satisfaction in having bought The Wall Street Journal , about journalism , his business , politics , his family , and the future for a new biography .
I was warned about his charm by many other journalists — warned not to fall victim to it .
So the surprise was his lack of it .
He ’s without introspection and self - analysis and does n’t like to talk about the past .
What ’s more , he mumbles terribly ( and with a heavy Aussie accent ) and seldom finishes a sentence .
For the first three months of our interviews , he never addressed a word to or even looked at my research assistant , Leela de Kretser , who was at each of the sessions , and ignored her questions — perhaps because it ’s not necessary to acknowledge a girl , or possibly because it was embarrassing for him that she was , at the time , a pregnant girl .
( She had the baby .
He eventually warmed up . )
But his odd lack of seductiveness or felicitousness — contributing to his aura of villainy — became after a while alluring in itself .
There ’s no spin , because he really can’t explain himself .
Rather , what you see is what you get .
He ’s transparent .
The nature of the beast is entirely evident .
One morning when Leela and I arrived at Murdoch ’s office for another interview session , we found the 77 - year - old News Corp. chairman and C.E.O. hunched over the phone reporting out a story .
He ’d been out the night before and gotten a tip .
Now he was trying to nail it down .
His side of the conversation was straight reporter stuff :
Who could he call ?
How could he get in touch ?
Will they confirm ?
Barked , impatient , just the facts .
Here was the old man , in white shirt , singlet visible underneath , doing one of the same basic jobs he ’d been doing since he was 22 , having inherited the Adelaide News in Australia from his father .
And he was good at it .
He was parsing each answer .
Re-asking the question .
Clarifying every point .
His notepad going .
He knew the trade .
Of how many media - company C.E.O. ’s could that be said ?
This was n’t a destroyer of journalism — this was a practitioner .
On the other hand , he was trying to smear somebody .
At the dinner party he ’d attended — since his marriage to Wendi Deng , he ’s become an unlikely fixture at fashionable tables — he heard that a seniormost Hillary Clinton operative was a partner in an online porn company .
He did n’t like the operative , did n’t like — no matter how much he had tried — Hillary Clinton .
So it did n’t much matter that the story itself seemed far - fetched and tenth - hand .
It was juicy and would slime somebody he thought was … a slime .
True , it did n’t pan out — and , to his credit , that was the end of it .
Well , sort of .
Because he kept recycling it .
While it did not end up on the * Post ’*s “ Page Six , ” it became a staple in Murdoch ’s repertoire of whispers and confidences and speculations .
Rupert Murdoch does n’t need to print or broadcast the news to make it … news .
He may be among the biggest gossips in New York .
In the months of interviewing him , I found that the most reliable way to hold his interest was to bring him a rich nugget .
His entire demeanor would change .
He ’d instantly light up .
He ’d go from distracted to absolutely focused .
Gossip gives him life ( and business opportunities ) .
This , I believe , is how the rumor about Michael Bloomberg ’s buying The New York Times got legs .
I offered it to him as a bit of speculation — conflating two of his favorite subjects , Bloomberg , whom he greatly admires , and the Times , which he does not — that a Bloomberg - Times deal could be possible .
He paused , considered , opened his mouth , seemed blissed out for a second , processed this information against his own needs and interests … and then said , “ It makes sense .
I think I ’ll ask him . ”
And suddenly the rumor was everywhere — he was telling everybody , which made it true .
The mayor ’s people seemed to like the rumor so much that they began to talk it up themselves .
Bloomberg himself seemed to fancy it ( offering only a tepid denial ) and , Murdoch thinks , could act on it .
As tempting as it may be for atheists to focus our efforts on facilitating de-conversion among religious believers , the costs of such efforts may exceed the benefits .
Direct challenges of religious belief , while undeniably cathartic , may even solidify believers ' resistance to reality .
Perhaps it is time to consider devoting at least as much attention to a very different kind of atheist outreach , one that focuses on a vital but often neglected portion of our own community .
If secular activism is to succeed , we need far more secular activists than we currently have .
And while there are a number of obstacles to overcome in getting there , I think it might make sense to devote more effort to opening dialogue with the millions of apathetic atheists in our midst .
Few like to admit it , but we all know that the number of atheists passionately engaged in secular activism of any kind is minuscule compared to the overall number of atheists .
We know that most atheists do not read atheist - oriented blogs , are not members of secular organizations , and do not regard themselves as being part of any sort of atheist movement .
To top it off , post- election polls conducted in the United States often reveal that the religiously unaffiliated vote at a lower rate than evangelical fundamentalist Christians .
It is important to recognize that atheists who do all of these things are a tiny minority within a tiny minority .
I would n't go so far as to claim that this is the only reason our accomplishments have been limited , but I suspect it has to be at least part of the explanation .
At least in the short - term , it seems as though our success in accomplishing the goals most of us share ( e.g. , protecting separation of church and state , strengthening secular public education , etc. ) might depend as much on de-converting our fellow atheists from apathy as on de-converting our religious neighbors from religion .
It is not necessary for every atheist to be involved in secular activism , but I think we need more than we currently have .
It is also not necessary for every atheist who is involved in secular activism to be involved in the same ways or to the same degree .
But again , I think it is clear that we need more atheists who are involved in at least some way .
What might outreach designed to encourage secular activism among atheists look like ?
What should we be doing more of ( or less of ) to reach the apathetic atheists and help them be a bit less apathetic ?
Here are a few things that have occurred to me so far :
Every atheist content creator has at least some apathetic atheists in their audience .
Thus , we already are communicating with some of them .
Apathy is easier to overcome when one perceives one 's efforts as effective or part of something valuable .
It is easier to motivate people to take action when the sort of action required is easy , cheap , quick , and low - risk ( e.g. , online petitions , contacting elected officials , etc. ) .
Raising awareness in general is valuable , but issue - specific education can be helpful in persuading people why they should care about a particular issue and what they can do about it .
Protecting anonymity is likely to be helpful for many apathetic atheists .
We need to find more ways they can contribute without having to publicly identify themselves as atheists or secular activists .
Undoubtedly , there are many other considerations for how to turn more apathetic atheists into contributing secular activists .
We need to make secular activism more welcoming and more relevant to more people .
We need to expand the range of activities that fall under the umbrella of secular activism and recognize that even small actions are better than no actions .
We need to recognize how destructive infighting can be in small diverse communities like ours and be better about not getting sucked into it .
Most of all , I think we just need to add this kind of atheist outreach to our to - do lists and not forget about it .
An early version of this post appeared on Atheist Revolution in 2008 .
It was revised and expanded in 2020 .
Just days after the QuebecTorrent BitTorrent tracker was taken down by an injunction in a blaze of publicity , a near identical clone of the 108,000 + member tracker has appeared out of nowhere .
Allegedly the product of the old team , Torrent411.com is up and running with 109,000 + members - and counting .
Last week we reported on the final chapter of the QuebecTorrent story .
After a long legal battle against 31 Canadian media organizations , the administrator decided that rather than fight and lose , it would be better not to mount a defense at all .
After receiving a permanent injunction ordering the closure of the site , QuebecTorrent closed its doors for the last time having amassed an impressive 108,805 members .
Many people are drawn to BitTorrent news as it can be both exciting , confusing , intriguing and amazing all at the same time .
Today we can report on a story which has all of these elements .
Seemingly out of nowhere appears Torrent411.com .
Dubbed “ The Torrent Yellow Pages ” , this site will have the Canadian recording industry – ADISQ and CRIA et al – tearing out its hair out today .
Hosted in Malaysia , from a standing start it already has 109,006 members , which is a couple hundred more than QuebecTorrent .
In fact , all of the QuebecTorrent user accounts have been transferred there – plus all the ratio stats and pretty much everything else .
Adding insult to injury , categories that were removed on QuebecTorrent in a failed attempt to avoid legal action in Canada , have now returned .
“ No censoring blacklists will be tolerated on the site ! ” claim the Torrent411 admins .
It ’s hard to imagine a bigger kick in the teeth for the media industry than this .
A notice on the homepage reads :
Welcome to one and all !
It is with great pleasure that we launch the Torrent 411.com site today .
All the team of Torrent411.com wishes you the most cordial of welcomes !
Here you will find all the torrents imaginable which will be for you for thousands ofÂ ’ hours to come !
Filled with surprises that await you !
Of course , Sebastien BrÃ»lotte , aka ‘ Doditz ’ the ex-administrator of QuebecTorrent , is abiding by the terms of his injunction to the letter .
He assured us that he had no part in the creation of the new site and this is backed up the admin team at Torrent411 : “ All the members of theÂ ’ team behind QuebecTorrent.com were preserved , except for late Doditz , our old Admin , who by court order could not join us . ”
One area where the sites are n’t quite identical is the number of peers currently being tracked .
Of course , to comply with the injunction QuebecTorrent is currently tracking zero peers but already there are instructions on Torrent411 ’s homepage to get the site ’s old torrents working – either a simple edit of the .torrent file ’s ‘ announce url ’ to match the format on Torrent411 – or users can simply re-download matching torrents from the site and use those instead .
NEW YORK ( Reuters ) - The U.S. dollar tumbled , hitting multiweek lows against the euro and against sterling on Monday as the U.S. government ’s bailout plan to ease a financial credit crisis reignited worries about the country ’s massive budget deficit .

The $ 700 billion package , which is awaiting congressional approval , would give sweeping powers to the U.S.
Treasury to buy mortgage - related bad debts from financial firms , including U.S. subsidiaries of foreign banks .
But analysts say foreign investors will be increasingly reluctant to finance the growing U.S. deficit at the current dollar exchange rate and that funding the gap would require higher interest rates and a weaker currency .
“ Nobody knows what form the bailout package will take .
We only know vaguely how much it will cost , ” said Ron Simpson , director of currency research at Action Economics in Tampa , Florida .
The U.S. fiscal position “ does not look pretty for this year and next ...
Overall , the uncertainty is driving the current flight out of the dollar , ” he added .
In late afternoon trading in New York the euro was trading at three - week highs of $ 1.4837 , up 2.5 percent on the day , putting the European currency on track for its biggest one - day gain since its inception in January 1999 .
Sterling also benefited from dollar selling , climbing as high as $ 1.8643 .
It was last trading at $ 1.8615 , up 1.6 percent on the day .
The Congressional Budget Office has forecast a record U.S. budget shortfall of about $ 438 billion in the next fiscal year , excluding the cost of the bailout .
The rescue package is expected to raise the government ’s debt ceiling 6.6 percent .
Against the Swiss franc , the dollar fell more than 3 percent to last trade at 1.0703 francs , according to Reuters Dealing .
Analysts also raised questions about the ultimate form of the government ’s proposed $ 700 - billion solution to the credit squeeze and how the illiquid and damaged assets held by banks will be valued and taken onto the government ’s books .
The scope of the Treasury ’s bailout plan could be extended from covering only mortgage - related assets to other troubled assets , potentially including credit card and loan debt , they said .
UNCERTAINTY WEIGHS ON DOLLAR
“ This could significantly increase the initially proposed cost of the program and expose the government ’s balance sheet and thus the taxpayer , to even greater uncertainty , ” wrote Sacha Tihanyi , associate currency strategist at Scotia Capital in Toronto .
“ This uncertainty should continue to weigh on the performance of the dollar going forward , and possibly depress international demand for U.S. assets . ”
Some analysts , however , lauded the U.S. government plan , saying they believed that the Treasury had to act to prevent worsening turmoil in financial markets .
The market may be too fixated on the amount of growth of the government ’s debt , but may be underappreciating the fact that the government is also taking on assets , says Marc Chandler , head of global strategy at Brown Brothers Harriman in New York .
“ We recognize the genuine concerns about the trajectory of U.S. fiscal policy , ( but ) we think that although the U.S. dollar gets punished in the short term because of the bold and innovative approach by U.S. policy - makers , the U.S. will be rewarded in the medium term for the same reason , ” he said .
Adding to the list of significant developments following the Lehman Brothers collapse last week , Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley were granted approval on Sunday to become banking holding companies regulated by the U.S. Federal Reserve , enabling them to take deposits and gain easier access to financing as they fight for survival in the current credit turmoil .
Apologies for the delay in posting about this .
I was enjoying the fantastic Ajax Experience and jQuery Camp out in Boston , where I got a chance to hang with my jQuery compatriots as the huge Microsoft and Nokia announcement broke .
Now that I 'm back , I want to talk about the cool new features we 've been adding to Merb 's server .
Let 's take a look at them one at a time :
When a Merb server boots up and tries to bind to existing ports , it does n't crash .
Instead , it waits for each port to become available and binds when they do .
As a result , you can start up a new merb , and then gracefully kill the old one .
This should make restarting clusters of merbs significantly less painful , and with almost no downtime .
Merb 's clusters have been rewritten to take advantage of Ruby Enterprise Edition , which makes it much easier to share memory between workers in a Merb cluster .
Using Ruby Enterprise with Merb 1.0 should yield around the same 30 % memory improvement that Phusion Passenger yields .
Merb clusters are now controlled by a master process , which can be told to gracefully kill all of its children , or reload the application code ( but not init.rb or gems ) .
Sending an INT to the master process ( directly or via merb - K all ) tells each of the worker processes to gracefully die .
Sending a HUP to the master process tells each of the worker processes to gracefully die , but to start up a new cluster with reloaded code .
This bypasses reloading Merb , gems , and init.rb , so the restart is much quicker than doing a full reload .
This is also the same internal code used by development mode code - reloading , which has now been made 100 % foolproof .
Killing a worker process ( either via INT , which is graceful , or KILL , which is n't ) will cause a new process to be respawned instantly .
We 're talking basically no time at all , since no code needs to be reloaded ( the spawner process forks right before binding to a port )
All of these improvements are just harbingers of even more improvements , making Merb 's master process even more powerful and smart .
The most important thing to keep in mind is that Merb has been significantly tuned for Ruby Enterprise , and with regular Ruby , there is a bit of overhead for the master processes .
All of the features above will work correctly with standard Ruby , but you 'll get them for free ( memory - wise ) , as well as quite a bit of improved memory overall in a cluster by using Ruby Enterprise .
Please please please check it out .
I just read this story over at The Consumerist , and I ’m floored .
Apparently a man picking up HIV medication at a Philadelphia CVS was called a “ Fucking AIDS freak ” by a CVS employee .
I ’ve had my own experience with bad mannered customer service , but this is really astonishing .
Although , I am from Philadelphia and can attest that my city is , generally , a city with a bad attitude , especially in the areas surrounding downtown .
My advice to J , the person who wrote to The Consumerist , is to escalate the complaint .
Companies rely on their customers .
Customer service is paramount to all businesses , and if something like this got public , CVS would be badly damaged .
So I say continue , do n’t let it drop , write letters and emails to the CEO , and more importantly , to news organizations .
The more light that is shed on this situation , the more likely it is to never happen again .
You can find the entire post after the jump :
Here ’s J’s full email , for those of you who want a more detailed story :
In what has been one of the most horrifying experiences of my entire life , I have had a dreadful recent encounter at my local CVS .
Ironically one of the other worst customer - service related mishaps I ’ve ever had was at a CVS as well , though not the same one …
I was in my local CVS in Philadelphia getting my partner ’s prescription filled .
We are a gay male couple and my partner is HIV +.
The medication , Atripla , is HIV related .
We are both currently on a medicaid - related health insurance plan , a situation that is new to us and directly related to his current health issues .
I had in hand a coupon from the local paper that awarded me a $ 20 gift card if I transferred a prescription to CVS .
I had actually used the coupon the day before for another prescription , as it says you can do use it multiple times ( just not on the same day . )
On this particular day they were having a very hard time getting through to the other pharmacy to put the transfer through .
The staff was also particularly snide and unpleasant ; more so than usual , at any rate .
After the fiasco of getting the actual transfer put through , when the young man attempted to ring me up and process my coupon , something went wrong in the computer .
Another employee came by to try and figure things out , and they determined that the coupon was not acceptable for those with Medicaid .
I got a little agitated because they were n’t being particularly polite about it , and I tried to explain that I was n’t specifically on Medicaid proper , but on a related plan .
I also pointed out that I had just used the same coupon the day before .
They then called over another young man who was apparently a manager .
His actual position in the store is still up for debate ; he appeared to be a front - of - store manager who was doing some work in the pharmacy area .
He walked into the situation with an extremely aggressive attitude .
He would n’t allow me to actually SAY anything or discuss the situation with him , and it was clear he was taking an “ I know what I ’m talking about , I know what you ’re up to , and I ’m going to nip this in the bud ” kind of stance with the whole thing .
I was getting impatient , embarassed and frustrated .
The whole of the staff back there were just glaring at me , and I was extremely perturbed .
My inclination in these situations , which seem to happen more frequently these days , is to try and be rational and direct without being rude .
I said to this young man “ You know what ?
I do n’t think you ’re handling this very well or being very polite , and I ’d like to speak to someone else about this . ”
His response was “ Whatever , somebody needs to come deal with this because I ’m about to go off … ”
“ You ’re about to ‘ Go off ? ’ , I asked him ( probably exacerbating the situation , I admit . )
“ Do you really think that ’s the best thing to say to a paying customer ? ”
And at this point , with his back turned to me , the young man muttered “ Fucking AIDS freak . ”
I have to be honest with you : I ’m 30 years old , and in all of my adult life – with all of the bigotry and hatred I have encountered in various forms and situations – this was the absolute most shocking and flabbergasting thing that has ever happened to me .
It was one of those situations where I was so stunned and slack - jawed that I had no real faculties to handle the situation .
It ’s the kind of anger that silences you while your body tenses up and you try to control the shaking that ’s coming from the inside out .
By this point a woman , the manager of the pharmacy , had approached me and asked – stone faced – if she could help .
I told her that if her employees felt comfortable speaking to customers they way they just did , and in her presence , that I did n’t think she COULD help because obviously they felt doing so was okay .
I asked her to void my prescription transfer and I left .
When I got home I immediately called a different CVS location and asked for a number to call to file a complaint .
I called a local “ headquarters ” number and left a complaint on a voicemail for a district manager .
I also called the general 800 number for CVS and left a complain with the customer service person .
I was told the general manager of the store , Anthony , was on vacation until Monday .
On Monday , Anthony did call me back .
Our conversation was brief and typical of what I expected .
I was told that he would investigate the situation , and that if what I described did , in fact , happen , it would be dealt with .
But that basically he could n’t promise anything other than that if I ever came into the store again and something similar happened , I should ask to speak to him directly .
I can tell you now that nothing really came of the situation .
The young man still works at that CVS , and I have done my best to simply not go there anymore .
As it is located only 2 bocks from my apartment , and is the only 24 - hour estalishment in the area , I do still go occasionally , hating myself every step of the way .
I do n’t know what I expected CVS to do .
I suppose – and I say this laughingly – an apologetic gift card might have been nice .
But the real point is , is there any real resolution to a situation like this ?
Other than having the guy on video or audio tape , he ’s obviously going to deny that it happened , and his co-worker chums – presuming they heard what he said ( as that one part is probably the only “ fireable ” part of his lousy customer service ) – did n’t seem the types inclined to get involved .
There ’s no real great way to wrap up this report .
I guess the great lesson is , people can still be complete douchebags , and sometimes there ’s nothing you can do about it .
As John McCain tried every stunt in the book this week and Barack Obama struggled to be heard above the din of financial , media , and political hysteria , two voices rang clear : those of comedians David Letterman and Chris Rock .
After McCain skipped out on Letterman ’s show on Wednesday night and said he would be “ flying to Washington ” using his “ suspended campaign ” as an excuse , the host showed a clip of McCain getting makeup put on in the CBS newsroom for an interview with Katie Couric that same night .
He excoriated McCain for two nights for the move , saying he should have had Sarah Palin campaigning for him while he was in Washington .
“ This does n’t smell right .
This is not the way a tested hero behaves , ” Letterman cracked .
“ Somebody ’s putting something in his Metamucil . ”
“ Are we suspending the campaign because of an economic crisis ? ” he asked .
“ Or because the poll numbers are sliding ? ”
The night before , Letterman had invited Chris Rock on to promote his new DVD .
Rock came on after Bill Clinton had spent a few minutes talking about politics and Hillary .
“ Is it me or he did n’t want to say the name Barack Obama ? ”
Rock asked , to great applause .
This caused such a stir that Clinton himself scolded Rock during a later appearance on the Daily Show .
But the comedian was already on a tear .
Last night , he held a funny , quick - witted session with Larry King .
We ’ve assembled his best lines after the jump :
• “ If this was a boxing match , McCain would be holding on to Obama . ”
• “ McCain jokes are easy jokes .
‘ I do n’t want a president with a bucket list ! ’
You basically take the dust off your Reagan jokes and tell them again . ”
• “ You got a guy that ’s worth $ 150 million with twelve houses against a guy worth a million dollars with one house .
The guy with one house really worries about losing his house — because then he ’s homeless ! …
John McCain could lose half his houses and sleep well ! ”
• “ [ Bill Clinton ’s ] wife was running for president .
If you give me a choice of pissing off a whole race of people or my wife , I ’m sorry , I gotta piss off a whole race of people .
Sorry blackies !
Go eat some chicken ! … Right Larry ?
You ’ve been married twelve times , right ? ”
• [ On the choice of Sarah Palin ] “ I thought Al Davis made the choice , or something .
That ’s how bad it was . ”
• “ Jason Leigh has done more interviews promoting My Name Is Earl than [ Sarah Palin ] had to run for vice - president of the United States . ”
• “ [ Sarah Palin is ] kind of like Kim Kardashian on Dancing With the Stars .
All that ass and you ca n’t shake it ! ”
• “ Bin Laden did more movies last year than Sam Jackson .
I think he ’s in Lakeview Terrace . ”
• “ America is broke right now , and nobody understands broke better than black people . ”

While the number of confirmed extrasolar planets is now approaching 300 , the tally of extrasolar moons so far identified is still a rather disappointing zero .
Planets beyond our solar system are incredibly challenging to find .
Moons are nearly impossible with today 's technology , given that they are generally expected to be quite small compared to their parent worlds .
Even Earth 's moon is invisible on the famous " pale blue dot " image obtained by Voyager 1 from the comparatively small distance of 3.7 billion miles — a photograph taken from well within our solar system .
But the search is not impossible , says Darren Williams , associate professor of physics and astronomy at Penn State Erie , the Behrend College .
Williams believes a moon in orbit around a known extrasolar planet will also be detectable if we look hard enough with the right techniques .
" It will add a periodic component to the combined infrared signal " of the planet - moon system , he said .
Why it matters
Finding moons is more than just an academic quest to count them up .
Planetary satellites can be highly interesting in their own right .
It 's possible , for example , that life could exist on extrasolar moons , researchers say .
And it has been suggested that the ocean tides induced by Earth 's moon may have been necessary to create the conditions for life on our planet to begin .
At the least , the evolution of life has been affected by our moon 's constant tugging .
" We certainly owe our present climate stability to the Moon and its stabilizing influence on the spin axis , but I 'm not convinced that big moons are a requirement for simple or advanced life , " Williams said .
" I do think that Earth would have evolved advance life even with greater seasonal extremes , but it may have taken a different evolutionary path . "
How to find them
Williams has modelled an Earth - like planet with moons of varying sizes and concluded that satellites as small as Earth 's moon could be detectable in the infrared data , owing to their large surface temperature variations .
By studying an extrasolar planet and building up a picture of that world 's infrared output , any sizable moons present should be detectable in this way .
So far , however , no planet as small as Earth has been detected around another star .
But astronomers expect that barrier to be broken soon .
Future missions , such as NASA 's Terrestrial Planet Finder and The European Space Agency 's Darwin , will have the ability to return the valuable data required both for finding other Earths and , Williams figures , some moons .
" The present goal is to build instruments capable of seeing something as large as the Earth or possibly Mars .
Smaller Mercury - or Titan - sized objects fall below that first - order threshold , " Williams said .
So could these missions cut to the chase and spot an extrasolar moon directly ?
" They might , if the light collectors are big enough and if the moons are big enough .
It will be easier to see moons that happen to transit the face of a star , such as what the space telescope Kepler will attempt to do starting next year , " Williams explained .
The space - based Kepler observatory will note dips in starlight caused by planets crossing in front of stars .
If the planets are aligned in such a favourable manner , then thinking goes , moons ought to transit the stars too .
A similar conclusion is reached by Szab , Szatmry , Diveki and Simon in a paper published in Astronomy and Astrophysics in 2005 .
They conclude that the Kepler mission should identify a few extrasolar moons using this method of detection .
Upon reflection
Yet even if we are not lucky enough to catch an extrasolar moon in transit , these future space - based planet hunters will be able to do the observational groundwork , in visible light and in the infrared , needed to search for satellites .
These planet finders will even be capable of detecting the glint of starlight reflecting off any oceans of liquid water an extrasolar planet may harbor .
" Water is extremely dark in the infrared except when the light reflects from the surface at a glancing angle , " Williams told SPACE.com .
This glint will be most apparent when the planet is in a crescent phase , when the starlight hits the reflective surface at an oblique angle .
( Mercury and Venus , as seen from Earth , go through phases similar to our moon .
Observations of other planets around distant stars will undergo phasing , too . )
Observing such reflections can help map the planet 's thermal output and infer the distribution of oceans and continents .
Indeed the Mars Express spacecraft is set to observe crescent Earth 's ocean reflection this summer and in fall of 2009 to help understand the phenomenon .

More men suffering ' Manorexia ' , health experts warn as size zero pressure hits males
There are signs that anorexia is increasing at a faster rate among men than women as the beauty and fashion industry puts a greater focus on males , an eating disorder expert has warned .
In recent years designers have promoted sizezero chic for both sexes , with waif - like men in slim - fit clothes parading the catwalks of London Fashion Week .
Professor Hubert Lacey , a psychiatric consultant at St George 's Hospital in Tooting and the Capio Nightingale clinic in Marylebone , saw more male than female anorexia referrals for the first time this summer .
Experts say skinny models such a these are encouraging ' manorexia ' as males aspire to be thinner
He said : '" It was shocking , a huge surprise and evidence of how rapidly male anorexia is increasing .
' Although it 's not at the level found in women , people working in the field have seen it really take off over the past couple of years .
' I came back from holiday last week and for the first time ever I had more male referrals for anorexia than female ones . '
He said that men are subject to a relentless message that body perfection is a measure of self worth - with men from the higher social classes most commonly affected by eating disorders .
Harvard University found last year that a quarter of anorexia and bulimia sufferers are now male .
The British Fashion Council says its health guidelines apply equally to both sexes .
The Georgia Crisis Turns Dangerous
by Eric Margolis by Eric Margolis
DIGG THIS
PARIS — Pipsqueak Georgia ’s harebrained and disastrous attack on tiny South Ossetia has produced a full - blown crisis pitting the US and NATO against Russia .
In an act fraught with danger , US and NATO warships are delivering supplies to Georgia , watched by Russian men of war .
The US Congress may soon vote $ 1 billion for America ’s embattled Georgian satellite .
The western powers have resorted to fierce Cold War rhetoric .
They are playing with fire .
Russia has some 6,600 strategic nuclear weapons , mostly aimed at North America and Europe .
Besides , the US , which invaded Afghanistan and Iraq , and whose air force just killed 90 Afghan civilians , 60 of them children , is in no position to lecture Moscow about aggression .
France ’s conservative president , Nicholas Sarkozy , blasted Russia and will shortly hold a European summit over Georgia in Brussels .
As usual , the Harper government faithfully echoed Washington ’s words .
Poland agreed to emplace a US antiballistic missile system only 184 km from Russia ’s border , provoking Moscow ’s fury .
Ukraine and Poland are loudly backing Georgia .
Russia ’s chief of staff , Gen. Yuri Baluyevsky , warns his nation has the right to launch a " preemptive nuclear strike " against enemies , in line , he tartly noted , with the Bush administration ’s own policies .
Topping off this war of words , two of Sen .
John McCain ’s closet rightwing allies , senators Joseph Lieberman and Lindsay Graham , went to Georgia and called for " tough " measures against Moscow .
They urged isolating Russia for " aggression " and admitting Ukraine and Georgia to NATO .
McCain ’s allies give a good preview of what his foreign policy would look like .
Lieberman and Graham , leading proponents of the US occupation of Iraq , had the chutzpah to insist , " Russia must not be allowed to control energy supplies . "
This ugly mess recalls how the great powers blundered into both World War I and II over obscure locales like Bosnia - Herzegovina and the Danzig Corridor .
The obvious lesson : act with extreme caution .
But few are listening as rhetoric sharpens .
The Bush administration — most likely VP Dick Cheney — almost certainly planned or knew about Georgia ’s attack on Russian - backed South Ossetia launched under cover of the Beijing Olympics .
Whether the White House was trying to inflict a quick little military victory over Moscow , or whipping up war fever at home to boost John McCain ’s prospects , is uncertain .
This crisis over a mere 70,000 South Ossetians and 18,000 Abkhazians could have been quietly resolved by diplomacy .
Instead , the Bush administration turned it into a major confrontation by accusing Russia of aggression .
Washington , which rightly recognized the independence of Kosovo ’s Albanians from Serb repression , denounced Russia ’s recognition of Abkhaz and South Ossetian independence from Georgian repression .
Meanwhile , Moscow , which crushed the life out of Chechnya ’s independence movement , piously claimed to be defending Ossetian independence .
Things may get worse .
The US is pressing Ukraine to join NATO , though half of its 48 million citizens oppose doing so .
Ukraine ’s constitution mandates a neutral state .
Russia allowed Ukraine to decamp from the Soviet Union with the understanding it would never join NATO , and allow Russia ’s Black Sea Fleet operate from Crimea .
Russian political expert Sergei Markov rightly notes that Washington and NATO see Ukraine as a rich new source of troops for Iraq and Afghanistan , wars from which he says NATO leaders cannot withdraw their soldiers without committing " political suicide . "
" Old Europe " is trying to avoid a clash with Moscow , while " new Europe " — Georgia , Poland , the Czechs , and Balts — frightened of Russia ’s growing power , eggs on the US - Russia confrontation .
Not only did the clumsy US attempt to expand its influence into Moscow ’s backyard backfire badly , Washington ’s childish , petulant response is as inflammatory as it is powerless .
The Georgian crisis and empty threats against Russia have aroused strong nationalist passions in Russia , which sees itself increasingly isolated and surrounded by the US and NATO .
Nationalist hysteria , jingoism , and fevered rhetoric are coming from both sides .
We saw such lunacy before : in August 1914 , and September 1939 .

Sarah Palin , small - town hockey mom and everywoman ?
More like Sarah Palin , pampered princess .
Jeanne Cummings at Politico reports that the RNC ’s monthly financial disclosure reports reveal that the Republican National Committee has spent tens of thousands of dollars on the vice presidential candidate 's wardrobe and accessories since she was nominated , including $ 150,000 in September alone .
So it seems you can take the girl out of the beauty pageant , but you ca n’t take the beauty pageant out of the girl .
Palin 's clothes came from retailers such as Saks Fifth Avenue , Macy ’s , Bloomingdales , Neiman Marcus and Barneys New York , and expenses included nearly $ 5,000 for hair and makeup .
Maybe this is actually her one - woman economic stimulus plan .
Lord knows the retail sector needs it .
Still , voters must find it unfathomable for Palin , who has been presented as a woman “ like us , ” to spend that kind of money on clothes in these difficult financial times , to see her speaking so passionately about Joe the Plumber while plumbing campaign coffers for Valentino jackets and pencil skirts .
And yet , they ’ve eaten it up , tittering on chat sites about Palin ’s Kawasaki eyeglass frames and her Naughty Monkey red peep - toe pumps .
( See our earlier take on Gov. Palin 's style here . )
Palin ’s spokewoman is saying this is much ado about nothing , that we should be talking about more important issues .
But can you imagine the outcry if it were revealed that Hilary Clinton ’s rainbow of pantsuits was paid for by campaign contributions ?
Or if college kids ’ $ 50 checks to the Biden / Obama campaign were putting those men in $ 5,000 custom suits ?
( Obama ’s suits are by Hart Schaffner Marx out of Chicago , and cost in the $ 1,500 range . )
In Palin ’s defense , being a woman in the public eye has its own kind of pressures .
And it ’s unlikely she has been stepping off the campaign trail to join the ladies who lunch for shopping sprees at Neimans .
Instead , she is probably working with a wardrobe stylist , who brings her things to try on and choose from .
But the issue of clothing and hair expenses has always been a land mine for politicians ( John Edwards ' $ 400 haircuts ) , and someone should have been sensitive to that .
You also have to wonder how it feels , as a woman , to have everyone know that you really have been dressed up and trotted out like a beauty queen for the American public to wag their tongues at .
Caribou Barbie indeed .

http://www.xubuntu.com/ surely hell lot faster than ubuntu / kubuntu /etc … and it's just as easy as ubuntu / kubuntu

complete control
or you can continue this minimal desktop installation if you like …
what make this installation different is that you have complete control what you want to install .
you decide every single piece of your linux .
you decide if you want opera over firefox or gnumeric over openoffice.org calc , etc … and it 's still 100 % ubuntu .
this guide is tested on the field with a complete newbies who never see / use linux before and use 100 % windows and the system installed fine with all required hardware and software working !
warning & note :
i assume you install to an empty harddrive .
at least .
nothing important in the harddrive so that everything can be safely wiped out .
i will not responsible for any data lost .
legends
everything started with a # meaning that is a comment line .
that is for your eyes and you do not need to type it at all and you can safely ignore them .
all command started with $ is to be entered into terminal
if a command started with # $ meaning you should choose wheter or not to execute that command
multiple # $ means you should choose only one of the multiple commands
( almost ) everything is optional .
if you 're in doubt in any part , you can safely skip it for later
ok let 's get started …
first , install using server / alternate cd
boot your cd , choose your language , press F4 and choose " Install a command - line system "
if you use ubuntu minimal cd , enter ' cli ' at boot prompt
if / when asked what to install , choose nothing .
nothing at all .
not base system .
not minimal .
nothing .
deselect everything .
everything .
after ubuntu installed and restarted to your new installed system .
login as usual .
now we start installing the system .
let 's the fun begins .
nb. it 's most confusing for windows users that linux do not show any asterisk when you enter your password .
the password line just blank whatever you type into it .
and it 's intentional .
just key in your password and press enter .
update & upgrade
this step is optional but highly recommended .
as with everything in linux .
all and everything is optional .
you decide what you want .
do NOT install anything that you will not use / want .
if you want to install everything , you 'd better go with the ubuntu livecd installer .
# first , make things easier ... # if you want these alias activated everytime you login , put it into bashrc with all other aliases # with alias , you can shorten any command to save few keyboard strokes .
$ nano - w . bashrc alias nano= ' nano - w ' alias update= ' sudo aptitude update ' alias upgrade= ' sudo aptitude update && sudo aptitude safe - upgrade ' alias iapt= ' sudo aptitude install ' alias suapt= ' sudo aptitude ' alias sudeb= ' sudo gdebi '
now , do the update & upgrade
$ sudo aptitude update $ sudo aptitude safe - upgrade $ sudo aptitude full - upgrade # then you can always use ' suapt install ' in place of ' sudo aptitude install ' # this guide will keep the full syntax for clearity purpose .
quick start
this ONE SINGLE line is all you need to get your minimal desktop .
$ sudo aptitude -y install xserver - xorg - core xinit menu menu-xdg jwm fluxbox alsa-utils mrxvt gdebi-core synaptic logrotate localepurge
if you got missing packages or any error , please check the repo section and make sure your repo do not have this bug :
https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+bug/116387
users & groups
add more users
$ sudo adduser newlinuxusername
add users to groups
add your users to certain groups to allow you play music / video , mount , etc …
$ sudo usermod - aG dialout , cdrom , floppy , audio , video , plugdev , fuse , lpadmin yourusername
FINISH !
that 's all it !
you got somewhat minimal desktop .
now you can get into your desktop with :
$ startx
this is what you got :
then , you can use synaptic to install any other apps :
$ sudo synaptic
or , you can continue for more fun …
minimal X
if you do not like fluxbox above , you can choose to install any other wm .
just replace the fluxbox above with any of these desktop / wm .
only choose ONE for small system .
if you have enough resources , you might install more to try out any of them …
# $ sudo aptitude install jwm # $ sudo aptitude install fluxbox # $ sudo aptitude install fvwm - crystal # $ sudo aptitude install icewm icemc wmctrl # $ sudo aptitude install -- without - recommends lxde - core # $ sudo aptitude install -- without - recommends lxde # $ sudo aptitude install xfce4 # $ sudo aptitude install gnome - core # $ sudo aptitude install kde - core # $ sudo aptitude install kde4 - core #
generaly , i try to sort them with their memory usage .
if you have absolute minimal ram ( 64meg ) use the first ( jwm / fluxbox only )
to sort them with their memory usage .
if you have absolute minimal ram ( 64meg ) use the first ( jwm / fluxbox only ) at most bottom , gnome - core , kde - core and kde4 - core is the heaviest .
avoid them if you have very small ram ( < 128meg )
for n00b , maybe lxde / xfce4 is easier to use
see also : install fvwm - crystal on debian
LXDE
lxde is very cool .
you need to add repo to install it .
see http://wiki.lxde.org/en/Ubuntu
lxde recommends gdm , a huge monster apps that depends on other monster apps .
use — without - recommends switch so that you wont install those monster .
first , put the lxde repo into /etc/apt/sources.list :
# $ sudo nano -w /etc/apt/sources.list # then paste this line into it : deb http://ppa.launchpad.net/lxde/ubuntu hardy main # then : # $ sudo aptitude update # $ sudo aptitude install -- without - recommends lxde
update : if you got problem from old lxde repo , make sure you remove the apps from that old repo first :
# first , remove apps from old repos $ sudo aptitude purge lxde lxsession - lite lxappearance pcmanfm lxpanel # then do the install $ sudo aptitude install -- without - recommends lxde
more on window manager
choosing your x session / window manager
you can choose alternatives xsession / xwindow manager ONLY IF you install more than one of those .
if you only install one , you got no alternatives to choose from .
sudo update - alternatives -- config x-session - manager $ sudo update - alternatives -- config x-window - manager
or , you can create .xsession
# to create .xsession file , open a terminal and enter : # $ nano -w .xsession # and put one of these into it : # uncomment ( remove the # ) only ONE that you want to use .
# and comments ( put # in front of it ) all the others that you do not use exec startfluxbox # exec startlxde # exec startxfce4 # exec icewm - session # exec fvwm - crystal
graphical login , display manager
this is OPTIONAL !
skip this if you dont know about it .
it uses more ram .
try install qingy instead of any of these .
you can even automatically login and startx when you turn on your pc .
unless you have to .
ie , fix problem with X display drivers etc. .

# install ONLY ONE of these # $ sudo aptitude install wdm # $ sudo aptitude install xdm $ sudo aptitude install slim # $ sudo aptitude install gdm # $ sudo aptitude install kdm

QA
why everything use aptitude ?
somewhat n00b friendly .
minimal fussing with apt / source .list , no tedious install from source it ease my life .
any new apps , bugfix or security update i just do aptitude upgrade
why not apt - get aptitude keep a record of what you install and offer you to remove unneeded dependencies .

Why is the mainstream media – which keeps lecturing Americans that Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson ’s Bailout Package Version 2.0 must be passed immediately – ignoring what might be the most earth - shattering provisions in Paulson ’s package ?
The media needs to start asking hard questions .
Here is where they need to start .
If you look at page 180 of the 451 - page monster bailout bill that easily passed the Senate yesterday ( PDF here ) , you will see that it includes at Section 116 language about the tax treatment of “ industrial source carbon dioxide . ”
It also provides , at Section 117 , for a “ carbon audit of the tax code . ”
What could a provision about the tax treatment of “ industrial source carbon dioxide ” and another provision about doing a “ carbon audit ” of the tax code possibly have to do with restoring confidence in Wall Street ’s troubled credit markets ?
The answer : NOTHING .
This appears to be an attempt by global warming fanatics to lay the foundation for an economy - killing carbon tax just like the “ cap - and - tax ” system that is now destroying European industry .
If you think the Mother of All Bailouts is bad , just wait till you see the carbon tax .
Get ready to reduce your standard of living drastically .
It really should n’t be a surprise that these non-germane provisions are included in legislation that is supposed to save all of us from economic Armageddon .
After all , Henry Paulson is a confirmed environmentalist and global warming true - believer who abused his power at Goldman Sachs .
While Paulson headed Goldman Sachs he simultaneously headed the Nature Conservancy and his wife was a former Conservancy board member .
( See “ In Goldman Sachs We Trust : How the Left ’s Favorite Bank Influences Public Policy , ” by Fred Lucas , Foundation Watch , October 2008 . )
Henry Paulson presided over Goldman Sachs ’s donation of 680,000 acres of land it owned in Tierra del Fuego , Chile to the New York - based Wildlife Conservation Society .
One of the trustees of the Wildlife Conservation Society was H. Merritt Paulson , the son of Henry Paulson .
As green critic Paul Driessen observed , at no time did anyone “ assess the vast area ’s potential value for timber , oil or metals , so that locals and [ Goldman Sachs ] shareholders would at least know the true cost of the giveaway . ”

The US vice - president , Dick Cheney , yesterday issued a direct challenge to Moscow 's sway over Georgia , pledging Washington 's support for its eventual membership of Nato , while denouncing Russia 's " illegitimate " invasion .
" Georgia will be in our alliance , " Cheney said after talks with President Mikheil Saakashvili .
Cheney used his one - day visit to Georgia to reinforce battle lines in the increasingly direct struggle between Washington and Moscow for the upper hand along Russia 's southern border .
His visit to Azerbaijan , Georgia and Ukraine was aimed at stressing America 's " deep , abiding interest " in the region , in response to the claim by Russia 's president , Dmitry Medvedev , that Moscow had " privileged interests " in former Soviet states .
The US challenge was undermined by the collapse of Ukraine 's pro-western coalition on the eve of Cheney 's arrival in Kiev at the end of his three - country trip yesterday .
The crisis threatened to derail President Viktor Yushchenko's efforts to win Ukraine Nato and EU membership .
Cheney made clear however that it would not shake Washington 's deep involvement in the region , now focused on Georgia after last month 's conflict with Russia over South Ossetia .
Shrugging off Russian recognition of the breakaway republics of Abkhazia and South Ossetia , he declared the Bush administration 's " strong commitment to Georgia 's territorial integrity " .
The US would stand with Georgia , he said , " as you work to overcome an invasion of your sovereign territory and an illegitimate attempt to change your country 's borders by force " .
He also made a point of reaffirming US support for Saakashvili , who Moscow has derided as " a political corpse " .
In pointed contrast , Cheney told the Georgian leader : " You have been fearless in response to the occupation of your country and steadfast in your principles .
We respect you . "
The two men made a joint appearance near an aircraft factory destroyed by Russian bombing , to watch a US military transport plane unload blankets , part of the $ 1bn in emergency aid the US has offered Georgia to help the country rebuild .
The package makes Georgia the biggest recipient of US aid after Israel , Egypt and Iraq .
US officials stressed the package did not include aid to rebuild Georgia 's military .
That will be decided later this year .
Georgian membership of Nato is due to be discussed at an alliance ministerial meeting in December .
Russia insisted yesterday that such a move remained a red line in east - west relations .
Dmitry Rogozin , Russia 's representative to Nato , said Moscow would respond by halting co-operation with Nato over Afghanistan .
Cheney 's trip coincided with the collapse of Ukraine 's government after a split between Yushchenko and the prime minister , Yulia Tymoshenko .
Their coalition collapsed over Russia 's invasion of Georgia - with Tymoshenko positioning herself as a rival candidate to Yushchenko in Ukraine 's presidential election next year .
Yushchenko has lambasted Russia 's occupation of Georgia , while Tymoshenko has refused to criticise the Kremlin directly .
The moment that most stuck with me last night ( and most people , I assume ) was when Senator Biden choked up while taking about losing his wife and daughter to a horrific car accident .
He successfully challenged Palin 's assertion that he does n't understand the challenges of average , working Americans in what was clearly an unscripted and sincere moment that provided a window into the true character of the man .

Look , I understand what it 's like to be a single parent .
When my wife and daughter died and my two sons were gravely injured , I understand what it 's like as a parent to wonder what it 's like if your kid 's going to make it .
I understand what it 's like to sit around the kitchen table with a father who says , " I 've got to leave , champ , because there 's no jobs here .
I got to head down to Wilmington .
And when we get enough money , honey , we 'll bring you down . "
But the notion that somehow , because I 'm a man , I do n't know what it 's like to raise two kids alone , I do n't know what it 's like to have a child you 're not sure is going to -- is going to make it -- I understand .
Biden 's most powerful , personal moment was quickly followed by what Palin did best all night : repeat mindless , boilerplate talking points , never deviating from the script prepared for her .
Markos puts it perfectly :
WASHINGTON ( Reuters ) -
The common cold virus activates dozens of immune system genes in the lining of the nose , including some natural antivirals that might be used as the basis of new drugs , researchers reported on Friday .
It also appears to shut down some genes , but to a lesser degree , the international team reported in the American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine .
Of particular interest is a gene that controls a natural antiviral called viperin , said David Proud of the University of Calgary in Alberta , who led the study .
Viperin , only discovered in the 1990s , was known to be involved in other viral infections but not the common cold , Proud said .
“ This had never been examined during rhinovirus infections , ” he said .
Proud and colleagues , including a team at cold remedy maker Procter & Gamble Co , tested 35 people who agreed to be infected with a common cold virus called human rhinovirus 16 .
Hours after infection , the researchers scraped a little bit of the lining from inside the volunteers ’ noses and analyzed gene expression , or activity , in the cells .
Every cell in the body carries all the genes , but certain genes become more or less active during various activities .
“ I think that is the ideal approach to trying to treat these viral infections .
If you can find out what are the body ’s natural defenses , can you either boost them or supplement them ? ”
Proud said in a telephone interview .
“ The findings are important because they provide us a blueprint for developing the ideal cold treatment : one that maintains the body ’s natural antiviral response while normalizing the inflammatory response , ” added P&G ’s Lynn Jump , who also worked on the study .
Others had looked at immune responses one by one .
“ This was really the first study that looked at the entire human genome , ” Proud said .
“ We confirmed some of the things we knew , and we found an awful lot more that we were n’t aware of . ”
For instance , you might be able to blame a runny nose , sneezing and chills on viperin , the researchers found .
Symptoms such as a stuffy nose , headache and cough were not associated with viperin , however .
Several immune system chemicals called chemokines , which call in other virus - killing cells , became very active 48 hours after infection , they found .
So did a class of immune system compounds called interferons .
Viperin , on average , was six times as active in infected as in uninfected volunteers .
Other antiviral substances that were activated included compounds called MX1 and MX2 , which are linked with resistance to influenza .
Proud said it will take years of careful study before researchers have any idea of how to control cold symptoms .
“ You need a little bit of inflammation to have some protection , ” he noted .
More than 200 different viruses cause common cold symptoms , including the rhinoviruses but also others such as respiratory syncytial virus or RSV .
Many , including RSV and rhinoviruses , are linked with more serious conditions such as asthma and chronic bronchitis , now grouped with emphysema as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease .
“ In young children , if they have recurrent viral infections in early life that are rhinovirus - driven , they are 10 times more likely to develop asthma , ” Proud said .
“ Eighty - five percent of acute asthma attacks are associated with viruses . ”
What Happens to AIG Customers ?
As insurance giant struggles , insurance customers worry about their benefits .
Sept. 16 , 2008  --
An accident three years ago left Gloria Cirolo - Wright so injured that she could n't continue with her job as a nurse .
Today , the 57 - year - old Massachusetts woman and her husband , a maintenance supervisor , rely on a weekly worker 's compensation check from AIG to help make ends meet .
AIG is one of the world 's largest insurance companies , with operations in 130 countries and products that include worker 's compensation , auto insurance , life insurance and annuities .
Now , as the company struggles to stay afloat amid losses related to the country 's mortgage crisis , Cirolo - Wright is one of many customers questioning whether her benefits are in danger .
" I 'm really worried that if AIG is going bankrupt that means that I wo n't have any source of income at all , " she said .
" I 'm totally disabled . … I 'm just so scared I do n't know what to do . "
Exactly how worried should AIG customers be ?
The insurance giant so far has defended the health of its multiple insurance businesses .
" The insurance policies written by AIG companies are direct obligations of our regulated insurance companies around the world .
These companies are well capitalized and meet or exceed local regulatory capital requirements .
These companies continue to operate in the normal course to meet our obligations to our policyholders , " AIG spokesman Peter Tulupman wrote in an e-mail to ABCNews.com .
Tulupman said that customers with questions about certain AIG policies and products should call the following phone numbers :
Annuities : 800-448-2542
Mutual Funds with AIG Sun America : 800-858-8850
Auto Insurance : 800-241-1188
Insurance experts say that even if AIG fails , there is a state - organized system in place to protect consumers and ensure that most continue receiving the benefits guaranteed by their insurance policies .
" There is a safety net in place for all insurance policy holders , " said Roger Schmelzer , the president and CEO of National Conference of Insurance Guaranty Funds .
" The personal insurance consumer is gong to be treated well under this safety net . "
Every state , experts say , have at least two guaranty funds that cover claims associated with insurance companies that have shut down .
One fund covers property and casualty claims , including workers ' compensation , and another for life insurance , health insurance and annuities .
The funds are supported by assessments charged to insurance companies .
In the last six years , guaranty funds in the United States have paid a total of about $ 10 billion in claims , according to NCIGF .
Claims paid by the funds are generally capped at $ 300,000 , but each state has its own limits .
A listing of the limits for life and health insurance are available on the Web site for the National Organization of Life & Health Insurance Guaranty Associations , while the National Conference of Insurance Guaranty Funds offers more information on property and casualty insurance at its Web site .
Schmelzer said that state guaranty funds that are members of NCIGF have reported an uptick in phone calls by worried consumers in recent days .
But it 's not just concerns about AIG , he said , that might be prompting the calls .
" I think there 's just a general sense of skittishness about what 's going in the financial markets , " he said .
The United States imprisons almost one in one hundred American adults a higher number and percentage of its population than any other country , according to a February 29 , 2008 Washington Post article .
This has been especially devastating for minorities as the Post points out , ( o ) ne in nine black men ages 20 to 34 is behind bars . 
Many of these people remain in a continual pattern of crime .
Are we a safer society as a result , or should we re-evaluate our crime policies ?
When I was in college , Johnnie Cochran gave a talk in which he asked whether we are doing a service to the country by building a land of barbed wire and concrete  from sea to shining sea . 
There is a psychological and social effect that has been pointed out by Ayn Rand , who argued ( astutely ) that social control is easier if we create a nation of criminals .
Many statutes do not prevent crimes ; they create them .
Drug laws are a perfect example : drug use infringes on no ones rights ; it is the essence of a victimless crime . 
Some might respond that there is no such thing as a victimless crime because of the effects of drug use on the users friends and families .
These costs are all too real as the legacy of families torn apart by drug abuse suggests .
If we are going to adopt this utilitarian line of reasoning , though , then we have to weigh the costs to families against the social costs created by the unintended consequences of the war on drugs .
The drug war is an integral part of the rapidly growing American prison population .
Outlawing marijuana , cocaine , heroin , and other drugs created a whole new class of crimes and moved traffic in psychoactive drugs out of the legitimate marketplace and into the black market .
Another one of the unintended consequences of the drug war is the escalating potency of the drugs people use today .
The marijuana on the streets today is much more potent than the marijuana that was on the streets thirty and forty years ago .
As penalties have changed , so too have the drugs people use .
Cocaine became more prevalent after the government cracked down on heroin in the 1970s .
The crack epidemic was in part a response to attempts to eradicate cocaine , and the crystal meth epidemic of the last decade has happened in part in response to the war on crack .
Criminal penalties give people incentives to pack as much potency into as small a space as possible ; therefore , drug dealers have incentives to increase the potency of the drugs they deal .
Yet other examples of the unintended consequence of the drug war are the extremely low quality of the drugs that appear on the street and the violent means that drug dealers use to settle disputes .
Someone who buys bad aspirin has legal recourse against the company that sold it to him .
Someone who buys bad heroin or bad crack has no such legal recourse , and disputes over quality will be settled violently , if at all .
Epidemics of urban crime are among the unintended consequences of the drug war .
It appears that we learned nothing from our experiment with alcohol prohibition in the first part of the twentieth century .
When alcohol was outlawed , alcohol production and distribution were taken over by organized criminal syndicates think Al Capone and crime skyrocketed .
Prison is not the answer .
In a recent set of lectures given on behalf of the Institute for Humane Studies , Georgetown University legal scholar John Hasnas argued in favor of restitution as opposed to incarceration and statutory law .
Hasnas argued that people are not necessarily reformed while in prisons and jails .
They learn to be better criminals .
They attach themselves to larger criminal networks .
After some of the horrible experiences of prison like prison rape , for example still others are likely to become even more withdrawn and antisocial .
The current system is nt working .
Proponents of law and order might see this as bleeding - heart , soft - on - crime liberalism .
I agree that crime should be punished ; indeed , a strong legal system is essential for a well - functioning society .
To take one example , it has been argued by legal scholar Richard Posner ( and I agree ) that the penalties for drunken driving are not nearly severe enough .
It is quite another matter , however , to argue that our current system is doing what it was meant to do .
It is time to re-examine our drug policy .
Zbigniew Brzezinski , born in Warsaw , Poland , in 1928 , the son of a diplomat posted to Canada in 1938 , serves as Counselor , Center for Strategic and International Studies ( CSIS ) and is Professor of American Foreign Policy at the Paul H. Nitze School of Advanced International Studies ( SAIS ) at Johns Hopkins University , Washington , D.C. Brzezinski is said to be a protege of both Nelson A. Rockefeller and Paul H. Nitze ( see Nitze School ) , his CSIS profile states . [ 1 ]
In the private sector , Brzezinski serves as an " international advisor of several major US / global corporations . "
He is a " frequent participant in annual business / trade conventions " and is President of Z.B. Inc. " ( an advisory firm on international issues to corporations and financial institutions ) .
Also a frequent public speaker and commentator on major domestic and foreign TV programs , and contributor to domestic and foreign newspapers and journals . " [ 2 ]
Brzezinski's career with the U.S. Government spans several presidents : advisor to John Fitzgerald Kennedy and Lyndon Baines Johnson ; policy advisor to James Earl Carter , Jr. ; and George Herbert Walker Bush 's co-chair on the National Security Advisory Task Force ( 1988 ) . [ 3 ]
He earned his B.A. ( 1949 ) and M.A. ( 1950 ) at McGill University and his Ph.D. at Harvard University ( 1953 ) .
He holds honorary degrees from several universities . [ 4 ]
Taliban -al Qaeda Machinator ?
In a 1997 interview for CNN's Cold War Series , Brzezinski hinted about the Carter Administration 's proactive Afghanistan policy before the Soviet invasion in 1979 , that he had conceived .
Interviewer : How did you interpret Soviet behavior in Afghanistan , such as the April revolution , the rise of ...
I mean , what did you think their long - term plans were , and what did you think should be done about it ?
Brzezinski : I told the President , about six months before the Soviets entered Afghanistan , that in my judgment I thought they would be going into Afghanistan .
And I decided then , and I recommended to the President , that we should n't be passive .
Interviewer : What happened ?
Brzezinski :
We were n't passive .
7 months after the interview for the CNN series , Brzezinski , in a interview for the French publication , Le Nouvel Observateur , was more forthright , and unapologetically claimed to be the mastermind of a feint which caused the Soviet Union to embark upon a military intervention to support their client government in Kabul , as well as training and arming extremists , which later became the Taliban government .
Q : When the Soviets justified their intervention by asserting that they intended to fight against a secret involvement of the United States in Afghanistan , people did n't believe them .
However , there was a basis of truth .
You do n't regret anything today ?
Brzezinski : Regret what ?
That secret operation was an excellent idea .
It had the effect of drawing the Russians into the Afghan trap and you want me to regret it ?
The day that the Soviets officially crossed the border , I wrote to President Carter :
We now have the opportunity of giving to the USSR its Vietnam war .
Indeed , for almost 10 years , Moscow had to carry on a war unsupportable by the government , a conflict that brought about the demoralization and finally the breakup of the Soviet empire .
Q : And neither do you regret having supported the Islamic [ integrisme ] , having given arms and advice to future terrorists ?
Brzezinski :
What is most important to the history of the world ?
The Taliban or the collapse of the Soviet empire ?
Some stirred - up Moslems or the liberation of Central Europe and the end of the cold war ?

Bisazza craftsmen have encrusted each MINI with over 30,000 colored glass tesserae , creating four “ artomotive ” masterpieces in the themes of a Zebra , Summer Flowers , Tartan plaid and a Dama .
The tesserae , each one - half inch by one - half inch in size were used to transform the vehicles , with 31,700 tesserae laid on each convertible and 37,004 on each coupe .
Sewage - fed cows , " mad cows " , dioxin contaminated chickens , hormone injected cattle , genetically modified Soya , animal carcasses used to make animal feed , contaminated mineral water and Coca - Cola .
A common thread runs through all these cases : the search for the highest profits on the part of the food industry to the detriment of everybody 's health .
Michele Fabbri , Italian Marxist magazine Falce Martello .
Sewage - fed cows , " mad cows " , dioxin contaminated chickens , hormone injected cattle , genetically modified Soya , animal carcasses used to make animal feed , contaminated mineral water and Coca - Cola .
The list of contaminated food is getting longer and longer .
There is a common thread running through all these cases : the search for the highest profits on the part of multinationals in the food industry to the detriment of everybody 's health .
Each time one of these scandals breaks out it is presented as an exceptional case and soon disappears from the newspaper headlines .
Delays , incompetence and sometimes downright complicity on the part of the authorities , who are supposed to carry out checks , are covered up ( see the attempt on the part of the European Commission in August to double the permitted levels of PCB residues - a precursor to dioxins - in food .
Dioxin has been discovered in chickens on several occasions in the past .
We should not forget that in 1998 unacceptable levels of dioxin were found in milk produced in the North of France .
The source of this contamination were several incinerators that had polluted the surrounding grazing land .
Dioxin spewing out of the incinerator plants settled on the grass .
It then got chewed by the cows where it was concentrated mainly in their fat deposits and from there into their milk .
At each successive stage the dioxin was more and more concentrated .
Successive concentration is in fact the most subtle and dangerous feature of this carcinogenic substance .
Furthermore , thanks to animal feeding techniques , which lengthen the food chain in an unnatural way ( chickens fed on animal fats , industrial waste and sewage residues ) , dioxin concentration increases in the last link in the chain by as much as thousands of times the initial level .
And humans are always the last link in this artificially extended chain .
Thus we should not be surprised to find that there is much more dioxin in human milk than in cow 's milk .
We even have the paradox , that in many cases human milk should not be used as the levels of dioxin in it are often higher than acceptable limits in cow 's milk .
Dioxin and incinerators
The incineration of refuse is still the main source of dioxin emissions .
And in spite of improvements in the incinerator plants , the quantity of dioxin produced by this system of refuse disposal is still high .
A modern incinerator plant , with the latest technology , pumps out into the atmosphere about 250 billion picograms of dioxin a year ( one picogram = one billionth of a gram ) .
Available data reveals that in the Belgian chickens , that had a lower level of contamination ( although well above the legal limit ) , there were about 550 thousand picograms of dioxin .
That means that the amount of dioxin produced each year by just one incinerator could be enough to seriously contaminate nearly half a million chickens !
Obviously not all the dioxin produced by an incinerator ends up in the chickens .
However , we should remember that the life span of an incinerator is about 20 years .
If we add to this the number of existing incinerators then we get a clearer picture of the potential for dioxin contamination .
The average amount of dioxin produced per capita in Europe is 13.2 micrograms .
The highest levels per capita are in Belgium , with 45.2 micrograms per capita .
This is the result of the high level of refuse which is disposed of through incineration : 54 % of the total , another European record .
Back in the 1980s the British food industry pushed for a liberalisation of beef production in an attempt to reduce costs .
However , they did not expect such disastrous effects on the health of both cows and humans .
In 1996 the discovery of BSE ( " mad cow " disease ) raised suspicions about the type of feed beings used .
Again , this was presented as an isolated case , and it was declared that beef in the rest of Europe was safe .
Very few bothered to point out that it was the whole of the food industry that was to blame because its methods were based purely on the maximisation of profits .
The farmers took the blame , the very same people who bore the brunt of the financial losses , while in reality they were the victims of the companies ( and their allies ) that produce animal feed .
Nothing was done to get to the root cause of the problem .
Animal feed
Nowadays the use of animal carcasses in the production of animal feed to boost its protein content is widely criticised , but it is not a new development .
The meat industry has built its power and competitive edge by basing itself on an inexhaustible source of raw materials , the recycled waste of the slaughterhouses that is transformed into animal feed .
Everyday millions of eggs are exported to the four corners of the world from Holland .
Dutch eggs sell all over the world because they are so cheap .
But how have they managed to reduce the cost of production so dramatically ?
The British and the Dutch are not solely to blame for this situation .
The finger should be pointed at the Common Agricultural Policy which has been developed by all the national governments of Europe .
Decisions are taken by a unanimous agreement of all EU member states .
The authorisation to continue using animal based feeds for pigs and chickens led to all kinds of possible effects .
In fact , only a few months later , in 1997 , the European Union had to order the destruction of millions of pigs due to the outbreak of an epidemic .
This cost a million ECU ( about £ 700 million ) , half of which was paid by European tax payers .
After the Belgian chicken scandal France suggested once again the banning of animal feed produced from animal waste .
And once again everything was hushed up !
Powerful lobbies
No stop - gap measure will eliminate problems that derive from a productive system , imposed by the Common Agricultural Policy , whose only aim is to increase the profits of the powerful food industry and in particular of the multinational corporations that produce animal feed , antibiotics and growth stimulants .
According to official statistics , on livestock farms with less than 100 pigs the cost of antibiotics is about £ 40 per head .
But when there is a high concentration of animals in one place the cost can be over £ 100 per head .
This shows that the aim is not to keep the animal healthy , but to achieve an artificial weight gain through a constant low intensity input of antibiotics in order to avoid even the slightest infection .
It is a well known fact that salmonella , which develops quite easily among fowl , is the source of 70 % of cases of mass food poisoning in Europe .
Bacteria is becoming ever more resistant due to the excessive use of antibiotics and this is causing growing problems in the treatment of infectious diseases .
The scientific committee of the European Union has published a report in which it requests a ban on the widespread use of antibiotics .
But as recently as July of this year the European Union had not taken on board the requests of the Committee .
Are they stupid ?
No , on the contrary , it is a question big vested interests .
This sector alone accounts for $ 250 billion of the world market for pharmaceutical products .
It is up to the European labour movement to defend our right to safe food production as part of the general struggle for decent jobs and wages .
To leave this essential task in the hands of environmental or consumer groups means that in the best of cases all that will be achieved is a denunciation of the problem .
A solution can only be found by posing the problem clearly : so long as food production is in the hands of the capitalists these scandals will continue .
As we have already seen , inspections , laws and guidelines will have little effect because the authorities listen more to the large corporations than to the people they are supposed to represent .
Good healthy food can only be achieved through the nationalisation of these corporations with a democratic planning of the resources .
Even in the kitchen socialism is the only answer .
Several theories have been proposed by scientists to explain the two mass extinction events which took place on the earth 250 and 200 million years ago .
The Permian - Triassic catastrophe ( 250 million years ago ) was the worst of all five of the mass extinction events to ever have befallen the earth .
It eradicated almost 95 % of all species , 53 % of marine families , 84 % of marine genera and an approximated 70 % of all land species including plants , insects and vertebrate animals .
Many scientists suspect that the event was the result of a comet or an asteroid colliding with the earth .
Others believe that flood volcanism from the Siberian Traps and the associated oxygen loss in the seas was the cause .
While others continue to investigate the possibility that thinning levels of atmospheric oxygen caused the eradication of so many species at the time .
But new research findings by University College Dublin scientists published in Science question the theory of falling oxygen levels as a mechanism for causing the mass extinction events .
To assess the likely atmospheric oxygen levels at the time of the mass extinction events , using purposefully designed walk - in - plant - growth rooms equipped with thermal imaging system and full atmospheric , temperature and humidity control , Dr Claire Belcher and her University College Dublin colleagues spent several months measuring the lower limits of oxygen at which combustion can occur .
When the measurements were recorded , they compared their results with the charcoal in the fossil record from ancient times because the charcoal that remains in the fossil record reveals the presence of ancient wildfires which require a sufficient level of oxygen in the air for plants to burn .
“ By performing experimental burns using pine wood , moss , matches , paper and a candle at 20 °C in varying ranges of oxygen concentrations and comparing these results to the occurrences of fossil charcoal throughout the Mesozoic ( 250 - 65 million years ago ) , we were able to identify that prolonged periods of low oxygen are unlikely to have occurred , ” says Dr Claire Belcher from the School of Biology and Environmental Science , University College Dublin , the lead author of the report .
“ Low oxygen atmospheres , less than 12 % , are considered to be the primary driver of at least two of the ‘ big five ’ mass - extinction events , ” explains Dr Belcher .
“ But our research findings question that hypothesis and highlight the need for more detailed studies of fossil charcoal across these mass extinction events . ”
This is the first time that research to identify the lower limit of atmospheric oxygen under which combustion can occur have been conducted within fully controlled and realistic environments .
The six walk - in chambers at University College Dublin , funded by EU Marie Curie , enable the realistic reconstruction of environmental conditions from the past .
Listen to article
LIMA , Peru ( Reuters ) - A Peruvian man who last year sliced off his penis to draw attention to his jobless plight on Monday chopped off one of his testicles in front of the parliament building , police and hospital officials said .
``I 'm doing all this to protest my lousy situation , '' Eduardo Veliz , 36 , told doctors after his dramatic stunt .
Veliz , now a poorly paid laborer , hacked off his penis last September outside parliament after failing to meet the Congress head to ask for work .
It was successfully reimplanted .
Witnesses said Veliz shouted at the door of Congress that he wanted to see Congress President Carlos Ferrero .
`` When he could n't see him , he got out a sharp knife and cut off his testicle , '' a policeman , who asked not to be named , told Reuters .
Firefighters rushed over to Veliz , who was bleeding heavily , and he was taken to a hospital where doctors said he suffered a ``traumatic castration '' of the right testicle .
`` He 's a laborer .
Last year he was asking for work ... this time he wanted a pay rise because he says he earns a paltry wage , '' said Carlos Viera , spokesman at the Dos de Mayo hospital which treated Veliz on both occasions .
Peru's President Alejandro Toledo has pledged to create jobs and alleviate the suffering of more than half the nation 's 26 million people who live in poverty .
Despite his mutilation , Viera said Veliz could still enjoy ''a normal sex life . ''

Gmail Labs Canned Responses
By Tony Ruscoe
Yet another experimental feature has just been added to Gmail Labs .
“ Canned Responses ” offers two useful features in one : the ability to store emails as templates and the ability to automatically respond to emails using those templates .
When composing an email , you have the option to save it as a canned response .
You can then use this as either a template for replying to emails manually after you ’ve read them , or you can set up a filter to send the responses automatically based on certain criteria – like if the sender is using a Hotmail address ... ;-)
Although they ’re not shown in the “ Drafts ” view , the canned responses are actually stored as some kind of draft mail in Gmail .
If you use the “ All Mail ” view , you can see they ’re listed with the red “ Draft ” label next to them – but do n’t try to edit them from there as you ’ll either get the “ Unable to locate the canned response ” error message when you try to use them or you ’ll not be able to find them anymore when you reload Gmail .
One extra thing I thought of using this for was custom signatures .
You could create several signatures – e.g. personal , business , without your phone number , etc. – and then use the canned response feature to drop your preferred signature into your mail .
( I thought you could possibly even use this to include images in your signature , but although HTML formatting is allowed , I could n’t get it to save images copied from the web in the canned responses even though Gmail ’s draft messages allow this . )
However , one problem is that loading a canned response clears the content of the original message , so if you ’re replying to an email you ’ve received , if your recipient is n’t able to see a conversation view of the thread like in Gmail , they may not know which email you were replying to if the subject is n’t very clear .
As with all Gmail Labs features , be aware that the “ Canned Responses ” feature may change , break or disappear at any time .

US Feminist Katha Pollitt on Sarah Palin ' Gender Alone Is Not Enough '
Activist and poet Katha Pollitt talks to SPIEGEL about the American women 's movement , her support for Barack Obama and the politics of the Republican vice - presidential nominee .
Stars without enough mass to turn into exploding supernovae end their lives blowing away most of their mass in a non-explosive , but intense stellar wind .
Only a hot stellar core remains in the form of a white dwarf ; the rest of the star is dispersed into the interstellar medium , enriching it with chemically processed elements , such as carbon , that is found in all living organisms on Earth .
These elements were cooked in the stellar furnace during a stellar life span covering billions of years .
The high - energy radiation from the hot white dwarf makes the blown gas to shine for a short period of time , and the result is one of the most colourful and beautiful astronomical objects : a planetary nebula .
The complex history of mass loss
The events which lead to the formation of a planetary nebula develop in two phases that finally induce a structure composed of a denser , inner region – the planetary nebula itself– and an external fainter halo , that consists of the ionized stellar wind .
All together , the blowing of this material is performed in a relatively short time , in astronomical terms , and the planetary nebula is visible only during a few thousand years .
For this reason there are not many of these objects available for study .
External halos of planetary nebulae are faint and difficult to study , but they can provide a wealth of information on the physical properties of the final mass loss stage of the dying star .
Although there is progress in understanding both stellar evolution and mass loss theoretically , observational details of , in particular , the last phase of the mass loss process have remained obscure .
Classical astronomical spectrographs and other instruments are able to study only a few points of such faint and extended objects , making the analysis of these halos an extremely cumbersome , or even impossible task .
Integral field spectroscopy to the rescue
Through the new technique of integral field spectroscopy it is possible to obtain hundreds of spectra across a relatively large area of the sky , and this opens new prospects for the analysis of extended objects , such as planetary nebulae .
Calar Alto Observatory has one of the world 's best integral field spectrographs , PMAS ( Potsdam Multi- Aperture Spectrophotometer ) , attached to its 3.5 m telescope .
In a research article , that was just published in the journal Astronomy and Astrophysics , a research team from the Astrophysical Institute in Potsdam , lead by C. Sandin , has used PMAS to study the two - dimensional structure of a selected set of five planetary nebulae in our Galaxy : the Blue Snowball Nebula ( NGC 7662 ) , M2 - 2 , IC 3568 , the Blinking Planetary Nebula ( NGC 6826 ) and the Owl Nebula ( NGC 3587 ) .
The halos of planetary nebulae revealed
For four of these objects the research team derived a temperature structure , which extended all the way from the central star and out into the halo , and found , in three cases , that the temperature increases steeply in the inner halo .
According to Sandin , " The appearance of such hot halos can be readily explained as a transient phenomenon which occurs when the halo is being ionized . "
Another remarkable result of this study is that it has been possible , for the first time , to measure the mass loss history of the final evolution of the stars which produced the planetary nebulae .
Sandin says that " In comparison to other methods which measure mass loss rates , our estimates are made directly on the gas component of the stellar wind . "
The results allow important insights on how mass is lost in time , and the researchers found that " the mass loss rate increases by a factor of about 4 - 7 during the final , say , 10 000 years of mass loss . "
The research team plans to continue with this study of the final evolutionary phases of low mass stars , and have observed planetary nebulae in the Magellanic Clouds .
As the authors argue " on the theoretical side the results of our studies should provide a challenging basis for further improvement of models of stellar winds . "
We seem to be bombarded constantly by doom and gloom tales of new animals becoming extinct and being told that we should be stopping it – something that is usually impossible for the average person .
I thought it might be nice to show a positive list about extinct animals , so here is my list on the top 10 animals that were thought to be extinct but are actually still around !
10 New Holland Mouse
The New Holland Mouse is a rodent first described in 1843 .
It vanished from view after that and was presumed extinct until it was rediscovered in 1967 .
It is found only in Australia .
The mouse is currently listed as endangered and a number of the populations are now considered extinct – some due to the Ash Wednesday Wildfires in 1983 .
9 Terror Skink
The terror skink ( Phoboscincus bocourti ) was long thought extinct until a specimen was discovered in 2003 in New Caledonia .
The skink measures around 50 cm and has long sharp curved teeth – unusual for a skink as they are normally omnivores .
The only other known example of the skink was also discovered in New Caledonia in 1876 .
8 Giant Palouse Earthworm
The Giant Palouse Earthworm , from North America , was considered to be extinct in the 1980s but recently it has resurfaced .
Little is known about the worm , but what is known is very strange .
It can grow up to 3 feet in length and when handled , gives off a smell like lilies .
The creature is believed to be able to spit in defense .
It is albino in color .
7 Takahe
The Takahe is a flightless bird native to the South Island of New Zealand .
It was thought to be extinct after the last four specimens were taken in 1898 .
After an extensive search for the bird , it was rediscovered near Lake Te Anau in 1948 .
The bird is currently endangered .
Takahes have an unusual eating habit , in which they pluck grass with their beak , grasp it in one claw , and eat only the softest parts at the bottom of the leaf .
They then throw away the rest .
6 Mountain Pygmy Possum
The Mountain Pygmy Possum was first described as a Pleistocene fossil in 1896 .
It was rediscovered alive in 1966 in a ski-hut on Mount Hotham , Australia .
The possum is mouse - sized and is found in dense alpine rocks and boulders .
The female possums live at the top of the mountain while the males live lower down .
In order to mate , the males travel up to the females .
Because they need to cross a road , their survival was in danger , so the Australian government built them a “ tunnel of love ” beneath the road .
5 Gracilidris
Gracilidris is a genus of nocturnal ants that were only know through the fossil record – in fact the only known fossil existing of this ant is a specimen in amber .
The ants were discovered alive and were described in 2006 , but to this day very little is known about them .
The ants live in small colonies and nest in soil .
4 Bermuda Petrel
The Bermuda Petrel , a nocturnal ground - nesting sea-bird , was thought extinct for 330 years .
It is the national bird of Bermuda and was rediscovered in 1951 when 18 pairs were found .
It was believed to have been made extinct after the English settled Bermuda and introduced cats , rats , and dogs .
The bird has an eerie call that caused Spanish sailors to believe the isles were haunted by Devils .
For that reason , they never settled there .
3 Laotian Rock Rat
The Laotian Rock Rat ( also known as the rat squirrel ) was first described in 2005 by a scientist who put it in to its own family of creatures ( Laonastidae ) .
One year later , the classification was disputed by others who believe that the rock rat is actually a member of the extinct family Diatomyidae which vanished in the late Miocene period .
The animals are like large dark rats with tails like a squirrel .
Surprisingly , the first specimens were found on sale as meat at a market in Laos .
2 La Palma Giant Lizard
The La Plama Giant Lizard was thought extinct from 1500 .
It lived in La Palma in the Canary Islands and it is believed that the introduction of cats caused its final downfall .
In 2007 it was rediscovered in its original location despite the belief that the only lizards left in the Canary Islands were on Gran Canaria .
An interesting sidenote is that the islands are named after dogs , not canaries – the name comes from the Latin Insula Canaria which means “ Island of the Dogs ” .
Canary birds are actually named after the islands .
1 The Coelacanth
This entry is number one because it is the coolest – the Coelacanth was thought to be extinct since the end of the Cretaceous period .
In 1938 it was rediscovered in various African nations , making it a Lazarus Taxon – one of a group of organisms that disappears from the fossil record only to come back to life later .
Coelacanths first appear in the fossil record 410 million years ago .
They normally live near the bottom of the ocean floor but have , on some occasions , been caught closer to the surface .
They have been known to grow past fifteen feet long , but there is n’t a single attack record on a human as the fish live so deep .
Anyone who caught the season premieres of “ The Office ” and “ Heroes ” on NBC might have noticed the conspicuous product placement of Apple products .
On “ The Office ” , Jim and Pam video - chatted on a MacBook Pro , while on “ Heroes ” , Hiro Nakamura and his dad both had offices equipped with new iMacs perched on top of their desks .
Apple is n’t just focusing its product placement on a few of NBC ’s biggest hit shows , but rather has a long history of prominent product placement on some of TV ’s most popular shows .
Apple products have shown up on “ House ” , “ 24 ” , “ CSI NY ” , and “ Entourage ” just to name a few .
As services like DVR become more prevalent , consumers are watching fewer and fewer commercials , and product placement is becoming increasingly more significant .
It does n’t matter how funny or creative a commercial is if people are fast forwarding through them .
So how does Apple get its products onto some of todays most popular shows ?
The process is n’t entirely clear , but Apple has repeatedly stated that it does n’t pay for product placement .
The obvious answer is that Apple gives its products away for use in certain productions .
In addition , Apple was one of the first companies to actually hire someone in Hollywood whose job was to get as many eyeballs on Apple products as possible .
The strategic placement of consumer products on TV shows and in movies is quite common now , but it ’s something Apple has been working at and refining for quite some time .
While most product placements typically involve seeing a product in the background , or having a character specifically mention a brand name mid-sentence , Apple products sometimes take center stage in the actual plots of certain TV shows .
For example , in an episode of “ The Office ” where the staff exchange Christmas presents , Michael buys a Video iPod for Ryan the intern .
The iPod soon becomes the sought after gift as the staff begins trading gifts with each other .
On an episode of Family Guy , Stewie does his own version of a silhouetted iPod commercial , and on an episode of Entourage , one of the major plots in an episode involved Turtle and Johnny Drama hanging out at an Apple Store .
Apple is , and has been , so successful at product placement that during a 4 month period in 2006 , The Hollywood Reporter noted that “ Apple iPods , Macs and other products have been featured 250 times on 38 different network primetime shows , including such hits as “ CSI : NY ” and “ The O.C. , ” for a total of 26 minutes of exposure ” .
Make that 26 minutes of free exposure .
Apple ’s product placement is n’t limited to Television as it also has an impressive resume of product placement in some of Hollywood ’s biggest blockbusters such as Independence Day , Zoolander , and Mission Impossible , though Tom Cruise using an Apple product might have a negative impact these days .
But Apple is n’t alone .
Product placement is essentially its own business in Hollywood these days , and one of the more popular trends in advertising .
Though Apple does n’t pay for its product placement , a lot of other companies do , and some TV shows make a significant amount of money from it .
The major networks alone display hundreds of thousands of product placements a year , and take in billions of dollars as a result .
Cable networks are also getting in on the action as product placement is featured prominently on cable shows such as MTV’s “ Real World / Road Rules challenge ” , and Spike TV’s “ The Ultimate Fighter ” .
The fact that Apple is able to achieve such widespread product placement free of charge is an advertisers dream come true .
Apple certainly is n’t the only company who gets free product placement .
But when you consider the quality and number of shows that feature Apple products , and feature them prominently , it becomes clear that Apple is playing the product placement game extremely well .
Apple is n’t the only one benefitting , though .
Product placement is a two way street and is often the result of a mutually beneficial agreement where a show offers to show a product in return for getting that product for free .
But are product placements even effective ?
Not always , but when done right , they ’re extremely effective and can even become well - known pop culture references .
Think back to the DeLorean in “ Back to the Future ” , Reese ’s Pieces in “ E.T. ” , Subway in “ Happy Gilmore ” , Junior Mints on “ Seinfeld ” , and more recently , Sarah Jessica Parker ’s ubiquitous Apple laptop on Sex and the City .
When done right , product placement can have an immediate impact .
The makers of Red Stripe Beer , for example , noted that their U.S sales increased by more than 50 % just a few weeks after being prominently displayed in the 1993 movie “ The Firm ” .
So what is the key to Apple ’s success ?
Maybe people in Hollywood tend to be more mac-centric , or maybe Apple is more intertwined with Hollywood due to its iTunes store which sells an enormous amount of Hollwood content .
As a result , Apple already has numerous channels of communication open with Hollywood ’s biggest companies .
It also ca n’t hurt that Steve Jobs is on the board of directors at Walt Disney Co. – which recently had a hit with “ Wall - E ” , another movie rife with Apple references .
The most likely explanation , however , is simply that Apple works hard at product placement , and is benefited by the fact that its products are more easily recognizable than those of other companies .
As the product placement business continues to grow , expect to see Apple products to pop up in the most unexpected of places .
“ Banji .. have you put on your belt ? ” “ Yes , mother . ” “ Banji .. are you sure ?
” “ Yes , mother .. you can see it for yourself ” , I said while showing the belt I was wearing .
“ HAHAHAHAHA .. I was referring to the seatbelt ” .
And all passengers in the car laughed at me .
Guess what , it ’s been 20 over years , and my mother still bring up that incident once in a while . 🙂
/ end memory
Nobody likes making mistakes .
However our life today can only be better if we learn from the mistake we did yesterday .
There is also no way we can be 100 % free from making mistakes .
So we might as well just accept the fact that we will make mistake and keep learning from it throughout our life .
I believe that there is however another set of mistakes that we need to avoid at all cost – The mistakes we do after making mistakes .
Enlisted below are some of the most common mistakes we usually do after making mistakes .
1 ) Refuse to admit that mistakes had been done
Some people are so egoistic that they will never accept the fact that they had made a mistake .
For this type of people , mistakes are signs of weakness and being the egoist that they are , they will never admit to that .
Another type of people who fall into this category is those who were always in denial after a mistake has been made .
They are so afraid of making mistakes that they deny the mistake ever happened .
These are not the kind of people you want to be around with .
How can we learn from our mistakes if we never actually admit there was one ?
2 ) Try to forget the mistakes
Some mistakes are embarassingly painful .
These will usually be buried deep down in our memory with the hope that it will be forgotten .
Personally , trying to forget our mistake is a very stupid move .
If we forget it , it will be like buying a hideous van and burn it down right away .
People will never notice the van but your money spent to buy the van is loss forever .
Do n’t you value your money ?
3 ) Blame self or others .
This habit has become sort of a built - in habit to everyone .
Once a mistake was done , the first thing people will do is to find whose fault it is .
It will never serve any function except the illusion that the mistake has been solved .
It can be important however to do this if finding the fault will solve the problem .
The worst case scenario is when we are blaming ourselves for the mistake .
Once we do this , believe me , there ’s no way out .
Our mind will use all of its resource to further punish ourselves for the mistake .
It will be like a black hole with no way out .
Do n’t go there .
4 ) No room for forgiveness .
This is sort of related to point 3 .
But it is very significant that it deserve its own number .
Forgiveness is always the hardest thing to do .
We can say anything , read all the books but when your life was screwed up by a person , it will be very hard to forgive him .
That is why , we need to have that room in our heart for forgiveness .
Set up this room in our heart .
We do n’t necessarily need to forgive him right away , but knowing that there ’s a room in there for forgiveness will definitely help later on .
5 ) Justify mistakes
Very similar to point number 1 , the person who make this mistake will come up with justification as to why a mistake was made .
Remember the girl who cried wolf ?
She might made a mistake the first time thinking that she saw a wolf .
And when the villagers came she made excuses that she was just fooling around .
You know how it ended .
Justifying mistakes does not make the mistake go away .
It will not help you learn from it either .
6 ) Refuse to analyze your mistake
Being an engineer , when a problem / mistake occurs in an operation , the first step is always “ redefining the problem ” .
Let say an operator forgot to switch on a pump and ruined the whole operation .
I can straight away scold him or give him a warning letter .
But this will not solve the problem .
If he can forget the first time , the chances are he will forget it again later .
I should study if there were any possibility the pump can be run automatically and thus removing the problem altogether .
Or maybe put up a checklist to help the operator remember .
Analyzing mistake is the most important things to do right after a mistake has been made .
If not the mistake made will serve no purpose and you will find that your life is just one big boring loop where the same mistake is being repeated everyday
– I wonder –
What ’s your biggest shareable mistake in your life ?
— — — – Personal Note — — ——
–
My biggest shareable mistake in life is when I was in my final year .
I literally spent all my time chatting on IRC .
I failed a subject and did poorly on others .
That for me is my most expensive lesson in life .
I made a lot of good friends though ..
I just need to manage my priorities better .

How lessons from frogs could boost supplies of transplant livers
Copy - frog : Scientists believe cooling transplant livers slowly , the way a frog cools down during hibernation , could protect them and boost supplies
A hibernating technique used by frogs could boost the supply of transplant livers , reports say .
Scientists have pioneered a process that freezes the organ very slowly , as some frogs do when they hibernate , to prevent the formation of damaging ice crystals .
They have already tested the system by successfully freezing , thawing and transplanting a pig 's liver .
If human livers are found to survive the process , more of the organs would be made available to patients .
Transplant livers deteriorate rapidly without a blood supply , becoming useless after between 12 and 24 hours .
Some frog species employ a similar slow - cooling technique when they allow parts of their bodies to freeze during hibernation .
Dr Amir Arav , who developed the new freezing method at the Israeli Agricultural Research Organisation in Bet - Dagan , told New Scientist magazine : " We did n't invent this process , nature did . "
His team cooled the pig's liver at a rate of 0.3C per minute , reducing its temperature to minus 20 C in about an hour - and - a - half .
The liver was then allowed to thaw for 20 minutes before being transplanted into another pig .
The animal 's original liver was left in place .
After about two hours the pig was killed and analysis of the transplanted liver showed its cells were alive .
Dr David Winter , president of Human BioSystems , a company in Palo Alto , California , that is looking at organ freezing , said it would have been better if the transplant liver had been tested on its own .
" One pig liver in a piggyback transplant is not very convincing as there 's no evidence the thawed liver can really support the animal , " he said .
Dr Arav said his work had been restricted by animal welfare regulations .
He hopes to evaluate how long livers can be stored , and work out the best storage temperature .
The team also found that rat livers stored at minus 80 C for up to three weeks regained function , although they were not transplanted into living animals .
Rat hearts , human ovaries connected to fallopian tubes , and parts of human knee joints have also been frozen by Dr Arav .
( Well , it looks like our file - upload tool is in a mischievous mood tonight , so that ambitious 26 - song mp3 post I was planning for today will have to be delayed .
Great .
My post is due in 7 hours and I 've gotta start from scratch .
What can I fall back on ? )
Oh yeah -- beer .
OK , this one goes out to Adler .
In the movies , nobody ever says " gimme a Michelob " , or " a Corona " , or even " a Saison Dupont " .
No , it 's always just " a beer " .
( Or , in rare cases , " a Heineken " . )
Last night , I said " gimme a Saison Dupont " , and I felt like an asshole .
Could I have asked for that in a more colloquial way ?
Probably .
Here are a few snooty brews that have already made the trip through my beerbelfish .
Kasteel - " Gimme a Whimsey Beer "
This 11 % ABV whopper is whimsey beer , so named for the emails it inspires me to write , and the insipid little dances it inspires me to dance around the kitchen .
Mike Lupica and Liz Berg will testify to the emails ; no one but my dog is party to the dance .
Foret - " Gimme a Devendra Beer " ( or " Espers Beer " )
This one gets its " gimme a " name from its label , as you 'll plainly see .
This is the beer label of the new weird americana , and it happens to be what I 'm drinking as I write this .
Mmmm mmmm - bartender , gimme an acoustic guitar !
Kwak - " Quack "
This one presents the opposite problem .
The sort of establishment that would carry this super - sweet Belgian brew is n't likely to hire a bartender who plays well with patrons who quack at him / her .
Nice beer though !
Reeeeeally brown , if a little puckery .
But what 's with the hourglass - at - the - gallows contraption it comes in ?
BUD - Now that the Belgians own it , I expect you all to order your next Budweiser by demanding " gimme a liquid corn vomit " .
Oh , and hey - happy Halloween .
A DRUNKEN teacher went on a wrecking spree at a castle during a riotous stag night .
Thomas McMahon , 34 , wreaked havoc at 13th - century Caverswall Castle before grappling with millionaire owner Robin MacDonald .
The primary school teacher , from Tyldesley , near Leigh , caused thousands of pounds ' damage before he was eventually found ' dangling ' out of his window in an ' incoherent ' state by police .
He now faces the sack and was ordered to pay almost £ 4,000 after his night of shame .
Magistrates heard how an ' extremely drunk '
McMahon was first spotted by Mr MacDonald being lowered from a neighbouring hotel room into his Staffordshire castle 's courtyard .
Mr MacDonald , who had been awoken by the commotion , said he shouted to McMahon as he was concerned for his safety .
But he was met with rude gestures by the stag group and called police .
McMahon , the best man , then trampled across the roof of his Vauxhall Vectra , causing £ 350 damage .
His midnight rampage was n't finished there .
McMahon , of Wardley Road , then ' stumbled and staggered ' towards a Grade II - listed staircase leading up to the castle .
On his way up he booted a stone boulder off the banister , sending it tumbling down the stairs .
Mr MacDonald came out of the castle to confront McMahon , and the pair tussled on the courtyard floor .
Sandra Whitehurst , prosecuting , told North Staffordshire magistrates : " McMahon came to him with both arms swinging to try to land a punch .
Mr MacDonald had to take hold of him and it ended up in a scuffle . "
Police , who arrived to find McMahon dangling out of his hotel window , described him as ' incoherent ' on his arrest .
He claimed he could not remember the incident because of the amount of alcohol he had consumed .
Andrew Bennett , defending , said : " He has no recollection and is aghast at what has taken place . "
McMahon admitted two counts of criminal damage and one of common assault .
He was ordered to pay £ 97 costs , £ 3,606 compensation for the damage and £ 75 compensation for the assault .
At home , he said he regretted his actions and was very worried he would lose his job .
Mr MacDonald , 37 , who appeared in the M.E.N. after meeting his fiancée on the internet , slammed the teacher 's behaviour .
" It 's no wonder the kids are as unruly as they are today if the teachers are setting this kind of impression , " he said .
" I 've never had an apology from him and I think he 's only upset he got prosecuted .
He came on to my property , and caused irreparable damage to a 16th - century staircase - a listed building in itself . "
WASHINGTON ( Reuters ) - The Bush administration and Congress on Sunday ramped up talks on an unprecedented $ 700 billion bank bailout as they battled the clock to prevent further financial market turmoil that risks hurtling the economy into a deep and damaging recession .
The plan for the largest - ever bank rescue would give sweeping powers to the U.S.
Treasury to buy up toxic mortgage - related debt from financial firms , including U.S. subsidiaries of foreign banks .
Democratic leaders in Congress promised swift action , but also want to throw a lifeline to homeowners , not just Wall Street .
With the economy issue No. 1 in an election less than six weeks away , lawmakers are striving to get a plan in place by week ’s end , fearful that delay could send markets reeling .
“ This is a new phenomenon for every major player in this place and there are no dress rehearsals .
That is why the market is so jittery .
This has to work the first time , ” said Peter Kenny , managing director at Knight Equity Markets in Jersey City , New Jersey .
Two key questions remained unanswered even after Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson appeared on four television talk shows to press his case for emergency action .
What price will the United States pay for these toxic debts , which have spawned the worst financial storm since the Great Depression ?
When will it start buying them ?
“ I ’m confident that the credit market will improve but it will improve slowly .
It just seems a lot of details have not been answered yet , ” said Jack Ablin , chief investment officer with Harris Private Bank in Chicago .
Paulson painted the proposed market intervention as a necessary evil , arguing the consequences of inaction would be so dire that the large burden on taxpayers would be worth it .
“ This is not something that we wanted to do .
This was something that was very necessary , ” Paulson said on the NBC Sunday program “ Meet the Press . ”
“ We did this to protect the taxpayer . ”
DEMOCRATS SEEK AID FOR MAIN STREET
Democrats , who control both chambers of Congress , began to swap proposals with the Treasury in a bid to ensure any rescue plan balances Wall Street ’s interests with those of Main Street , while putting checks on the nearly unfettered power the administration sought for the Treasury secretary .
“ Democrats believe a responsible solution should include independent oversight , protections for homeowners and constraints on excessive executive compensation , ” said California Democratic Rep. Nancy Pelosi , the Speaker of the House of Representatives .
A list of proposed changes given to Treasury by the staff of the House Financial Services Committee sought limits on the compensation of executives of firms offloading assets , greater efforts to stem foreclosures , and oversight by the Comptroller General -- the government ’s main auditor .
“ It ’s ... hard to tell the average American that we ’re going to continue to have foreclosures that destabilize neighborhoods and deprive cities of revenues they need , but we ’re going to buy up the bad paper , ” committee Chairman Barney Frank said on CBS ’
“ Face the Nation . ”
There was similar sentiment among Democrats in the Senate .
“ We totally understand the gravity of the moment ... but you cannot just turn over $ 700 billion of taxpayer money and not insist that the taxpayer is going to be protected , ” Senate Banking Committee Chairman Christopher Dodd told reporters .
Dodd and New York Sen. Charles Schumer , a member of the Senate Democratic leadership , both said having the government receive warrants to buy equity in companies selling off assets could protect taxpayers .
“ I ’m looking at something , and I ’ve talked to Paulson about this -- warrants that would put the federal government first , ” Schumer said on “ Fox News Sunday . ”
OVERCOMING DIFFERENCES
Even as negotiations got under way , Schumer and Senate Republican Whip Jon Kyl predicted lawmakers would quickly resolve their differences and were likely to pass a bill by week ’s end .
“ The chances are better than 50 - 50 that we will get it done by the end of the week , ” Kyl said on Fox .
Paulson said the final cost of the bailout should fall well short of the $ 700 billion initial price tag since the government would be able to hold the debt until markets stabilize and prices recover .

“ This is the least costly path , ” he said on CBS .
If the Treasury tapped its full authority , the bailout would put every man , woman and child in the United States on the hook for more than $ 2,000 .
To cover the cost , Treasury asked Congress to hike the government ’s debt limit to $ 11.3 trillion from $ 10.6 trillion .
The administration and Federal Reserve have already taken several other emergency steps to try to prevent growing credit strains from engulfing the entire financial system and economy .
A $ 700 billion fund would push the total pledged to combat the crisis to $ 1.8 trillion , or $ 15,000 per U.S. household .
HEDGE FUNDS NEED NOT APPLY
Initially , the Treasury proposed buying assets only from companies based in the United States , but Paulson laid out the case for a broader mandate to ensure credit was flowing .
Slideshow ( 17 images )
“ If a financial institution has business operations in the United States , hires people in the United States , if they are clogged with illiquid assets , they have the same impact on the American people as any other institution , ” he said on the ABC program “ This Week . ”
The Treasury chief confirmed that hedge funds -- investment vehicles for the wealthy -- would not be eligible .
While aimed at mortgage assets , the administration ’s plan would even let the Treasury acquire assets from nonfinancial firms and assets not tied to mortgages if needed to promote market stability .
The bailout plan follows a wrenching week that transformed Wall Street with Lehman Brothers ’ failure , the agreed sale of Merrill Lynch & Co and a government takeover of ailing insurer AIG .
It was also possible that within days , Morgan Stanley -- one of the two remaining U.S. investment banks -- would accept a partner .
FOCUSING ON TROUBLED HOME LOANS
The plan was hatched amid grave concerns that other major banks could collapse and that credit markets were close to freezing , threatening the U.S. and global economy .
“ We have a global financial system and we are talking very aggressively with other countries around the world , and encouraging them to do similar things , and I believe a number of them will , ” Paulson said on ABC .
Lawmakers said Paulson and Fed Chairman Ben Bernanke had offered starkly grave assessments of the economic cost of inaction in private briefings .
“ What they told us was the contagion here and the depression in the market was such that you were going to see a shutdown of the lending businesses not just on Wall Street ” but for all Americans , Frank said on CBS .
Bernanke on Sunday was talking by phone and meeting in person with Treasury officials and lawmakers , while Paulson also was working the phones as counterproposals emerged .
Financial markets responded positively last week as news of a large - scale financial bailout spread .
Stock markets worldwide added more than $ 1.5 trillion in value on Friday , the largest one - day advance ever and a sign of the vital importance of the plan to global markets and investor confidence .
It was still unclear , however , whether the bailout would be enough to pull the U.S. economy out of the doldrums .
“ I wo n’t bet against the American people ...
We will work through this , ” Paulson said on NBC .
“ I would n’t bet against the long - term fundamentals of the U.S. economy . ”
Take - Two Will Remain Independent
" Our strong cash position -- with no debt and an undrawn $ 140 million credit facility -- gives us the financial flexibility to continue to do what we do best : innovate and create the great games that our customers have come to expect , " said CEO Ben Feder .
In addition to its ownership of the Grand Theft Auto and BioShock brands and their respective developers , Take - Two 's portfolio includes such notable items as the ever - profitable Carnival Games series , the Max Payne property , and the Sid Meier 's Civilization franchise along with developer Firaxis .
On Russia , at least , Gordon Brown , David Cameron and Nick Clegg think alike .
Belatedly and perhaps emptily , all three party leaders have condemned the invasion of Georgia and demanded a tough response .
Yet a different and even odder alliance is taking shape on the other side .
Its members include such unlikely figures as Andrew Murray of Stop the War Coalition , David Davies , the Tory MP for Monmouth , and historian Correlli Barnett , as well as anonymous but influential City bankers and lawyers .
The Kremlin's most constant allies are the old pro-Soviet left : people such as Bob Wareing , the veteran leftwing MP for Liverpool , West Derby .
He recalls warmly the wartime alliance with Stalin 's Soviet Union , and the promise of social justice in the communist system .
In the Morning Star , Andrew Murray blames the war in Georgia on American imperialism and contrasts it with the success of " Soviet nationalities policy " in promoting " the cultural , linguistic and educational development of each ethnic group , no matter how small or how historically marginalised " .
Chechens , Crimean Tatars and other victims of Stalin 's murderous deportation policies presumably do n't count .
A simpler approach is pure Russophilia : people who love Russia 's culture or language , and rejoice in what seems to be a national rebirth under Vladimir Putin .
A wider group is sparked chiefly by anti-Americanism .
If you hate George W Bush then you may cast a friendly glance on the people who make life difficult for him , such as Hugo Chávez of Venezuela , or Putin in Russia .
It is countries such as Russia , however spiky and unattractive , that can derail the new world order .
Yet that 's odd .
If , say , you feel that Muslims get a hard deal from America , then surely the Russian torture camps in Chechnya should make your blood boil ?
In odd alliance with the anti-globalists are the champions of international business : those who do well out of selling goods and services to Russia .
In the City , investment banks , law firms , accountants and consultants have enjoyed a bonanza thanks to their Russian clients .
Auditors such as PricewaterhouseCoopers have not flinched at doing the Kremlin 's dirty work - for example in withdrawing their audit of Yukos , once Russia 's biggest oil company , which conveniently coincided with Kremlin allegations of fraud .
For this pinstriped fifth column , business is business , and worries about human rights or the rule of law are tiresome distractions .
David Wilshire , a leading Conservative member of the Council of Europe parliamentary assembly , has lobbied hard to make Mikhail Margelov , a pro-Putin Russian parliamentarian who used to be a KGB language instructor , the next president of the organisation , which is supposedly devoted to promoting human rights .
Then come those such as the polemical Peter Hitchens , who have no great liking for tycoons , but a deep admiration for the nation - state .
He writes : " I often wish we were more like Russia , aggressively defending our interests , making sure we owned our own crucial industries , killing terrorists instead of giving in to them , running our own foreign policy instead of trotting two feet behind George W Bush . "
Russia , he says , has come to stand for national sovereignty and independence , while we give up our own .
Correlli Barnett praises the regime in Russia in a similar vein .
In the past few days , for example , Barnett has said : " World peace ?
Give me Putin any day ! " ; and " the West should jettison moral indignation and global do - goodery as the basis of policy , and instead emulate Russia 's admirable reversion to 19th - century realpolitik " .
The main motive here is dislike for the whole apparatus of modern diplomacy - multilateral organisations governed by international treaties and at least a notional commitment to human rights .
It is all very odd .
Russia is an oil - fuelled fascist kleptocracy ruled by secret police goons and their cronies .
It is authoritarian : critics risk forcible incarceration in psychiatric hospitals , or are simply murdered - such as the shooting dead in police custody of Magomed Yevloyev , an Ingush journalist , this week .
It is imperialist : bullying neighbours with oil and gas cut - offs , let alone the occupation of Georgia , where Russia 's proxies have practised ethnic cleansing on a scale that recalls the atrocities of the wars in former Yugoslavia .
And it is deeply corrupt and lawless : something that even Putin 's successor as president , Dmitry Medvedev , has acknowledged publicly .
However bad other countries may be , it is hard to find anything there worth emulating .

Google Suggest , a feature that offers auto - completed phrases when composing a search query , has become the latest product to graduate from the company 's testing grounds .
Already present in a plethora of Google 's other products , Google Suggest now helps you figure out that search term on the tip of your tongue with help from Google.com .
Launched as one of Google 's famous " 20 percent projects " back in 2004 , Google Suggest debuted with its own specific URL and an inconspicuous search box .
The idea behind the feature is that Google 's search box can help you search more efficiently by filling in blanks , completing phrases , or correcting spelling before you ever hit the Return key .
Apparently Google noticed that that the know - it - all " Did you mean ? " suggestion link that appears above search results from misspelled queries was getting on our collective nerves .
The strange thing about Google Suggest 's journey to the One Searchbox to Rule Them All is that many products from Google and others were quick to adopt it .
Google Toolbar , Maps , Web Search ( in select countries ) , Google 's iPhone and BlackBerry apps , and YouTube all adopted Google Suggest 's type - ahead advantages some time ago .
Even Firefox 's search box and countless other products from affiliates and competitors all began using it .
Judging from today 's announcement on the Official Google Blog , Google Suggest 's feature set has n't changed much in the four years since its debut in Google Labs .
The three primary focuses of the feature as a whole are to " help formulate queries " by fleshing out incomplete phrases , " reduce spelling errors " by automatically fixing them in the suggestion drop - down area , and " save keystrokes " by predicting what you 're going to type .
We 've used the features in the past and their wide adoption in other products means they 're a no - brainer for increasing search efficiency .
We can't get our hands on their current implementation , however , as Katie Watson , a representative from Google 's Global Communications & Public Affairs , told Ars Technica that " This feature is gradually rolling out over the course of this week .
Some people might not be able to see it until as late as Friday , so it could take some time . "
So if you 're dying to have Google suggest search terms , you may have to wait a few more days .
Hayden Panettiere
A teen queen she may be , but the star of the hit show Heroes is already making quite a name for herself as an environmental and animal activist .
Panettiere made international news when she was issued an arrest warrant in Japan after protesting against whale and dolphin hunting in that country .
She was subsequently given a a Genesis Award ( which honors those in the entertainment industry who help spread the message of compassion for animals ) by the Humane Society for her efforts .
A few months later , she was back in action on behalf of animals , donating the clothes off her back to raise money and awareness for the Save the Whales Again Campaign .
She 's also been snapped by the paparazzi carrying reusable grocery bags - to her SUV , though , proving she still has some green lessons to learn .
CHICAGO ( MarketWatch ) -- Almost 40 million people watched Sen. Barack Obama 's acceptance of the Democratic presidential nomination on Thursday night , according to Nielsen Media Research .
That figure , which includes both broadcast and cable networks , is nearly twice the four - day average of the 2004 Democratic National Convention .
And with 7.6 million black viewers , the event was the fifth most - watched nonsports program among African - Americans in 11 years , Nielsen added .
Jennifer Hudson's Mother and Brother Murdered : 7 - Year - Old Nephew Missing
's mother and brother were found murdered in Chicago today .
A cousin who lives nearby found the bodies of 57 - year - old Darnell Donerson and her son Jason in Donerson 's home on the South Side of Chicago .
Both had been shot to death .
Officers were called to the 7000 block of Yale Avenue in the Englewood neighborhood just before 3 p.m. and the home was declared a crime scene .
Police have also issued an all points bulletin for Hudson 's 7 - year - old nephew Julian King ( pictured below ) , who may have been taken from the scene .
Police are looking for a man known as " William . "
He has braids in his hair , and could be driving a 1994 white Chevy Suburban with license plate X584859 .
Jennifer Hudson was in Florida when she heard the news and is currently en route to Chicago .

Visualize real - time data streams with Gnuplot
( September 2008 )
For the last couple of years , I 've been working on European Space Agency ( ESA ) projects - writing rather complex code generators .
In the ESA project I am currently working on , I am also the technical lead ; and I recently faced the need to ( quickly ) provide real - time plotting of streaming data .
Being a firm believer in open - source , after a little Googling I found Gnuplot .
From my ( somewhat limited ) viewpoint , Gnuplot appears to be the LaTEX equivalent in the world of graphs : amazing functionality that is also easily accessible .
Equally important , Gnuplot follows the powerful paradigm that UNIX established : it comes with an easy to use scripting language , thus allowing its users to prescribe actions and " glue " Gnuplot together with other applications - and form powerful combinations .
To that end , I humbly submit a little creation of mine : a Perl script that spawns instances of Gnuplot and plots streaming data in real - time .
Plotting data in real - time Plotting data in real - time
Interfacing over standard input
My coding experience has taught me to strive for minimal and complete interfaces : to that end , the script plots data that will arrive over the standard input , one sample per line .
The samples are just numbers ( integers / floating point numbers ) , and must be prefixed with the stream number ( " 0 : " , " 1 : " , etc ) .
Each plot window will also be configured to display a specific number of samples .
The resulting script is relatively simple - and easy to use :
bash ./driveGnuPlots.pl
Usage : ./driveGnuPlots.pl < options > where options are ( in order ) : NumberOfStreams
How many streams to plot ( windows ) Stream1_WindowSampleSize < Stream2 ...>
This many window samples for each stream Stream1_Title < Stream2_Title > ...
Title used for each stream ( Optional ) Stream1_geometry <...>.
Sizes and positions in pixels
The last parameters ( the optionally provided geometries of the gnuplot windows ) are of the form : WIDTHxHEIGHT+XOFF +YOFF
An example usage scenario : plotting sine and cosine
# !/ usr / bin / perl - w use strict ; use Time :: HiRes qw / sleep /; # First , set the standard output to auto - flush select ( ( select ( STDOUT ) , $ | = 1 ) [ 0 ] ) ; #
And loop 5000 times , printing values ... my $ offset = 0.0 ; while ( 1 ) { print " 0 : " . sin ( $ offset ) . "
" ; print " 1 : " . cos ( $ offset ) . "
" ; $ offset += 0.1 ; if ( $ offset > 500 ) { last ; } sleep ( 0.02 ) ; }
Note that the script uses the " autoscale " feature of GnuPlot , to automatically adapt to the incoming value ranges .
Let 's say we want to see a sine and a cosine run side - by - side , in real - time .
We also want to watch the cosine " zooming - in " by 10 x ( time - scale wise ) .
The following code will print our test samples :
We 'll use this code to test our plotting script : the data for two streams ( sine and cosine ) are printed in the expected format : one sample ( one number ) printed per line .
To distinguish between the two streams , the sample is prefixed with " 0 : " , " 1 : " , etc .
Notice that we explicitly set the autoflush flag for our standard output : we need the data output to be unbuffered , otherwise our plotting script will receive data in bursts ( when the data are flushed from the producer ) , and the plots will " jerk " forward .
This is how we test the plotting script ( assuming we saved the sample code above in sinuses.pl ) : <
bash $ ./sinuses.pl | ./driveGnuPlots.pl 2 50 500 " Sine " " Cosine "
To stop the plotting , use Ctrl - C on the terminal you spawned from .
The parameters we passed to driveGnuPlots.pl are :
2 is the number of streams
The window for the first stream ( sine ) will be 50 samples wide
The window for the second stream ( cosine ) will be 500 samples wide ( hence the different " zoom " factor )
The titles of the two streams follow
When executed , the script spawns one gnuplot per each stream , and displays the graphs in a clear , flicker - free manner .
If you do n't like the Gnuplot settings I used ( e.g. the grid , or the colors , or ... ) feel free to change them : the setup code that defines the plotting parameters starts at line 82 of the script .
Executive summary : plotting streaming data is now as simple as selecting them out from your " producer " program ( filtering its standard output through any means you wish : grep , sed , awk , etc ) , and outputing them , one number per line .
Just remember to prefix with the stream number ( " 0 : " , " 1 : " , etc , to allow for multiple streams ) , and make sure you flush your standard output , e.g .
For this kind of output : bash $ / path/to/programName ...( other stuff ) Measure : 7987.3 ...( other stuff ) Measure : 8364.4 Measure : 8128.1 ...
You would do this : bash $ / path/to/programName | \ grep -- line - buffered '^ Measure : ' | \ awk - F : '{ printf ( " 0: %f
" , $ 2 ) ; fflush ( ) ; } ' | \ driveGnuPlots.pl 1 50 " My data "
grep
awk
-- line - buffered
fflush ( )
Preparing for a demo
bash $ ./sinus.pl | ./driveGnuPlots.pl 2 50 50 Sinus Cosinus 512x384+0+0 512x384+512+0
In the code above , filters out the lines that start with " Measure : " , andselects the 2nd column ( $ 2 ) and prefixes it with " 0 : " ( since this is the 1st - and only , in this example - stream we will display ) .
Notice that we used the proper options to force the standard output 's flushing for both grep ( ) and awk ( called ) .
You do n't want to move the GnuPlot windows after they are shown , do you ?
So you can just specify their placement , in " WIDTHxHEIGHT+XOFF +YOFF " format ( in pixels ) :
The provisioning of titles and GnuPlot window placement information , makes the script very well - suited for live demonstrations .
P.S. UNIX power in all its glory : it took me 30 min to code this , and another 30 to debug it .
Using pipes to spawned copies of gnuplots , we are able to do something that would require one or maybe two orders of magnitude more effort in any conventional programming language ( yes , even accounting for custom graph libraries - you do have to learn their API and do your windows / interface handling ... )
Update , November 30 , 2009 : Andreas Bernauer has improved the script further , allowing multiple streams to be plotted in the same window .
His work is here
Update , December 20 , 2009 : Dima Kogan has done his own version , which detects the number of streams dynamically .
He placed : Dima Kogan has done his own version , which detects the number of streams dynamically .

Your President just spoke from the White House to assure us that a deal will be done .
I suspect Bush ’s statement , at 9:35ish , was timed to coincide with the opening of the stock market .
Yes , he said “ It ’s hard work . ”
That was his trademark line about Iraq during the 2004 debates .
More Bush this morning :
The legislative process is sometimes not very pretty .
But , we are going to get a package passed .
We will rise to the occasion .
Republicans and Democrats will come together and pass a substantial rescue plan .
Such a leader .
Do n’t you feel assured ?

BBC News , Nairobi
Nancy
Akoth is four months pregnant and like many women in her state has strange cravings .
Some women eat coal , gherkins or soap but Mrs Akoth craves soft stones , known in Kenya , where she lives , as " odowa " .
" I just have this urge to eat these stones .
I do very crazy things , I would even wake up at night and go looking for them , " she told the BBC .
" I consulted my doctor and all he told me is that maybe I 'm lacking iron and gave me medication on iron , but I still have the urge to eat those stones . "
Luckily for Mrs Akoth , she is not alone in craving stones and they are easily found on sale in Nairobi 's sprawling Gikomba market .
It can actually cause things like kidney damage and liver damage , if you do n't take enough fluid
Alice Ndong , nutritionist Among the fish - mongers and dealers in second - hand goods who flock to the market are traders who specialise in odowa .
Stone - seller Stephen Ndirangu unsurprisingly says women are his main customers .
" Most of them buy the stones to go and sell them to women who are pregnant , " Mr Ndirangu says .
He says he sells one 90kg sack for about $ 6 .
' Pleasant taste '
Although they are stones , they are too soft to break the teeth of Mrs Akoth and her fellow cravers .
Nutritionist Alice Ndong says the stones have a bland taste .
" It 's a pleasant taste .
It does n't have a tangy flavour or a salty or a sugary flavour .
It 's a bit like eating flour , " she told the BBC .
I can not do without it
Sylvia Moi
She says that because of their abrasive nature , the stones actually clean the teeth as the stone is chewed and the finer particles pass through the mouth .
However , she warns this should not be used as an excuse to eat the stones as the habit can also have harmful consequences .
" If somebody eats those stones and they do n't take enough water , then they will actually get severe constipation
It can actually be very dangerous , " she says .
" It can actually cause things like kidney damage and liver damage , if you do n't take enough fluid because it will form a mass that cannot be excreted . "
" When you eat these stones , it 's like eating metal .
The particles - because it's not food - are not digested as finely as fruits or vegetables , " she says .
' Irresistible '
The phenomenon of craving non-food items like soil or soft stones is referred to as pica , a Latin word for magpie , the bird notorious for eating almost anything .
Researchers from the University of Nigeria interviewed 1,071 pregnant women attending a prenatal clinic at the Pumwani Maternity Hospital in Nairobi .
At least 800 of those interviewed said they ate soil , stones and other non-food items during their pregnancy .
But it is not only those who are pregnant who indulge in this habit .
Sylvia
Moi still finds the soft stones irresistible , 14 years after she gave birth .
" I can not do without it ...
Walking without it makes me feel bad , as if I 'm lacking something [ or ]
I 'm hungry , " Mrs Moi says .
She says she would like to quit the habit but just cannot stop herself .
" When you eat it you look awkward , people think : ' What is it that you lack in you that makes you eat that awkward stone , ' " she says .
Infection Experts say that the craving to eat odowa is largely due to a deficiency of vital minerals , like calcium , in the body .
" Unfortunately , these stones do n't offer a lot of calcium .
They offer some other forms of minerals like magnesium but not much calcium , " says Mrs Ndong .
Research shows that these habits have negative side - effects on the women 's health , ranging from parasitic infestations , anaemia and intestinal complications " The problem with these stones is sometimes they 're not hygienic .
I remember up - country I 've seen people just go somewhere , dig up and maybe people urinate in that spot , " she says .
Experts warn pregnant women and others who enjoy eating odowa to try to ignore these cravings for the sake of their health .
The researchers say that the women are better off eating a balanced diet , than remaining hooked to the myth that their changing bodies need soft stones and soil .

More than 70 firearms and thousands of rounds of ammunition found after suicide of UVF veteran Billy Bell
This article is more than 11 years old
This article is more than 11 years old
More than 70 firearms and thousands of rounds of ammunition have been recovered from the house of a loyalist terrorist in Belfast .
Sources told the Guardian today that the discovery was made after the suicide of Billy Bell , an Ulster Volunteer Force ( UVF ) veteran , who shot himself in the Ballysillan area of north Belfast last weekend .
A note at Bell 's home led the Police Service of Northern Ireland to the munitions .
More firearms were found at a lock - up garage .
Loyalist sources said Bell , who had cancer , left the note near his body saying where the firearms could be found .
They said the weaponry was a large proportion of the UVF 's weaponry in north Belfast .
The discovery is a huge embarrassment for the UVF - the oldest loyalist terror group in Northern Ireland - and its political wing , the Progressive Unionist party .
Last year the UVF declared its " war " was over and that it had stopped recruiting and gathering intelligence .
It said it had put its weapons " beyond use " , although no independent observers verified this .
The Sinn Fein assembly member Gerry Kelly said : " The obvious question that nationalists across north Belfast will be asking is what the UVF were doing with 70 guns and a large amount of ammunition in the city anyway , 14 years after the UVF declared a ceasefire .
" If anything , this find reinforces the fact that continued pressure , especially from the British government and the unionist parties , needs to be brought to bear on loyalist paramilitaries to once and for all get their deadly arsenal off the streets . "
Billy Hutchinson , the UVF 's link to the international decommissioning body , said : " First and foremost a man has died and his family will be grieving at this time , it is important we acknowledge and respect that .
" In relation to the weapons , I have made initial enquiries and will continue to pursue that throughout the day with the hope of making a full statement at a later time . "
A spokeswoman for the Northern Ireland police service said officers were examining the firearms and ammunition .
Bell 's funeral was scheduled to take place at noon today .
A relative warned reporters to stay away .
HIV is a huge problem in Africa A gene which apparently evolved to protect people from malaria increases their vulnerability to HIV infection by 40 % , say US and UK scientists .
People of African descent have a variation of the " DARC " gene which may interfere with their ability to fight HIV in its early stages .
The Cell Host and Microbe study says the gene accounts for millions of extra HIV cases in sub-Saharan Africa .
However , people with the gene appear to live longer with HIV than others .
There has always been this myth that people in sub-Saharan Africa were more likely to get HIV because of differences in their sexual behaviour , or that they are more promiscuous
Dr Ade Fakoya
International HIV / AIDS
Alliance
While the differences in HIV prevalence in different parts of the world can be partly explained by different social conditions and sexual behaviour , scientists have long suspected that there may be genetic reasons why the virus is rife in certain communities .
Research at University College London and the University of Texas focused on the Duffy Antigen Receptor for Chemokines ( DARC ) gene .
The gene influences the levels of chemicals called chemokines , which play a role in the body 's defences against viruses , and a variation is held by approximately 90 % of Africans .
The origins of the variation are unclear , but it is thought to have evolved in response to widespread malaria outbreaks by offering protection against that disease .
The researchers did not use volunteers living in Africa , but analysed data from a 25 - year study of Americans from different ethnic backgrounds with HIV .
They calculated that , after taking account of social and economic differences , people with the genetic variation were 40 % more likely to be susceptible to the illness .
If the gene variant were not present in sub-Saharan Africa , they said , they would expect to see approximately an 11 % lower burden of HIV in the region .
An estimated 24.5 million people are living with the disease there , and there are approximately 2 million deaths per year .
Survival mystery However , paradoxically , having the variant could mean that the disease , once caught , does not advance as quickly .
People who carry it survive on average an extra two years longer than those who do not , said the researchers .
The precise reasons for both the any extra vulnerability to HIV , and the increased lifespan of HIV - infected people , are not clear , with the scientists suggesting a " complex interplay " between levels of the protein expressed by DARC , levels of chemokines , and levels of the virus .
Professor Robin Weiss , from UCL , one of the researchers , said : " The big message here is that something that protected against malaria in the past is now leaving the host more susceptible to HIV . "
Dr Ade Fakoya , from the International HIV / AIDS Alliance , said that the findings could explain why some countries had a much higher prevalence of the disease .
He said : " There has always been this myth that people in sub-Saharan Africa were more likely to get HIV because of differences in their sexual behaviour , or that they are more promiscuous .
" This shows that it 's not that simple , and I think it will be an important message for education programmes in these areas . "
People who carry a gene for the blood cell abnormality sickle cell trait are also known to be protected against malaria .

Inmates at the women 's prison include convicted murderers
Restrictions on parties in prisons have been announced after a newspaper published photos of a " horror " theme party at London 's Holloway jail .
The pictures , which appeared in the Sun , showed women prisoners in Hallowe 'en - style outfits in 2007 .
The Ministry of Justice ( MoJ ) said the party was " completely unacceptable " .
A spokeswoman said Justice Secretary Jack Straw had ordered that such events " wo n't happen again at Holloway or any other prison " in England and Wales .
Fancy dress
" The event last year was n't justified , " the spokeswoman said .
The ban would apply to events which were " out of normal routine and with absolutely no justification , " she added .
The pictures show women in fancy dress including vampire , witch and devil costumes .
Some are daubed with fake blood .
Inmates at the women 's prison in north London include convicted murderers .
But the Ministry of Justice would not confirm the Sun 's claim that the party was held in Holloway 's Life Sentence Unit .
Brian Caton , general secretary of the Prison Officers Association , said the story did little for the " credibility of either the prison governor , [ or ] the prison staff " .
He told the BBC : " It does n't do anything as far as I can see on the rehabilitation or the safe custody of prisoners .
It just seems to me plainly stupid . "
It 's entirely possible that Mike Brown overdosed on ADD meds :
These brass goggles scream " attention to detail " .
And they 're frickin ' awesome .
Some numbers :
The leather is actually bolted to the eyepieces , using 48 tiny bolts plus another four for the nosepiece .
The leather was chosen for the tanning process which should give it a klife of a few thousand years .
Ditto the eyepieces , which are machines from titanium and coated with Titanium Nitride .
Predicted lifespan : 500 years plus .
There are even brass eyelets in the leather eyecups to stop the lenses steaming up .
Mike put in a few nice extras , too .
The sliders in each eyepiece close the leaf - apertures inside , which will cut out light and also sharpen your eyesight , just like a pinhole camera .
The lenses themselves react to light and get darker the brighter it is .
Want to buy them ?
You can't , unless you have a lot of cash lying around .
Titanium does n't come cheap :
To put things in perspective , Titanium wedding rings go for around $ 900 - $ 2000 in the U.S. so these were not cheap to make .
I wo n't be making any big purchases anytime in the near future .
Check out the full gallery , and marvel at one man 's obsession to make a beautiful object that will outlive him by hundreds of years .

OH NO YOU DI - IN'T , GIRL - FRIEEEEN '.
New government research shows that levels of childhood obesity have remained largely unchanged for the past decade .
For the first time since the mid 1990s , government scientists asked a large number of Australian children ( 4,400 between the ages of two and 16 ) about what they eat .
In a survey that also included questions about physical activity , CSIRO researchers found that while most children get enough exercise , time in front of television and computer screens has blown out dramatically .
The survey found 72 per cent of children are in the healthy weight range , but 17 per cent are overweight , 6 per cent are obese and 5 per cent are considered underweight .
The relatively unchanged levels of childhood obesity comes despite a common conception in today 's society that Australian children are in the grip of an obesity epidemic .
" One of the surprising findings is that there has n't been much of an increase , " said Professor Tim Olds from the school of health sciences at the University of South Australia .
" In fact , it 's pretty much plateaued over the last 10 years , the percentage of kids classified as overweight or obese , and that 's encouraging news . "
Less encouraging are the findings on the amount of time children spend watching TV and computer screens , what the survey calls ' screentime . '
" An average of almost four hours per day , and that does n't include the time accumulated during school .
And so they really were quite shocking to me , " he said .
" I do n't think it 's good for kids to be doing anything for that amount of time , even if they 're trying to find a cure for cancer or learning to play the Moonlight Sonata .
" I think to devote that much time when you 're a child to one thing is a kind of distortion . "
Physical activity
Despite Australia 's children spending too much time staring at screens , the results on exercise levels are good .
Sixty - nine per cent get the recommended one hour or more of moderate exercise per day .
But the group that reports doing the least amount of physical activity is teenage girls .
" If there 's one group , which is the group of concern , it would be the older adolescent girls , the 14 - 16 year old girls , who show a really big drop off in physical activity , " Professor Olds said .
Dr Jane Bowen from CSIRO Human Nutrition says the findings on the diets of teenage girls add to the concern .
She says 80 per cent of girls aged 14 to 16 do n't consume enough calcium .
" Combined with low calcium intake , this group of girls has the least amount of physical activity , and they 're both very important factors for bone health in girls . "
The more complex consoles become , the more weirdy - beardy secret functions are squirreled away inside of them , and Nintendo 's latest is no exception .
While most of the Wii's Easter Eggs are specific to certain games - there 's a whole trove of 'em in Wii Sports alone - here 's seven of the best for the console itself .
1. Email a chum's Wii
You 'll need to have a record of those damnably unmemorable friend codes for anyone you want to mail , but once you do it 's simple : just drop a message to w[ friendcode ] @wii.com .
For instance , w1234567891011@wii.com .
2 . Add a smooth , constant blue glow to your Wii
The blue lighting around the disc slot normally only glows when the Wii's got some sort of announcement for you , and disappears once you 've read it .
However , you can lend your lounge a sci - fi feel by making that tastefull glow permanent .
Just email your own Wii - using the system in the tip above - but never read the message ( which can take up to an hour to arrive , incidentally ) .
As long as it stays unread , that cheeky light will keep on twinkling .
3. Mario attack
If you 're downloading something from the Wii shop - be it a new channel or a virtual console title - have a gander at what the Mario animation in the progress bar is wearing .
If he 's dressed in red and white ( as opposed to his traditional red and blue togs ) , you can make him chuck fireballs with the A button .
4. Puzzle puzzle
Unlock a hidden hardcore mode in the Photo Channel 's jigsaw mini-game .
Move the cursor over the number of pieces you want to split your photo into , but hold down the 1 button before you select the option .
The resulting jigsaw will be split into 194 pieces , which makes for quite the pictorial challenge .
5. Restore MP3 playback
Speaking of the photo channel , you were probably narked to discover that last year 's update to do it inexplicably removed MP3 soundtrack support , lumping us with AAC tracks only .
Yeah thanks , Ninty .
Fortunately , you can downgrade to the original version by heading to Wii Settings then Data Management , then selecting the Channels tab and choosing to delete the Photo Channel entirely .
Do n't worry , it wo n't disappear - instead , it 'll revert to sweet old version 1.0 , replete with MP3 support .
6 . Fix stubborn Wiimotes
If you 're having trouble getting a new or borrowed Wiimote to synch with your console , there 's a way to make the Wii completely forget about all the remotes it 's paired with so that you can start afresh .
Turn the Wii off and unplug it from the wall .
Wait 30 seconds , then plug it in and turn it on again .
When the Health & Safety warning pops up , open the flap on the front of the Wii , then press and hold down the red SYNC button for 15 seconds .
And that 's it - all the synced controllers will be forgotten .
Then pair all your Wiimotes with the console using the standard method .
7 . Use your Wiimotes with your PC
Yep , the Wiimote uses standard Bluetooth wireless tech to talk to the console - which means it can also work with a PC .
So your Wii controller can double up as a remote control for movie watching , or you can even play any game with it .
You 'll need either built - in Bluetooth support or a USB adaptor in your PC , plus free app GlovePIE to get it working .
There 's a little bit of faff involved , but the instructions at the GlovePIE site will talk you through it .
You can also download pre-made profiles for specific games .

Chuckling Queen gets a fit of the Googles as she comes face - to - face with YouTube 's famous laughing baby
The Queen kept an appointment in cyberspace yesterday when she visited the headquarters of Google .
Accompanied by the Duke of Edinburgh , she spent more than an hour being shown how the world 's most popular internet search engine is run .
But when the royal party were shown a YouTube clip of a baby with an infectious laugh , they were reduced to giggles by the footage .
The Queen uses a computer to upload a video to the Royal Channel on You Tube video alongside co-founder of YouTube Chad Hurley
Google giggle :
The monarch smiles at a video of a baby laughing on You Tube
The visit was celebrated by an image of the Queen being incorporated into Google 's UK homepage logo .
The ' Google doodle ' , which changes periodically to mark national holidays or anniversaries of major events , features a profile of the monarch and a crown just for today .
Nikesh Arora , president of Google Europe , Middle East and Africa , who took the monarch around his company 's UK headquarters in Victoria , London , said : ' She did seem very very interested in everything going on .
' She has used YouTube and has her own Royal Channel and understands what our products are about . '
Staff say the Queen is a relatively proficient user of the internet .
She sent her first electronic message in 1976 , during a visit to an Army base , and , at the age of 82 regularly emails grandsons William and Harry .
According to aides , however , it is her 87 - year - old husband who has really taken to the technology .
' The Duke is a very competent surfer and regularly uses the internet to send e-mails and research his speeches , ' said one .

Royal Google :
The search engine giant has paid tribute to the Queen to mark her visit to the London headquarters
The royal couple were treated to a demonstration of Google 's search capabilities that have become a staple tool for millions of web users just 10 years after the organisation was founded by Larry Page and Sergey Brin in California .
Before the presentation began , the Duke chatted to Matthew Trewhella , a developer advocate who promotes his organisation 's products to companies .
Philip asked the Google worker , who was dressed casually in a hooded top , chinos and trainers like many of his colleagues : ' Just come back from jogging ? '
The royal couple were shown searches made for a number of topics , from their nearby London residence Buckingham Palace , Royal Corgis - a favourite of the Queen - and one of the capital 's most famous landmarks , Big Ben .
During the tour the Queen was shown a series of demonstrations explaining Google 's various operations from Google Earth , where users can access detailed maps and satellite images of the planet , to a mobile phone using the search engine 's technology .

But when the Duke asked staff to find their own offices in Buckingham Palace Road , the site but not the building , which has been constructed in recent years , could be seen on Google Earth .
The royal party later chatted to 16 schoolchildren , all winners in a competition to design new doodles for Google .
The royal couple were also introduced to Chad Hurley , who co-founded YouTube , the popular video - sharing website bought by Google in 2006 .
He showed the Queen and Duke footage of a baby sitting in a high chair being made to laugh by an unseen person making a " boo " noise .
The clip has been viewed more than 63 million times and the Queen turned to Philip and said ' lovely little thing is n't it ' , adding : ' Amazing a child would laugh like that . '
The monarch has her own Royal Channel on YouTube which was launched last Christmas and has been viewed 1.6 million times by internet users - making it one of the most popular on the site .
Peter Oakley known as Geriatric , who has millions of hits on YouTube , talking with the Duke of Edinburgh during the visit
In 2006 , the Queen 's Speech was made available as a podcast for the first time and in 1997 the monarch launched the official royal website during a visit to Kingsbury High School in north - west London .
During the visit she also chatted to ordinary people who have become YouTube stars after uploading footage of themselves on to the site .
Peter Oakley , 81 , from Derbyshire , who uses the web name geriatric1927 , has posted more than 100 video diaries in more than two years and has attracted millions of hits .
He said : ' I started almost by accident , I did n't know anything about YouTube .
Welcome break : Google staff welcome then say goodbye to the Queen
' I was interested in slideshows and Photoshop and I needed to incorporate some video into it and then had the thrill of putting up a video on YouTube .
' At the time I was 79 and all these social networking sites were for young people , but I and YouTube got a lot of attention and things started to grow .
' I talk about growing up during the war - about air raid shelters , rationing , the influx of American GIs and how we as children reacted to them , things like that .'
Before the Queen left she used a computer mouse to upload a new video on to the royal website .
The footage was from a Buckingham Palace reception held in 1968 for sportsmen and women who had taken part in that year 's Olympic Games .

History of the Google doodle
The ' Google doodle ' has become a famous part of the company 's history , with the standard Google logo changing to reflect national holidays , major events or historic dates , usually including a humorous twist .
As Aesop said , appearances are deceiving — even in life 's tiniest critters .
From first detection in the 1880s , clinging to the sides of an aquarium , to its recent characterization by the U.S. Department of Energy Joint Genome Institute ( DOE JGI ) , a simple and primitive animal , Trichoplax adhaerens , appears to harbor a far more complex suite of capabilities than meets the eye .
The findings establish a group of organisms as a branching point of animal evolution and identify sets of genes , or a " parts list , " employed by organisms that have evolved along particular branches .
With each sequenced genome , another dataset is made available to advance the quest of evolutionary biologists seeking to reconstruct the tree of life .
The analysis of the 98 million base pair genome of Trichoplax ( literally " hairy - plate " ) illuminates its ancestral relationship to other animals .
Trichoplax is the sole member of the placozoan ( " tablet , " or " flat " animal ) phylum , whose relationship to other animals , such as bilaterians ( humans , flies , worms , snails , et al ) and cnidarians ( jellyfish , sea anemones , corals , et al ) , and sponges is contentious .
" Our whole genome analysis supports placing the placozoans after the sponge lineage branched from other animals , " said Daniel Rokhsar , the publication 's senior author , DOE JGI 's head of Computational Genomics Program , and Professor of Genetics , Genomics and Development at the University of California , Berkeley .
" Trichoplax has had just as much time to evolve as humans , but because of its morphological simplicity , it is tempting to think of it as a surrogate for an early animal , " said Mansi Srivastava , the study 's first author , a graduate student under the direction of Rokhsar , at the Center for Integrative Genomics , U.C. Berkeley .
Earlier mitochondrial DNA studies suggested that this " mother of all metazoans , " Trichoplax , was the earliest branch , before sponges diverged , but this remains debatable — even among collaborators .

" The latest and most complex analysis again suggests that placozoans populated the oceans long before sponges evolved , " said Bernd Schierwater , director of the Institute of Animal Ecology & Cell Biology and head of the Center for Biodiversity at TiHo Hannover , Germany .
Schierwater , a study co-author , joined Stephen Dellaporta and Leo Buss of Yale University in proposing the Trichoplax sequencing project in 2004 to DOE JGI 's Community Sequencing Program .
" The outcome of the Trichoplax adhaerens genome sequencing is so exciting that we are now culturing another 13 placozoan species in order to identify the most basal placozoan lineage and genome , " said Schierwater .
" Trichoplax is an ancient lineage — a good representation of the ancestral genome that is shedding light of the kinds of genes , the structures of genes , and even how these genes were arranged on the genome in the common ancestor 600 million years ago , " said Srivastava .
" It has retained a lot of primitive features relative to other living animals . "
Originally collected from the Red Sea , and cultured over the last 40 years in the laboratory , Trichoplax is a two - millimeter flat disk containing fluid sandwiched between two cell layers .
It lacks organs and only has four or five cell types .
Yet , despite its apparent simplicity , its genome encodes a panoply of signaling genes and transcription factors usually associated with more complex animals .
Trichoplax has no neurons , but has many genes that are associated with neural function in more complex animals .
" It lacks a nervous system , but it still is able to respond to environmental stimuli .
" It has genes , such as ion channels and receptors , that we associate with neuronal functions , but no neurons have ever been reported , " explained Rokhsar .
advertisement
Of the 11,514 genes identified in the six chromosomes of Trichoplax , 80 percent are shared with cnidarians and bilaterians .
Trichoplax also shares over 80 percent of its introns — the regions within genes that are not translated into proteins — with humans .
Even the arrangement of genes is conserved between the Trichoplax and human genomes .
This stands in contrast to other model systems such as fruit flies and soil nematodes that have experienced a paring down of non-coding regions and a loss of the ancestral genome organizations .
With its pancake shape , gutless feeding , and genomic primitiveness , the rich array of metabolic capabilities begs additional consideration .
While it has been observed to motor around via cilia , eat by mounting its prey , and reproduce by fission ( pulling itself into pieces ) — it may in fact have a secret sex life .
" Some of our new placozoan species show frequent sexual reproduction while others never show any signs of sex , " said Schierwater .
" The genome data allow us to search for the genes responsible for sex and life cycle complexity . "
" It 's remarkable that we have the whole genome sequence but we still know so little about this animal in the wild , " said Rokhsar .
" Hopefully the genome sequence will stimulate more studies of this enigmatic creature . "

The tomb of the Prophet Ezekiel in Kifl , south of Baghdad , used to be a pilgrimage site for Jews .
It is one of few traces that remain of a once - vibrant Jewish community in Iraq .
A pogrom in 1941 and other traumas led to a sharp decline in the Jewish population .

His fears are all too real in a city where bodies are still found dumped in the street almost daily , despite a fall in the overall death toll .
Christians , a far larger group , have fled Iraq by the thousands , and even Sunni and Shiite Muslims , who live among millions of their fellows , remain fearful of religious and sectarian fanatics .
Jews were once a wealthy and politically active part of the spectrum of Iraq .
In a fading red volume of the Iraq Directory of 1936 , the “ Israelite community , ” then numbering about 120,000 , is listed along with Arabs , Kurds , Turkmen , Muslims , Christians , Yazidis and Sabeans .
Rescued from a Baghdad library , this book lists Hebrew among the six languages of Iraq and describes a country in which “ the mosque stands beside the church and the synagogue . ”
However , the directory predates decades of trauma : the 1941 Farhud pogrom in which more than 130 Jews were killed during the Feast of Shavuot , World War II , the Holocaust , the anti-Zionism of Saddam Hussein and the post -2003 rise of Islamic militants .
Most traces of Jews are now gone beside the Prat and the Hidekel rivers , the Hebrew names for the Euphrates and Tigris .
Baghdad ’s Jewish quarter , in Taht al - Takia , is no more .
And about 80 miles south of Baghdad lies the Hebrew - inscribed tomb of the Prophet Ezekiel , “ son of Buzi . ”
During a visit there on Saturday , dozens of Muslim pilgrims filed through the well - tended shrine , its interior blackened by centuries of lamp smoke , to honor Ezekiel as a respected prophet .
Among these fragments of their civilization live the moribund huddle of holdouts .
Saleh ’s grandson is now alone .
His mother died two decades ago , his older brother left in 1991 , and his father , now 87 , was among the last handful of Jews taken from Iraq by the Jewish Agency after 2003 , reducing the current community to single figures .
Analysts say a global response from this weekend 's Group of 20 ( G20 ) meeting is crucial to addressing the financial crisis .
The Australian sharemarket has fallen below 4,000 points for the first time since 2005 , with investors gripped by recession fears .
Members of the industrialised and emerging nations forum are gathering in Washington to discuss the turmoil .
Citibank managing director of economics , Stephen Halmarick , says the moves made so far by international authorities will not be sufficient to avert a global recession .
" Investors will be looking to the weekend G20 meeting , which our Treasurer 's attending , to reinforce that it 's going to be a global response to this global crisis and looking for some stabilisation there , " he said .
At about 3:00 pm AEDT , the All Ordinaries index had fallen as much as 7.9 per cent to 3,953 , while the ASX 200 was down 317 points to 4,004 .
The Australian dollar was trading at 66.44 US cents , after reaching as high of 71 US cents overnight .
New York 's Dow Jones Industrial Average and S&P 500 both lost more than 7 per cent overnight .
Earlier , Mr Halmarick said the local currency has been oversold .
" The Australian economy is going to actually outperform the economies of Europe , New Zealand and Japan , so against those other currencies the Aussie dollar probably is undervalued at these levels , but at times of these extreme volatility the Aussie dollar 's going to continue to trade in very wide ranges , " he said .
" The extent of the volatility is just completely unprecedented .
" We 've had a 13 cent range in the Aussie dollar this week , normally you would n't see that range over the course of the year . "
Tokyo's stock market was also taking a heavy battering .
The Nikkei index was down about 11 per cent in morning trade .
In Seoul , share prices dropped just over 5 per cent within 15 minutes of opening .
WASHINGTON ( CNN ) --
Lawmakers return to Capitol Hill on Monday to resume their fight over legislation allowing more offshore oil drilling , in a bid to help relieve sky - high gasoline prices that are hurting the economy and infuriating voters .
Republicans believe offshore oil drilling will be a winning issue for them this fall .
While there were signs of compromise over the August recess , many on Capitol Hill are skeptical a deal can be reached that would send a bill to the president 's desk before Election Day .
Aides and congressional members from both parties acknowledge finger - pointing is likely to trump legislative deal - making during the truncated three - week session before lawmakers return home to campaign for re-election .
Democratic leaders in the House and Senate , who long resisted Republican - led calls to lift the ban on offshore oil drilling , changed course over the recess and now say they will push comprehensive energy plans in September that will include expanded drilling .
But Democrats will insist energy bills also include their own priorities , such as repealing tax breaks for big oil companies , something many Republicans oppose .
" If this is going to be a fig leaf , a political document , then it 's doomed to failure at the end of the day , " Rep. Doc Hastings , R- Washington , said Friday about the package being put together by House Speaker Nancy Pelosi , D - California .
Despite a recent dip in prices at the pump , Republicans believe expanded oil drilling remains a potent political issue .
They feel emboldened by complaints they heard from constituents over the summer break , and they are convinced their August protest sessions on the House floor helped draw attention to a lack of congressional action on energy policy .
Watch what voters told one Democratic congressman »
Do n't Miss Congress returns with campaigning in mind
Congress returns with campaigning in mind Ticker : Kennedy plans to return in January
Republicans also expect a boost from their vice presidential candidate , Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin , a strong advocate of drilling .
Delegates at the Republican National convention last week showed their fervor for drilling by punctuating speeches with chants of " drill , baby , drill . "
Republicans believe Democrats are underestimating the political importance voters give the issue .
They point to Sen. Chuck Schumer , D - New York , the head of the Senate Democrats ' campaign effort , who was quoted last month in the newspaper Politico , saying the drilling issue had " peaked " for voters .
Pelosi plans to unveil her bill by the end of the week , her office said .
In addition to allowing limited drilling on the Outer Continental Shelf , the measure is expected to include curbs on market speculators , and provisions promoting the use of alternative sources of energy and requiring the release of millions of barrels of oil from the Strategic Oil Reserve .
" Democrats support drilling , but a ' drill only ' plan would do nothing but drill deeper and deeper into your wallet , " Rep. John Larson , D - Connecticut , said last week .
A bipartisan compromise group in the Senate known as the " Gang of 10 " expanded to 16 members over the break .
Several more members are expected to join this week , a source involved with the group told CNN .
The bill the " gang " is pushing would tie new offshore drilling to $ 84 billion in investments in conservation and the use of alternative fuels .
Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid , D - Nevada , is working with the group and may link its bill to a package of tax breaks for producers of wind , solar , and other alternative fuels , an aide to the senator said .
Senate Republicans are wary of Reid because they do n't think he will allow votes on their amendments , something they will insist upon , even if the bill includes provisions they support , like offshore drilling , a Senate Republican leadership aide told CNN .
Senators are holding a bipartisan energy summit Friday , sponsored by Reid and Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell , R- Kentucky , to hear from industry experts , but it 's not clear the summit will actually help bridge differences between many Democrats and Republicans .
The controversy over offshore drilling could prompt a showdown later this month over a must - pass bill to fund the government through early 2009 .
The bill includes an annual extension of the moratorium on offshore oil drilling .
Republicans will attempt to strip it out , but if they fail , they could try to block passage of the entire spending bill , which could lead to a partial government shutdown .
Such a gamble would be politically risky , but in an election year in which Republicans expect to lose seats in each chamber , some lawmakers may want to roll the dice .

Google ’s Rainbow - colored Results for " Gay "
When you search Google for gay , you will see special rainbow colors next to the AdWords ads to the right side .
Rainbow colors are a globally recognized gay symbol and there ’s Pride Week coming up .
On a related note , Google also sometimes dresses up AdWords for holidays , and they ’ve also had their own wagons at gay parades before .
Within Google , gay employees call themselves “ gayglers . ”

One of the hardest things about facing tough times is figuring out what to do .
The right choice depends on an uncertain future – it depends on guessing right about what will happen .
Do you transfer your stock market funds to Treasuries ?
Get out of the market ?
Give up on retirement ?
Go back to school ?
Should you be preparing for a job loss ?
Should you let your house go ?
And of course , we ’re gambling with your future , and losing has high stakes .
A lot of people have emailed me lately asking me what I expect to have happen , so that they can make plans .
This is not something I ’m totally wild about – I ’d personally rather you base this on your own analysis .
I have been doing fairly well at the prediction game so far – I predicted a deflationary depression with rising food prices just about a year ago and my annual New Year ’s predictions are now officially 8 for 10 , but I also would have predicted oil prices to remain fairly high for a while into the recession , and I ’ve long said that I though the fundamentals of the economy were so bizarre and unstable that I did n’t understand why it had n’t crashed already .
That is , I do not think that every word that comes out of my mouth was put there by a divine being , and neither should you .
I ’m wrong sometimes , and you should remember that .
But because so many people are asking me to give them a sense of what we ’re facing , I ’m going to do that , if you promise not to make any life decisions solely based upon my thinking .
So here are my bets for what we ’re facing the coming decade in re : food , energy , etc …
- That in retrospect , the current economic shifts will last at least 7 years , and probably a decade or more before stabilizing , almost certainly at a new , lower economic and energy level .
During that period , there will be a number of seeming signs of recovery , periods where things are worse , declarations the crisis is over ( I like CNBC ’s website for a daily promise that the crisis is over today and that the last set of interventions have worked .
They start out every morning with that promise , and amend their claims according to the end of the day . )
I think we are entering a Depression – and both the Great Depression and the 1970s recession took us a full decade to get out of .
In both cases , they were essentially escaped by the application of lots of cheap energy – the former withe WWII build out , the latter with the cheap oil of the early 80s price collapse .
It is n’t clear to me what would get us out of our current economic crisis – but we will probably reach various points of stability in between drops to lower economic levels , as John Michael Greer argues .
Meanwhile , I also believe that we are likely to see what we ’ve seen in other economic crises – denial , rallies ( such as we ’ve seen in the markets yesterday and so far today ) , minor improvements , declarations that all will be better soon .
One of the tricks is going to be sorting out real improvements from wishful thinking and outright lies .
My own opinion is that it is wise to think about this crisis as a long term , rather than a short term one .
That does not mean that things wo n’t get very nasty in a short time – it means that whatever levels we fall to , I would say we ’re a ways from getting out .
- Markets will still exist after this .
This seems obvious , but I ’ve had people ask if there will still be a stock market after this .
The answer is yes , certainly .
If nothing else , the US , which is the world ’s largest grain exporter will be trading food to energy producing nations and food for large nations that can’t produce what they need for a long time .
There may be points at which trading is suspended , and my own bet would be in a steep decline over the next year – a few days ago we were down 40 % over last year – I think there ’s at least another 40 - 50 % to go from here .
It wo n’t be a steady downturn , though – there will be rallies and improvements .
I think it is perfectly possible , however , that a lot of foreign investment may leave the US and the amount of money available for markets to play with will continue to decline for a long , long time .
I suspect most ordinary people will probably get out of the markets , just as they did after the 30s .
Where should you put your money ?
This is not my area of expertise , so I ’ll just tell you where I ’ve put mine - into my home , into the food in my pantry and the tools I use , into my community ( I ’m trying to keep up my charitable donations as much as possible ) , and my local credit union .
Is this a perfect solution ?
No , and it probably is n’t helpful to those close to retirement , retired or with lots of money to preserve .
In that case , I ’d take the advice of Ilargi and Stoneleigh over at www.theautomaticearth.blogspot.com.
They are far better at this than I am .
I still think that durable goods , land , natural resources and basic things like food make a lot of sense .
- This one is more an intuition than a fully formed and reasoned thought , but I ’m coming to suspect that we may find ourselves unable to import some , or many goods at some point in the not - too - distant future .
Watching Iceland ’s current situation is going to be unique – and the costs of shipping are also a major issue .
There are two consequences of this – the first is the re-onshoring of some manufacturing , which would be good .
A friend of mine who works in the medical equipment business already jokes that his job in New Bangalore ( Boston ) is the cheap place to make stuff for the Swiss company owners .
The second consequences may be that you just ca n’t get stuff you are used to .
So I ’d suggest getting unused to it , if you can .
This will not be easy or pleasant .
And this includes food and other things we need .
While the US can feed itself , we are also one of the largest food importers in the world .
- I ’d expect to lose your job .
I ’d bet on high unemployment levels over the next decade – 15 - 30 % .
There ’s a lot of fat in our economy , and a lot of us make our money on that fat – that ’s not a value judgement , btw – books are a luxury too , as is a college education .
The problem is that we do n’t much distinguish in economic crisis terms between valuable luxuries like education and valueless ones , like Mercedes .
Just to be clear , we ’re totally implicated in this one .
We figure there ’s a 50 - 50 shot Eric will lose his job – he brings in a huge amount of money to the university and is paid less than a comparable tenured professor ( part of our betting mechanism ) , but if across the board commands come to get rid of non-tenured faculty come out , he ’s toast .
This is bad , since it provides our benefits and also much of our income .
It is also bad because Eric loves his job .
We particularly took this job , as opposed to say , a tenured position at a small university ( Eric is primarily interested in science education , not research , so tenure at a research University was never considered ) , because we thought that despite the risks , the state universities are more likely to survive a major crisis than small private ones , but this was a bet , and we may pay the price .
If your job depends on travel , state and county budgets , parents having the money for private schools or college , luxury goods ( and by luxury I mean “ stuff you do n’t need ) , high end consumers choosing to pay more for quality ( and this is likely to affect many small organic farmers , crafters , etc… me included ) , real estate development , or can be described as a “ Dilbert Job ” you are probably at risk .
I ’d also suggest that people relying on current non-traditional energy booms , and renewables are in trouble if the credit crisis continues .
You are even more at risk if you are a. older , and highly paid and can be laid off and replaced with a much cheaper younger person b. recently hired c. recently graduated or d. have a medical condition that makes you expensive or are likely to have a baby , and thus seem expendable .
What can you do about this ?
If you can , make sure someone in your household ( and remember , “ household ” is a fungible commodity – it does not have to consist only of a nuclear family ) has a reliable job if possible .
If you currently are making a lot of money , but could shift into something more stable , it might be wise to do it .
Otherwise , pay down your debts and do what you can to start cottage industries and local businesses so that you have a way of bringing in income .
Double up with family , share resources , cut your budget and get ready .
If you do have stable employment , sit tight and play nice .
- I may be wrong here , but I do n’t expect most people to lose their homes , nationally .
I think millions will , but the enormous build out of homes has left us with more housing than we can possibly use in any rational system .
So while some people will be homeless , my assumption is that gradually , either municipalities will decline to foreclose , as several have already , or legal challenges will allow people to keep their homes , because the institutions that once held their mortgages are now owned by the government , and paid for by the people .
I think more people will end up living together , but most people will have homes , simply because we built so many of them .
- I think that most people ’s kids are n’t going to college for a while .
Eventually , my guess is that some small schools will close or be bought by state colleges , and eventually , the US will probably go to a subsidized college education system – but that ’s longer term .
I think this is likely simply because sending young adults to college is one of the best ways to keep them from rioting and causing violence – it is a cheaper thing than letting them start revolutions because they have no work and no money .
In the coming 5 years or so , I would n’t bet on college unless you have the cash to pay for it securely in your mattress – I think state colleges and community colleges will do ok , with trickle down of more affluent parents sending their kids there , but private , expensive colleges without huge endownments will struggle .
It is time to think about alternative education – apprenticeship , cooperative universities created by professors in their communities , and other educations .
I do expect , in the very short term , a lot of people to go back to community college and especially graduate schools .
But since such programs only have subsidies for a few , be very cautious about borrowing money for this .
- I do n’t expect short term loss of the utility grid as a whole or food access as a whole , but I do expect a lot of people to struggle to pay for them .
Utility shut offs are up again , and food is the one thing whose price is not falling much .
I expect high food prices in proportion to income to continue over the next years – and people are going to pay more and more of their income for food .
The same is true with utilities – while people may cut back some , I do n’t expect radical drops in gas or electric prices .
So my guess would be that more of us should be set up to do without electricity or heat , or with very minimal use of these .
Growing some of your own food , and perhaps food to sell is going to continue to be essential .
- I have said this before , but I expect that generations are going to have to come to terms with one another really soon .
That is , older folks who have been expecting to retire , or are retired , but now ca n’t do so or are struggling , are going to have to come together with younger folks who can work , but do n’t have assets like housing or remaining funds , and have large debts from college and other sources .
The only possible answer to this set of problems is for them to work together – parents with kids , younger friends with older ones .
The good news is that this is n’t bad .
The bad news is that both generations are going to have adjust their expectations of the future enormously – the all leisure retirement is probably over .
So is the idea that living with your parents means you are a loser .
Valid relational difficulties are going to have to be overcome – or chosen family will have to take on the characteristics of biological family – ie , they ’ll love you and help you even when they do n’t like you much .
- I expect that in the coming years there will be a lot of misery and unhappiness .
And also a lot of surprising moments of happiness .
There will be a lot of pain and suffering .
And there will be a lot of moments in which people show extraordinary courage , kindness , and experience joy and delight , despite what ’s happening .
We will live through extraordinary events , but we will also experience our lives in ordinary ways , and if we plan and think ahead , it is possible even to imagine that happiness will predominate , in the face of very difficult times .

He 's Baaaack !
Tom DeLay Hailed as GOP Hero
Despite Scandal , Indictment , ' The Hammer ' Big in Minneapolis
MINNEAPOLIS -- Tom DeLay , the former House GOP majority leader whose connections to convicted lobbyist Jack Abramoff brought scandal and disgrace to the Republican party , returned to the spotlight in Minneapolis last night , helping to host a private party that drew hundreds of delegates and Republican officials .
" He 's the man , he 's the man , " said one guest leaving the party .
" I 've always liked him , he 's a good solid conservative , " said one delegate standing in line for entrance to the party , Corey Stewart , chairman of the Board of Supervisors in Prince William County , Virginia .
DeLay arrived at the Minneapolis night club for his party last night in a gold mini-van , no longer traveling with the Capitol police detail that used to protect him from reporters and other perceived security threats .
He declined to answer questions from ABC News as he entered the back door of the club through a loading dock .
Tune in to World News with Charles Gibson tonight to see Brian Ross on the Money Trail from Minneapolis .
Once known as " the hammer " for his hardball tactics on Capitol Hill , the featured entertainment at DeLay 's party was the band Smash Mouth .
Asked his reaction to DeLay 's appearance in Minneapolis , Cong .
John Mica ( R - FL ) declined to answer and then head - butted the ABC camera .
( Click here to watch the raw video of Cong. Mica 's head - butt )
DeLay 's arrival was hardly welcomed by the campaign of Sen. John McCain .
McCain led the Senate investigation that revealed many of the abuses connected to Abramoff , and DeLay has criticized McCain for years .
Earlier this year , according to The Hill , DeLay accused McCain of " betraying " the conservative movement .
" He is no friend of ours , " said one McCain campaign official .
" But you can't really keep him out of the city . "
Ethics watchdog groups were appalled that DeLay would be back in the spotlight at the Republican convention .
" Why would they welcome back one of the most obvious examples of corruption , " asked Ellen Miller of the Sunlight Foundation , a public interest group monitoring the role of lobbyists at the political conventions .
No longer in office , and awaiting trial on state election law violations in Texas , DeLay disappeared from the Washington scene two years ago after deciding not to seek re-election from his Congressional district south of Houston .
Despite speculation , DeLay has not been indicted in the ongoing federal investigation of Congressional corruption and influence peddling .
The convicted lobbyist , Abramoff , who once boasted of his close ties to Delay , is cooperating with authorities .
Abramoff is scheduled to be sentenced Thursday by a federal judge in Washington .
DeLay 's unintended legacy may be the new Congressional ethic reform legislation that has changed the rules about what lobbyists can do to gain access and influence with members of Congress , a law , passed to correct the abuses ascribed to DeLay and Abramoff .
Under the new law , lobbyists may no longer pay for travel , meals and gifts for members of Congress as Abramoff once did .
In recent months , DeLay has sought to re-establish himself as a player in the Republican party .
He started the Coalition for a Conservative Majority , wrote a book , " No Retreat , No Surrender , " and has established his own web site where he blogs with his own political commentary .
" Why one of the most disgraced members of Congress would think that he had an opportunity now to redeem himself is beyond me , " said Miller of the Sunlight Foundation .
" I do not believe all is forgiven , " she said .

2004 : John Kerry
“ You might have thought that , three years after a devastating terrorist attack on American soil , a period which has featured two wars , radical political and economic legislation , and an adjustment to one of the biggest stockmarket crashes in history , the campaign for the presidency would be an especially elevated and notable affair .
If so , you would be wrong .
This year 's battle has been between two deeply flawed men : George Bush , who has been a radical , transforming president but who has never seemed truly up to the job , let alone his own ambitions for it ; and John Kerry , who often seems to have made up his mind conclusively about something only once , and that was 30 years ago .
But on November 2nd , Americans must make their choice , as must The Economist .
It is far from an easy call , especially against the backdrop of a turbulent , dangerous world .
But , on balance , our instinct is towards change rather than continuity : Mr Kerry , not Mr Bush . ”
See article : “ The incompetent or the incoherent ? ”
2000 : George W. Bush
“ The Economist , if it had a vote , would choose George W. Bush .
It prefers his small government , pro-market philosophy .
And , on the simple test of the two crises , he wins on points : behind on a foreign crisis , but well ahead in a domestic one .
The tenor of his presidency would depend crucially on Congress : to restrain the social illiberalism and occasional isolationism of other Republicans , the best outcome would be a divided one , with the Democrats back in control of the House of Representatives .
Let 's see . ”
See article : “ Crunch time ”
1996 : Bob Dole
“ He [ Bill Clinton ] has , to be sure , learned from his mistakes .
His foreign - policy touch has grown sharper .
Brought to his knees by the 1994 mid-term congressional elections , he recast himself as a moderate Republican , keen to balance the budget by 2002 , to declare that the “ era of big government was over ” and , at last , to begin reforming welfare .
It is on that ticket that he has run this year , making many small pledges but no new big ones .
If he sticks to that position , his second term might not be at all bad .
Such a president would be a good balance to a Republican Congress , if ( as is to be hoped ) that party retains its control of it .
Many of the ideas that such a Congress would stand for , including tax reform and further reform of the government safety net , are good ones ; President Clinton could usefully restrain the Republicans ' social - policy extremists .
But will he stick to that position ?
That is the question that will always surround him .
If he does , this newspaper will congratulate him in 2000 when he retires .
But the risk is that he will not .
He will face financial constraints imposed by the bond markets , but none of the constraints of re-election .
He may be beset by ethical problems , whether over campaign finance or Whitewater indictments , even conceivably of his wife .
These might lead him in all sorts of new directions , especially if he has been re-elected on a landslide , and if the Democrats were to regain control of one or both of the houses of Congress .
No one can be sure what he would do in such circumstances .
And that is why The Economist feels unable to endorse him .
We would not know what we were backing .
Would we know with Bob Dole ?
It is hard to be sure .
We choose him on the assumption that the real Bob Dole is the one who spent three decades on Capitol Hill , not this year 's dubious character ; that he would be more prudent than his economic plan implies .
That is an awkward basis for an endorsement .
But the choice is a lousy one . ”
1992 : Bill Clinton
“ What choice between these two [ Bill Clinton and George Bush ] ?
On past occasions
The Economist has sometimes joined in with American elections and stated its preference ; and it has sometimes opted out .
In 1988 , when George Bush faced Michael Dukakis , we felt we could recommend neither .
Four years on , Mr Bush has done nothing to prove himself .
The man is spent , and his party with him .
The Republicans , tired to distraction , out of ideas , have become prey to a far right whose economic nostrums run to demonising taxes , and many of whose social ideas would rub salt in the country 's wounds .
The issue of ideas is central .
The Democratic Party , to be sure , has not yet proved that its new look goes beyond Mr Clinton and his circle .
But it has been working for 12 years on how to become a plausible modern party of government , and should be given a chance to try .
During the campaign , Mr Clinton has proved himself to be far more than a token candidate .
He is intelligent ; he is diligent ; he is energetic ; he has grasped most of the issues , and found persuasive solutions to some .
He could mark an end to divided government and could , if he used the presidency well , begin to bring Americans , black and white , rich and poor , closer together .
Despite the risks , the possibilities are worth pursuing .
Our choice falls on him . ”
1988 : No endorsement
“ The Economist would sometimes like to vote in American elections .
In 1980 we saw the arguments for Mr Ronald Reagan and made them : he seemed to offer better solutions to the problems that then faced America , and the West generally , than did Mr Jimmy Carter .
This year neither candidate has persuaded us that he has either the policies or , more important , the qualities that the times demand .
It is not that Mr Bush and Mr Dukakis are rapscallions .
At the end of the primary season we wrote that they were " responsible , upright and experienced in their different ways " .
They still are .
But what they are not , it seems , is presidential .
Since the primaries , during which candidates can be forgiven some excesses , neither has once shown that he understands the threat that the budget deficit poses .
Not once on this — or any other — issue has either shown one scrap of political courage . ”
1984 : No endorsement
“ In the four years since America elected Ronald Reagan , the voters have felt their country change .
Most think the change has been for the better .
A new spirit of self - assurance and optimism prevails .
As Mr Walter Mondale has sensibly acknowledged , Mr Reagan deserves some credit for this .
The president whom America elects on November 6th will be able to build on the achievements of the past four years .
He will also have to make good some shortcomings ....
This is not to deny that Mr Mondale could make a fine president .
Nothing he has said or done in the campaign suggests that , if Americans wanted him , the rest of the world would not find him acceptable too .
He shows greater recognition of certain problems ahead .
Although Mr Reagan 's ultra-Keynesian America is barrelling along towards full employment , all its trading and budget accounts are frighteningly out of balance .
A sound international economic order cannot be built on the assumption that the rumbustiously richest country will go on borrowing unprecedented amounts at enormous interest rates from everybody else for ever . ”
1980 : Ronald Reagan
“ Are these the signs of a flexible man , a pragmatist rather than an ideologue ?
Or is Mr Reagan just empty , an actor who can speak the lines that go down best with the audience he happens to be addressing ?
The question will not matter if Mr Reagan has sound advisers and knows how to use their advice .
This , surely , is the key to the whole choice .
Many , though by no means all , of his current advisers are indeed sound , and the evidence from his time governing California and from what the more impressive of them say is that his greatest quality is to be a good listener — though not to the legislature , which he treated with disdain .
Mr Carter is generally a bad listener .
There can be no certainty that Mr Reagan , victorious at the age of nearly 70 , would pick well , cut through his competing lieutenants and have the agility of mind to see the critical issues .
If he did , however , he would probably be a more successful leader of opinion than Mr Carter , who has so often taken his cue from the latest poll .
There is a choice in this election : the two main candidates are not clones , and thoughtful Mr John Anderson , with no prospect of winning and no party to run congress if he did , is no real escape from the poverty of choice .
Another four years of Mr Carter would probably be much like the past four — for there is nothing in the president 's make - up to lead one to believe he is likely to change his ways .
Mr Reagan brings with him some heavy ideological baggage .
Some of that , though not all of it , will need to be quickly shed .
But Mr Reagan also holds out the promise of a firmer line abroad , based on a sounder structure of advice .
He would almost certainly bring in more new ideas , for the Republican party now shows more signs of intellectual vitality than the Democrats .
The justification of a Reagan gamble is the prospect that the Republican governing establishment available from four years ago is , at almost every level , more impressive and more reassuring than the central coterie and the usually powerless cabinet generals Mr Carter has used these past four years in Washington .
That , perhaps , is the most pressing reason why so many of America 's friends want , unusually in a presidential election , to see a change at the top , even one laden with risk .
We agree with them . ”
Lockheed Martin to Develop Ocean Thermal Energy Prototype
October 9th , 2008 by Alex Felsinger
The energy produced could be used to generate electricity or to fuel desalination , and according to the company , the process would be relatively harmless to the ocean ’s environment .
While scientists began fleshing out Ocean Thermal Energy Conversion in the 70’s , no one has yet been able to manufacture a workable commercial design.[ social_buttons ]
Military contractor Lockheed Martin ’s challenge is to create piping wide and long enough to stretch down thousands of feet under the ocean , which is believed to be the only way to make the process efficient .
The temperature variant is relatively small , so large volumes of water are needed to produce a commercially - viable amount of power .
“ Our independent research and development work to date has shown OTEC to be technically feasible , ” said Denise Saiki , the vice president and general manager of Lockheed ’s Undersea Systems business unit .
“ The next step is to demonstrate it on a commercial scale and this DOE contract will help accelerate our progress towards that goal . ”
The company first plans to develop a full - scale fiberglass and composite material prototype to demonstrate their plans to the Department of Energy .
This wo n’t be their first prototype :
In 1974 , Lockheed and Bechtel created a small - scale prototype , which is still functional to this day .

Latest Cleantech Talk Episode
The latest medical study predicts everyone will soon be obese .
It was so unimaginable that anyone would take this study seriously , that I was n’t even going to comment on it .
Even G4TV laughed at the absurdity of researchers predicting that 100 % of us would be obese by 2048 .
As Ty Colfax piercingly wrote :
In today 's edition of doctors can be stupid too , we present an article published in the July issue of Obesity , stating that 86 % of Americans could be overweight or obese by 2030 .
And if you thought that was bad , they expect a 100 % obesity rate by 2048 ...
And to that we say , WTF ?
100 % obesity rate ?
Are these people serious ?
Do n't they understand arithmetic vs. complex graphing ?
...
If their graph continued without logical limits , which they seem to have ignored , perhaps 220 % of us will be obese by 2061 .
It 's ridiculous to think that just because someone goes to school for a long time they can publish this kind of b.s. in a medical journal ( Obesity ) obviously designed to inspire panic and deliver " news " on this epidemic that 's fake as it is .
But leave it to mainstream medical journalists [ cough ] to report it as news .
ABC
News covered the story , ending with claims that this study is a good wake up call and that “ obesity experts agree that certain measures , taken now , can head off major problems . ”
And who were those experts quoted ?
Dr. David Katz , director of the Integrative Medicine program at Yale [ see here , here , here and here ] , and Dr. Neal Barnard , head of the vegan organization , Physicians Committee for Responsible Medicine , which had even sent out a press release about the study this week .
As ABC reported :
" We are terribly , ominously off - course , " says Dr. David Katz , co-founder of the Yale University Prevention Research Center .
" To close the gap , we need to fix everything that 's broken — from neighborhoods without sidewalks , to the high price of produce , to food marketing to children , to misleading health claims on food packages , to school days devoid of physical activity and school cafeterias devoid of healthful offerings .
The list goes on and on . "
Others cite individual responsibility for diet and lifestyle habits .
Dr. Neal Barnard , founder and president of the Physicians Committee for Responsible Medicine ( PCRM ) and a staunch supporter of a vegetarian diet , says dietary modification could be a crucial step in solving the problem .
" U.S. eating habits are nowhere near where they should be , " he says .
" The average American eats 50 pounds more meat and 20 pounds more cheese per year , compared to the 1960s ...
I would strongly encourage Americans to adopt more vegetarian meals .
[ According to the latest data from the USDA Center for Nutrition Policy and Promotion , and the total food supply of meats , poultry and fish produced in the United States was 18.1 % of available food ( 579 kcal / day ) in 1970 and went down to 13.4 % ( 522.6 kcal / day ) in 2004 .
An dairy products also went down , from 11.3 % to 8.6 % . ]
This study in the news , published in the journal of the Obesity Society , was led by Dr. Youfa Wang , Ph.D. , M.D. , with the Center for Human Nutrition at Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health .
This is the world ’s largest public health school and receives 20 % of all U.S. government public health research funding .
Partnered with Johnson & Johnson , it also awards grants for community wellness and healthy lifestyle programs addressing obesity , and leads the national Meatless Monday campaign .
The Center for Human Nutrition , according to its Director , has had a leading role in IOM committees establishing dietary guidelines , the body of research on food and cancer for the World Cancer Research Fund , and the World Health Organization ’s new BMI growth curves for children .
[ A few World Cancer Fund posts here , here , here , here , here , and here . ]
Readers may most remember Dr. Wang from his 2006 study predicting a worldwide pandemic of childhood overweight and obesity , and that rates in the U.S. alone would double to 46 % by 2010 .
[ Since rates have been flat for nearly a decade , it ’s doubtful his predictions will come true in the next 17 months . ]
In describing their method for this latest prediction , Dr. Wang and colleagues wrote that they based their projection analysis on NHANES data collected between 1970s and 2004 .
According to the authors , “ the prevalence of overweight and obesity has increased steadily among all U.S. population groups over the past two to three decades . ”
And :
We estimated the average annual increase in the prevalence of overweight and obesity and predicted the future prevalence among U.S. adults and children assuming the trends would be similar of the past three decades .
Most of the past prevalence estimates based on NHANES data used in our analysis were based on previously published estimates , all of which were based on analyses done with consideration of survey design effects and sampling weights .
[ They referenced two previous papers led by Dr. Wang . ]
They went on to use linear projection models to predict what the future will be if their past trend estimates continue .
They said that “ by the year 2030 , about 90 % of all American adults would be overweight and 51.5 % would be obese . ”
And by the year 2048 , “ the prevalence would reach 100 % . ”
See the mostly linear line straight up since 1970 :
This is what a lot of the public thinks the obesity epidemic looks like .
Before we examine this chartsmanship , the authors not surprisingly concluded by calling for more research and broad , comprehensive public interventions to address “ the pervasive and serious problem ” of that projected obesity epidemic :
As articulated by the World Health Organization for the global situation and by the Institute of Medicine with respect to childhood obesity in the United States , dramatic and effective population - based programs and related policies need to be developed and implemented to address the epidemic ...
More recently , there has been increasing recognition of the major role that the “ obesogenic ” environment plays in perpetuating the epidemic .
What is needed now are creative initiatives to actually effect environmental changes , and this will require a strong and sustained collaboration among the public and private sectors , educators , food producers , urban planners , transportation experts , parents , and the general public .
[ A few IOM posts here , here , here , here , here , here and here . ]
Convincing us of an obesity epidemic
We ’ll try this one more time .
It is frighteningly easy to lie with statistics , charts , maps and graphs and even fool healthcare professionals into believing there 's a runaway obesity epidemic .
Darrell Huff ’s classic book should be required reading for every student , healthcare professional , journalist , politician and anyone else who thinks they know how to fix things for the rest of us .
Illustrating the nonsense inherent in mathematical extrapolations , for example , between 1947 and 1952 , the number of television sets in American homes increased around 10,000 % .
Projected for the next five years would predict 40 sets per family !
And if you want to be even sillier , begin with a year before television sets were available , and you can “ prove ” that each family will have 40,000 sets !
Now , that ’s an epidemic of television sets .
Popular perceptions of an obesity epidemic come from nonstop marketing about skyrocketing increases in the number of ‘ obese ’
Americans and even the CDC saying that ‘ obesity rates ’ have doubled between 1980 and 2000 .
Most people have an image of nearly half the population now as fat as those headless images shown on television , and believe that our weights , themselves , have been skyrocketing just like that graph created by Dr. Wang and colleagues .
As Mr. Huff would say , we ’ve been misled by “ statisticulation . ”
Sadly , the populace has been led to confuse a contrived obesity epidemic with actual obesity .
Please read that sentence again .
The two are not the same thing .
The factors behind each one are very different , too .
And not one of the popularly proposed “ solutions to the obesity crisis ” understand the difference and they will continue to be ineffective , waste vast amounts of limited public health resources , and put people at risks for harm .
But when you understand the difference , then the fallacies of logic [ see here , here , here , here and here ] and prejudices behind the war on obesity will become much more readily apparent .
Throughout time , humans have exhibited a natural diversity of physical characteristics .
People have always come in a wide range of shapes and sizes — some thin , some heavy and the largest numbers falling somewhere in the middle .
When the heights and weights of a population are plotted on a graph , a rough bell curve is seen .
There ’s a small number normally at the low - weight end , and small number at the high - weight end , with the largest in between .
Those whose natural , genetic sizes are at the most extreme high end have been called ‘ obese . ’
This obesity is not a new characteristic and has been documented since the earliest history of the human species .
But cultures did n’t used to see it as a fashion negative .
As Dr. Jeffrey M. Friedman , M.D. , Ph.D. , head of the Laboratory of Molecular Genetics at Rockefeller University and a renowned molecular geneticist and obesity researcher , explained several years ago during an NPR interview :
Historically , being obese was the desirable body habit as so .
If you go to museums … all the rich people in Egypt would pay extra money to have extra chins put onto their sculpture .
Rubenesque figures were the vogue in the 1700s .
Renoir ’s characters were all heavy .
In aboriginal societies the chieftains were all quite obese .
For reasons that — you all have as good an idea about as I do I guess — things changed here about what our views of what was attractive in the 60s and it set up an idealized view of what people should weigh and who they should be that just is n’t matched by our genetic endowment .
Now , to create perceptions of a contemporary obesity epidemic , two key things have transpired .
And neither was that the numbers of truly obese people have gone through the roof as is widely believed .
The bell curve still looks roughly the same as it always has .
First , an arbitrary line through the bell curve was drawn and everyone to the right of the line was called ‘ overweight ’ or ‘ obese ’ .
The line used to be drawn to the right of the main peak on the curve ( BMI 27 ) , but that changed in 1998 , when the line was moved to the left , to cut directly through what is average for most of the population ( BMI 25 ) .
Instantly , 30.5 million more people found themselves added to the rosters of the ‘ overweight ’ and the arbitrary change increased the numbers who fell into that category by nearly 50 % — without a single person gaining a single pound .
[ The image , from Dr. Wang et.al. , plots BMIs since 1976 from NHANES surveys . ]
The second thing that has transpired over the decades , as you can see , is that the entire bell curve has scooted over to the right a bit .
This means that the average weights and heights of the population have increased .
But as you can see , it ’s not all that impressive .
There ’s a reason you hear about obesity rates ( the number of people crossing that arbitrary BMI threshold ) as doubling and never hear how much our heights and weights have actually increased : the change is far less dramatic - sounding and would n’t illicit the hysterical reaction needed to create a crisis .
Going back forty years , by the way , we ’ve also gained an inch in height ( the other part of the BMI equation ) .
And how much weight have we , as a population , gained on average ?
While describing the difference between genes and the “ misconception about the role of environment because of the misuse of statistics , ” Dr. Friedman explained :
So let me give you an analogy ...
Imagine that 40 years ago the average IQ was 100 and there was a bell - shaped curve .
Imagine now that our educational system improves and the bell - shaped curve shifts a little and the average IQ is now 105 .
With that you could imagine that the number of people who have an IQ greater than 140 , so - called geniuses , might have doubled .
Now is it more useful to think about how our education is doing by saying , “ average IQ increased 5 points ” or “ number of geniuses is doubled . ”
I think probably both are of interest but the former seems to me more informative .
Ok .
So how does that analogize to weight ?
Over the time period that you ’ve heard that the obesity rates have quote “ doubled ” or gone up by 70 percent , the average weight gain is 7 to 10 pounds ... think about the fact that 7 to 10 pounds is almost nothing compared to the hundreds of pounds of difference in weight that you might see in any two people walking around the street today , both of whom essentially have unlimited access to calories .
A crisis declared over 7 - 10 pounds !
Failing to understand statistics also means a lot of people do n’t understand why moving the entire bell curve on a graph by such a nominal amount can mathematically increase exponentially the numbers of people falling within a category and enhance perceptions of an epidemic .
Remember that 2003 Rand report which had announced that the prevalence of the fattest people has increased the most ?
Once again , it ’s not that their numbers have gone through the roof or that they ’re responsible for the ‘ obesity epidemic ’ .
Over the past two decades , the largest people ( those common television images of obesity ) , with BMIs ≥ 50 have increased 5 - fold ( to a mere 0.5 % ) , and those with BMIs ≥ 40 have quadrupled ( to only 2 % ) .
The exponential increases are a mathematical phenomenon of that entire bell curve shift .
What has continued to exasperate those trying to create a crisis of this shift in average weights is that the population keeps getting healthier and living longer than at any time in our history .
There ’s good reason that the health crisis of the obesity epidemic has failed to materialize .
Some of this can also be explained by the factors that have contributed to that shift in the bell curve — mostly neutral or positive changes as a result of our modern life and how good we have things .
For example , remember the bell curve is based on population surveys — and not only is our population very different from earlier decades , but the NHANES surveys themselves have been redesigned to oversample certain segments of the population — all of which would tend to amplify average weights — lending caution to seeing trends by piecing surveys together .
Our population has become dramatically more diverse just since 1970 , when ethnic / racial minorities were 16 % of the population , compared to a third today .
The bell curve ( and NHANES surveys ) also is n’t corrected for age and the population is aging , significantly so since the 1950s and 1970s , especially in the babyboomer age group .
Animals and the human species naturally gain weight with age , especially during middle age .
As Dr. Friedman said , aging could notably contribute to the perception that weights in our population are increasing .
And then there are all of those modern advances that have helped children and adults to live longer , healthier lives , while contributing to healthier average weights and heights among the entire population .
Modern food production has improved , enabling more affordable food to feed more people .
Compared to past generations and previous war times , fewer people are going hungry or facing food rationing or severe nutritional shortfalls , which had left more people underweight for their genes and skewed the population averages slightly downward .
Our food and water are considerably safer today and have reduced by 100 - fold the number of children and adults sick ( and dying ) with foodborne illnesses .
Far fewer children spend their childhoods sick and fighting childhood illnesses , that have been eradicated just in recent decades .
Most of us remember measles , mumps , chicken pox and polio among our classmates and siblings when we were younger .
As recently reported , according to the CDC , before the introduction of the measles vaccine , alone , in 1963 , “ approximately 3 to 4 million persons had measles annually in the United States ; approximately 400- 500 died , 48,000 were hospitalized , and 1,000 developed chronic disability from measles encephalitis . ”
And , of course , there are other possible iatrogenic factors , such as stress and prescriptions for anti-depressants and anti-anxiety medications that tripled between 1988 and 1999 , most of which have been shown to increase weight , age - related diabetes , and auto - immune disorders .
Smoking , which many used to help control weights , is down .
Dieting , which since the 1970s has grown into a $ 61 billion / year industry in the U.S. , can help to ratchet up weights if diets are repeated in rapid succession .
And so on .
So , for that ‘ obesity epidemic ’ , the entire bell curve has scooted over , not because it ’s the fat people eating more or being sloths compared to the thinner people .
Fat and thin have been clinically shown , by researchers at the University of Rockefeller and others , to eat and behave no differently to explain the diversities of sizes .
And , as you see from the bell curve , despite the media portrayals , the variation of our sizes is n’t nearly as dramatically different today than it ’s always been .
Through a lifetime of diligently controlling eating and behaviors , most people can have a long - term control over their weight within a 10 - 15 pound range , according to Dr. Friedman and colleagues , not enough to change someone ’s body type .
Just as true obesity is primarily genetic and not caused by or changed by how much people eat or how active they are , so will interventions focused on calories in - out — and all the fruits and vegetables and sidewalks in the world — do nothing to eradicate actual obesity .
As Dr. Friedman added about the misguided focus on calories and foods :
[ T ]he focus is wrong and there are many levels at which to answer the question .
The first is that the idea that you can change your weight voluntarily is one that the diet industry has a huge financial interest in .
And so anybody can tune into infomercials telling you what you need to do to lose weight is fork over some money to their diet plan , eat it or not eat it and you ’ll lose weight .
And I do n’t think that message and that marketing muscle can be easily counteracted by what scientists have to say about it .
Part of the problem is that that notion fits in with people ’s intuition .
And this gets very complicated .
It ’s a control issue ; people want to feel like they ’re in control of what they eat and what they weigh ... the available evidence would suggest that the vast majority of people who find themselves at a particular weight — be it thin , medium , or heavy — that ’s pretty much their weight .
Now actually one of my neighbors heard me talking about this at one point and he said , “ Oh , but that ’s so sad . ”
Well , I do n’t know ...
I mean it ’s also sad if you do n’t like your height and you do n’t like your eye color and you do n’t like lots of things about yourself .
It ’s that somehow people think this is something they ought to be able to control .
And they accept all these other things you ca n’t control that are just who you are .
But people are very loathe to believe that what they weigh is [ what ] they are .
And others to accept them as they are , too .
This is the eighth post in an article series about MIT 's lecture course " Introduction to Algorithms . "
In this post I will review lecture twelve , which introduces an efficient search structure called Skip Lists .
Skip lists are an efficient data structure that can be used in place of balanced trees .
Skip lists use probabilistic balancing rather than strictly enforce balancing and as a result the algorithms for insertion and deletion in skip lists are much simpler to implement and significantly faster than the equivalent algorithms for balanced search trees ( see lectures 9 and 10 for search trees ) .
Here is the first publication ever on skip lists by their inventor William Pugh - Skip Lists : A Probabalistic Alternative to Balanced Trees
The lecture begins with Erik Demaine ( professor ) telling the students that before the lecture he implemented skip lists to see how fast it could be done .
It took him 10 minutes to implement linked lists ( on which skip lists are based ) and took another 30 to implement skip lists themselves ( +30 mins debugging ; ) ) .
He says that they are so simple that at no point did he have to think while implementing them .
Compare it to red - black trees for example , where you have to think really hard to implement the operations to maintain red - black tree properties ( see lecture 10 on red - black trees ) .
The lecture continues with derivation of skip lists from scratch .
First , a single sorted linked list is considered .
Searching in a sorted linked list takes O( n ) .
Then another sorted linked list is added .
The added linked list is chosen to be a sublist of the first linked list .
The elements that both lists share are linked together with another link ( see my scanned lecture notes below to see how it looks ) .
The search cost for such structure is O ( 2·sqrt ( n ) ) .
Then another and another linked list is added , the search cost goes down to O ( 3· n 1/3 ) , O ( 4·n1/4 ) , ... , O( k·n1 / k ) .
Now , what should k be ?
Take it to be log(n ) , we get running time of O ( lg ( n ) ·n1 / lg( n ) ) , which is O ( 2·lg ( n ) ) - logarithmic time search structure !
The lecture also presents Search ( x ) method for finding the element x in a skip list , and Insert ( x ) method for inserting the element x in a skip list .
The rest of the lecture is allocated to the proof that the search operation in skiplists takes O ( lg ( n ) ) time with high probability .

A marriage registrar was harassed for refusing to conduct same - sex ceremonies , a tribunal has ruled .
Lillian Ladele , who said the civil partnership ceremonies went against her Christian faith , hailed the decision as a " victory for religious liberty " .
The tribunal ruled that Miss Ladele was discriminated against on grounds of religious beliefs and was harassed .
Islington council said it was " disappointed " and was considering an appeal against the ruling .
' Wider implications ' Until December 2007 registrars in Islington effectively worked on a freelance basis and could swap with each other to avoid same - sex ceremonies 14
But since then they have been under direct control of the local authority which , it is claimed , has led to far less flexibility about the registrars ' responsibilities .
Miss Ladele said she was being effectively forced to choose between her religion and her £ 31,000 - a- year job as a result .
Gay rights should not be used as an excuse to bully and harass people over their religious beliefs
Lillian Ladele
She said she was picked on , shunned and accused of being homophobic for refusing to carry out civil partnerships .
Miss Ladele said : " I am delighted at this decision .
" It is a victory for religious liberty , not just for myself but for others in a similar position to mine .
" Gay rights should not be used as an excuse to bully and harass people over their religious beliefs , " she said .
Councillor John Gilbert , Islington Council 's Executive Member for Human Resources , said : " We 're clearly disappointed with the result , as we consider our approach was the right one .
" We are now considering the judgment carefully in order to decide whether we should appeal .
" The wider issue of whether councils should be able to expect employees to carry out civil partnerships does n't seem to have been fully addressed . "
He added the ruling could have " wider implications " for local authorities .
' Catastrophic judgement '
Gay rights campaigner Peter Tatchell said the ruling was a " dangerous subversion " and a " violation of human rights " .
" Lillian Ladele claims she has won a victory for religious liberty .
No , she has not .
She has won a victory for the right to discriminate , " he said .
" Public servants like registrars have a duty to serve all members of the public without fear or favour .
Once society lets some people opt out of upholding the law , where will it end ? "
Condemning the " catastrophic judgement " the National Secular Society said : " This decision appears to show that religious rights trump gay rights and that should leave gay people quaking in their boots . "

I was going to call this post “ A portrait of an electrical engineer as a young man ( or woman ) ” but decided against it .
I ’ve got nothing on James Joyce , neither in loquaciousness nor confusing writing .
Anyway , I have been pondering what kind of employee I would hire out of school for an electrical engineering position .
There are some basic skill sets that will allow just about any young engineer to succeed if they have these skills ( the best situation ) or at least appear they will succeed if written on their resume ( not the best situation ) .
Either way , let ’s look over what a new grad should have on their utility belt before going out into the scary real world .
Conceptual models of passive components —
This has been one of the most helpful things I have learned since I have left school … because this kind of thinking is not taught in classrooms ( at least it is n’t in the curriculum ) .
The idea is to conceptualize what a component will do , as opposed to what the math is behind a certain component or why the physics of material in a component give it certain properties .
Why does this matter ?
When you ’re looking at a 20 page schematic of something you ’ve never seen before , you do n’t care what kind of dielectric is in a capacitor and how the electric field affects the impedance .
Nope , you care about two things :
What is the value and how does it affect the system .
The first question is easy because it should be written right next to the symbolic notation .
The second is different for each type of passive component you might encounter .
Let ’s look at the common ones Resistors —
The best way I ’ve found to think of resistors is like a pipe .
The electrons are like water .
The resistance is the opposite of how wide the pipe is ( if the resistance is higher , the pipe is smaller , letting fewer electrons through in the form of current ) .
Also , the pressure ( voltage ) it takes to get water ( electrons , current ) through a pipe ( resistor ) will depend on the thickness of the pipe ( resistance ) .
Well whaddaya know ?
V=IR !
Capacitors —
At DC , a capacitor is essentially an open circuit ( think a broken wire ) .
If you apply charge long enough ( depending on the capacitance ) , it can consume some of that charge ; after it is charged it will once again act like an open circuit .
When considering AC ( varying ) signals , the best way to think about a capacitor is like a variable resistor .
The thing controlling how much the capacitor will resist the circuit is the frequency of the signal trying to get through the capacitor .
As the frequency of the signal goes up , the resistance ( here it is called “ impedance ” ) will go down .
So in the extreme case , if the frequency is super high , the capacitor will appear as though it is not there to the signal ( and it will “ pass right through ” ) .
Taking the opposite approach helps explain the DC case .
If the signal is varying so slowly that it appears to be constant ( DC ) , then the impedance of the capacitor will be very high ( so high it appears to be a broken wire to the signal ) .
Inductors —
Inductors have an opposite effect as capacitors and provide some very interesting effects when you combine them in a circuit with capacitors .
In their most basic form , inductors are wires that can be formed into myriad shape but are most often seen as spirals .
Inductors are “ happy ” when low frequency signals go through them ; this means that the impedance is low at low frequencies ( DC ) and is high at high frequencies ( AC ) .
This makes sense to me because if the signal is going slow enough , it ’s really just passing through a wire , albeit a twisty one .
An interesting thing about electrons going through a wire is that when they do , they also product tiny magnetic fields around the wire ( as explained by Maxwell ’s Equations ) .
When a high frequency signal tries to go through the inductor , the magnetic fields are changing very rapidly , something they intrinsically do not want .
Instead it “ slows ” the electrons , or really increases the impedance .
This “ stops ” higher frequency signals from passing through depending on the inductance of the inductor and the frequency of the signal applied .
Looking at the how they react to different frequencies , we can see how inductors and capacitors have opposite effects at the extremes .
Diodes —
I think of diodes as a one way mirror … except you ca n’t see through the one way until you get enough energy .
The one way nature is useful in blocking unwanted signals , routing signals away from sensitive nodes and even limiting what part of a varying signal will “ get through ” the diode to the other side .
Transistors —
I always like thinking of transistors as a variable resistor that is controlled by the gate voltage .
The variable resistor does n’t kick in until the gate voltage hits a certain threshold and sometimes the variable resistor also allows some energy to leak to one of the other terminals .
C coding —
Sorry to all you analog purists out there , but at some point as an engineer , you need to know how to code .
Furthermore , if you ’re going to learn how to code , my personal preference for languages to start with is C .
Not too many other languages have been around for as long nor are they as closely tied to hardware ( C is good for writing low level drivers that interpret what circuits are saying so they can talk to computers ) .
I ’m not saying higher level languages do n’t have their place , but I think that C is a much better place to start because many other languages ( C++ , JAVA , Verilog , etc ) have similar structure and can quickly be learned if you know C .
Even though the learning curve is higher for C , I think it is worth it in the end and would love to see some college programs migrate back towards these kinds of languages , especially as embedded systems seem to be everywhere these days .
How an op amp works —
I set the op amp apart from the passives because it is an active component ( duh ) and because I think that it ’s so much more versatile that it ’s important to set it apart conceptually .
I ’ve always had the most luck anthropomorphizing op amps and figuring out what state they “ want ” to be in .
Combining how you conceptually think about op amps and passives together can help to conceptualize more difficult components , such as active filters and analog to digital converters .
The ability to translate an example —
A skill that nearly every engineering class is teaching , with good reason .
Ask yourself : are homework problems ever THAT much different from the examples in the book ?
No .
Because they want you to recognize a technique or a idiosyncrasy in a problem , look at the accepted solution and then apply it to your current situation .
Amazingly , this is one of the most useful skills learned in the classroom .
Everyday engineering involves using example solutions from vendors , research done in white papers / publications and using even your old textbooks to find the most effective , and more importantly , the quickest solution to a problem .
High level system design —
This is similar to the first point , but the important skill here is viewing the entire picture .
If you are concentrating on the gain of a single amplification stage , you may not notice that it is being used to scale a signal before it goes into an analog - to - digital converter .
If you see a component or a node is grounded periodically , but ignore it , you may find out that it changes the entire nature of a circuit .
The ability to separate the minutiae from the overarching purpose of a circuit is necessary to quickly diagnose circuits for repair or replication in design .
Basic laws —
It is amazing to me how much depth is needed in electrical engineering as opposed to breadth .
You do n’t need to know all of the equations in the back of your textbook .
You need to know 5 - 10 ; but you need to know them so well that you could recite them and derive other things from them in your sleep .
A good example would be Kirchoff ’s laws .
Sure , they are two ( relatively ) simple laws about the currents in a node and the voltage around a loop , but done millions of times and you have a fun little program called SPICE .
Budgeting —
There are many important budgets to consider when designing a new project .
In a simple op amp circuit , there are many sources of error and inefficiencies .
Determining and optimizing an error budget will ensure the most accurate output possible .
Finding and determining areas that burn power unnecessarily must be discovered and then power saving techniques must be implemented .
The cost is another consideration that is usually left to non-engineering , but is an important consideration in many different projects .
Finding cost effective solutions to a problem ( including the cost of an engineer ’s time ) is a skill that will make you friends in management and will help you find practical solutions to many problems .
Math —
Ah yes , an oldy but goody .
Similar to the passive components , having a conceptual notion of what math is required and how it can be applied to real life situation is more important than the details .
Often knowing that an integral function is needed is as important as knowing how to do it .
And similar to the basic laws , you do n’t need to know the most exotic types of math out there .
I have encountered very few situations where I need to take the third derivative of a complicated natural log function ; however , I have needed to convert units every single day I have been an engineer .
I have needed simple arithmetic , but I ’ve needed to do it quickly and correctly .
Sure , you get to use a calculator in the real world , but you better learn how to use that quickly too , because your customers do n’t want to wait for you to get out your calculator , let alone learn how it works .
Each of these skills could be useful in some capacity for a new electrical engineer grad .
There are many different flavors of engineering and the skills listed above are really modeled off what would be good for an analog system engineer ( who develop commercial or industrial products ) .
However , a future chip designer and even a digital hardware engineer all could benefit from having the skills listed , as it is sometimes more important to be open to new opportunities ( especially given the possibility of recession and potential shifting of job markets ) .
Did I miss anything ?
Do you think there are other skills that are necessary for young electrical engineers ?
What about general skills that could apply to all young engineers ?

Excellent raw , uncut footage of a young citizen journalist fleeing the “ Free Speech ” zone which had suddenly come under assault by law enforcement despite the fact that the permit for the area was supposed to be good for over 2 1/2 hours .
It was just after 8 p.m. when this footage was shot , and the permit was good until 11 p.m. Jodin Morey , IFP cofounder , was shot in the back with a rubber bullet as he was obeying orders to disperse / leave the area .
http://rnc08report.org/archive/video/Protestors-Tear-Gassed-Raw-footage.shtml
This is the very best raw video footage I ’ve found that gives a clear impression of the panic instigated by the preemptive assault policy employed by law enforcement in their warfare against dissidents and peaceful protesters outside the Xcel Center in downtown Saint Paul , Minnesota during its occupation by the GOP during the RNC 2008
And this panic was initiated by law enforcement at the designated “ FREE SPEECH ZONE ” that was permitted to be occupied for another couple of hours .
It was the planned location for the conclusion of that day ’s march .
That was a part of the permit signed by City of St. Paul officials .
The Ramsey County Sheriff ’s office – where Elliott Hughes was beaten and tortured at the hands of Sheriff Bob Fletcher ’s thugs – was fully aware that the permit was good until 11 p.m. – another couple of hours away at the time of the shooting of this video .
There is no way to tell you how much I hate what the fascists are doing to our freedoms .
Are you awake yet ?
If you did n’t see this on your news source , that is because this is what it is like to live inside of the bubble of disinformation the corporate news shrink wraps you inside of .
Are you numb yet ?
If you are n’t absolutely revolted and disgusted , you most certainly are n’t paying attention .

Call them and give them an earful .
I did .
They hung up on me after about 15 minutes of my challenging Fletcher to an open debate about whether or not preemptive assault , unlawful search and seizure , harassment and torture are a part of official Ramsey County Sheriff policy .
They have n’t gotten back to me on that one , even though I left my phone number multiple times .

From the NYT :
The Democratic chairman of a House investigative committee presented documents to the Pentagon on Thursday charging that a top Republican fund - raiser , Harry Sargeant III , made tens of millions of dollars in profits over the last four years because his contracting company vastly overcharged for deliveries of fuel to American air bases in Iraq … .
Mr. Waxman uses e-mail messages , company documents , Pentagon reports and other information to make the case that Mr. Sargeant repeatedly received contracts to deliver the fuel even though his company was not the lowest bidder … .
Mr. Sargeant is one of several dozen people who are listed on Senator McCain ’s Web site as having raised $ 500,000 or more for him .
He was the host of a fund - raiser for Mr. McCain at his mansion in Delray Beach , Fla. , this year .
Mr. Sargeant came under scrutiny in August when media reports highlighted a cluster of more than $ 50,000 in unusual campaign contributions bundled together by Mr. Sargeant from a single extended family in California and a few of their friends .
The donations set off questions of whether they might have been made by donors in name only who were reimbursed by someone trying to skirt contribution limits .
It turned out that the donations were not actually solicited by Mr. Sargeant but by another Jordanian business partner , Mustafa Abu Naba’a .
The McCain campaign later said it would return all contributions solicited by Mr. Abu Naba ’a and review all donations collected by Mr. Sargeant .
The 3rd Infantry Division ’s 1st Brigade Combat Team Has New Mission ; The US By By KJ Mullins Sep 25 , 2008 in World Starting October 1 the 3rd Infantry Division ’s 1st Brigade Combat Team has a new post , the United States of America .
They will be the ones on call to deal with natural or man made emergencies and disasters , including terrorist attacks .
Army Times discusses the new mission saying that it will be a permanent one .
“ Right now , the response force requirement will be an enduring mission .
How the [ Defense Department ] chooses to source that and whether or not they continue to assign them to NorthCom , that could change in the future , ” said Army Col.
Louis Vogler , chief of NorthCom future operations .
“ Now , the plan is to assign a force every year . ”
The soldiers will be operating out of Fort Stewart , Georgia .
There they will be allowed to go to school , take time to be with their families and train for their homeland mission as well as the counterinsurgency in war zone areas .
The soldiers are not scheduled to be sent to either Iraq or Afghanistan until 2010 , that gives them 20 months to work with Homeland Security .
Their new mission is bringing to the table a different element , how to subdue without killing .
The 1st BCT ’s soldiers also will learn how to use “ the first ever nonlethal package that the Army has fielded , ” 1st BCT commander Col .
Roger Cloutier said , referring to crowd and traffic control equipment and nonlethal weapons designed to subdue unruly or dangerous individuals without killing them .
“ It ’s a new modular package of nonlethal capabilities that they ’re fielding .
They ’ve been using pieces of it in Iraq , but this is the first time that these modules were consolidated and this package fielded , and because of this mission we ’re undertaking we were the first to get it . ”
Other branches of the armed forces will be working on the NorthCom and DOD mission .
The team will be composed of an Air Force engineer and medical units , the Marine Corps Chemical , Biological Initial Reaction Force , a Navy weather team and members of the Defense Logistics Agency and the Defense Threat Reduction Agency .
Communications between the services is one of the areas Vogler will be addressing .
“ I do n’t know what America ’s overall plan is — I just know that 24 hours a day , seven days a week , there are soldiers , sailors , airmen and Marines that are standing by to come and help if they ’re called , ” Cloutier said .
“ It makes me feel good as an American to know that my country has dedicated a force to come in and help the people at home . ”
The Brigade is used to hostile lands , they have been restoring essential services and escorting supply convoys for the past 60 months in Iraq .

In the mid-1990s , the Alaskan Independence Party was experiencing a boom of sorts .
A governor had been elected on its ticket in 1990 , when the party was not even a decade old .
And membership was swelling .
Among the new recruits was Todd Palin , whose wife , Sarah , would later become governor of Alaska .
The Palins attended the party ’s convention in their hometown , Wasilla , in 1994 , according to party officials , where the party called for a revote on statehood and a draft constitution for an independent Republic of Alaska .
Mr. Palin joined the party .
Ms. Palin remained a Republican and never joined the Alaskan Independence Party , but returned to its convention in 2006 to speak as candidate for governor .
After she had been elected , she recorded a video greeting that was played at the party convention this year .
“ Good luck on a successful and inspiring convention , ” she said .
“ Keep up the good work , and God bless you . ”
Now that she is the Republican nominee for vice president  for a campaign whose motto is “ Country first ”  the couple ’s interaction with the Alaskan Independence Party has gotten attention because of its reputation as a secessionist group .
The saga of the Custer Channelwing is probably the most interesting of all V / STOL aircraft .
It is without doubt , the oldest ongoing saga in aviation .
This is the story of a single minded man on a single minded mission to change the path of aviation .
Years of research , tests by every conceivable variety of agency , and stunning flying examples , did n't add up to commercial production of the Channelwing .
It is n't that the Custer would n't perform , it was rather , that maybe it performed unbelievably well , with the accent on unbelievable .
Willard Custer made many claims for the Channelwing , including the discovery of new lift principles , which he called , " aerophysics " .
Most engineers , cynics and parents , know you can't get something , for nothing .
So when Custer claimed 8.2 pounds of static lift per horsepower , with a simple fixed wing aircraft , critics scoffed and tended to look the other way .
But , Custer was persistent to say the least .
In time , he was back , claiming 13.8 pounds lift per horsepower , vertical capabilities , fighter like speed , simple construction , and heavy load capacity , beyond anything built to date .
He also hinted that the university academia and manufacturers did n't know what they were talking about when they criticized the Channelwing , and needed to be re-trained to understand his new theories of lift .
It was obvious by this time that he was a crackpot inventor , untrained in the aeronautical world , and tiresome to listen to .
Custer was dumped into the dustbin of aviation history for obvious reasons .
So obvious , in fact , that no one stopped to notice that , for the most part , he was right .
CCW - 5 five seconds into takeoff run .
This aircraft can be seen at the Mid Atlantic Air Museum , in Reading , Pennsylvania .
The idea of the channelwing pre-dates most of those who are reading this site .
It all began in the 1920s , when Willard Custer took shelter in a barn during a near hurricane velocity storm .
Much to his surprise and fascination , the roof of the barn suddenly lifted off , and soared through the air .
He wondered why an airplane had to gather speed on a runway , while a barn roof , a poor airfoil by any reckoning , could fly from a standing start .
He soon came to the realization that it was , the speed of the air , over the surface , not the speed of the surface through the air that created lift .
Bernoulli principle in both cases , but an application that had eluded aviation up to that time .
He settled on the idea of pulling the air through channels that were , in fact , the lower half of a venturi .
He was reversing the normal method of powered flight .
Instead of using the engines to move the airfoil through the air , he used the engine to move the air through the airfoil .
His channel had the effect of going several hundred miles per hour , due to the induced air flow , while standing still .
The airflow over the surface of the channel created conventional lift , and a lot of it .
It was at this point that Custer settled on , " It 's the speed of the air , not the airspeed " , which became his mantra of , " aerophysics " .
Many experiments followed with all nature of devices .
The first real aircraft to which he applied his principle , was the CCW - 1 , or Custer Channelwing number one , which now hangs at the Garber facility of the Smithsonian .
It is still strangely modern , even after all these years , with a smoothly rounded fuselage , and a wrap around Plexiglas canopy .
But , close inspection reveals the channels appended with two by four struts .
Two 75 HP engines were fitted into the two six foot diameter half - barrel like channels , and the tests were started .
First flight was November 12 , 1942 .
The CCW - 1 was used for test purposes only , to prove the concept .
More than 300 hours of flight tests did prove that the Custer not only flew , but was capable of flight without wings .
After the first flights proved stability , the wings were progressively cut off or had spoilers attached to the point of having no lift from the wings at all .
The test pilot noticed no difference because the channels furnished all the lift needed !
Most of these tests were low , straight ahead hops .
A demonstration took place in Beltsville Maryland for Brigadier General W. E. Gilmore .
Gilmore was noted for his gruff temperament , but after seeing the demonstration , was excited enough to place a call to Orville Wright , asking that he come out to witness the Custer phenomenon .
Orville did n't make it , but the plane was placed in a military test program .
The results of these tests proved to be typical of the many government tests the Channel wing received over the years .
The Army Air Force technical report concluded that the lift generated by the channels was similar to normal induced lift created by other wing / propeller arrangements .
Although this was a complete falsification , the damage was done , and Custer was on the defensive .
What they forgot to mention , was that the channelwing created more static lift than the weight of the test vehicle , and was , in fact , capable of vertical takeoff !
The report stated that the channelwing was inferior to the helicopter in creating static lift and did not show sufficient promise of military value to warrant further testing .
This was at a time when every conceivable concept from flying wings to rocket ships was being tried .
The conclusion , both then and now , seems incomprehensible to say the least .
To Custer , it was obvious that the tests had been too good , and consequently helicopter interests were pushing him out of the picture .
That seems to be the most likely scenario , as later tests proved the channelwing to outlift helicopters of the day , with 13.8 pounds of lift per horsepower recorded .
Custer was a good inventor , but a little naive about politics and government contracts .
He also felt that the engineering staff and theorists just did n't understand the Custer phenomenon , as they did n't understand " aero physics " .
But , if faith in the government was dimmed , faith in himself was n't .
Over the next forty years , he obtained financial backing for a series of aircraft from CCW - 2 to CCW - 5 .
He had enough data and tests to convince enough investors to bring him near full production on at least two occasions .
In 1951 , he co-operated with the Baumann Aircraft Company , and modified one of their twin pusher aircraft to a Custer configuration .
This was the CCW - 5 , and had two 225 HP engines , and weighed en excess of 4300 pounds .
Walker Davidson made the first flight of the CCW - 5 in July of 1953 .
As usual , the aircraft was highly successful .
Demonstrations repeatedly showed hair raising maximum performance takeoffs , nose high climbs at speeds so low it seemed obvious that the Custer would fall out of the sky .
Three second takeoffs , with nose high steep turns of 45 to 60 degrees bank , at speeds below 30MPH gave the CCW - 5 the ability to take off and do a 180 before most planes could lift off .
Video of these flights still confound experienced pilots .
Although I have personally logged 20,000 + hours , in all nature of aircraft , I was absolutely stunned the first time I saw the videos of the Custer doing a 150 foot takeoff , roll into a steep bank at speeds that would have insured a stall - spin - crash , in any other plane , and leave town going the other way , while staying within what appeared to be about a 250 ' square area .
Slow flight was a specialty , and the CCW - 5 flew at a measured 22 MPH and on August 27 , 1954 hovered against an 11 MPH wind , although it was not modified to use maximum lift potential .
Cruise speed remained a normal 170 mph .
These tests attracted more investors , and it seemed that Custer and Noordyun Aircraft Ltd. of Canada were going to do a production run of at least 100 aircraft .
On the strength of this proposal , a production version of the CCW - 5 was built and rolled out on July 4 of 1964 .
Although it looked like the original Baumann conversion , the second model was built from scratch , rather than modified from an existing aircraft .
Now came the securities and exchange commission who claimed the stock was not issued correctly , and the deal fell through , in a manner reminiscent of the Tucker car .
Since then , the Custer channelwing has virtually disappeared , and few have even heard of the aircraft , let alone its ' questionable capabilities .

So , they can just decide to disqualify ballots and offer no recourse for votes to be counted ?
I think someone needs to file a lawsuit or make an FOIA request to get the counts of the spoiled ballots .
I smell a rat ..

Awesome comment Kira .
So there are like actual laws to prevent this kind of thing .
That 's so cool .
So much like the country I remember living in a long time ago .
I 'm sure you remember too .
I sure miss it .
It seems like the fix is going in earlier this time , eh ? Makes sense .
There is a lot more to fix this time .
What will we do this time when once again , there are massive numbers of people turned away from the polls , enough to swing the election the other way , and hold - ups that prevent hundreds of thousands of people from ever making it into the polling place .
And exit polls that say Obama won , with official results saying the opposite .
I think this is what we should expect .
This is all what I expect .
Oh , right , there are are all those lawyers working behind the scenes .
Why do I think they are going to stay right there and do nothing , just the way that they did with Kerry ?
Does it look to anyone else like there just MUST be more to the Democrats inaction than simple cluelessness and faith in the status quo ?
Like maybe they are scared and cowed , and they have been told that they can expect to be arrested for domestic terrorism if they do anything to cause people to question the outcome of the elections ?
In physics , when you push on an object and it does n't move like you would expect it to , you can infer that there are forces at work that you can't see .
It seems to me that there are unseen forces at work here .
I do n't get it , but something is going on .
At a minimum , I think the word has been put out to all the network journalists , about what kind of things they can say and not say , and if they say anything about having been told what they can say , it wo n't be aired anyway , and their career will be over .
So they play along .
Will we play along again this year , or take to the streets in protest ?
I 'll be on the street corner in my town holding a sign up .
Please stand with me , if it comes to that .
Or at least honk in solidarity as you drive by .
You 'll recognize me .
I 'll be wearing orange .

I do n't understand one thing .
If a vote is rejected due to a signature not matching ( yes , I know some do not have consistent exact signatures ) then , in my view , a ballot is not " cast , " giving the voter the right to do something to not be disenfranchised - of course no later than election day .
Also , I know many many people whose signatures are simply a flourish or some squiggly ( sp ? ) lines .
How are those signatures dealt with ?
It seems there is a lot of room for subjective decisions being made by a low - level worker at the Board of Elections .
Oh please let Senator Obama win .
The nightmare must end now .

Is Terrarium Better Than ShowBox ?
Find Out Which One Dominates
A lot of people would like to enjoy watching movies or TV shows on a daily basis .
However , work pressures and schedules might get in the way of making this a reality .
Therefore , people are looking for ways to compromise .
Thus , a comparison of two popular apps namely ShowBox and Terrarium TV has been made .
Here are some of the points that you can ponder and later decide which one suits your taste better .
Terrarium TV
This app is perfect for smartphone users who want to watch TV anytime , anywhere .
Pros :
A huge collection of movies based on genres
Contains new and old movies and TV shows from around the world
It enables you to mark your favorite movie that you can watch later
Provides support for Firestick and Chromecast , among other devices very well
No extra charges while watching any video in between the app
Runs on Android and iOS devices , Fire TV , Smart TV , and PC or Laptops .
Perfect for people who have different tastes
Cons :
Takes up much of your memory
Contains some standard features of downloading TV shows and movies
Takes too much time downloading films and TV shows
ShowBox
Another Android TV app is called ShowBox , which is considered better than other TV apps .
Here are things you need to know about ShowBox .
Pros :
Has a massive list of movies , sports videos , news , and other TV programs
Does n’t support charges or purchases around the app
Regularly updates new movies and TV shows
Provides am authentic list of TV show and movies , which wo n’t harm your PC or smartphones
Cons :
It would lower the speed of your smartphone upon usage
It consumes a huge amount of memory
Becomes less useful when server issues arise from time to time
Overall , you can tell that ShowBox is better than Terrarium TV due to some impressive characteristics , along with the higher picture quality and other options .
The announcement that Led Zeppelin , the rock 'n 'roll deities of the early 1970s , are to reunite for a tour without their singer Robert Plant calls many important issues into question .
One is the issue of authenticity .
Can the band present itself to its worshippers as the genuine article , when it lacks Plant 's unique falsetto screech ?
They may point to several instances when a replacement singer has been , as it were , grafted on to the vestigial musical body : Paul Rogers replacing the late Freddie Mercury as front man of Queen , Ronnie James Dio standing in for Ozzy Osbourne in Black Sabbath , similar substitutions in Deep Purple , Motley Crue and Iron Maiden .
They seldom work .
When Phil Collins replaced Peter Gabriel as singer with Genesis , the band nosedived into mediocrity .
Next month sees the 1970s stadium band , Yes , reforming for a tour in which the straining falsetto of Jon Anderson will be substituted by Benoit David , whose stage experience has been confined to Yes tribute bands in Canada .
So we must ask : if the singer is a professional Yes fake , why should fans accept the new - look Yes as authentically Yes ?
Download the new Independent Premium app Sharing the full story , not just the headlines
In the case of Led Zeppelin , our confusion is compounded by two things .
First , the talented Mr Plant cannot now quite reach the astonishing high notes to which he once had unfettered access .
Should a replacement singer mimic
Plant 's incapacity , or should he be employed because he can sing as high as Plant used to ?
If the latter , does this make him " better " than the genuine Robert Plant ?
Second , the drummer on the Led Zeppelin tour will be Jason Bonham , son of the late John Bonham , the band 's original drummer .
Jason was barely alive in the Zeppelin heyday , but has been accepted by fans as a kind of mystical manifestation of his father .
Is he , therefore , " the real thing " by some genetic osmosis ?
All of which enquiries are as chaff in the wind to the average Zeppelin fan , who will happily pay £ 100 for a ticket to the new tour .
Those who attended the band 's one - off 02 Arena gig last year speak of the experience in hushed whispers , as the greatest rock gig in history .
To suggest that the fans were merely adulating their own fiery , long - haired youth , and will continue to do so , would be cynical ; but clear thinking is not part of the rock fan 's mental repertoire .
As long as it summons up their past with sufficient conviction , they will love a reunion by Sham 69 or Blodwyn Pig or Dave Dee , Dozy , Beaky , Mick and Tich – even if aware that Mick and Tich have been replaced by people with quite different names .
The only person who emerges with dignity out of rock music 's current strip - mining of the past is Robert Plant .
No amount of cash will persuade him back on the yellow brick road , while he pursues his new interest in making beautiful music with the country fiddler Alison Krauss .
A 1970s musician who puts creative exploration above money ?
It 's not very rock 'n 'roll , is it ?

I read Holman Jenkins 's " Boone Doggle " ( Business World , Aug. 6 ) about my energy plan and I 'm convinced that he has n't even read my plan .
So for the benefit of Mr. Jenkins and his readers , I 'll go over it again .
There are two numbers everybody should keep in mind .
The first is 70 % -- that 's how much of our oil comes from foreign nations .
The ...
Although there are rules and guidelines that should be observed by debt collection companies , they do not always keep to these .
Some have been known to use dishonest and borderline illegal tactics , meaning you need to be on your guard .
Here is how to deal with debt collectors if they come calling :
Find out what you owe and to whom
When dealing with a debt collector , find out exactly what they want , where the debt they are collecting has come from and how much they believe you owe .
It is important to do this before you acknowledge that you owe them any money .
Write to the debt collection agency in question asking for a copy of your original credit agreement - they must legally provide this .
Tell them that you wish only to be contacted be post - this should prevent telephone calls and home visits , which are difficult to keep track of .
If you have no knowledge of the debt in question , inform them in writing that this is not your debt , and that you will contact the Trading Standards if they contact you again about it .
What to do if you owe money and can pay ?
If the debt is question is legitimate and you can afford to clear some or all of it , the easiest solution is just to pay up .
Delaying unnecessarily is likely to lead to further hassle from the debt collection company and could lead to court action and the appointment of bailiffs in the long run .
Once you have settled you should also make sure the company updates your credit file to show that the debt is now satisfied .
What to do if you owe money and cannot pay ?
If you cannot afford to pay the debt , you may be able to agree a repayment plan with the debt collection agency , even if this is a nominal amount each month .
However , before you contact them to negotiate a plan , you should seek advice from an independent charity such as the Citizens Advice Bureau , StepChange or the National Debt Line .
Once you have contacted a debt charity , you should be given a grace period of up to 30 days by the debt collection agency .
This should allow you to sort your finances and establish how much you can afford to pay .
Can debt collectors enter your home ?
The debt collector should only come into your home if you have invited them to .
This means they cannot force their way in , either by breaking in or by pushing past you when you open the door .
They must also leave your property if you ask them to .
If you do not answer the door or refuse to let them in , there is little that they can do about it .
You can also write to them and ask they only communicate with you by phone or in writing .
Can bailiffs enter your home ?
In most cases a bailiff cannot enter your property without your permission .
However , they can enter your home without your consent if they can do so without breaking in or causing damage .
This is called " gaining peaceful entry " and means that if you leave a door unlocked or a window open that they can come into your home .
Even in the limited cases where they can legally break into your home , they should only do this as a last resort after other reasonable measures have been pursued .
Can debt collectors take your possessions ?
Different rules apply to bailiffs and debt collection companies when it comes to seizing possessions .
Bailiffs
There are set rules on what bailiffs can and can't take from your property .
They cannot take the following :
Things you need for day to day life - clothes , cooker , furniture or tools for work
Items that do not belong to you , like your partner 's or flatmate 's possessions
However , they can take luxury items and anything from outside your home , including your car and garden equipment .
Debt collection companies
Unlike registered bailiffs , debt collection companies cannot take your possessions .
They do not have the same legal powers as a bailiff and can only visit your home to discuss repayment of your debts .
Can debt collectors take your wages ?
A debt collector or creditor needs court approval before they can take your pay direct from your employer .
They will only be able to get this if you 've had a CCJ in place for a certain amount of time .
The court would decide how much money they can take and for how long .
The courts will then be responsible for making arrangements with your employer and for passing the agreed amount to the company you owe money to .
Your creditor and the debt collection company cannot apply for an attachment of earnings order if you are :
Unemployed
Self employed
In the armed forces or the merchant navy

If you disassemble a single binary , you can never tell why something was done in a certain way .
If you have eight different versions , you can tell a lot .
This episode of “ Computer Archeology ” is about reverse engineering eight different versions of Microsoft BASIC 6502 ( Commodore , AppleSoft etc. ) , reconstructing the family tree , and understanding when bugs were fixed and when new bugs , features and easter eggs were introduced .
This article also presents a set of assembly source files that can be made to compile into a byte exact copy of seven different versions of Microsoft BASIC , and lets you even create your own version .
Microsoft BASIC for MOS 6502
First written in 1976 , Microsoft BASIC for the 8 bit MOS 6502 has been available for virtually every 6502 - based computer including the Commodore series ( PET , C64 ) , the Apple II series , Atari 8 bit machines , and many more .
These are the first eight versions of Microsoft BASIC :
Name Release VER ROM FP ROR Buffer Extensions Version Commodore BASIC 1 1977 Y 9 Y ZP CBM 1.0 OSI BASIC 1977 1.0rev3.2 Y 6 Y – 1.0a AppleSoft I 1977 1.1 N 9 Y 0200 Apple 1.1 KIM BASIC 1977 1.1 N 9 N ZP – 1.1a AppleSoft II 1978 Y 9 Y 0200 Apple 2 Commodore BASIC 2 1979 Y 9 Y 0200 CBM 2a KBD BASIC 1982 Y 6 Y 0700 KBD 2 b MicroTAN 1980 Y 9 N ZP – 2c
Name : Name of the computer system or BASIC interpreter
Release : Release date of this version – not necessarily the date when the source code was forked from Microsoft’s
VER : Version string inside the interpreter itself
ROM : Whether the software shipped in ROM , or was a program supposed to be loaded into RAM
FP : Whether the 6 digit or 9 digit floating point library was included .
9 digit als means that long error messages were included instead of two character codes , and the GET statement was supported .
ROR : Whether the ROR assembly instruction was used or whether the code worked around it
Buffer : Location of the direct mode input buffer ; either zero page or above
Extensions :
What BASIC extensions were added by the OEM , of any .
Version :
My private version number used in this article and in my combined source
The Microsoft BASIC 6502 Combined Source Code
Download the assembly source code here : msbasic.zip
In order to assemble if , you will need the CC65 compiler / assembler / linker package .
The source can be assembled into byte - exact versions of the following seven BASICs :
Commodore BASIC 1
OSI BASIC
AppleSoft I
KIM - 1 BASIC
Commodore BASIC 2 ( PET )
Intellivision Keyboard Component BASIC
MicroTAN BASIC
You can build the source by running the shell script make .sh .
This will create the seven files cbmbasic1.bin , osi.bin , applesoft.bin , kb9.bin , cbmbasic2.bin , kbd.bin and microtan.bin in the “ tmp ” directory , which are identical to the original ROMs .
You are welcome to help clean up the source more , to make it more readable and to break features out into CONFIG _ * defines , so that the source base can be made more customizable .
Make sure to read on to the end of the article , as it explains more about the source and what you can do with it .
Microsoft BASIC 1
Ric Weiland , Bill Gates and Monte Davidoff at Microsoft wrote MOS 6502 BASIC in the summer of 1976 by converting the Intel 8080 version .
While the former could fit well into 8 KB , so that a computer manufacturer could add some machine - specific I/ O code and ship a single 8 KB ROM , code density was less on the 6502 , and they could not fit it significantly below 8 KB – it was around 7900 bytes – so that computers with BASIC in ROM would require more than a single 8 KB ROM chip .
Spilling over 8 KB anyway , they decided to also offer an improved version with extra features in a little under 9 KB :
This version had a 40 bit floating point library ( “ 9 digits ” ) instead of the 32 bit one ( “ 6 digits ” ) , and the two - character error codes were replaced with actual error messages :
6 digit BASIC 9 digit BASIC ?NF ERROR
OK ? NEXT WITHOUT FOR ERROR
OK
9 digit BASIC also added support for the GET statement to read single keystrokes from the keyboard .
On startup , Microsoft BASIC 6502 asks for the size of memory :
MEMORY SIZE ?
If the user just presses return , BASIC detects the size of memory itself .
If , on the other hand , the user enters “ A ” , it prints :
WRITTEN BY RICHARD W. WEILAND .
Versions since 1.1 print :
WRITTEN BY WEILAND & GATES
Then it asks :
TERMINAL WIDTH ?
Microsoft ’s codebase could also be assembled either for use in ROM or in RAM :
The RAM version additionally asks :
WANT SIN - COS -TAN - ATN ?
These four statements are located at the very end of the interpreter image ( actually , the init code is at the very end , but that gets overwritten anyway ) , so that up to 250 more bytes are available for the BASIC program if the start of BASIC RAM was set to the beginning of the SIN / COS / TAN / ATN code ( “ N ” ) , or to overwrite ATN only ( “ A ” ) – in this case , the user would gain about 100 bytes extra .
All these questions were very similar to the ones presented on an Intel 8080 BASIC system – after all , BASIC 6502 was a direct port .
The start message looks something like this :
MOS TECH 6502 BASIC V1.0 COPYRIGHT 1977 BY MICROSOFT CO .
n BYTES FREE OK
Microsoft ’s codebase was very generic and did n’t make any assumptions on the machine it was running on .
A single binary image could run on any 6502 system , if the start of RAM was set correctly , the calls to “ MONRDKEY ” , “ MONCOUT ” , “ LOAD ” and “ SAVE ” were filled with pointers to the machine - specific I/O code , and the “ ISCNTC ” function was filled with code to test for Ctrl+C .
Microsoft maintained this source tree internally and , at different points in time , handed their current version of the source to OEMs , which adapted and / or extended it for their machines .
While most OEM versions were heavily modified in its user interaction ( startup screen , line editing … ) , most of the code was very similar ; some functions were even never changed for any version of BASIC .
No OEM ever came back to Microsoft for updates , except for Apple and Commodore , which both synced once each , up to the bugfixed version 2 .
Commodore BASIC 1 ( 1.0 )
The BASIC that shipped with the first Commodore PET in 1977 is the oldest known version of Microsoft BASIC for 6502 .
It does not say “ Microsoft ” anywhere , and memory size detection and screen width were hardcoded , so on startup , it just prints *** COMMODORE BASIC *** , followed by the number of bytes available for BASIC .
Commodore added the “ OPEN ” , “ CLOSE ” , “ PRINT # ” , “ INPUT # ” and “ CMD ” statements for file I/O and added VERIFY to compare a program in memory to a file on a storage device .
They also added “ SYS ” to call into assembly code – Microsoft ’s code had only provided the “ USR ” function with a similar purpose .
It seems Commodore did n’t like the “ OK ” prompt , so they renamed it to “ READY . ” .
All machine - specifics were properly abstracted by calls into the KERNAL jump table , the upper 7 KB of the 16 KB ROM – except for one call out into the screen editor part of the PET ROM :
iny lda ( INDEX ) , y .ifdef CONFIG_CBM1 _PATCHES
jsr LE7F3 ; patch .else ldy # $ 00 asl a adc # $ 05 .endif adc INDEX sta INDEX bcc L33A7 inc INDEX+1
This code fixes the garbage collector by doing the missing ldy / asl / adc in the patch code .
Speaking of patches : Commodore BASIC 1 has been binary patched a lot :
There are six patch functions appended to the very end of the interpreter image that work around miscellaneous fixes .
This is what one of these calls into a patch function looks like :
.ifdef CONFIG_CBM1
_PATCHES
jmp PATCH1 .else clc jmp CONTROL_C_TYPED .endif
Here is the patch function – someone indeed forget to clear the carry flag :
PATCH1 : clc jmp CONTROL_C_TYPED
Some of these patches are in generic code , and some in Microsoft - specific code .
Later fixes in generic code are not necessarily identical to these patches .
So this indicates that Commodore wrote the fixes .
But it is unknown why these additions were done in the binary as opposed to the source : Commodore had the source and made lots of additions to it .
Maybe it was just more convenient to patch the binary for debugging at some point .
Ohio Scientific ( 1.0a )
Ohio Scientific sold a wide series of 6502 - based machines for several years , but they all shipped with the same version of 6 digit BASIC bought from Microsoft in 1977 .
6 digit vs. 9 digit was probably a compile time option , because the differences are pretty straightforward , as can be seen in this example :
; ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- ; ADD MANTISSAS OF FAC AND ARG INTO FAC ; ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
FADD4 : adc ARGEXTENSION sta FACEXTENSION .ifndef CONFIG_SMALL lda FAC+4 adc ARG+4 sta FAC+4 .endif lda FAC+3 adc ARG+3 sta FAC+3 lda FAC+2 adc ARG+2 sta FAC+2 lda FAC+1 adc ARG+1 sta FAC+1 jmp NORMALIZE_FAC5
Ohio Scientific only made minimal adaptions for their computers , and added no extensions .
It asks for memory size and terminal width , and then prints OSI 6502 BASIC VERSION 1.0 REV 3.2 " .
One quirk on the Ohio Scientific is the inclusion of the WANT SIN - COS - TAN - ATN string , although BASIC ran in ROM .
The code to print this string and adjust memory layout accordingly is not included .
OSI BASIC is 7906 bytes in size .
Without the extra string , they could have saved 21 bytes .
The string Garbage Collector was horribly broken in OSI BASIC , effectively destroying all string data – in Commodore BASIC 1 , it had been binary patched for fix the problem .
AppleSoft I ( 1.1 )
Apple shipped the first Apple II systems with Integer BASIC in ROM , Microsoft BASIC was only available as an option loaded from disk or tape .
AppleSoft BASIC , as it was named , had only minor adaptions and extensions .
On startup , it printed :
APPLE BASIC V1.1 COPYRIGHT 1977 BY MICROSOFT CO .
In order to make AppleSoft feel more like Integer BASIC , it showed a ‘ ]’ character instead of “ OK ” and said “ ERR ” instead of ERROR .
The memory size easter egg was modified in this version , it printed COPYRIGHT 1977 BY MICROSOFT CO instead of Weiland ’s and Gates ’ names .
Since the Apple II character output code ignored the uppermost bit , this text could be hidden in ROM by setting the MSBs of every character :
. ;287F C3 CF D0 D9 D2 C9 C7 C8 " COPYRIGH " .;2887 D4 A0 B1 B9 B7 B7 A0 C2 " T 1977 B " .;288 F D9 A0 CD C9 C3 D2 CF D3 " Y MICROS " .;2897 CF C6 D4 A0 C3 CF 0D 00 " OFT CO . "
This version introduced another easter egg present in all later versions : BASIC 1.1 was the first version to include the “ MICROSOFT ! ” easter egg text , as described in a previous article .
The encoded ( XOR 0x87 ) text was hidden in some floating point constants and never addressed .
AppleSoft I is the oldest known BASIC 1.1 .
Compared to 1.0 , version 1.1 included minor bugfixes in GET / INPUT / READ , TAB ( ) and LIST , as well as the fix in the Garbage Collector present in the Ohio Scientific machines and binary patched in Commodore BASIC 1 .
BASIC 1.0 also had a bug where lines in direct mode that started with a colon were ignored :
jsr CHRGET .ifdef CONFIG_11 tax .endif beq L2351
CHRGET is supposed to set the zero flag on the end of an instruction , which can be end of line ( 0 character ) or a colon .
The original code wanted to check for an empty line and got the first character , and went on reading another line of it was empty – but a colon as the first character had the same effect .
1.1 fixed this by setting the flags on the value again .
Version 1.1 also contained various tiny speed optimizations : BEQs and BNEs were changed so that a cycle could be saved on the more likely case .
Here is another optimization in LEFT $ / RIGHT $ / MID $ :
.ifndef CONFIG_11 sta JMPADRS+1 pla sta JMPADRS+2 .else tay pla sta Z52 .endif [...] .ifdef CONFIG_11 lda Z52 pha tya pha .endif ldy # $ 00 txa .ifndef CONFIG_11 inc JMPADRS+1 jmp ( JMPADRS+1 ) .else rts .endif
The original code is n’t only suboptimal , it ’s even dangerous , because it only increments the low byte of the address it wants to jump to and assumes it does n’t roll over to $ 00 .
For some reason , the random number seed was changed slightly :
.ifdef CONFIG_11 . byte $ 80 , $ 4F , $C7, $ 52,$58 .else . byte $ 80 , $ 4F , $C7,$52,$59 .endif
But this does n’t make a difference , due to a bug present in all 9 digit versions of BASIC :
The value is copied into the zero page together with the CHRGET routine :
.ifdef CONFIG_SMALL ldx #GENERIC_CHRGET_END-GENERIC_CHRGET
.else ldx #GENERIC_CHRGET_END-GENERIC_CHRGET-1 .endif L4098 : lda GENERIC_CHRGET -1 , x sta CHRGET - 1 , x dex bne L4098
On 9 digit BASIC , one extra byte had to be copied , but the start index was not changed , so the last digit was omitted .
This bug exists in every known version of Microsoft BASIC .
Another bug was introduced on the Apple II :
All previous versions of BASIC had the input buffer for instructions in direct mode in the zero page .
On the Apple II , it was at $ 0200 in RAM , which broke some code that made assumptions on the address :
NEWSTT : jsr ISCNTC ; check for Ctrl +
C lda TXTPTR ldy TXTPTR+1 ; high - byte of instruction pointer beq L2683 ; 0 -> direct mode sta OLDTEXT sty OLDTEXT+1
Subsequent versions of BASIC compared the high - address of the text pointer :
cpy #>INPUTBUFFER
KIM - 1 ( 1.1a )
The KIM - 1 is a computer kit based around the MOS 6502 , which was sold by the makers of the 6502 to show off the capabilities of this CPU .
A 6 digit and a 9 digit version of Microsoft BASIC was available on tape , but the 6 digit version seems to be very rare .
BASIC for the KIM - 1 is the most authentic version of Microsoft BASIC , because it has only been minimally modified , it contains all questions about memory size , screen width , and the trigonometric functions , as well as the memory width easter egg .
The encoded “ MICROSOFT ! ” string can be found at the same spot as on the Apple II .
Although this is based on BASIC 1.1 , just like AppleSoft I , there are a few fixes in array handling and the PRINT statement .
But they also introduced another bug :
In input handling , again concerning the location of the input buffer , there is the following code :
ldx #( INPUTBUFFER -1 ) bne L2AF8 ; always
This code has been in place since 1.0 and assumes that INPUTBUFFER is above $ 0100 .
On the CBM1 , which had the input buffer in the zero page , this had been hotfixed by Commodore by swapping the ldx and the ldy .
On the OSI , this code did n’t exist , as it is only included in versions that have the GET statement , i.e. 9 digit versions .
AppleSoft I was not affected either , because it had the input buffer at $ 0200 .
And versions after the KIM fixed this by replacing the BNE with a BEQ in case the input buffer is in the zero page .
It is obviously hard to maintain a single codebase with many compile time options that still does optimizations like these .
Since the first KIM - 1 systems shipped in late 1975 , their CPUs had the 6502 ROR bug , so KIM - 1 BASIC had to work around this : Every ROR instruction is replaced by a corresponding sequence using LSR instead .
AppleSoft II ( 2.0 )
AppleSoft II is the oldest version of Microsoft BASIC 2 .
It was available on tape or disk , and also in ROM in later Apple II models .
It is the first BASIC from an OEM that had extended BASIC which was re-sync’ed with Microsoft ’s codebase .
In other words : Apple licensed an improved and bugfixed version of BASIC , and merged their old changes into it .
BASIC 2 contains mostly bugfixes ( all input buffer location bugs have finally been eliminated ) , small optimizations ( reuse two adjacent zeros inside the floating point constant of 1/2 as the 16 bit constant of zero instead of laying it down separately ) , better error handling for DEF FN , and support for “ GO TO ” with a space in between as a synonym for GOTO .
Also , the memory test pattern has been changed from $ 92 / $ 24 to the more standard $ 55 / $ AA .
In AppleSoft II , Apple also eliminated the “ memory size ” and “ terminal width ” questions .
Commodore BASIC 2 ( 2.0a )
Just like Apple , Commodore went back to Microsoft for an updated version of BASIC , and integrated its changes into the new version .
The version they got was slightly newer than Apple ’s , but the major difference was that Microsoft added the “ WAIT 6502 ” easter egg .
For this , they changed the encoding of the string “ MICROSOFT ! ” that was hidden in every BASIC since 1.1 from XORed ASCII into PETSCII with the upper two bits randomly set – this way , the text would be just as obfuscated , but it the decoder would be shorter on PET systems .
So Commodore BASIC 2 is the only version of Microsoft BASIC that ever accesses this hidden text .
Every version since 2.0a had the PETSCII version of the “ MICROSOFT ! ” text in it – and so did every version of BASIC for 6809 .
Intellivision Keyboard Component BASIC ( 2.0 b )
The Mattel Intellivision is a game console released in 1980 that contained a very nonstandard 16 bit “ CP1610 ” CPU .
After a series of delays , the “ Keyboard Component ” , an extension with its own 6502 CPU and Microsoft BASIC , was released in 1982 , but canceled very soon .
They are very rare today .
The BASIC in the Keyboard Component is the most custom of all known versions .
It is based on a 6 digit version of BASIC 2 and younger than Commodore BASIC 2 : It contains two bugfixes :
One piece of code that pulled its caller ’s address from the stack and normalized it by adding one , had forgotten to respect the carry , so this could fail if the caller sits just on a page boundary .
The other fix changed the number of steps needed for normalizing a floating point number .
Intellivision BASIC replaced LOAD and SAVE by PLOD , PSAV , VLOD , VSAV and SLOD , PRT , GETC and VER were added , and PEEK , POKE and WAIT were removed .
But the customizations were even more extensive : Instead of keeping the interface to library code , a lot of code was replaced inline , and the whole init code was rewritten .
While most of the generic code , for example memory handling was unchanged across Commodore , Ohio , AppleSoft and KIM , making it easier to later integrate Microsoft ’s fixes , some of even this code was altered on the Keyboard Component .
What is interesting about the strings in Intellivision BASIC is that they use both upper - and lower case .
The start message is this :
INTELLIVISION BASIC Copyright Microsoft , Mattel 1980
But upper -/ lowercase support does n’t stop here :
The complete code has been extended to be case insensitive , but case preserving .
The CHRGET code , a super - optimized function living in the zeropage has been patched with a call to this function :
LF430 : cmp # 'a ' bcc LF43A cmp #'z '+1 bcs LF43A sbc # $ 1F LF43A : rts
This very unoptimized piece of code adds at least 17 cycles to every CHRGET , and will slow down execution measurably .
Microtan BASIC ( 2.0 c )
The version of BASIC that shipped on the Tangerine MICROTAN 65 is , like the Ohio and KIM versions , again a very authentic version with few changes .
The updated BASIC 2 contained a single bug fix , which is the floating point constant of - 32768 which had n’t been updated from 6 to 9 digits correctly and was missing a byte .
The startup message looks like this :
MICROTAN BASIC ( C ) 1980 MICROSOFT
Microtan BASIC contains the complete “ memory size ” and terminal width procedures and the “ Weiland / Gates ” easter egg .
Although the Microtan was introduced in 1980 , its version of BASIC was , like the KIM version , assembled with code that worked around the ROR bug in 6502 chips until mid-1976 .
The I/O library on the other hand made use of ROR , suggesting that this compile time option was set in error .
Bugs never fixed
As you can see , the first versions had many bugs that were quickly fixed , but fixed became less and less – simply because there were only very few bugs left .
But still there are some bugs that never got fixed .
The short copy of the random number seed for example , exists on all versions .
Similarly , the two extra constants used for generating random numbers ( CONRND1 , CONRND2 ) are 4 bytes in all versions , which is one byte short for 9 digit BASIC .
But this is another bug that does n’t really matter , since the numbers will still be random enough .
The buggy check on large line numbers has also never been fixed .
Typing 35072121 into any version of Microsoft BASIC will have the interpreter jump to a pseudo random memory address .
The buggy code resides in “ LINGET ” .
Something similar happens in the case of PRINT 5 + " A " + - 5 : The interpreter will build up the formula on the CPU stack , but miss the string / float type mismatch because of the “ +-“ , and messes up its stack when removing items .
This bug is in “ FRMEVL ” .
But the fact that Microsoft never fixed these bugs in their codebase does n’t mean none of the OEMs fixed them .
While the LINGET and FRMEVL seem to have been unnoticed everywhere , at least the CONRND1 / CONRND2 bug has been fixed by Commodore , at least as early as for the VIC - 20 in 1980 .
How to build your own BASIC
Now that you have the source that can build seven different OEM versions of Microsoft BASIC , and that you know about the differences between those , you might be interested in building your own version of BASIC 6502 for some 6502 - based machine or customizing BASIC to build a bugfixed or extended version for some platform .
First duplicate one of the cfg files , and add it to make .
sh. cbmbasic2 is a good start , as you can quite easily test the resulting images in the VICE emulator – CC65 can even provide symbol information for the VICE debugger .
Add a case in defines.s to define one of CBM1 , CBM2 , APPLE etc. , because you need one flavour of platform specific code , and include your own defines _ *.s.
For Commodore BASIC , you also need to define CONFIG_CBM_ALL .
If you are targeting a new type of computer , make sure to adjust the zero page locations in your defines_ *.s file ( ZP_STARTn ) so that they do n’t clash with your I/O library .
Also make sure that , in case you are compiling for RAM , the init code does not try to detect the memory size and overwrite itself .
The CONFIG_n defines specify what Microsoft - version the OEM version is based on .
If CONFIG_2B is defined , for example , CONFIG_2A , CONFIG_2 , CONFIG_11A , CONFIG_11 and CONFIG_10A will be defined as well , and all bugfixes up to version 2B will be enabled .
The following symbols can be defined in addition :
CONFIG_CBM1 _PATCHES
jump out into CBM1 ’s binary patches instead of doing the right thing inline
CONFIG_CBM_ALL add all Commodore - specific additions except file I/ O
CONFIG_DATAFLG ?
CONFIG_EASTER_EGG
include the CBM2 “ WAIT 6502 ” easter egg
CONFIG_FILE support Commodore PRINT# , INPUT # , GET# , CMD
CONFIG_IO_MSB all I/O has bit # 7 set
CONFIG_MONCOUT_DESTROYS_Y
Y needs to be preserved when calling MONCOUT
CONFIG_NO_CR terminal does n’t need explicit CRs on line ends
CONFIG_NO_LINE_EDITING
disable support for Microsoft - style “ @ ” , “ _ ” , BEL etc .
CONFIG_NO_POKE
do n’t support PEEK , POKE and WAIT
CONFIG_NO_READ_Y_IS_ZERO_HACK
do n’t do a very volatile trick that saves one byte
CONFIG_NULL support for the NULL statement ( send sync 0s for serial terminals )
CONFIG_PEEK_SAVE_LINNUM
preserve LINNUM on a PEEK
CONFIG_PRINTNULLS
whether PRINTNULLS does anything
CONFIG_PRINT_CR
print CR when line end reached
CONFIG_RAM optimizations for RAM version of BASIC , only use on 1.x
CONFIG_ROR_WORKAROUND
use workaround for buggy 6502s from 1975 / 1976 ; not safe for CONFIG_SMALL !
CONFIG_SAFE_NAMENOTFOUND
check both bytes of the caller ’s address in NAMENOTFOUND
CONFIG_SCRTCH_ORDER
where in the init code to call SCRTCH
CONFIG_SMALL use 6 digit FP instead of 9 digit , use 2 character error messages , do n’t have GET
Changing symbol definitions can alter an existing base configuration , but it is not guaranteed to assemble or work correctly .
I am very interested in your creations .
Please add a comment to this article if you have made something new out of this source base !
Using the Floating Point Library Standalone
The complete project has been split into many components , each in their own assembly source file .
The core floating point library is in float.s , extra trigonometric functions are in trig .s .
It should not be too hard to use this broken - out part ( in a 6 digit or 9 digit version ) standalone in your own creations .
The 9 digit version is a little over 2 KB in size , the 6 digit version is a little smaller .
Adding More Versions
If you want to add another version of BASIC into the source base , you can do it like this : Use “ da65 ” from the CC65 package to dissemble your version of BASIC and all existing .bin files ( with the correct base addresses ) , and run a “ diff ” command on the new disassembly and each of the disassemblies of the existing versions .
The diff that contained the fewest changes ( just look at the file size ) is probably a good candidate to base your new version on .
Or look at the release date or the family tree to find a version which is similar .
Now create a new version in the source base , as described earlier .
Make sure the new version assembles ; then compare the disassembly of your version with the disassembly of the original binary in a diff program , like the excellent Mac OS X FileMerge , to find the differences .
In most cases , you will only have to adjust a few defines ( CONFIG _ * and zero page locations ) in your defines _ *.s file to get matching output .
Otherwise , add ifdefs to the respective source files .
Run regress.sh to verify that you did n’t break the other versions .
Repeat the last step until the assembly process outputs the same file .
Send your changes to me . :-)
Note that the idea of all versions of BASIC in the current source code is that they are all direct forks from Microsoft ’s codebase .
I chose not to include versions like Commodore BASIC 4 , Commodore BASIC 2 for the VIC - 20 / C64 etc. , and I would n’t add very late AppleSoft versions , because these are only extended versions of earlier forks and contain no extra code from the original Microsoft source base .
Versions that would be very interesting to integrate would be AppleSoft II and Atari Microsoft BASIC , preferably the very first revisions of these .

Proposed HHS regulations seek to protect provider conscience -- at the expense of patient access to care .
Testimony submitted to the President 's Council on Bioethics examines the harmful ramifications these regulations could have .
Editor ’s Note :
The following is excerpted from written testimony submitted by Lois Uttley , director of the MergerWatch Project , to the President ’s Council on Bioethics , which is meeting Thursday and Friday of this week .
Lois ’s testimony concerns the harmful implications of proposed Dept. of Health and Human Services regulations regarding provider conscience , and puts forward alternative regulations that would protect patients ’ conscience and access to care .
Recently , a great deal of public attention and public policy
has been focused on protecting the religious and ethical beliefs of health
providers .
As your council discusses this issue , I urge you to consider another
imperative – protecting the rights of patients to receive accurate medical information
and needed treatment in a timely manner .
In a pluralistic society such as we
have in the United States ,
public policy must carefully balance the needs and rights of all affected parties .
Let ’s use an example to make this discussion very concrete :
A 19 - year - old rape victim – let ’s call her Sally
— is brought to a hospital emergency department by the police .
The physician
who treats her numerous injuries – Let ’s call him Dr. Brown — omits any
mention of the potential to prevent pregnancy from the rape by using emergency
contraception , because he does not approve of it for religious reasons .
Many
hours later , Sally leaves the hospital without being informed about emergency
contraception , or offered the medication .
A friend takes her back to the
college dorm where they live and Sally , exhausted , falls asleep for 24 hours .
Because emergency contraception is the most effective
when taken shortly after unprotected intercourse , Sally ’s opportunity to
prevent pregnancy has now been greatly diminished .
Sex . Abortion .
Parenthood .
Power .
The latest news , delivered straight to your inbox .

What has just happened ?
Is this proper medical care ?
What
are Sally ’s rights ?
What are Dr. Brown’s ?
And , how should they be properly
balanced ?
The patient ’s rights
Let ’s start with Sally .
After all , the patient is supposed to be the focus of what the health professions now refer to as " patient - centered care . "
According to the Institute of Medicine , " patient - centered care is defined as health care that establishes a partnership among practitioners , patients and their families ( when appropriate ) to ensure that decisions respect patients ’ wants , needs and preferences and solicit patients ’ input on the education and support they need to make decisions and participate in their own care . "
One of the central tenets of patients ’ rights and
" patient - centered care " is the right to informed consent .
For a patient to make
an informed decision about medical treatment , he or she must have knowledge of all
potential treatment options , and their risks and benefits .
In this case , the
rape victim has not been informed about an important potential treatment option
– use of emergency contraception to prevent pregnancy .
As it happens , Sally is
one of the millions of American women of reproductive age who are not aware of
EC .
So , Sally has had no opportunity
to consider this option or use her own moral , ethical or religious perspectives
to decide whether she wishes to risk the chance of bearing the child of a
rapist .
Further , she has had no chance to discuss with her physician the
potential medical complications of an unplanned pregnancy , in view of her existing
medical conditions , which include diabetes .
How could this violation of patients ’ rights be corrected ?
The
simplest method would be to require all hospital emergency department
personnel , including Dr. Brown , to always offer EC to rape victims who are of
reproductive age .
Physicians ’ rights
and responsibilities
But now , let ’s focus on Dr. Brown .
A fundamentalist Christian ,
he believes that emergency contraception is the same thing as abortion , even
though medical and scientific experts say that is untrue and the FDA has stated
unequivocally that emergency contraception prevents pregnancy and does not
cause an abortion .
Dr. Brown argues that requiring him to give emergency
contraception to Sally would violate his religious beliefs .
" I should n’t have
to give up my religious freedom in order to be a doctor , " he says .
Let ’s pause for a moment to consider whether personal
beliefs that are unsupported by or unrelated to medical science should be
considered valid reasons why a licensed medical professional should be
permitted to refuse to provide needed medical care , especially in an emergency
situation in a facility that serves the general public .
How far should we allow
Dr. Brown or one of his colleagues to go with such claims ?
If Dr. Brown also
believes that AIDS is a just punishment from God for perverted behavior , should
he be allowed to refuse to treat any
patients with AIDS ?
What if one of his colleagues believes that under Islamic
law , anyone who committed murder
should be sentenced to death ?
Should he be permitted to refuse to treat
suspected murderers who are brought to the emergency room for treatment of
wounds suffered in the attack ?
Where would we draw the line between acceptable
and unacceptable moral reasons for refusing to provide care ?
In the interests of moving our analysis along , however ,
let ’s set that issue aside and see if there is a compromise we could arrive at
that would permit Dr. Brown to refuse to give EC to Sally , while still ensuring
that she gets the medication in a timely manner .
What if we just require Dr. Brown to refer
Sally to another physician or a nurse in the emergency department who could inform
her about EC and provide her the medication if she wishes to use it ?
That , too , is unacceptable , Dr. Brown says , because it
requires him to cooperate in helping the patient receive treatment he finds
morally objectionable .
" I can not be implicated in any way in helping her commit
an immoral act , " he states .
One could argue that Dr. Brown ’s professional responsibilities
to his patient should obligate him to provide Sally with at least a referral in
such a situation .
But , under a proposed " Provider Conscience Regulation " issued
by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services ( HHS ) on August 26 , 2008 ,
no entity receiving federal funding ( such as the hospital where Dr. Brown works )
could require him to give Sally the medical information or referral she needs
if he claims a religious objection .
To attempt do so would be to " discriminate "
against him , and could result in the loss of federal funding , according to the
rule .
Not a single other physician or
nurse in the hospital could be required to step in and give Sally what she
needs , if that health professional held the same views as Dr. Brown .
Moreover , HHS has proposed a very expansive definition of the
term " assist in the performance of " to permit refusals for " participation in any activity with a reasonable connection to the
objectionable procedure , including referrals , training and other arrangements
for offending procedures . "
Arguably , this definition would permit a pharmacy
technician to refuse to stock emergency contraception in the hospital pharmacy ,
or a hospital purchasing agent to refuse to order it .
Again , we face the
question of where we should draw the line between acceptable and unacceptable
refusals .
The proposed HHS rule would seem to draw no line at all , instead
allowing medical professionals and hospital personnel to use personal moral or
religious beliefs to exempt themselves from any
medical obligations to their patients .
Let ’s consider another alternative – requiring the hospital
to be responsible for ensuring that Sally ’s rights as a patient are protected .
Hospital responsibilities
Arguably , the hospital should
already be responsible for ensuring that Sally ’s medical needs are met .
In
order to participate in the federal Medicare program , and to be reimbursed
under the Medicaid program , hospitals must adhere to " Conditions of
Participation . "
These conditions are meant to ensure that patients ’ rights are
respected and they received medically appropriate care .
For example , hospitals
are required to :
" Honor a patient ’s right to make informed
decisions regarding his or her medical care . "
decisions regarding his or her medical care . "
" Meet the emergency needs of patients in
accordance with acceptable standards of practice . "
accordance with acceptable standards of practice . "
" Have pharmaceutical services that meet the
needs of patients . "
But since the Medicaid / Medicare Conditions of Participation has
not yet been enforced to require the provision of EC to rape victims , a
number of states have enacted so - called EC in the ER or Compassionate
Care for Rape Victims laws .
These statutes specifically require
hospitals to offer emergency contraception to rape victims , or , at
minimum , inform rape victims about the potential to use the medication
to prevent pregnancy .
How should the hospital go about fulfilling these
responsibilities for patients like Sally ?
Should administrators fire Dr. Brown
and replace him with someone who will dispense EC to rape victims ?
No , that
would not be the preferable way of dealing with this situation , because there
are far less drastic options available .
Instead , the hospital could offer Dr. Brown a transfer out
of the ER into another unit of the hospital where he would not be expected to
dispense EC , and replace him in the ER with someone who has no objections to
EC .
Such an arrangement would be an example of a " reasonable accommodation "
under Title VII of the Civil Rights
Act of 1964 , which requires employers to
reasonably accommodate an employee ’s religious beliefs or practices , unless doing
so places an " undue hardship " on the employer ’s business .
This type of careful balancing
of competing rights is a hallmark of American public policy .
But , Dr. Brown might argue that he is being discriminated
against even by such a reasonable accommodation , because it removes him from
the practice of emergency medicine , which he sees as his mission in life .
The
proposed HHS rule might give him ammunition to do so , because it lacks any attempt to balance his rights with the patients ’
rights and the obligation of the hospital to serve its patients .
! pagebreak !
HHS Secretary Michael Leavitt , in a press conference to
release the department ’s proposed rule , went so far as to frame the issue this
way : " " Freedom of conscience is not to be surrendered upon issuance of a
medical degree . "
He told reporters , " This is about protecting the right of
a physician to practice medicine according to his or her moral compass . "
Is there another solution ?
How about requiring the hospital
to have a routine protocol of offering EC to all rape victims , and designating
someone on each shift who does not object to EC to step in , inform the patient
about EC and offer it ?
This surely would be somewhat cumbersome , and would
require careful management of hospital staffing schedules .
It also would
require that Dr. Brown and any other hospital emergency department personnel
who have objections to dispensing EC disclose those objections up front , so
that hospital administrators can make appropriate scheduling decisions .
Religious hospital
claims to " conscience " rights
But what if the hospital as an institution operates under a religious
doctrine that expresses grave reservations about the use of emergency
contraception ?
Let ’s put Dr. Brown and Sally in the emergency department of St .
Mary ’s Roman Catholic Hospital .
Like other Catholic hospitals , it is governed
by the Ethical and Religious Directives
for Catholic Health Care Services ( ERDs ) , which offer guidance about EC that has been interpreted in a variety of ways .
Some
Catholic hospitals provide EC to all rape victims .
Some administer a pregnancy
test , even though such a test would only be able to detect a pregnancy that was
established prior to the rape ( and if the woman is already pregnant , she does
not need EC ) .
Some require the rape victim to undergo an ovulation test .
If the
test comes back positive , EC is denied because of the hypothetical possibility
that there might be a fertilized egg in existence .
Still other Catholic
hospitals refuse to offer EC at all .
St. Mary ’s Hospital , as it
happens , is one of the Catholic hospitals that refuse to allow any dispensing
of EC .
Moreover , the hospital does not permit staff to even discuss EC with
patients like Sally , citing another two of the ERDs .
Under a new state law taking effect in six months , St .
Mary ’s and all other hospitals in this state ( including Catholic ones ) will be
required to offer EC to rape victims .
Dr. Gray , a colleague of Dr. Brown ’s in
the emergency department , is happy about the new law , because he believes it is
his professional and ethical obligation to serve the patient ’s medical needs ,
and he wants to be able to offer EC to patients like Sally .
He is upset about
what he views as the hospital ’s violation of his rights to use his own ethical
beliefs and his medical training in deciding how to treat patients .
( The
proposed HHS regulation , it should be noted , does not seem to protect
physicians like Dr. Gray , who wish to provide
medical treatment , not refuse it , but
are stymied by institutional religious restrictions . )
St. Mary ’s , which opposed the new law , hopes to argue that since
it considers emergency contraception to be an abortifacient , it cannot be
compelled to obey the law .
Administrators of St .
Mary ’s plan to cite the proposed HHS rule which , in seeking to enforce
compliance with a longstanding federal law allowing federally - funded hospitals
to refuse to perform abortions or sterilizations , seems to leave the definition
of abortion open to interpretation .
The regulation , as promulgated , dropped a definition of
abortion that had appeared in an earlier draft that had attempted to conflate
contraception with abortion by including anything
that could interfere with a fertilized egg .
But , as the Washington Post
reported , supporters and critics alike agreed that the language remains broad
enough to apply to contraceptives .
HHS
Secretary Leavitt , in response to reporters ’ questions about the proposed rule ,
acknowledged that there was no definition of abortion and that some medical
providers may want to " press the definition " and make the case that some forms
of contraception are tantamount to abortion , according to the Wall Street
Journal .
Does this mean that state health officials who try to
enforce the new state law at St. Mary ’s – in order to ensuring that all rape
victims are offered emergency contraception — might risk being found guilty of
" discrimination " against St. Mary’s ?
Could the state lose all of its federal
health funding as a result ?
Is that really the outcome we should be seeking in
federal policy ?
If St. Mary ’s were to be successful in its claim , what would
happen to rape victims who need emergency contraception ?
Should they be
expected to go to drugstores to buy it , even though they have just suffered a
traumatic attack , may have had their clothes torn and may have been robbed of
their purses , their money and their car keys ?
What if the local pharmacy also
objects to emergency contraception ?
The proposed HHS rule , which purports to be
about protecting health providers from having to perform abortions and
sterilizations , extends provider conscience protections to pharmacies ( and
also , it should be noted to a wide variety of other health care institutions ,
including nursing homes and dentists offices ) .
Should rape victims be expected to leave St. Mary ’s and go
to a different hospital , again in a traumatized state ?
What if St. Mary ’s is the only local hospital ?
Conclusions
To hear HHS Secretary Leavitt and his colleagues tell it , the
department ’s regulatory might and funding power must be marshaled behind medical
professionals in this country who , they contend , are at serious risk of
retaliation , firing or being forced to surrender their medical licenses for
exercising their religious consciences .
The department ’s introduction to its
proposed rule on provider conscience states , " There appears to be an attitude
toward the health professions that health care professionals and institutions should
be required to provide to assist in the provision of medicine or procedures to
which they object , or else risk being subjected to discrimination . "
The
Department ’s commentary , however , did not supply a single example of a health
professional who actually had been discriminated against .
Secretary Leavitt claimed at his press conference releasing
the proposed regulation that " there is nothing in this rule that would in
any way change a patient ’s right to
a legal procedure " and that " this regulation does not limit patient
access to health care . "
But , as the story of Sally , Dr. Brown and St. Mary ’s
Hospital has demonstrated , that would not be the case .
In fact , the proposed
HHS rule has the potential to seriously undermine the already fragile balance
between providers ’ rights and patients ’ rights in the American health care
system .
It would tip the scales far over in the direction of objecting health
providers , and leave patients at risk of going without needed medical
information and care .
It would allow
providers ’ personal moral beliefs to come before patients ’ rights and would take
American health care in the opposite direction from " patient - centered care . "
Recommendations
Clearly , the proposed HHS rule should be withdrawn .
It is
both unnecessary and overreaching in its broad interpretation of those existing
statutes .
But I also recommend that your council consider ways in
which public policy could more strongly protect patients ’ rights and access to
care , without unduly burdening individual health practitioners who have moral
objections to providing certain medical services .
What would be some ways of
doing this ?
When you think of stupidity , these days it ’s hard not to fall upon the conservative hotspot , FOX News .
When thinking of idiots who happen to work for FOX News , you would typically think of Bill O’Reilly or Sean Hannity , two massive tools who are somehow consistently able to out - douche themselves .
But not enough is said of Dick Morris , a “ pundit ” for FOX News .
Recently , concerning remarks made by the head of the Republican Party in Virginia ( read : irrelevant moron ) comparing Barack Obama to Osama bin Laden , Morris somehow managed to defend him .
Then again , he was going up against another idiot , “ liberal ” ( read : politically - moderate pussy that FOX News labels a liberal to seem balanced ) Alan Colmes :
COLMES : And then after tamping it down , today the RNC comes out with another ad comparing Obama to Ayers .
And you have the Republican chair in Virginia who sends out his troops , Jeff Frederick , giving instructions to 30 door - to - door canvassers saying , both have friends who bombed the Pentagon ?
MORRIS : What ’s the matter with comparing .
COLMES : Is this healthy ?
MORRIS : Yes , what ’s the matter — it is .
What ’s the matter with comparing Obama to the guy who introduced him in politics , gave him his first job , and has been a fixture in his campaign .
What ?
How is it rational to compare Obama to William Ayers ( much less Osama bin Laden ) ?
First off , what logic does Morris use to determine that Ayers “ introduced [ Obama ] in politics ” ?
Ayers was never a politician ; for God ’s sake , HE BOMBED POLITICIANS !!!
Also , I did n’t know that William Ayers ever lived in Hawaii , where Obama got his first job working at an ice cream shop .
Of course , they did serve strawberry , a known weapon of mass deliciousness .
And how has Ayers been “ a fixture in his campaign ” ?
The only involvement Ayers has had with the Obama presidential campaign is indirect ; to be specific , his involvement is limited to being a name tossed around by the geniuses in charge of McCain ’s campaign who somehow think the American people are retarded .
( Then again , we did elect Bush … )
If Dick Morris is really this stupid , then how does he find his way to the FOX News building every morning ?
I think he must sleep there , with Doocy , Hannity , and all those other idiots .
You might wonder what they would be doing together at FOX News at night .
I , for one , do n’t want to know , but I ’m sure it does n’t involve intellectual activity .

That notion is also acceptable to House Republicans , who voted 133- 65 against the first bill .
They also favour the addition of extended tax breaks for businesses and changes to the Alternative Minimum Tax .
But Republicans would come out even more strongly against any more help for struggling homeowners , believing they do n’t deserve to be rescued .
Big bird : Experts unveil skull of giant duck with teeth and the wingspan of a family car
They are ducks - but not as we know them .
Instead of the fluffy little creatures seen today , these big birds boasted ' teeth ' , a 16ft wingspan and once flew over Britain .
Today , scientists announced the discovery of fossil skulls of these birds buried in clay on the Isle of Sheppey in Kent .
Darsornis : A computer - generated image of the giant duck with a 16ft wingspan that roamed over Britain 50 million years ago
It is not the first time fossils of these duck have been found , but the experts believe this find is among the best - preserved .
The enormous birds , known as Dasornis , soared over the wetlands of prehistoric southern England when the land which now covers London , Essex and Kent was underwater .
Related to present - day ducks and geese , 50 million years ago these giants once skimmed the waters , snapping up fish and squid with their bony - toothed beak .
Their massive wingspan - the length of a family car - also meant they could cover huge distances .
Dasornis was in many ways similar to the modern albatross .
Big head :
The Darsornis fossil skull discovered by palaeontologists on the Isle of Sheppey
Dr Gerald Mayr , from the Senckenberg Research Institute in Frankfurt , Germany , who described the find today in the journal Palaeontology , said : ' Imagine a bird like an ocean - going goose , almost the size of a small plane .
' By today 's standards these were pretty bizarre animals , but perhaps the strangest thing about them is that they had sharp , tooth - like projections along the cutting edges of the beak .
' Like all living birds , Dasornis had a beak made of keratin , the same substance as our hair and fingernails , but it also had these bony " pseudo - teeth " .
' No living birds have true teeth because their distant ancestors did away with them more than 100 million years ago , probably to save weight and make flying easier .
' But the bony - toothed birds , like Dasornis , are unique among birds in that they reinvented tooth - like structures by evolving these bony spikes . '
The fossil is in a collection at the Karlsruhe Natural History Museum , Germany .

You know I believe all three of newtons laws apply to this one .
And they all make perfect sence but I do also see where the op is coming from .
I think if you simply study how it all works a little you would see how simple the idea of the rocket propultion in space is .
Everyone learns differently you just need to find the explination that fits for you .
If you do google it however you will find a vast amount of information on how this works , just have to do one thing which will probably be the hardest thing for you .
Open your mind a little and try to see the other side .

1. The " Freedom Ship "
- a futuristic dream that just might come true
I remember seeing similar illustrations in some vintage popular science magazine , depicting a floating city concept in a truly mind - boggling way .
Little did I think that I might live to see similar projects given serious consideration , and some virtually on the brink of being built .
According to the official site the projected " Freedom Ship " may look something like this :
( images credit : Freedom Ship )
Imagine a mile - long stretch of 25 - story - tall buildings stacked close to each other ; now imagine that floating on the water .
" The Freedom Ship has little in common with a conventional ship ; it is actually nothing more than a big barge ...
But what if this tremendous barge was assigned a voyage that required slowly cruising around the world , hugging the shoreline , and completing one revolution every 3 years ? "
There is even talk about making this city an independent country .
Incidentally , the " Freedom Ship " could also end up to be the largest man-made structure on Earth , which puts it in the same category as the Tower of Babel .
It would be extremely vulnerable to some spectacular downfall , even if it were by some miracle actually built ( the last update on their site is from February 2005 , when everything still revolved around financing )
For now we can just dream on , wistfully looking at the pictures :
Notice the similarity of the above concept with the 1928 model of an airport on top of a giant building !
Los Angeles architects expected private planes to replace automobiles in a near future ; hence this 300 m - long roof - top airstrip :
( image via )
Also , check out these futuristic " Airport Docks for New York " dreamed up by architect Harry B. Brainerd :
( image credit : Modern Mechanix )
Misperception : " Freedom Ship " aircraft flight deck can accept 747 aircraft .
Facts :
The largest aircraft this flight deck can accept are turboprop aircraft in the 38 to 40 - passenger range .
( Oh well , there goes the " wow " factor ... )
More on this titanic undertaking here and
here , where you can also trace the evolution of its design .
2. More Cruise Ship Concepts :
some of them will dwarf any other ship in existence
- Kvaerner Masa - Yards ' Super - Large Cruise Ship ( on the left ) and The Nova , a Panamax - Max ship displacing more than 100,000 GT ( on the right ) :
Read more about the trend of increasing cruise ship sizes here
- This article speaks about " Project Genesis " - Royal Caribbean 's largest - ever cruise ship with capacity of 5,400 passengers :
To give you an idea of modern cruise ships ' scale , here 's a comparison with the Statue of Liberty :
The new liner ( due sometime in 2009 ) , code - named " Project Genesis " , will dwarf the " Freedom of the Seas " , measuring 220,000 tons ( about 100,000 tons based on displacement — a Nimitz - class aircraft carrier comes in at about 97,000 tons )
3. The Biggest Ships Ever Constructed - Supertankers Extraordinaire !
The biggest ships ever constructed were four supertankers built in France at the end of the seventies , having a 555.000 DWT and a 414 meters length .
They launched from the shipyard Chantiers de l'Atlantique at Saint Nazaire .
The only larger ship was the super sized " Knock Nevis " ; ex " Jahre Viking " , ex " Seawise Giant " , ex " Porthos " , in 1981 ( see entry in Part 2 ) .
However , the Batillus class had the greater gross tonnage per ship , and it could be argued that they were , in fact , larger than the Knock Nevis .
* Batillus , built in 1976 , scrapped in 1985 .
* Bellamya , built in 1976 , scrapped in 1986 .
* Pierre Guillaumat , built in 1977 , scrapped in 1983 .
* Prairial , built in 1979 ,
( also as " Hellas Fos " and " Sea Giant " ) scrapped in 2003
So here is " Pierre Guillaumat " - the Biggest Ship Ever Constructed :
( Source : Photo collections Didier Pinçon and Ed Keefe )
By the way , this is why it 's not a good idea to build bigger ships , if you want them to be able to cross canals : ( " Scraaaape ! " )

Jean Charles de Menezes 's mother , Maria , heard the testimony of C12
For three years she had waited for this moment - to hear from the man who pulled the trigger .
And on Friday , at the Oval cricket ground , within walking distance of Stockwell Tube station , Maria Otone de Menezes heard how her son died on 22 July 2005 .
In the witness box at the inquest into his death , which is being held at the ground , was one of the Metropolitan Police 's top firearms officers , codenamed C12 .
He and his colleague C2 shot dead Jean Charles de Menezes because they thought he was a suicide bomber about to detonate a bomb on a Tube carriage at Stockwell station .
On Friday he spoke for the first time about why he did what he did - and how he would live with the consequences for the rest of his life .
On the morning of Friday 22 July 2005 , Londoners were facing an unprecedented situation , with four suicide bombers on the run .
My sincere regrets .
I cannot begin to put myself in the position that they are faced with .
I am a family man myself
Met Police firearms officer C12 Electrician Jean Charles de Menezes 's day started like any other - other than he was now unwittingly living in a block of flats linked to one of the bombers .
C12's day began with a briefing where it was made clear to the officers of the SO19 firearms squad they could be called upon to stop the most dangerous and determined men in the country .
They had trained to shoot a suicide bomber on sight , without warning .
But when Jean Charles de Menezes left home , and was identified as the possible suspect , they were not on the scene to challenge him as per orders .
Police say that Osman and Mr de Menezes resembled one another Mr de Menezes had boarded a bus going to Stockwell station and surveillance officers indicated he had been acting nervously as he had prepared to leave it before entering the Tube station .
C12 said he could not understand why the firearms teams had not been given the order to take charge at this point .
" I remember there being a radio silence , " he told the hushed inquest .
" I was very frustrated by this .
I could not understand why we were not going State Red . " [ I had ] a growing sense of unease that an identified suicide bomber , or potential one , had entered the Tube station . "
Then the order came on a radio channel : " All units , State Red , State Red . "
If I did not act , members of the public would be killed , colleagues would be killed .
I would be killed .
I had a duty to protect the public
C12
It was the order for the armed teams to use all means necessary to stop the man .
C12's car was close to the station .
He jumped out trying to conceal his Glock hand gun and radio beneath a baggy shirt .
He sprinted through the station , jumped the barrier , pushed aside a station attendant who tried to stop him and ran down the escalator .
" I did n't know where he was , " said C12 .
" He could have already been on the Tube , on the platform , or on the escalator . "
As he headed towards the bottom of the escalator , an undercover officer spotted him and indicated the northbound platform .
C12 feared he was too late , that the man was on his way into central London - but then realised the train was still on the platform with all of its doors open .
" Can I just pause for a moment ? " the officer quietly asked the coroner .
" I know where this is leading to .
I 'm going to try to be as delicate as I can for the benefit of the family .
" But some things need to be said and I know , quite frankly , this is an awful time for them .
I 'm going to try to be as sensitive as I can . "
This police photograph of Hussain Osman was not shown to marksmen
There was another pause .
" My sincere regrets .
I cannot begin to put myself in the position that they are faced with .
I am a family man myself .
" To lose a son or any member of your family in this situation , I can't begin to imagine and I offer my sincere condolences , I really , really respectfully do that . "
C12 told how his years of training and preparations for extreme life - and - death situations had taken over .
He had not run .
He had moved with a " controlled and purposeful " walk , holding his gun tight against his right leg to hide it from passengers .
His aim had been to get as close as possible to the suspect without revealing himself .
" Did you have any idea what you would have to do at this stage , " asked Nick Hilliard QC , for the inquest .
I 'm responsible for the death of an innocent man .
Something I have to live with all my life
C12 " Primarily to intercept him , to stop him , perhaps to detain him .
I did not have any preconceived ideas . "
Then another surveillance officer , codenamed Ivor , pointed to Mr de Menezes , saying : " That 's him . "
Those two words reinforced C12's understanding of the situation he was now confronting .
" It would have been dangerous for us to pause to make [ my own ] positive identification , " he said .
" It would potentially alert the suspect .
I must reiterate the speed in which it all happened . "
C12 sighed and took a deep breath , but his voice remained clear .
" He [ Mr de Menezes ] looked and stood up .
I have a snapshot of him .
He was wearing a blue denim jacket that appeared to be bulky .
He came towards us , in my opinion he closed us down . "
Point blank range C12 had brought his handgun up to head level and pointed it at Mr de Menezes .
The electrician had approached closer , he said .
C12 said he had called out : " Armed police ! " " I could not understand [ his ] reaction .
To be pointed at suddenly and then come towards the potential threat [ the gun ] , I could not understand it .
" I formed the opinion that he is going to detonate , he is going to kill us , and I have to act now to stop this from happening .
I had to use force as soon as possible .
This was an identified suicide bomber to me . "
Officers relied on " poor quality " CCTV images of Osman on a bus
The surveillance officer had lunged at Mr de Menezes and pinned him back in the seat .
C12 said there had been something of a scrum , he had brought his weapon over Ivor 's body and shot three times into Mr de Menezes 's head at point blank range .
" If there could have been any other alternative , you must believe me , that I would have taken it .
If I did not act , members of the public would be killed , colleagues would be killed .
I would be killed .
I had a duty to protect the public . "
As C12 began to explain the aftermath , the attempts to get passengers off the train amid fears of a bomb and the chaos of the scene , he went silent from behind the screen hiding his identity .
He asked for water and broke down .
The coroner adjourned the inquest for a few minutes to allow the officer to compose himself .
Returning to the witness box , C12 told how he had written up his account - but was consumed with the reality of what had happened .
" A sense of disbelief , shock , sadness and confusion , " he said .
" Everything I had trained for proved wrong .
" I 'm responsible for the death of an innocent man .
Something I have to live with all my life . "

Corporate Media Coverage of Now - Deceased U.S. Army Bio-Researcher / Suspect Fails to Note Obvious ' Liberal ' Targets of Deadly Post - 9/11 , Pre-War Letter Campaign
ALSO : ABC News Continues to Protect ' Sources ' Who Lied About Iraq Connection to Anthrax ...
Brad Friedman Byon
8/1/2008 , 3:25 pm PT
-- Brad Friedman
With the mainstream corporate media reports today on the apparent suicide of Bruce E. Ivins of the U.S. Government 's bio weapons lab at Ft. Detrick , MD , who was reportedly about to be charged with the Anthrax murders of late 2001 , it 's curious --- if hardly surprising --- that none of the major outlets reporting the news bothered to note that the attacks were all made on perceived " liberals . "
Letters , seeming to appear as if they were from Muslim extremists , declaring " Death to America ... Death to Israel ... Allah is Great , " were sent to then - Democratic Majority Leader Sen .
Tom Daschle , powerful Democratic Sen. Patrick Leahy and then NBC News anchor Tom Brokaw .
Given the recent coverage ( or extraordinary lack thereof ) of the church shootings earlier this week in Knoxville , TN , carried out by a gunman who was said to have blamed " liberal Democrats " for all of this country 's woes ... and the coinciding news that the Bush Administration 's DoJ illegally screened out applicants for career posts based on perceived beliefs that they might support " liberal Democratic " causes ( a convergance that we noted , if few others did ) ... it's all the more curious --- if still not surprising in the least --- that the supposed " Liberal Media " have n't bothered to highlight who the actual targets of the anthrax attacks were , or the reasons why they appear to have been targeted .
Even the parade of reporters contacting the Ivins family today failed to bring up the topic .
We spoke with Ivins eldest brother Thomas today , to ask if he had any idea of Bruce 's political leanings , and he told us " No , I did n't .
I did n't know what his affiliations where .
And that 's a good question . "
He was surprised by the question , and although he said he'd been speaking with reporters all day , " one after another , " he told The BRAD BLOG none of the other reporters , not one of them , had asked him about his brother 's political affiliations , leanings , or beliefs .
Apparently , it remains open hunting season on perceived " liberals . "
Today 's remarkable MSM coverage of Ivins ' death continues to underscore that point ...
The Los Angeles Times ' David Willman , who first broke the story on Ivins ' death today , noted that the anthrax attacks " shut down a Senate office building " and included " letters addressed to two senators . "
The senators are n't named .
AP 's latest report , says only : " The letters contained [ sic ] anthrax powder were sent on the heels of the terror attacks of Sept. 11 , 2001 , and turned up at congressional offices , newsrooms and elsewhere , leaving a deadly trail through post offices on way . "
Later in the article , AP misleads readers by noting , " The victims of the attacks had little in common . "
That may be true , if one separates the victims who died from the targets to whom the attacks were clearly sent .
AP 's video report noted that the anthrax killer " sent letters to a number of people . "
Later , the report adds : " Some of the letters were sent to members of Congress , and to the media . "
Anybody in particular in either the Congress or the media ?
The AP , as in its written coverage , does n't bother to say .
USA Today , in an article they describe as being culled " from staff and wire reports , " tells us only that " letters ... were mailed to lawmakers '
Capitol Hill offices , TV networks in New York , and tabloid newspaper offices in Florida . "
The New York Times reported : " Letters containing anthrax powder were also sent to lawmakers ’ offices on Capitol Hill , causing great alarm in the capital when it was still jittery from the 9/11 terrorist attacks . "
While no clue is offered as to who those " lawmakers " were in their description above , buried on the second page of the article , in the final grafs of the story ( which I do n't recall being there this morning when I was first canvassing coverage of the story ) there is some cursory coverage of the specific targets and victims of the attacks .
In the third to final graf there 's this : " The 2001 anthrax mailings were baffling in several ways , not least because the victims — whether they were chosen or were struck at random — seemed to have nothing in common . "
The graf goes on to detail those who died --- " an editor at a tabloid newspaper based in Florida " and the others .
Clearly , those victims had inadvertently come in contact with the anthrax via post offices through which the letters were routed .
So , despite the NYTimes ' language there , what 's actually " baffling " is not the random folks who were killed along the way , but rather , that the Times ( like AP ) would even focus on the random victims as a reason for " bafflement . "
The targets of the attack were quite clear , and not " baffling " in the least .
They were all perceived by the rightwing as powerful " liberals . "
Finally , in the penultimate graf --- and one that I suspect was added later , after the first story was posted --- the NYTimes identifies the " targets of the mailings " to have included " Tom Brokaw of NBC and two Democratic senators : Tom Daschle of South Dakota , then his party ’s Senate leader , and Patrick J. Leahy , a leading member of the Senate Judiciary Committee but arguably not an instantly recognizable figure outside Washington and his home state . "
If Leahy was " not an instantly recognizable figure outside Washington and his home state , " he was certainly recognizable to rightwing political junkies , who feared his recent takeover as chair of the Judiciary Committee might serve to be a roadblock to the Republican legislative agenda .
Leahy had taken over the Senate Judiciary Committee after Sen. Jim Jeffords left the Republican party , handing a thin majority --- and the Senate committee chairs with it --- to the Democrats .
On his radio program this morning , Thom Hartmann noted that Daschle and Leahy held the most important roles in Congress , as Majority Leader and Chair of Judiciary , respectively , in the possible blockage of the PATRIOT Act , which both men had originally indicated they might oppose .
The long - time attacks on NBC News and other media outlets perceived to have a " Liberal " bias are well known .
It should be noted that Anthrax letters were also sent to the Editor of the New York Post ( a Rupert Murdoch - owned paper ) and the National Enquirer offices , whose political bent , if they have one , seems difficult to discern .
So why the lack of focus --- and in many cases , any mention at all --- of who the Anthrax Killer 's actual targets were ?
If the attacks had been against , say , Tom Delay , Karl Rove and Bill O'Reilly , would the media have noted , in summarizing them upon Ivins ' death , that the attacks were sent to " prominent conservatives " ?
Of course they would have .
Attacking perceived " liberals " in the United States , illegally barring them from government jobs , shooting them in churches and sending them anthrax in the mail is , apparently , just fine in these United States of America these days .
At least that 's what the supposed " Liberal Media " coverage of these recent events would seem to suggest .
By way of related addendum ...
Glen Greenwald 's coverage at Salon today is an absolute must read .
He notes the unbelievably irresponsible reporting of ABC News prior to the Iraq War , in which they breathlessly reported from " four well - placed and separate sources , " that the anthrax used in the letter attacks was linked with Iraq and Saddam Hussein .
While ABC's and Brian Ross ' reports have since been discredited again and again --- and certainly today 's news would seem to put yet another nail in that already rotting coffin --- their report was used , big time , to help rally the country towards supporting a war against Iraq prior to Congress handing authorization to George W. Bush to do so .
In fact , ABC 's false reports seem to have been the only actual tie between Iraq and the anthrax attacks that played such an effective role when Bush referred to " the Iraqi regime [ having ] plotted to develop anthrax , " in his 2003 State of the Union Address , and the collective chill that ran down American spines when Colin Powell held up his infamous fake vial of anthrax in his presentation to the U.N. declaring little doubt that Saddam was developing weapons of mass destruction .
As Greenwald notes today [ emphasis in original ] :
every bit as false as the linkage between Saddam and the 9/11 attacks --- persisted .
...
Surely the question of who generated those false Iraq - anthrax reports is one of the most significant and explosive stories of the last decade .
...
ABC News already knows the answers to these questions .
They know who concocted the false bentonite story [ which served to falsely connect Saddam to the anthrax attacks ] and who passed it on to them with the specific intent of having them broadcast those false claims to the world , in order to link Saddam to the anthrax attacks and --- as importantly --- to conceal the real culprit(s ) ( apparently within the U.S. government ) who were behind the attacks .
And yet , unbelievably , they are keeping the story to themselves , refusing to disclose who did all of this .
They 're allegedly a news organization , in possession of one of the most significant news stories of the last decade , and they are concealing it from the public , even years later .
ABC
News never retracted its story ( they merely noted , as they had done from the start , that the White House denied the reports ) .
And thus , the linkage between Saddam and the anthrax attacks ------ persisted .... Surely the question of who generated those false Iraq - anthrax reports is one of the most significant and explosive stories of the last decade ....[ which served to falsely connect Saddam to the anthrax attacks ] and who passed it on to them with the specific intent of having them broadcast those false claims to the world , in order to link Saddam to the anthrax attacks and --- as importantly --- to conceal the real culprit(s ) ( apparently within the U.S. government ) who were behind the attacks .
And yet , unbelievably , they are keeping the story to themselves , refusing to disclose who did all of this .
They 're allegedly a news organization , in possession of one of the most significant news stories of the last decade , and they are concealing it from the public , even years later .
They 're not protecting " sources . "
The people who fed them the bentonite story are n't " sources . "
They 're fabricators and liars who purposely used ABC News to disseminate to the American public an extremely consequential and damaging falsehood .
But by protecting the wrongdoers , ABC News has made itself complicit in this fraud perpetrated on the public , rather than a news organization uncovering such frauds .
So here we are today , almost seven years after ABC's October 2001 report .
Here we are , still waiting for either a retraction , or more importantly , the disclosure of who " concocted and fed , " as Greenwald puts it , the false reports to ABC way back then , playing what was perhaps the most crucial element in helping to lead the country into war .
Here we are in August of 2008 and ABC is protecting the liars even today .
And with a major break in the anthrax story , even now the mainstream corporate media fail to note the connection to the targeting of perceived " liberals . "
Thomas Ivins , the brother of the government 's now - deceased and apparent top suspect in the anthrax attacks , said that after speaking the entire day to one reporter after another --- who , he noted , had told him " a great deal " about the story which he had n't known --- had no idea that the targets of the attacks were two high - ranking Democratic members of Congress .
" Really ?
I did n't know that , " he told me when I bothered to inform him .
That part of the story , apparently , just is n't news for the mainstream corporate media .
So , the open season on " liberals " continues , even as our years - long hunt for the great mythical " Liberal Media " continues as well .

Radisson Hotels in Britain have put up a billboard in London with with a picture of Big Ben under the headline , “ Heavenly Peace in the City That Never Sleeps . ”
But today 's NY Times basically tells the British capital to step off , noting that their trains do not run all night , most of their pubs close around midnight and even their Apple Store is n't open twenty - four hours .
While they make a strong case that London has no business taking one of our city 's most beloved nicknames , elsewhere in the paper they question whether London will soon take away our crown as the financial capital of the world .
Iranian parliament Speaker Ali Larijani said Wednesday that Iran would prefer Democrat Barack Obama in the White House next year .
Larijani also dismissed any idea that the US would attack Iran .

Last year 14 squirrels were seized on espionage claims .
Fate of captive birds unknown Iran exposes pigeon - brained espionage plot , literally
How to deal with Iran and the crisis over its nuclear drive has been one of the foreign policy issues in the Nov. 4 race for the White House between Obama and Republican John McCain .
Larijani , a leading figure in the conservative camp in Iran , also said the United States was too busy dealing with the global financial crisis to consider waging an attack on Iran .
" The risk was low before , " he said .
" But now I am 100 % certain that the United States will not unleash a war against Iran .
The economic crisis has cost the United States $ 1.4 trillion and Washington is working to resolve its internal problems and not a war . "
Washington severed ties with Iran in 1980 in the wake of the Islamic revolution .
US President George W. Bush famously denounced the country as part of an " axis of evil " .
Tensions have mounted over Iran 's nuclear program , which many Western countries believe is a cover for ambitions to build atomic weapons , although this is vehemently denied by Tehran .
How did the Republicans let it get this far ?
And just as importantly , how can America trust the stewardship of our country to an economic neophyte like John McCain ?
America ca n’t afford the inexperience that John McCain brings to the table on economic issues .
McCain ’s only financial claim to fame is sinking 1,000 banks .
Well that ’s not entirely true .
He also is now saying that he was responsible for deregulating the banking industry and leading us to the current disaster .
Ahmadinejad came to power in 2005 with a pledge to fight corruption Iranian president Mahmoud Ahmadinejad is often seen in the West making fiery pronouncements about his country 's nuclear programme and lambasting world powers for their " arrogance " and " imperialism " .
But much like his US arch nemesis George W Bush , Mr Ahmadinejad has faced growing criticism at home over his economic record .
Newspapers are dominated by stories of soaring prices and high unemployment , with some pointing the finger of blame at the president 's populist policies .
With less than a year to go before the next presidential election , discontent over the economy could harm Mr Ahmadinejad 's chances of securing another term in office .
Economic policy Mr Ahmadinejad came to power in 2005 with a pledge to fight corruption and defend the interests of Iran 's poor .
IRAN FACTS Population : 71.5 million ( 2007 estimate , Central Bank of Iran ) Urban population : 49.6 million ( 2007 , CBI ) Economically active population : 23.5 million ( 2006 estimate , CBI ) GDP : 294.1 billion dollars , ( 2007 US estimate ) Unemployment : 9.6 % , rising to 20.3 % among people under 24 ( spring 2008 , CBI ) Inflation : 29.4 % ( August - September 2008 , CBI ) Oil production : 4.4 m barrels per day ( 2006 , IMF )
Country profile : Iran Soaring oil revenues have helped in this regard , with government measures such as cheap loans for small businesses , as well as generous subsidies on petrol and food .
Despite widespread public debate over economic policy , there is no single official document setting out the government 's economic objectives .
It is now considering a so - called " Economic Transformation Plan " , which will be put before Iran 's parliament , the Majlis .
The hope is that it will reduce government subsidies ( especially on energy ) , give more freedom to the private sector and reduce the country 's reliance on oil revenue .
There has been consistent criticism of government economic policy from Iran 's pro-reform political parties .
In September , Mosharekat , the party of former President Mohammad Khatami , said that " despite mythical levels of oil revenue , Iran 's economic status has been in decline " .
A survey in Tehran showed big fears over the high prices
It added that " the class gap has increased , the lower and middle classes , particularly labourers and public sector workers , have been hurt and the development of infrastructure has suffered " .
Another opposition party , the Organisation of the Mojahedin of the Islamic Revolution of Iran ( OMIRI ) , has accused the government of " unwise and destructive " policies , and also blamed Mr Ahmadinejad 's " aggressive " foreign policy for bringing international sanctions upon the country .
Meanwhile , the man who holds ultimate power in Iran , Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei , has given only guarded support to Mr Ahmadinejad 's policies .
In August , he told the president to be " cautious " and avoid any " hasty behaviour " regarding the economy .
Public opinion
But how do ordinary Iranians feel ?
Due to restrictions imposed on the media , little is known about the level of discontent in the private sector or among trade unions .
But other indicators , such as opinion polls and readers ' letters to newspapers , suggest that the economy is priority number one .
MAJLIS PUBLIC STUDY , JUNE Most serious problems : Inflation and high prices : 90 % Housing : 83 % Unemployment : 78 % Insufficient income : 72 % Survey : 1,223 people questioned in 30 districts of Tehran A study carried out for the Iranian parliament in June asked people in Tehran what they considered to be the " most serious social problems " in the country .
Some 90 % felt that inflation and high prices were a big problem .
Housing and unemployment were also major concerns .
Mr Ahmadinejad has frequently railed against Western " pressure " and the sanctions imposed on Tehran over its nuclear programme .
The same survey asked people whether they thought these were to blame for Iran 's economic difficulties .
A total of 32 % said yes , while 29 % disagreed .

Bad experiences are supposed to be good , in a twisted sort of way .
That 's because we 're supposed to learn things that help us avoid the same mistakes the next time around .
But it 's hard to argue now that anything good came out of the bad experience called Enron .
In fact , one thing that is crystal clear amid all the chaos of these days is that the lessons from Enron went unlearned - or were just forgotten .
Start with the Houston - based energy trader 's notorious lack of transparency .
After Enron 's implosion , everyone talked about how important it was to be able to understand how a company makes money .
Now raise your hand if you understand how a modern financial services firm makes money .
No hands ?
The truth is , there is no way to understand .
These companies are as opaque as Enron .
Just as Enron had off balance - sheet vehicles - SIVs - that allowed it to book earnings and hide debt , Citigroup and other financial institutions had structured investment vehicles that did the same .
Indeed , Citigroup had to take almost $ 50bn of SIVs back on to its balance sheet after they ran into trouble .
It would be nice if the accounting rule - makers would grasp this basic tenet : if they want to hide it , we want to know about it .
Of course , SIVs are only a small manifestation of the deeper problem , which is the evolution of financial engineering into a dark art .
Enron now seems like the canary in the coal mine .
After its bankruptcy , Steve Cooper , who was in charge of restructuring it , told the Wall Street Journal his task might leave him " in a wheelchair and drooling " due to the complexity of its financial structures and the " unbelievable amount of debt accumulated around the company " .
Does n't that sound like our entire financial system ?
Just as Enron packaged bad investments into a private equity fund run by its chief financial officer , Wall Street packaged mortgages given to people who could n't afford the payments into sleek new instruments called RMBS and CDOs .
But Enron 's machinations could n't make the losses go away , and Wall Street 's shiny acronyms can't turn a defaulted mortgage into good money .
As for the lessons we 've forgotten , how about this one : financial statements are n't supposed to be fairytales .
Enron was castigated for its abuse of mark - to - market , or fair value , accounting .
This is supposed to allow investors to see what the market says a security is worth , instead of just what the company paid for it .
Employed correctly , it makes a company 's finances more transparent .
But we all joked that Enron did n't mark to market - it marked to myth , to whatever it wanted them to be .
In this , the US regulatory agency , the SEC , was complicit , because it signed off on Enron 's use of this accounting and never ensured it was n't abusing the rules .
Today 's mark - to - market saga has a new twist .
The SEC is facing political pressure to abolish mark - to - market accounting requirements for financial institutions , and some in Congress would like to dig mark - to - market 's grave .
Said in another way , now financial services firms may be allowed to deceive investors about their status , with the regulators blessing that deceit .
( An aside here .
Those who say mark - to - market should be abolished argue that because there is no market , firms are being forced to value these securities at artificially low levels .
But there is no market precisely because firms are n't willing to sell at a price at which a reasonable investor would buy . )
While for a short period in the aftermath of Enron , we did understand that short - sellers serve a good purpose , we have also forgotten that .
Short - sellers were the first to warn there were problems at Enron .
But today , nobody is thanking short - sellers like David Einhorn , a hedge fund manager who began to warn investors about Lehman 's problems in March , when the stock was worth about $ 50 .
Instead , companies say the short - sellers are to blame for their problems .
And the SEC has gone along with this and banned short - selling in a number of stocks .
Poor Washington Mutual and Wachovia , which plummeted after the ban on short - selling .
How will they explain what happened to them now they can't blame short - sellers ?
Which leads to the most sobering repeat lesson of all .
Most of the believers in the free market only believe in it when it is going their way .
When it does n't , it 's someone else 's fault .
Enron 's former leaders often cited their free - market beliefs .
Its demise , they said , was due to a short - sellers ' conspiracy .
Indeed , when all was booming , Wall Streeters said they deserved their pay because the market said they were worth it .
But now things are falling apart , they say the market does n't work , and we need to stop short - selling , and taxpayers need to pony up .
If there is a tiny bit of good in all this , it 's that Wall Street , although it was complicit in the Enron mess , managed to walk away relatively unscathed .
This time , Wall Street has brought itself down .
Then again , maybe it really is n't a good sign for the future that there do n't seem to be any smart guys anywhere in the room .

FAT -BUSTING
but not wallet - busting , the humble bicycle is an increasingly popular choice of transport .
Around 130 m bikes rolled off production lines in 2007 and even more are set to be made this year .
Bicycle and car production grew pretty much in tandem in the two decades beginning in 1950 .
But since 1970 bike production has nearly quadrupled while car production has roughly doubled .
Much of the recent growth has been driven by electric bikes ; production has doubled since 2004 , to 21m .

PARIS / LONDON ( Reuters ) - Microsoft
Corp is opening three research centers in Europe as it steps up efforts to catch market leader Google Inc in the field of Internet searching , the U.S. software group said on Thursday .
Visitors stand between rows of computers at the Microsoft booth during the first public day at the CeBIT computer fair in Hanover March 15 , 2007 .
REUTERS / Christian Charisius
Microsoft , which failed several times to acquire search company Yahoo !
Inc , said the new European search technology center would have hubs in Paris , London and Munich .
It added its budget for research and development in Europe , which currently stands at $ 600 million a year , would increase .
“ We are the challenger , not the leader , in search , but we believe strongly that search is in its infancy and there is so much room for innovation , ” Chief Executive Steve Ballmer told a news conference in Paris .
“ For companies like Microsoft search is the key for unlocking huge new opportunities in advertising . ”
Ballmer declined to say how much the group would invest in the research centers announced today , but said that “ over the next few years we expect to employ several hundred people , software developers , in these centers in Europe . ”
Speaking alongside Ballmer , French Economy Minister Christine Lagarde said the new French facility , to be based in Issy - les- Moulineaux , near Paris , would be up and running by around March 2009 .
Lagarde added that Microsoft would benefit from a tax credit scheme aimed at encouraging R&D investment .
For every 100 euros invested by the U.S. group , it would get 30 euros back from the French state .
Ballmer said the investments announced on Thursday would bring the group ’s research presence in Europe to 2,000 engineers , taking the top spot in regions outside the United States , a little ahead of China and with India at number three .
“ In many ways it ’s an interesting time , though , to be talking about investment at all .
I was talking to the minister a little bit about the current economic uncertainties and investing in anything today can , I think , be a bit of a hard sell , ” Ballmer said .
CATCHING UP
Microsoft has about 2 percent of the European online search market , according to Web research firm ComScore , compared with Google ’s 79 percent .
The U.S. group recently bought UK mapping specialist Multimap , Germany - based price comparison site Ciao and Norwegian enterprise search company FAST as it tries to establish a niche in particular search areas used for such purposes as shopping .
In an interview with Reuters , Jean - Philippe Courtois , President of Microsoft International -- operations outside the U.S. and Canada -- said the $ 2 billion worth of acquisitions of Internet - based companies in Europe over the past 12 months were complete or nearing completion .
“ We keep looking at a lot of great start - up companies in Europe and other parts of the world and I am sure there will be some more to come in the next 12 months , ” Courtois said .

No Surprise here .
Voter Suppression is in full swing .
Never mind that Groups such as " Voters Outreach of America " will register voters ( or potential Republican voters ) and throw away registrations of minorities and Democratic potentials .
ACORN is under strict guidelines and Laws to deliver ALL registrations and they dutifuly did that noting the glaring miscreants registrations , that screw around with the canvassers .
Remember , some of these individuals are the results of " No Child Left Behind " answering questions of folk just doing their jobs .
Government is not trusted or held in confidence with the likes of George W. Bush or John McCain .
This is once again a major fraud on the part of the Republican Party / Fox News Propagandists and anti-democratic operatives ( aka Corporatists ) .
The multi-tiered Program of undermining voting and voters is underway in Colorado ( Repub . SoS , Mike Coffman ) , Indiana Repub .
SoS , Todd Rokita ) , Ohio ( Dem .
SoS Jennifer Brunner inheriting the filth from Kenneth Blackwell - who gave the 2004 Election to Bush ) , Michigan ( Repub . SoS , Terri Lynn Land ) , Nevada ( Dem SoS Ross Miller ... besieged by the Fox Noise contingent of morons and the " ACORN " completely bogus allegations , knowing that they are required to report / turn over all registration forms while Repub .
operatives can trash any forms they do n't like .... wow ) , North Carolina ( Dem. SoS Elaine Marshall ... surrounded by Republicans gone berserk ... HAVA and machines , iVotronic touch - screens , Election Systems & Software or AutoMARK voting system in play ) since her taking office in 1997 has been holding the line ... but may have become another Pelosi ?
or the technology just slipped in there in its glorius , uncertifiable magnanimus way and with a wave of her imperious hand it is deemed So .
Under no circumstances is any Election result that missmatches Exit Polls by 3 % to be allowed to stand or be accepted WITHOUT A RANDOM RECOUNT !!!!!!!!
Any lame ass , excuses must immediately be challenged as vote tampering suspects and taken into custody .
In Ohio , they were caught .
Hey Mike Connell , where 's your testimony , huh ?
Greg Palast is Karl Rove 's ( The Uber Planner of this Election fiasco aliong with Bobby Gates ... ) greatest nightmare .... many thanks in this are to Greg !!!!

Notwithstanding the fact that the GOP has indulged in vote fraud in previous elections , ACORN is currently being investigated by the attorneys general of eight different states in addition to a multitude of district attorneys .
This is too many instances of the same accusation to believe that its due to dirty tricks by the political opposition .
Consequently , I cannot buy into the argument that the Republicans are manuipulating the system to disenfranchise the poor .

And the sad fact is that we 've known this was going to happen for years .
In the meantime the Dem 's have raised lots of dough for the campaign and organized a bunch of lawyers to run around holding their " Richards " AFTER the fraud has been perpetrated on November 4th .
Remember that if Democrats are lucky enough to win on November 4 by 2 % percent and gain a slim majority , Nancy Pelosi and Harry Reid will be running around congratulating themselves on their great surrender strategy ( civil rights , subpoenas , corruption , wiretapping , ignoring vote purging , etc. )
Instead they should be winning by 10 - 15 % and a 60 + count in the Senate in the midst of this national train wreck ..

I have read this website frequently for the excellent information contained in it .
What I have read encouraged me to volunteer to do voter protection work on election day .
that is why I was extremely offended today when I opened this site and the add at the top of the site was in support of Proposition 8 in California .
Proposition 8 amends the California Constitution to deprive gay people of their fundamental right to marry .
I always thought Brad Blog was dedicated to protecting Americans fundamental rights and such an ad on this website is either a thoughtless oversight or it evidences a concerning perspective of the website .

Nancy Hoffman - Just so you know , I had n't seen that ad , but it 's likely one of the Google ads that rotates in , that I have little control over .
Some ads on the site here , I approve before they are seen , others , like that one , are rotated in from a network .
In general , I only disapprove ads ( those I have control over , anyway ) when they are misleading propaganda of sorts .
I 've had to disapprove of ads even from folks I like on that basis .
As to the Protect Marriage ad ( which I have n't yet seen , as not all ads show in all places for all users here )
I 'll look out for it and see if it needs to be removed , and if I 'm able to do so .
For the record though , I do n't disapprove comments based solely on content .
Eg. , if John McCain wanted to advertise here ( even though it'd be a cold day in hell before I voted for him ) , I 'd likely accept his money , as long as his ad was n't deceptive .
Same would be true for Obama ( who I ca n't imagine voting for either ! ) .
Where I can , I try to keep a separation between ad and editorial here , and try to design the page so that it 's very clear what is an ad , and what is actual content .

To JIMCT :
Hopefully , Cindy Sheehan will have won out over the Vichy Democrat Nancy Pelosi .
Harry Reid is just another walking sphincter .
As a former exit poll surveyor , many years ago getting a Masters , science has become the whipping boy of the ignorants dominating the political scene simply because they can yell louder ?
McCain IS fomenting uprising in keeping with the rumored withdrawal of a battalion from Iraq for domestic upheaval / unrest in preparation for this election .
Let 's not forget , many of these yellers and screamers are un-American , disruptive , and promoting the agenda of conflict to have the provisions of the Patriot Act ( s ) kick in .
This is as planned as it gets and the MSM think its just individuals ??
These people are more than likely PAID operatives of the RNC .
But , back to science and statistical sampling .... Exit Polls are 98%-99 % accurate .. Period .
They are not partisan and they are founded on mathematical , scientific principles developed over decades .. or more .
They ( Exit Polls ) are in competition with greed and avarice .
Your quote by Joseph Stalin , Brad , is absolutely true .
Republican Lawyers challenging Voters , Republican Judges adjudicating over results , and finally Republican SoS's ( oh yes , those fond memories of Katherine Harris come to mind .. Kenneth Blackwell , et.al. ) that exhibit outragous behavior towards the democratic and lawful election process of " Jim Crow " in Sheep 's disguise ..... ID's , Voter Purge Lists , Provisional Ballots , Electronic Uncertifiable and hackable machines ..... spell domestic outcry .
Every single instance of this most corrupt Administration ..... from Top to Bottom ... has been prefaced by " just trust us . "
We absolutely trust you and almost every RNC and Government Operative to Deceive , misdirect and obfuscate .
The Russians collapsed because of that .
No one was safe in their own beds or knew their own parents or trusted their government ... during the entire reign of Soviet / Communist rule .
And here we are with the Corporatists .... is n't AIG too real ?
Another $ 35 Billion and they take a lavish junket on the back of the Taxpayers .... LOL .
So , it 's part of the Plan to CAUSE DOMESTIC UNREST TO KICK IN THE PATRIOT PROVISIONS ( AND BUSH WILL REMAIN IN OFFICE AS SUPREME UNITARIAN EXECUTIVE ( SooIE ... a pig call ) .

I 've long felt that ACORN was being infiltrated and sabotaged .
So much about them makes them the ideal target for Nixonesque dirty tricks .
Hopefully , the desperation to get this smear out there will be its undoing .
Watch the completely unhinged Lou Dobbs introduce this story on 10/09 : DREW GRIFFIN , CNN SPECIAL INVESTIGATIONS UNIT : Lou , let me set this up a little bit .
Lake County is a very Democratic county in the Republican state of Indiana .
Barack Obama wants to turn Indiana this election .
And if it turns his way it will be largely because of the voters in Lake County who turn out again heavily Democratic .
ACORN who supports Barack Obama in this presidential campaign went out and tried to register as many new voters in Lake County as they possibly could .
The deadline was October 6th .
They came in with 5,000 new applications .
And when the registrations office began going through them , they found a pattern --- every single one of them was fraudulent .
( BEGIN VIDEOTAPE ) GRIFFIN ( on camera ) : A lot of them ?
RUTHANN HOAGLAND ( R ) , LAKE COUNTY ELECTIONS BOARD : 50 percent .
We had close to 5,000 total from ACORN , and so far , we have identified about 2100 .
GRIFFIN : So roughly half of them ...
HOAGLAND : Roughly half .

[ This article is excerpted from The Mystery of Banking available in the Mises Store . ]
I. Money : Its Importance and Origins
1. The Importance of Money
Today , money supply figures pervade the financial press .
Every Friday , investors breathlessly watch for the latest money figures , and Wall Street often reacts at the opening on the following Monday .
If the money supply has gone up sharply , interest rates may or may not move upward .
The press is filled with ominous forecasts of Federal Reserve actions , or of regulations of banks and other financial institutions .
This close attention to the money supply is rather new .
Until the 1970s , over the many decades of the Keynesian Era , talk of money and bank credit had dropped out of the financial pages .
Rather , they emphasized the GNP and government 's fiscal policy , expenditures , revenues , and deficits .
Banks and the money supply were generally ignored .
Yet after decades of chronic and accelerating inflation — which the Keynesians could not begin to cure — and after many bouts of " inflationary recession , " it became obvious to all — even to Keynesians — that something was awry .
The money supply therefore became a major object of concern .
But the average person may be confused by so many definitions of the money supply .
What are all the Ms about , from M1A and M1 - B up to M - 8 ?
Which is the true money supply figure , if any single one can be ?
And perhaps most important of all , why are bank deposits included in all the various Ms as a crucial and dominant part of the money supply ?
Everyone knows that paper dollars , issued nowadays exclusively by the Federal Reserve Banks and imprinted with the words " this note is legal tender for all debts , public and private " constitute money .
But why are checking accounts money , and where do they come from ?
Do n't they have to be redeemed in cash on demand ?
So why are checking deposits considered money , and not just the paper dollars backing them ?
One confusing implication of including checking deposits as a part of the money supply is that banks create money , that they are , in a sense , money - creating factories .
But do n't banks simply channel the savings we lend to them and relend them to productive investors or to borrowing consumers ?
Yet , if banks take our savings and lend them out , how can they create money ?
How can their liabilities become part of the money supply ?
There is no reason for the layman to feel frustrated if he can't find coherence in all this .
The best classical economists fought among themselves throughout the nineteenth century over whether or in what sense private bank notes ( now illegal ) or deposits should or should not be part of the money supply .
Most economists , in fact , landed on what we now see to be the wrong side of the question .
Economists in Britain , the great center of economic thought during the nineteenth century , were particularly at sea on this issue .
The eminent David Ricardo and his successors in the Currency School , lost a great chance to establish truly hard money in England because they never grasped the fact that bank deposits are part of the supply of money .
Oddly enough , it was in the United States , then considered a backwater of economic theory , that economists first insisted that bank deposits , like bank notes , were part of the money supply .
Condy Raguet , of Philadelphia , first made this point in 1820 .
But English economists of the day paid scant attention to their American colleagues .
2. How Money Begins
Before examining what money is , we must deal with the importance of money , and , before we can do that , we have to understand how money arose .
As Ludwig von Mises conclusively demonstrated in 1912 , money does not and cannot originate by order of the State or by some sort of social contract agreed upon by all citizens ; it must always originate in the processes of the free market .
Before coinage , there was barter .
Goods were produced by those who were good at it , and their surpluses were exchanged for the products of others .
Every product had its barter price in terms of all other products , and every person gained by exchanging something he needed less for a product he needed more .
The voluntary market economy became a latticework of mutually beneficial exchanges .
" The Currency School lost a great chance to establish truly hard money in England because they never grasped the fact that bank deposits are … money . "
In barter , there were severe limitations on the scope of exchange and therefore on production .
In the first place , in order to buy something he wanted , each person had to find a seller who wanted precisely what he had available in exchange .
In short , if an egg dealer wanted to buy a pair of shoes , he had to find a shoemaker who wanted , at that very moment , to buy eggs .
Yet suppose that the shoemaker was sated with eggs .
How was the egg dealer going to buy a pair of shoes ?
How could he be sure that he could find a shoemaker who liked eggs ?
Or , to put the question in its starkest terms , I make a living as a professor of economics .
If I wanted to buy a newspaper in a world of barter , I would have to wander around and find a newsdealer who wanted to hear , say , a 10 - minute economics lecture from me in exchange .
Knowing economists , how likely would I be to find an interested newsdealer ?
This crucial element in barter is what is called the double coincidence of wants .
A second problem is one of indivisibilities .
We can see clearly how exchangers could adjust their supplies and sales of butter , or eggs , or fish , fairly precisely .
But suppose that Jones owns a house , and would like to sell it and instead , purchase a car , a washing machine , or some horses ?
How could he do so ?
He could not chop his house into 20 different segments and exchange each one for other products .
Clearly , since houses are indivisible and lose all of their value if they get chopped up , we face an insoluble problem .
The same would be true of tractors , machines , and other large - sized products .
If houses could not easily be bartered , not many would be produced in the first place .
Another problem with the barter system is what would happen to business calculation .
Business firms must be able to calculate whether they are making or losing income or wealth in each of their transactions .
Yet , in the barter system , profit or loss calculation would be a hopeless task .
Barter , therefore , could not possibly manage an advanced or modern industrial economy .
Barter could not succeed beyond the needs of a primitive village .
But man is ingenious .
He managed to find a way to overcome these obstacles and transcend the limiting system of barter .
Trying to overcome the limitations of barter , he arrived , step by step , at one of man 's most ingenious , important and productive inventions : money .
Take , for example , the egg dealer who is trying desperately to buy a pair of shoes .
He thinks to himself : if the shoemaker is allergic to eggs and does n't want to buy them , what does he want to buy ?
Necessity is the mother of invention , and so the egg man is impelled to try to find out what the shoemaker would like to obtain .
Suppose he finds out that it 's fish .
And so the egg dealer goes out and buys fish , not because he wants to eat the fish himself ( he might be allergic to fish ) , but because he wants it in order to resell it to the shoemaker .
In the world of barter , everyone 's purchases were purely for himself or for his family 's direct use .
But now , for the first time , a new element of demand has entered :
The egg man is buying fish not for its own sake , but instead to use it as an indispensable way of obtaining shoes .
Fish is now being used as a medium of exchange , as an instrument of indirect exchange , as well as being purchased directly for its own sake .
Once a commodity begins to be used as a medium of exchange , when the word gets out it generates even further use of the commodity as a medium .
In short , when the word gets around that commodity X is being used as a medium in a certain village , more people living in or trading with that village will purchase that commodity , since they know that it is being used there as a medium of exchange .
In this way , a commodity used as a medium feeds upon itself , and its use spirals upward , until before long the commodity is in general use throughout the society or country as a medium of exchange .
But when a commodity is used as a medium for most or all exchanges , that commodity is defined as being a money .
In this way money enters the free market , as market participants begin to select suitable commodities for use as the medium of exchange , with that use rapidly escalating until a general medium of exchange , or money , becomes established in the market .
Money was a leap forward in the history of civilization and in man 's economic progress .
Money — as an element in every exchange — permits man to overcome all the immense difficulties of barter .
The egg dealer does n't have to seek a shoemaker who enjoys eggs ; and I do n't have to find a newsdealer or a grocer who wants to hear some economics lectures .
All we need do is exchange our goods or services for money , for the money commodity .
We can do so in the confidence that we can take this universally desired commodity and exchange it for any goods that we need .
Similarly , indivisibilities are overcome ; a homeowner can sell his house for money , and then exchange that money for the various goods and services that he wishes to buy .
" Trying to overcome the limitations of barter , he arrived , step by step , at one of man 's most ingenious , important and productive inventions : money . "
Similarly , business firms can now calculate , can figure out when they are making , or losing , money .
Their income and their expenditures for all transactions can be expressed in terms of money .
The firm took in , say , $ 10,000 last month , and spent $ 9,000 ; clearly , there was a net profit of $ 1,000 for the month .
No longer does a firm have to try to add or subtract in commensurable objects .
A steel manufacturing firm does not have to pay its workers in steel bars useless to them or in myriad other physical commodities ; it can pay them in money , and the workers can then use money to buy other desired products .
Furthermore , to know a good 's " price , " one no longer has to look at a virtually infinite array of relative quantities : the fish price of eggs , the beef price of string , the shoe price of flour , and so forth .
Every commodity is priced in only one commodity : money , and so it becomes easy to compare these single money prices of eggs , shoes , beef , or whatever .
3 . The Proper Qualities of Money
Which commodities are picked as money on the market ?
Which commodities will be subject to a spiral of use as a medium ?
Clearly , it will be those commodities most useful as money in any given society .
Through the centuries , many commodities have been selected as money on the market .
Fish on the Atlantic seacoast of colonial North America , beaver in the Old Northwest , and tobacco in the Southern colonies were chosen as money .
In other cultures , salt , sugar , cattle , iron hoes , tea , cowrie shells , and many other commodities have been chosen on the market .
Many banks display money museums which exhibit various forms of money over the centuries .
Amid this variety of moneys , it is possible to analyze the qualities which led the market to choose that particular commodity as money .
In the first place , individuals do not pick the medium of exchange out of thin air .
They will overcome the double coincidence of wants of barter by picking a commodity which is already in widespread use for its own sake .
In short , they will pick a commodity in heavy demand , which shoemakers and others will be likely to accept in exchange from the very start of the money - choosing process .
Second , they will pick a commodity which is highly divisible , so that small chunks of other goods can be bought , and size of purchases can be flexible .
For this they need a commodity which technologically does not lose its quotal value when divided into small pieces .
For that reason a house or a tractor , being highly indivisible , is not likely to be chosen as money , whereas butter , for example , is highly divisible and at least scores heavily as a money for this particular quality .
Demand and divisibility are not the only criteria .
It is also important for people to be able to carry the money commodity around in order to facilitate purchases .
To be easily portable , then , a commodity must have high value per unit weight .
To have high value per unit weight , however , requires a good which is not only in great demand but also relatively scarce , since an intense demand combined with a relatively scarce supply will yield a high price , or high value per unit weight .
Finally , the money commodity should be highly durable , so that it can serve as a store of value for a long time .
The holder of money should not only be assured of being able to purchase other products right now , but also indefinitely into the future .
Therefore , butter , fish , eggs , and so on fail on the question of durability .
" Proponents of the gold standard do not suffer from a mysterious ' gold fetish ' . "
A fascinating example of an unexpected development of a money commodity in modern times occurred in German POW camps during World War II .
In these camps , supply of various goods was fixed by external conditions : CARE packages , rations , etc .
But after receiving the rations , the prisoners began exchanging what they did n't want for what they particularly needed , until soon there was an elaborate price system for every product , each in terms of what had evolved as the money commodity : cigarettes .
Prices in terms of cigarettes fluctuated in accordance with changing supply and demand .
Cigarettes were clearly the most " moneylike " products available in the camps .
They were in high demand for their own sake , they were divisible , portable , and in high value per unit weight .
They were not very durable , since they crumpled easily , but they could make do in the few years of the camps ' existence .
In all countries and all civilizations , two commodities have been dominant whenever they were available to compete as moneys with other commodities : gold and silver .
At first , gold and silver were highly prized only for their luster and ornamental value .
They were always in great demand .
Second , they were always relatively scarce , and hence valuable per unit of weight .
And for that reason they were portable as well .
They were also divisible , and could be sliced into thin segments without losing their pro rata value .
Finally , silver or gold were blended with small amounts of alloy to harden them , and since they did not corrode , they would last almost forever .
Thus , because gold and silver are supremely " moneylike " commodities , they are selected by markets as money if they are available .
Proponents of the gold standard do not suffer from a mysterious " gold fetish . "
They simply recognize that gold has always been selected by the market as money throughout history .
Generally , gold and silver have both been moneys , side - byside .
Since gold has always been far scarcer and also in greater demand than silver , it has always commanded a higher price , and tends to be money in larger transactions , while silver has been used in smaller exchanges .
Because of its higher price , gold has often been selected as the unit of account , although this has not always been true .
The difficulties of mining gold , which makes its production limited , make its long - term value relatively more stable than silver .
4. The Money Unit
We referred to prices without explaining what a price really is .
A price is simply the ratio of the two quantities exchanged in any transaction .
It should be no surprise that every monetary unit we are now familiar with — the dollar , pound , mark , franc , et al. — began on the market simply as names for different units of weight of gold or silver .
Thus the " pound sterling " in Britain , was exactly that — one pound of silver .
" In all countries and all civilizations , two commodities have been dominant whenever they were available to compete as moneys with other commodities : gold and silver . "
The " dollar " originated as the name generally applied to a one - ounce silver coin minted by a Bohemian count named Schlick , in the sixteenth century .
Count Schlick lived in Joachimsthal ( Joachim 's Valley ) .
His coins , which enjoyed a great reputation for uniformity and fineness , were called Joachimsthalers and finally , just thalers .
The word dollar emerged from the pronunciation of thaler .
Since gold or silver exchanges by weight , the various national currency units , all defined as particular weights of a precious metal , will be automatically fixed in terms of each other .
Thus , suppose that the dollar is defined as 1/20 of a gold ounce ( as it was in the nineteenth century in the United States ) , while the pound sterling is defined as 1 / 4 of a gold ounce , and the French franc is established at 1/100 of a gold ounce .
But in that case , the exchange rates between the various currencies are automatically fixed by their respective quantities of gold .
If a dollar is 1/20 of a gold ounce , and the pound is 1 / 4 of a gold ounce , then the pound will automatically exchange for 5 dollars .
And , in our example , the pound will exchange for 25 francs and the dollar for 5 francs .
The definitions of weight automatically set the exchange rates between them .
Free market gold standard advocates have often been taunted with the charge : " You are against the government fixing the price of goods and services ; why then do you make an exception for gold ?
Why do you call for the government fixing the price of gold and setting the exchange rates between the various currencies ? "
The answer to this common complaint is that the question assumes the dollar to be an independent entity , a thing or commodity which should be allowed to fluctuate freely in relation to gold .
But the rebuttal of the pro-gold forces points out that the dollar is not an independent entity , that it was originally simply a name for a certain weight of gold ; the dollar , as well as the other currencies , is a unit of weight .
But in that case , the pound , franc , dollar , and so on , are not exchanging as independent entities ; they , too , are simply relative weights of gold .
If 1/4 ounce of gold exchanges for 1/20 ounce of gold , how else would we expect them to trade than at 1:5 ?
If the monetary unit is simply a unit of weight , then government 's role in the area of money could well be confined to a simple Bureau of Weights and Measures , certifying this as well as other units of weight , length , or mass .
The problem is that governments have systematically betrayed their trust as guardians of the precisely defined weight of the money commodity .
If government sets itself up as the guardian of the international meter or the standard yard or pound , there is no economic incentive for it to betray its trust and change the definition .
For the Bureau of Standards to announce suddenly that 1 pound is now equal to 14 instead of 16 ounces would make no sense whatever .
There is , however , all too much of an economic incentive for governments to change , especially to lighten , the definition of the currency unit ; say , to change the definition of the pound sterling from 16 to 14 ounces of silver .
This profitable process of the government 's repeatedly lightening the number of ounces or grams in the same monetary unit is called debasement .
How debasement profits the State can be seen from a hypothetical case :
Say the rur , the currency of the mythical kingdom of Ruritania , is worth 20 grams of gold .
A new king now ascends the throne , and , being chronically short of money , decides to take the debasement route to the acquisition of wealth .
He announces a mammoth call - in of all the old gold coins of the realm , each now dirty with wear and with the picture of the previous king stamped on its face .
In return he will supply brand new coins with his face stamped on them , and will return the same number of rurs paid in .
Someone presenting 100 rurs in old coins will receive 100 rurs in the new .
Seemingly a bargain !
Except for a slight hitch : During the course of this recoinage , the king changes the definition of the rur from 20 to 16 grams .
He then pockets the extra 20 percent of gold , minting the gold for his own use and pouring the coins into circulation for his own expenses .
In short , the number of grams of gold in the society remains the same , but since people are now accustomed to use the name rather than the weight in their money accounts and prices , the number of rurs will have increased by 20 percent .
The money supply in rurs , therefore , has gone up by 20 percent , and , as we shall see later on , this will drive up prices in the economy in terms of rurs .
Debasement , then , is the arbitrary redefining and lightening of the currency so as to add to the coffers of the State .
" Debasement , then , is the arbitrary redefining and lightening of the currency so as to add to the coffers of the State . "
The pound sterling has diminished from 16 ounces of silver to its present fractional state because of repeated debasements , or changes in definition , by the kings of England .
Similarly , rapid and extensive debasement was a striking feature of the Middle Ages , in almost every country in Europe .
Thus , in 1200 , the French livre tournois was defined as 98 grams of fine silver ; by 1600 it equaled only 11 grams .
A particularly striking case is the dinar , the coin of the Saracens in Spain .
The dinar , when first coined at the end of the seventh century , consisted of 65 gold grains .
The Saracens , notably sound in monetary matters , kept the dinar 's weight relatively constant , and as late as the middle of the twelfth century , it still equaled 60 grains .
At that point , the Christian kings conquered Spain , and by the early thirteenth century , the dinar ( now called maravedi ) had been reduced to 14 grains of gold .
Soon the gold coin was too lightweight to circulate , and it was converted into a silver coin weighing 26 grains of silver .
But this , too , was debased further , and by the mid-fifteenth century , the maravedi consisted of only 1 1/2 silver grains , and was again too small to circulate .
Where is the total money supply — that crucial concept — in all this ?
First , before debasement , when the regional or national currency unit simply stands for a certain unit of weight of gold , the total money supply is the aggregate of all the monetary gold in existence in that society , that is , all the gold ready to be used in exchange .
In practice , this means the total stock of gold coin and gold bullion available .
Since all property and therefore all money is owned by someone , this means that the total money stock in the society at any given time is the aggregate , the sum total , of all existing cash balances , or money stock , owned by each individual or group .
Thus , if there is a village of 10 people , A , B , C , etc. , the total money stock in the village will equal the sum of all cash balances held by each of the 10 citizens .
If we wish to put this in mathematical terms , we can say that
M = Σ m
where M is the total stock or supply of money in any given area or in society as a whole , m is the individual stock or cash balance owned by each individual , and Σ means the sum or aggregate of each of the ms .
After debasement , since the money unit is the name ( dinar ) rather than the actual weight ( specific number of gold grams ) , the number of dinars or pounds or maravedis will increase , and thus increase the supply of money .
M will be the sum of the individual dinars held by each person , and will increase by the extent of the debasement .
As we will see later , this increased money supply will tend to raise prices throughout the economy .
II .
What Determines Prices : Supply and Demand
What determines individual prices ?
Why is the price of eggs , or horseshoes , or steel rails , or bread , whatever it is ?
Is the market determination of prices arbitrary , chaotic , or anarchic ?
Much of the past two centuries of economic analysis , or what is now unfortunately termed microeconomics , has been devoted to analyzing and answering this question .
The answer is that any given price is always determined by two fundamental , underlying forces : supply and demand , or the supply of that product and the intensity of demand to purchase it .
Let us say that we are analyzing the determination of the price of any product , say , coffee , at any given moment , or " day , " in time .
At any time there is a stock of coffee , ready to be sold to the consumer .
How that stock got there is not yet our concern .
Let 's say that , at a certain place or in an entire country , there are 10 million pounds of coffee available for consumption .
We can then construct a diagram , of which the horizontal axis is units of quantity , in this case , millions of pounds of coffee .
If 10 million pounds are now available , the stock , or supply , of coffee available is the vertical line at 10 million pounds , the line to be labeled S for supply .
The demand curve for coffee is not objectively measurable as is supply , but there are several things that we can definitely say about it .
For one , if we construct a hypothetical demand schedule for the market , we can conclude that , at any given time , and all other things remaining the same , the higher the price of a product the less will be purchased .
Conversely , the lower the price the more will be purchased .
Suppose , for example , that for some bizarre reason , the price of coffee should suddenly leap to $ 1,000 a pound .
Very few people will be able to buy and consume coffee , and they will be confined to a few extremely wealthy coffee fanatics .
Everyone else will shift to cocoa , tea , or other beverages .
So if the coffee price becomes extremely high , few pounds of coffee will be purchased .
On the other hand , suppose again that , by some fluke , coffee prices suddenly drop to 1 cent a pound .
At that point , everyone will rush out to consume coffee in large quantities , and they will forsake tea , cocoa or whatever .
A very low price , then , will induce a willingness to buy a very large number of pounds of coffee .
A very high price means only a few purchases ; a very low price means a large number of purchases .
Similarly we can generalize on the range between .
In fact we can conclude :
The lower the price of any product ( other things being equal ) , the greater the quantities that buyers will be willing to purchase .
And vice versa .
For as the price of anything falls , it becomes less costly relative to the buyer 's stock of money and to other competing uses for the dollar ; so that a fall in price will bring nonbuyers into the market and cause the expansion of purchases by existing buyers .
Conversely , as the price of anything rises , the product becomes more costly relative to the buyers ' income and to other products , and the amount they will purchase will fall .
Buyers will leave the market , and existing buyers will curtail their purchases .
The result is the " falling demand curve , " which graphically expresses this " law of demand " ( Figure 2.2 ) .
We can see that the quantity buyers will purchase ( " the quantity demanded " ) varies inversely with the price of the product .
This line is labeled D for demand .
The vertical axis is P for price , in this case , dollars per pound of coffee .
" Is the market determination of prices arbitrary , chaotic , or anarchic ? "
Supply , for any good , is the objective fact of how many goods are available to the consumer .
Demand is the result of the subjective values and demands of the individual buyers or consumers .
S tells us how many pounds of coffee , or loaves of bread or whatever are available ; D tells us how many loaves would be purchased at different hypothetical prices .
We never know the actual demand curve : only that it is falling , in some way ; with quantity purchased increasing as prices fall and vice versa .
We come now to how prices are determined on the free market .
What we shall demonstrate is that the price of any good or service , at any given time , and on any given day , will tend to be the price at which the S and D curves intersect ( Figure 2.3 ) .
In our example , the S and D curves intersect at the price of $ 3 a pound , and therefore that will be the price on the market .
To see why the coffee price will be $ 3 a pound , let us suppose that , for some reason , the price is higher , say $ 5 ( Figure 2.4 ) .
At that point , the quantity supplied ( 10 million pounds ) will be greater than the quantity demanded , that is , the amount that consumers are willing to buy at that higher price .
This leaves an unsold surplus of coffee , coffee sitting on the shelves that cannot be sold because no one will buy it .
At a price of $ 5 for coffee , only 6 million pounds are purchased , leaving 4 million pounds of unsold surplus .
The pressure of the surplus , and the consequent losses , will induce sellers to lower their price , and as the price falls , the quantity purchased will increase .
This pressure continues until the intersection price of $ 3 is reached , at which point the market is cleared , that is , there is no more unsold surplus , and supply is just equal to demand .
People want to buy just the amount of coffee available , no more and no less .
At a price higher than the intersection , then , supply is greater than demand , and market forces will then impel a lowering of price until the unsold surplus is eliminated , and supply and demand are equilibrated .
These market forces which lower the excessive price and clear the market are powerful and twofold : the desire of every businessman to increase profits and to avoid losses , and the free price system , which reflects economic changes and responds to underlying supply and demand changes .
The profit motive and the free price system are the forces that equilibrate supply and demand , and make price responsive to underlying market forces .
On the other hand , suppose that the price , instead of being above the intersection , is below the intersection price .
Suppose the price is at $ 1 a pound .
In that case , the quantity demanded by consumers , the amount of coffee the consumers wish to purchase at that price , is much greater than the 10 million pounds that they would buy at $ 3 .
Suppose that quantity is 15 million pounds .
But , since there are only 10 million pounds available to satisfy the 15 million pound demand at the low price , the coffee will then rapidly disappear from the shelves , and we would experience a shortage of coffee ( shortage being present when something cannot be purchased at the existing price ) .
The coffee market would then be as shown in Figure 2.5 .
Thus , at the price of $ 1 , there is a shortage of 4 million pounds , that is , there are only 10 million pounds of coffee available to satisfy a demand for 14 million .
Coffee will disappear quickly from the shelves , and then the retailers , emboldened by a desire for profit , will raise their prices .
As the price rises , the shortage will begin to disappear , until it disappears completely when the price goes up to the intersection point of $ 3 a pound .
Once again , free market action quickly eliminates shortages by raising prices to the point where the market is cleared , and demand and supply are again equilibrated .
Clearly then , the profit - loss motive and the free price system produce a built - in " feedback " or governor mechanism by which the market price of any good moves so as to clear the market , and to eliminate quickly any surpluses or shortages .
For at the intersection point , which tends always to be the market price , supply and demand are finely and precisely attuned , and neither shortage nor surplus can exist ( Figure 2.6 ) .
Economists call the intersection price , the price which tends to be the daily market price , the " equilibrium price , " for two reasons : ( 1 ) because this is the only price that equilibrates supply and demand , that equates the quantity available for sale with the quantity buyers wish to purchase ; and ( 2 ) because , in an analogy with the physical sciences , the intersection price is the only price to which the market tends to move .
And , if a price is displaced from equilibrium , it is quickly impelled by market forces to return to that point — just as an equilibrium point in physics is where something tends to stay and to return to if displaced .
If the price of a product is determined by its supply and demand and if , according to our example , the equilibrium price , where the price will move and remain , is $ 3 for a pound of coffee , why does any price ever change ?
We know , of course , that prices of all products are changing all the time .
The price of coffee does not remain contentedly at $ 3 or any other figure .
How and why does any price change ever take place ?
Clearly , for one of two ( more strictly , three ) reasons : either D changes , or S changes , or both change at the same time .
Suppose , for example , that S falls , say because a large proportion of the coffee crop freezes in Brazil , as it seems to do every few years .
A drop in S is depicted in Figure 2.7 .
Beginning with an equilibrium price of $ 3 , the quantity of coffee produced and ready for sale on the market drops from 10 million to 6 million pounds .
S changes to S′ , the new vertical supply line .
But this means that at the new supply , S′ , there is a shortage of coffee at the old price , amounting to 4 million pounds .
The shortage impels coffee sellers to raise their prices , and , as they do so , the shortage begins to disappear , until the new equilibrium price is achieved at the $ 5 price .
To put it another way , all products are scarce in relation to their possible use , which is the reason they command a price on the market at all .
Price , on the free market , performs a necessary rationing function , in which the available pounds or bushels or other units of a good are allocated freely and voluntarily to those who are most willing to purchase the product .
If coffee becomes scarcer , then the price rises to perform an increased rationing function : to allocate the smaller supply of the product to the most eager purchasers .
When the price rises to reflect the smaller supply , consumers cut their purchases and shift to other hot drinks or stimulants until the quantity demanded is small enough to equal the lower supply .
On the other hand , let us see what happens when the supply increases , say , because of better weather conditions or increased productivity due to better methods of growing or manufacturing the product .
Figure 2.8 shows the result of an increase in S :
Supply increases from 10 to 14 million pounds or from S to S′ .
But this means that at the old equilibrium price , $ 3 , there is now an excess of supply over demand , and 4 million pounds will remain unsold at the old price .
In order to sell the increased product , sellers will have to cut their prices , and as they do so , the price of coffee will fall until the new equilibrium price is reached , here at $ 1 a pound .
Or , to put it another way , businessmen will now have to cut prices in order to induce consumers to buy the increased product , and will do so until the new equilibrium is reached .
In short , price responds inversely to supply .
If supply increases , price will fall ; if supply falls , price will rise .
" Price , on the free market , performs a necessary rationing function . "
The other factor that can and does change and thereby alters equilibrium price is demand .
Demand can change for various reasons .
Given total consumer income , any increase in the demand for one product necessarily reflects a fall in the demand for another .
For an increase in demand is defined as a willingness by buyers to spend more money on — that is , to buy more — of a product at any given hypothetical price .
In our diagrams , such an " increase in demand " is reflected in a shift of the entire demand curve upward and to the right .
But given total income , if consumers are spending more on Product A , they must necessarily be spending less on Product B .
The demand for Product B will decrease , that is , consumers will be willing to spend less on the product at any given hypothetical price .
Graphically , the entire demand curve for B will shift downward and to the left .
Suppose that we are now analyzing a shift in consumer tastes toward beef and away from pork .
In that case , the respective markets may be analyzed as follows :
We have postulated an increase in consumer preference for beef , so that the demand curve for beef increases , that is , shifts upward and to the right , from D to D′ .
But the result of the increased demand is that there is now a shortage at the old equilibrium price , 0X , so that producers raise their prices until the shortage is eliminated and there is a new and higher equilibrium price , 0Y .
On the other hand , suppose that there is a drop in preference , and therefore a fall in the demand for pork .
This means that the demand curve for pork shifts downward and to the left , from D to D′ , as shown in Figure 2.10 :
Here , the fall in demand from D to D′ means that at the old equilibrium price for pork , 0X , there is now an unsold surplus because of the decline in demand .
In order to sell the surplus , therefore , producers must cut the price until the surplus disappears and the market is cleared again , at the new equilibrium price 0Y .
In sum , price responds directly to changes in demand .
If demand increases , price rises ; if demand falls , the price drops .
We have been treating supply throughout as a given , which it always is at any one time .
If , however , demand for a product increases , and that increase is perceived by the producers as lasting for a long period of time , future supply will increase .
More beef , for example , will be grown in response to the greater demand and the higher price and profits .
Similarly , producers will cut future supply if a fall in prices is thought to be permanent .
Supply , therefore , will respond over time to future demand as anticipated by producers .
It is this response by supply to changes in expected future demand that gives us the familiar forward - sloping , or rising supply curves of the economics textbooks .
As shown in Figure 2.9 , demand increases from D to D′ .
This raises the equilibrium price of beef from 0X to 0Y , given the initial S curve , the initial supply of beef .
But if this new higher price 0Y is considered permanent by the beef producers , supply will increase over time , until it reaches the new higher supply S′′ .
Price will be driven back down by the increased supply to 0Z .
In this way , higher demand pulls out more supply over time , which will lower the price .
To return to the original change in demand , on the free market a rise in the demand for and price of one product will necessarily be counterbalanced by a fall in the demand for another .
The only way in which consumers , especially over a sustained period of time , can increase their demand for all products is if consumer incomes are increasing overall , that is , if consumers have more money in their pockets to spend on all products .
But this can happen only if the stock or supply of money available increases ; only in that case , with more money in consumer hands , can most or all demand curves rise , can shift upward and to the right , and prices can rise overall .
To put it another way : a continuing , sustained inflation — that is , a persistent rise in overall prices — can either be the result of a persistent , continuing fall in the supply of most or all goods and services , or of a continuing rise in the supply of money .
Since we know that in today 's world the supply of most goods and services rises rather than falls each year , and since we know , also , that the money supply keeps rising substantially every year , then it should be crystal clear that increases in the supply of money , not any sort of problems from the supply side , are the fundamental cause of our chronic and accelerating problem of inflation .
Despite the currently fashionable supply - side economists , inflation is a demand - side ( more specifically monetary or money supply ) rather than a supply - side problem .
Prices are continually being pulled up by increases in the quantity of money and hence of the monetary demand for products .
III .
Money and Overall Prices
1. The Supply and Demand for Money and Overall Prices
When economics students read textbooks , they learn , in the " micro " sections , how prices of specific goods are determined by supply and demand .
But when they get to the " macro " chapters , lo and behold !
supply and demand built on individual persons and their choices disappear , and they hear instead of such mysterious and ill - defined concepts as velocity of circulation , total transactions , and gross national product .
Where are the supply - and - demand concepts when it comes to overall prices ?
In truth , overall prices are determined by similar supply - and - demand forces that determine the prices of individual products .
Let us reconsider the concept of price .
If the price of bread is 70 cents a loaf , this means also that the purchasing power of a loaf of bread is 70 cents .
A loaf of bread can command 70 cents in exchange on the market .
The price and purchasing power of the unit of a product are one and the same .
Therefore , we can construct a diagram for the determination of overall prices , with the price or the purchasing power of the money unit on the Y - axis .
While recognizing the extreme difficulty of arriving at a measure , it should be clear conceptually that the price or the purchasing power of the dollar is the inverse of whatever we can construct as the price level , or the level of overall prices .
In mathematical terms ,
PPM = 1 / P
where PPM is the purchasing power of the dollar , and P is the price level .
To take a highly simplified example , suppose that there are four commodities in the society and that their prices are as follows :
eggs 50 ¢ dozen butter $ 1 pound shoes $ 20 pair TV set $ 200 set
In this society , the PPM , or the purchasing power of the dollar , is an array of alternatives inverse to the above prices .
In short , the purchasing power of the dollar is :
either 2 dozen eggs or 1 pound butter or 1/20 pair shoes or 1/200 TV set
Suppose now that the price level doubles , in the easy sense that all prices double .
Prices are now :
eggs $ 1 dozen butter $ 2 pound shoes $ 40 pair TV set $ 400 set
In this case , PPM has been cut in half across the board .
The purchasing power of the dollar is now :
either 1 dozen eggs or 1/2 pound butter or 1/40 pair shoes or 1/400 TV set
Purchasing power of the dollar is therefore the inverse of the price level .
Let us now put PPM on the Y - axis and quantity of dollars on the X - axis .
We contend that , on a complete analogy with supply , demand , and price above , the intersection of the vertical line indicating the supply of money in the country at any given time , with the falling demand curve for money , will yield the market equilibrium PPM and hence the equilibrium height of overall prices , at any given time .
Let us examine the diagram in Figure 3.1 .
The supply of money , M , is conceptually easy to figure : the total quantity of dollars at any given time .
( What constitutes these dollars will be explained later . )
" Increases in the supply of money , not any sort of problems from the supply side , are the fundamental cause of our chronic and accelerating problem of inflation . "
We contend that there is a falling demand curve for money in relation to hypothetical PPMs , just as there is one in relation to hypothetical individual prices .
At first , the idea of a demand curve for money seems odd .
Is n't the demand for money unlimited ?
Wo n't people take as much money as they can get ?
But this confuses what people would be willing to accept as a gift ( which is indeed unlimited ) with their demand in the sense of how much they would be willing to give up for the money .
Or : how much money they would be willing to keep in their cash balances rather than spend .
In this sense their demand for money is scarcely unlimited .
If someone acquires money , he can do two things with it : either spend it on consumer goods or investments , or else hold on to it , and increase his individual money stock , his total cash balances .
How much he wishes to hold on to is his demand for money .
Let us look at people 's demand for cash balances .
How much money people will keep in their cash balance is a function of the level of prices .
Suppose , for example , that prices suddenly dropped to about a third of what they are now .
People would need far less in their wallets , purses , and bank accounts to pay for daily transactions or to prepare for emergencies .
Everyone need only carry around or have readily available only about a third the money that they keep now .
The rest they can spend or invest .
Hence , the total amount of money people would hold in their cash balances would be far less if prices were much lower than now .
Contrarily , if prices were triple what they are today , people would need about three times as much in their wallets , purses , and bank accounts to handle their daily transactions and their emergency inventory .
People would demand far greater cash balances than they do now to do the same " money work " if prices were much higher .
The falling demand curve for money is shown in Figure 3.2 .
Here we see that when the PPM is very high ( i.e. , prices overall are very low ) , the demand for cash balances is low ; but when PPM is very low ( prices are high ) , the demand for cash balances is very high .
We will now see how the intersection of the falling demand curve for money or cash balances , and the supply of money , determines the day - to - day equilibrium PPM or price level .
Suppose that PPM is suddenly very high , that is , prices are very low .
M , the money stock , is given , at $ 100 billion .
As we see in Figure 3.3 , at a high PPM , the supply of total cash balances , M , is greater than the demand for money .
The difference is surplus cash balances — money , in the old phrase , that is burning a hole in people 's pockets .
People find that they are suffering from a monetary imbalance : their cash balances are greater than they need at that price level .
And so people start trying to get rid of their cash balances by spending money on various goods and services .
But while people can get rid of money individually , by buying things with it , they can't get rid of money in the aggregate , because the $ 100 billion still exists , and they can't get rid of it short of burning it up .
But as people spend more , this drives up demand curves for most or all goods and services .
As the demand curves shift upward and to the right , prices rise .
But as prices overall rise further and further , PPM begins to fall , as the downward arrow indicates .
And as the PPM begins to fall , the surplus of cash balances begins to disappear until finally , prices have risen so much that the $ 100 billion no longer burns a hole in anyone 's pocket .
At the higher price level , people are now willing to keep the exact amount of $ 100 billion that is available in the economy .
The market is at last cleared , and people now wish to hold no more and no less than the $ 100 billion available .
The demand for money has been brought into equilibrium with the supply of money , and the PPM and price level are in equilibrium .
People were not able to get rid of money in the aggregate , but they were able to drive up prices so as to end the surplus of cash balances .
Conversely , suppose that prices were suddenly three times as high and PPM therefore much lower .
In that case , people would need far more cash balances to finance their daily lives , and there would be a shortage of cash balances compared to the supply of money available .
The demand for cash balances would be greater than the total supply .
People would then try to alleviate this imbalance , this shortage , by adding to their cash balances .
They can only do so by spending less of their income and adding the remainder to their cash balance .
When they do so , the demand curves for most or all products will shift downward and to the left , and prices will generally fall .
As prices fall , PPM ipso facto rises , as the upward arrow shows .
The process will continue until prices fall enough and PPM rises , so that the $ 100 billion is no longer less than the total amount of cash balances desired .
Once again , market action works to equilibrate supply and demand for money or cash balances , and demand for money will adjust to the total supply available .
Individuals tried to scramble to add to their cash balances by spending less ; in the aggregate , they could not add to the money supply , since that is given at $ 100 billion .
But in the process of spending less , prices overall fell until the $ 100 billion became an adequate total cash balance once again .
The price level , then , and the purchasing power of the dollar , are determined by the same sort of supply - and - demand feedback mechanism that determines individual prices .
The price level tends to be at the intersection of the supply of and demand for money , and tends to return to that point when displaced .
As in individual markets , then , the price or purchasing power of the dollar varies directly with the demand for money and inversely with the supply .
Or , to turn it around , the price level varies directly with the supply of money and inversely with the demand .
2. Why Overall Prices Change
Why does the price level ever change , if the supply of money and the demand for money determine the height of overall prices ?
If , and only if , one or both of these basic factors — the supply of or demand for money — changes .
Let us see what happens when the supply of money changes , that is , in the modern world , when the supply of nominal units changes rather than the actual weight of gold or silver they used to represent .
Let us assume , then , that the supply of dollars , pounds , or francs increases , without yet examining how the increase occurs or how the new money gets injected into the economy .
Figure 3.4 shows what happens when M , the supply of dollars , of total cash balances of dollars in the economy , increases .
The original supply of money , M , intersects with the demand for money and establishes the PPM ( purchasing power of the dollar ) and the price level at distance 0A .
Now , in whatever way , the supply of money increases to M′ .
This means that the aggregate total of cash balances in the economy has increased from M , say $ 100 billion , to M′ , $ 150 billion .
But now people have $ 50 billion surplus in their cash balances , $ 50 billion of excess money over the amount needed in their cash balances at the previous 0A prices level .
Having too much money burning a hole in their pockets , people spend the cash balances , thereby raising individual demand curves and driving up prices .
But as prices rise , people find that their increased aggregate of cash balances is getting less and less excessive , since more and more cash is now needed to accommodate the higher price levels .
Finally , prices rise until PPM has fallen from 0A to 0B .
At these new , higher price levels , the M′ — the new aggregate cash balances — is no longer excessive , and the demand for money has become equilibrated by market forces to the new supply .
The money market — the intersection of the demand and supply of money — is once again cleared , and a new and higher equilibrium price level has been reached .
Note that when people find their cash balances excessive , they try to get rid of them , but since all the money stock is owned by someone , the new M′ can not be gotten rid of in the aggregate ; by driving prices up , however , the demand for money becomes equilibrated to the new supply .
Just as an increased supply of pork drives down prices so as to induce people to buy the new pork production , so an increased supply of dollars drives down the purchasing power of the dollar until people are willing to hold the new dollars in their cash balances .
What if the supply of money , M , decreases , admittedly an occurrence all too rare in the modern world ?
The effect can be seen in Figure 3.5 .
In the unusual case of a fall in the supply of money , then , total cash balances fall , say , from $ 100 billion ( M ) to $ 70 billion ( M′ ) .
When this happens , the people find out that at the old equilibrium price level 0A , aggregate cash balances are not enough to satisfy their cash balance needs .
They experience , therefore , a cash balance shortage .
Trying to increase his cash balance , then , each individual spends less and saves in order to accumulate a larger balance .
As this occurs , demand curves for specific goods fall downward and to the left , and prices therefore fall .
As this happens , the cash balance shortage is alleviated , until finally prices fall low enough until a new and lower equilibrium price level ( 0C ) is established .
Or , alternatively , the PPM is at a new and higher level .
At the new price level of PPM , 0C , the demand for cash balances is equilibrated with the new and decreased supply M′ .
The demand and supply of money is once again cleared .
At the new equilibrium , the decreased money supply is once again just sufficient to perform the cash balance function .
Or , put another way , at the lower money supply people scramble to increase cash balances .
But since the money supply is set and outside their control , they cannot increase the supply of cash balances in the aggregate .
But by spending less and driving down the price level , they increase the value or purchasing power of each dollar , so that real cash balances ( total money supply corrected for changes in purchasing power ) have gone up to offset the drop in the total supply of money .
M might have fallen by $ 30 billion , but the $ 70 billion is now as good as the previous total because each dollar is worth more in real , or purchasing power , terms .
An increase in the supply of money , then , will lower the price or purchasing power of the dollar , and thereby increase the level of prices .
A fall in the money supply will do the opposite , lowering prices and thereby increasing the purchasing power of each dollar .
The other factor of change in the price level is the demand for money .
Figures 3.6 and 3.7 depict what happens when the demand for money changes .
The demand for money , for whatever reason , increases from D to D′ .
This means that , whatever the price level , the amount of money that people in the aggregate wish to keep in their cash balances will increase .
At the old equilibrium price level , 0A , a PPM that previously kept the demand and supply of money equal and cleared the market , the demand for money has now increased and become greater than the supply .
There is now an excess demand for money , or shortage of cash balances , at the old price level .
Since the supply of money is given , the scramble for greater cash balances begins .
People will spend less and save more to add to their cash holdings .
In the aggregate , M , or the total supply of cash balances , is fixed and cannot increase .
But the fall in prices resulting from the decreased spending will alleviate the shortage .
Finally , prices fall ( or PPM rises ) to 0B .
At this new equilibrium price , 0B , there is no longer a shortage of cash balances .
Because of the increased PPM , the old money supply , M , is now enough to satisfy the increased demand for cash balances .
Total cash balances have remained the same in nominal terms , but in real terms , in terms of purchasing power , the $ 100 billion is now worth more and will perform more of the cash balance function .
The market is again cleared , and the money supply and demand brought once more into equilibrium .
Figure 3.7 shows what happens when the demand for money falls .
The demand for money falls from D to D′ .
In other words , whatever the price level , people are now , for whatever reason , willing to hold lower cash balances than they did before .
At the old equilibrium price level , 0A , people now find that they have a surplus of cash balances burning a hole in their pockets .
As they spend the surplus , demand curves for goods rise , driving up prices .
But as prices rise , the total supply of cash balances , M , becomes no longer surplus , for it now must do cash balance work at a higher price level .
Finally , when prices rise ( PPM falls ) to 0B , the surplus of cash balance has disappeared and the demand and supply of money has been equilibrated .
The same money supply , M , is once again satisfactory despite the fall in the demand for money , because the same M must do more cash balance work at the new , higher price level .
So prices , overall , can change for only two reasons :
If the supply of money increases , prices will rise ; if the supply falls , prices will fall .
If the demand for money increases , prices will fall ( PPM rises ) ; if the demand for money declines , prices will rise ( PPM falls ) .
The purchasing power of the dollar varies inversely with the supply of dollars , and directly with the demand .
Overall prices are determined by the same supply - and - demand forces we are all familiar with in individual prices .
Micro and macro are not mysteriously separate worlds ; they are both plain economics and governed by the same laws .
We ’ve now reached the point where gossip sites are forced to debunk rumors being circulated uncritically by the mainstream media .

KURTZ : But if it ’s a “ Lifetime Movie of the Week , ” Lola , then it seems to me that it ’s a very mixed picture from the point of view of a ticket that is trying to get , you know , John McCain and Sarah Palin elected president and vice president of the United States .
In other words , it ’s great to be a celebrity , and she ’ll get a book deal out of it and maybe her own television show , but does it undercut the effort to paint her as a serious , reform - minded governor ?
[ Lola ]
OGUNNAIKE :
And that ’s what she is going to have to guard against .
I mean , McCain has been really good about painting Obama as this lightweight , using the word “ celebrity ” as a pejorative .
They do n’t want to have a boomerang effect .
They do n’t want that to come back on Sarah Palin , and people say , yes , she looks good in a bikini clutching an AK - 47 , but is she equipped to run the country ?
Kurtz , who still thinks Andrew Sullivan ’s “ right - leaning , ” naturally did n’t know enough to correct her .
Exit question : Can anyone explain to me why the crowd at the convention was chanting “ NBC , NBC ” during the part of Palin ’s speech about media smears when it ’s CNN that ’s been the worst offender ?
It was CNN that went after Palin for deserting baby Trig before the pick was even announced ; it was CNN that gave Ed Schultz a platform to call her a bad mother ; it was CNN that casually mentioned the rumor about Bristol Palin being Trig ’s real mother , earning them an on -air rebuke from Bill Bennett ; it was CNN that thought it ’d be fun to air a clip by an Obama supporter goofing on McCain for allegedly checking Palin out at the podium ; and of course , now it ’s CNN that ’s taken by the bikini ‘ shop .
Oh , and of course it ’s CNN that ’s complained the loudest about GOP criticism of the media .
So I say again , why is MSNBC bearing the brunt of conservative animosity ?
Is it just a sort of lifetime achievement award for newly demoted demagogue Edward R. Olbermann ?

The telecommunications industry deputy ombudsman says phone and internet service providers need to give clear information to potential customers .
The ombudsman 's office received around 150,000 complaints in the last financial year , almost 50 per cent more than in the previous year .
Just under 14,000 complaints were about mobile phone premium services , with many people saying they had not asked for them or were not able to unsubscribe .
Deputy ombudsman Simon Cleary says clear information about service plans is important .
" It seems to us that the information that consumers are given before they enter into the subscription services has to be clear , " he said .
" It 's a fundamental principle .
[ It ] has to be clear so that consumers can make informed decisions about what they 're purchasing . "
The Communications Alliance says phone and internet service providers are trying to improve the service they offer to customers .
The chief executive of the Alliance , Anne Hurley , says she is not surprised by the figures .
" They 're not totally unexpected , although disappointing , because we 've had research recently which shows that communications services are increasingly viewed as being essential to people 's lives .
So there 's a greater degree of expectation , " she said .
" As an industry , our challenge is to manage these rising expectations and to find ways to respond so that customer satisfaction is improved . "

On Databases
Databases come in many forms .
The simplest definition of a database is any system of storing , organizing , and retrieving data .
With this definition , things like memory , hard drives , file systems , files on those file systems ( stored in plain text , tab - delimited , XML , JSON , or even BDB formats ) , and even applications like MySQL , PostgreSQL , and Oracle are considered databases .
Databases allow users to :
Store Data
Organize Data
Retrieve Data
It is important to keep a broad perspective on what data and databases really are so that you can always choose the best solution for your particular problem .
The SQL databases ( MySQL , PostgreSQL , Oracle , and others ) are remarkable because of the flexibility and performance they provide .
In my work , I look to them first when developing an application , with an eye towards getting the data model right before optimization .
Once the application is solid , and once I fully understand what parts of the data system are too slow or fast enough , then I can start building my own database on top of the file system or other existing technologies that will give me the kind of performance I need .
PostgreSQL : Free , BSD - licensed popular database .
http://postgresql.org/
http://postgresql.org/
MySQL : Free , GPL - licensed popular database .
http://mysql.org
http://mysql.org
Oracle : Commercial industrial database .
http://oracle.com
http://oracle.com
SQL Server : Microsoft ’s commercial database .
http://www.microsoft.com/SQL/default.mspx
Among the SQL databases , which one is best ?
There are many criteria I use to evaluate SQL databases , and the one I pay attention to most is how they comply ( if at all ) with the ACID model .
And given the technical merits of the various SQL databases , I consistently choose PostgreSQL above all other SQL databases when given a choice .
Allow me to explain why .
The ACID Model
ACID is an acronym , standing for the four words Atomicity , Consistency , Isolation , and Durability .
These are fancy words for some very basic and essential concepts .
Atomicity means that you either do all of the changes you want , or none of them , without leaving the database in some weird in - between state .
When you take into account catastrophes like power failures or corruption , atomicity is n’t as simple as it first seems .
Consistency means that any state of the database will be internally consistent with the rules that constrain the data .
That is , if you have a table with a primary key , then that table will not contain any violations of the primary key constraints after any transaction .
Isolation means that you can be modifying many different parts of the database at the same time without affecting each other .
( As a higher feature , there is Serialization , which requires that transactions occur one after the other , or at least the results of transactions . )
Durability means that once a transaction completes , it is never lost , ever .
Atomicity : All or nothing
Consistency : Rules kept
Isolation : No partials seen
Durability : Does n’t disappear
ACID compliance is n’t rocket science , but it is n’t trivial either .
These requirements form a minimum standard absolutely necessary to provide a database for a reasonable application .
That is , if you ca n’t guarantee these things , then the users of your application are going to be frustrated since they assume , naturally , that the ACID model is followed .
And if the users of the application get frustrated , then the developers of the application will get frustrated as they try to comply with the user ’s expectations .
A lot of frustration can be avoided if the database simply complies with the principles of the ACID model .
If the database gets it right , then the rest of the application will have no problem getting it right as well .
Our users will be happy since their expectations of ACID compliance will be met .
Remember : Users expect ACID !
What Violating the ACID Model Looks Like
To consider the importance of the ACID model , let ’s examine , briefly , what happens when the model is violated .
When Atomicity is n’t adhered to , users will see their data partially committed .
For instance , they might find their online profile only partially modified , or their bank transfer partially transferred .
This is , of course , devastating to the unwary user .
When Consistency is violated , the rules that the data should follow are n’t adhered to .
Perhaps the number of friends shown does n’t match the friends they actually have in a social networking application .
Or perhaps they see their bank balance does n’t match what the numbers add up to .
Or worse , perhaps your order system is counting orders that do n’t even exist and not counting orders that do .
When Isolation is n’t guaranteed , they will either have to use a system where only one person can change something at a time , locking out all others , or they will see inconsistencies throughout the world of data , inconsistencies resulting from transactions that are in progress elsewhere .
This will make the data unreliable just like violating Atomicity or Consistency .
A bank user , for instance , will believe their transfer of funds was successful when in reality their money was simultaneously being withdrawn by another transaction .
When Durability is lost , then users will never know if their transaction really went through , and wo n’t mysteriously disappear down the road with all the trouble that entails .
I am sure we have all had experiences dealing with data systems that did n’t follow the ACID model .
I remember the days when you had to save your files frequently , and even then you still were n’t ensured that all of your data would be properly saved .
I also recall applications that would make partial changes , or incomplete changes , and expose these inconsistent states to the user .
In today ’s world , writing applications with faults like the above is simply inexcusable .
There are too many tools out there that are readily available that make writing ACID compliant systems easy .
One of those tools , probably the most popular of all , is the SQL database .
Satisfying ACID with Transactions
The principle way that databases comply with ACID requirements is through the concept of transactions .
Ideally , each transaction would occur in an instant , updating the database according to the state of the database at that moment .
In reality , this is n’t possible .
It takes time to accumulate the data and apply the changes .
Typical transaction SQL commands :
BEGIN : Start a new transaction
COMMIT : Commit the transaction
ROLLBACK : Roll back the transaction in progress
Since multiple sessions can each be creating and applying a transaction simultaneously , special precautions have to be taken to ensure that the data that each transaction “ sees ” is consistent , and that the effects of each transaction appear all together or not at all .
Special care is also taken to ensure that when a transaction is committed , the database will be put in a state where catastrophic events will not leave the transaction partially committed .
Contrary to popular belief , there are a variety of ways that databases support transactions .
It is well worth the time to read and understand PostgreSQL ’s two levels of transaction isolation and the four possible isolation levels in Section 12.2 of the PostgreSQL documentation .
Note that some of the inferior levels of transaction isolation violate some extreme cases of ACID compliance for the sake of performance .
These edge cases can be properly handled with appropriate use of row - locking techniques .
Row - locking is an issue beyond this article .
Keep in mind that the levels of transaction isolation are only what appear to users of the database .
Inside the database , there is a remarkable variety of methods on actually implementing transactions .
Consider that while you are in a transaction , making changes to the database , every other transaction has to see one version of the database while you see another .
In effect , you have to have copies of some of the data lying around somewhere .
Queries to that data have to know which version of the data to retrieve the copy , the original , or the modified version ( and which modified version ? )
Changes to the data have to go somewhere the original , a copy , or some modified version ( again , which ? )
Answering these questions leads to the various implementations of transactions in ACID compliant databases .
For the purposes of this article , I will examine only two : Oracle ’s and PostgreSQL ’s implementations .
If you are only familiar with Oracle , then hopefully you will learn something new and fascinating as you investigate PostgreSQL ’s method .
The Connecticut Supreme Court has just issued its ruling that gays may marry !
CT becomes the third state after Massachusetts and California to issue same - sex marriage rights .
" Citing the equal protection clause of the state constitution , the justices ruled that civil unions were discriminatory .
In a 4 - 3 decision released at 11:30 a.m. , the majority wrote that the state 's " understanding of marriage must yield to a more contemporary appreciation of the rights entitled to constitutional protection . "
" Interpreting our state constitutional provisions in accordance with firmly established equal protection principles leads inevitably to the conclusion that gay persons are entitled to marry the otherwise qualified same sex partner of their choice , " the majority wrote .
" To decide otherwise would require us to apply one set of constitutional principles to gay persons and another to all others . "
Unsatisfied with the civil unions approved by the legislature in 2005 , eight same - sex couples had brought the case , Kerrigan v. the state Commissioner of Public Health , after they were denied marriage licenses in 2004 by the Madison town clerk , who was following instructions issued by the state attorney general 's office .
The state , arguing that civil unions already provide all the rights and protections of marriage , prevailed in a Superior Court ruling in July 2006 .
The couples appealed the ruling to the Supreme Court , which heard three hours of arguments on the case in May 2007 .
Attorney Bennett Klein , arguing on behalf of the couples , told the court that civil unions were a " less prestigious , less advantageous institution . "

17 Year Old Builds Bradley GT Into Electric Car
Image : benteen
There are some electric conversions that are just too interesting to pass up .
We ’ve talked about a 16 year old who built his own electric truck and the EcoModder co-founder ’s $ 672 electric car , but we ’ve yet to look at a car like this one .
It ’s not the car in the picture ( the original story did not come with any images ) , but it ’s the same model of kit car , the Bradley GT .
For decades ( the pictured GT is a ’ 71 ) the Bradley GT has been one of the standbys of kit car builders .
Not only is it light and cheap , but it looks pretty good .
It was no doubt this combination that led Lucas Laborde to choose the Bradley GT II as the basis for his electric car .
It was purchased off of Ebay with a few thousand miles on the original VW engine , but all of that was promptly stripped out to make way for an all electric drivetrain .
The specs on the car are a little sketchy , but here ’s what the original article has to say about the range and top speed :
The car uses the Bradley ’s original transmission , a manual four - speed , but the clutch is no longer needed to change gears .
The car has a top speed of about 45 mphÂ — plenty fast for in - town commuting and lots of low - end torque .
The motor does n’t make any sound , but Laborde inadvertently makes the rear tires chirp when he steps on the accelerator a little too hard while backing the car out of his father ’s shop .
“ It has a lot of power , ” he says sheepishly .
These are n’t overly impressive , but considering the low cost of the conversion ( the electric parts only cost an additional $ 5,700 ) and the low weight of the donor vehicle , they seem fitting .
Of course , the most important thing is that the car fits Laborde ’s needs and will be yet another rolling advertisement for electric cars .

10:51 : Rep. Jerry Nadler ( D - NY - 8 ) reviewing the lists of possible offenses that are excesses of the Executive Branch .
States this is not a waste of time .
10:53 : Rep. Mike Pence ( R - IN - 6 ) again reflects that this is not a hearing on “ impeachment . ”
Does this take us down the road of criminalizing American politics ?
Rep .
Pence sees no reason for impeachment .
Bush not accused of treason or bribery , so that leaves high crimes and misdemeanors .
Rep. Pence say Rep. Kucinich is “ dead wrong . ”
# 1 : 8 a.m. Dennis Kucinich kicks off the day on C - Span 1 while I make my first cup of coffee .
8:07 : Q : On Iraq , was the Administration lying or honestly wrong ?
A : Either way it ’s impeachable after the deaths of over 4000 U.S. soldiers
8:09 : A : My presentation will focus closely on what Congress was told about Iraq … on representations that were untrue at the time they were told to Congress .
Now everyone knows Iraq had no WMD ’s , no ties to Al Qaeda .
8:10 : Q : Only months left – why push impeachment ?
A : Setting precedent for future president .
Disastrous consequences .
Central purpose was to grab Iraq ’s oil – our troops are there to get $ 5 / gal gasoline from our people .
What ’s this all about ?
8:11 Q ( Auburndale Republican ) : I voted for Bush twice and I ’m sorry about it .
I thank you for impeachment .
8:12 : Q : Are you in touch with the Speaker ?
A : She ’s busy ; I talk to her staff and tell them everything I ’m doing .
Q : Why does she oppose impeachment ?
A : Ask her .
She took it off the table in 2006 .
But she allowed this hearing which is good .
This is n’t about Pelosi but about Bush .
She ’s done her best – other Members oppose impeachment .
8:15 : Q : Read Phillippe Sands ’ book – Bush lied on purpose .
A : I wrote a report in 2006 exposing lies .
We want to trust our President .
There has to be accountability – Founding Fathers only gave us impeachment .
8:16 : Q ( Random Lake WI ) : High crimes – I see every day .
We ’ve called 50 million children ( abortion ) , Waco , Saddam paying terrorists .
No attacks in US for 6 years because Bush went into Iraq .
A : Iraq had nothing to do with 9/11 .
We went to war against innocent people .
8:18 : Q ( Essex CT ) : Bush says he got bad info but never said where he got it – who gave it ?
Doug Feith ?
Netanyahu and Sharon ?
After 9/11 FBI caught 5 dancing Israelis – said they were sent to “ record the event . ”
How did they know “ the event ” ?
A : Do n’t know about the latter , just the former .
Senate Intelligence Committee report is damning to administration – they had plenty of info that the what they told Congress was n’t true .
8:21 : Q : What do other Members say ?
Some voted for Iraq because they honestly believed Bush .
There has been a steady reappraisal .
Over 4,127 troops have died , tens of thousands injured , over a million innocent Iraqis , $ 3 trillion cost , oil prices going up – oil was a central reason why we went to Iraq – rising oil price , rising food price .
Dimunition of civil liberties – all because a lie was told , that Iraq was an imminent offense .
I ca n’t think of a graver offense because of all the consequences .
8:23 Q ( Anniston AL Republican ) : Should Democratic leadership be impeached too for stupidity ?
A : Congress does have responsibility – for war powers .
But we never declared war .
We only relied on what the President told Congress .
When driving , accidental killing is manslaughter – a serious crime .
If it was just a mistake , look at the gravity – 1 million dead people in Iraq .
There must be accountability .
You ca n’t say “ gee we made a mistake . ”
They knew better and there must be consequences .
8:25 Q ( Walton NY Democrat ) : What was Bush ’s motivation ?
Is there a money trail ?
A : Congress ca n’t crack veil of secrecy over Cheney ’s meetings with oil companies – maps of Iraq – consensus that access to oil would be critical .
Link between that meeting and military action later on .
But just based on what ’s on the record we can impeach .
Look at consequences – money for health care , jobs , environment , alternative energy – money ’s not there because money ’s going into war .
Unless we find out the truth we ’ll never be free of the consequences .
8:27 Q : Cheney ?
A : I introduced H.Res.333 against Cheney because of his statements on nuclear weapons .
I thought it would be better to remove him first .
This is about accountability to history .
Our Constitution is at risk .
If our President is no longer accountable , we ’ve set the stage for more wars , a government that ’s about empire – not the urgent problems at home .
8:29 Q ( NYC Republican ) : I ’m a former prosecutor .
I blew the whistle on airport security in 1999 .
I made a big arrest for drug smuggling .
I reported it and was threatened by my supervisor to keep my mouth shut .
They wanted me to perjure .
I was terminated and filed a lawsuit that has lasted 9 years .
A : Call my office so I can investigate .
Thank you for standing up .
8:31 : This administration is getting ready to attack Iran and plunge us into a 4 - front war .
Very dangerous for America – for our troops in the field , for our economy .
We ca n’t sustain this – we have to look to our Constitution to rein this in .
There has to be consequences for this President ’s insistence on passing the AUMF .
8:32 Q : Will War Powers
Act be changed ?
A : Proposed changes would take more power from Congress .
Founding Fathers were clear – power for warmaking given to Congress , not President .
We need to strengthen Congress ’ role .
This is very serious – we see consequences in Iraq .
I 'm a Researcher , Designer and Developer in the areas of Musical Instruments and Medical Devices .
I 'm intensely curious about the nature of media , perception , communication and reality .

Protesters gather on Wall St. amid historic White House meeting Mike Sheehan and David Edwards
Published : Thursday September 25 , 2008
Print This Email This President George W. Bush conducted a historic meeting in the White House today with members of his cabinet , congressional leaders and the top two presidential candidates to discuss a Wall Street bailout package that Bush said last night was " aimed at preserving America 's overall economy . "
As the president met with Democratic nominee Sen. Barack Obama ( D - IL ) and GOP hopeful Sen. John McCain ( R - AZ ) -- who claims to have suspended his campaign to help move the bailout discussion forward -- an informal , loosely organized protest made up of ordinary people angry over the potential cost of the bailout to taxpayers gathered on Wall Street itself with banners , placards and signs .
" By having this protest ... we can show these thieves that we 're not their suckers , " read an anonymous email message posted on a New York media group 's website .
" There is no agenda , no leaders , no organizing group , nothing to endorse other than we are not going to pay ! "
As the White House meeting was still ongoing , a key Senate Republican emerged to speak to reporters , saying that there was no deal as of yet .
Sen. Richard Shelby ( R - AL ) had criticized the plan even before the meeting .
" We did not get into this situation in a matter of days , and we are not going to fix it in a matter of days , " said Shelby in a statement he released earlier in the day .
" Proponents of the Paulson plan are telling the American people we can solve this problem with a single bill .
I do n't believe that is credible . "
Both McCain and Obama left the meeting , neither making statements or taking questions .
Obama reportedly was to hold a press conference from his hotel later , and the Politico site said both McCain and Obama would appear on all three major networks tonight .
There was still no official word from the McCain camp as to whether or not the Arizona senator would show up for the first presidential nominee debate tomorrow in Oxford , Mississippi .
The Obama campaign has suggested that were McCain to follow through with his word and not appear tomorrow , the Illinois Democrat would conduct a townhall - style meeting on his own at the debate locale .

St. Petersburg Times ( Editorial ) “ Campaign of lies disgraces McCain ” McCain ’s straight talk has become a toxic mix of lies and double - speak .
It is leaving a permanent stain on his reputation for integrity , and it is a short - term strategy that eventually will backfire with the very types of independent - thinking voters that were so attracted to him .
Atlanta Journal Constitution ( Jay Bookman )
The volume and audacity of lies pouring from the McCain campaign is startling and even historic …
That ’s really something , lying straight out about a FactCheck group , knowing that you ’re going to get caught but not giving a damn about it .
With stuff like this , the McCain camp has cut any remaining tethers to reality and integrity and is now floating wherever the winds of illusion and whimsy may take them .
It ’s quite remarkable , and quite insulting to the intelligence of the American people .
Pittsburg Post Gazette ( Tony Norman )
Where have you gone , John McCain ?
You once said you ’d rather lose an election than lose a war .
Is it worth winning an election if it means forfeiting your soul on the altar of political expediency ?
… Where is the honor in reciting lies for something as transient as political advantage ?
What are we as voters supposed to make of political ads that accuse Barack Obama of advocating sex education for kindergartners ?…
Despite the intellectually dishonest maneuvering of your campaign , many Americans admire you , John McCain .
Before you embraced the darkness , I was among those who disagreed with your politics , but considered you honorable .
Now it ’s hard to look at you without seeing the scoundrels who made you what you are today .
Kansas City Star ( Barb Shelly ) McCain stoops to deception , distortion : Maybe you ’ve seen it .
The campaign ad cites the authoritative journal Education Week to claim that Democrat Barack Obama has been missing in action on education reform …
Shamelessly misleading the public ?
… These are old tricks we ’ve been seeing in local elections for years .
Distort .
Twist .
Deceive .
Damage .
And the winning candidate drags a load of public contempt into office .
I had hoped for better from McCain … John McCain may win the presidency this way , but he will lose the respect he has acquired over the years .
Boston Globe ( Scot Lehigh ) Pretzel logic from the McCain campaign :
Here ’s the question voters should be asking themselves this week : Just how stupid does the McCain - Palin campaign think I am ?
The answer : Dumb enough to hoodwink with charges so contrived and cynical they make your teeth ache…
As the nonpartisan campaign watchdog FactCheck.org has made clear , this is a thoroughly dishonest ad [ Kindergarten ] .
No matter .
The McCain campaign has shown it ’s ready and willing to say preposterous things to win .
Washington Post ( David Ignatius )
Stopping at nothing to win :
Thinking about the Palin choice , you begin to ponder other moves McCain has made on the road to winning the Republican nomination .
McCain was right a few years ago to warn that Bush ’s tax cuts would have potentially ruinous fiscal consequences ; now he favors extending the cuts that have produced a crisis of debt and deficit .
Why did he switch his position , other than political opportunism ?
…
In May 2006 , after McCain had courted the Rev. Jerry Falwell in an effort to win conservative support , I asked him if he was bending his principles for the sake of winning .
“ I do n’t want it that badly , ” McCain answered .
“ I will continue to do what is right …
If that means I ca n’t get the Republican nomination , fine .
I ’ve had a happy life .
The worst thing I can do is sell my soul to the devil . ”
He was right .
Washington Post ( Eugene Robinson ) The Scream Machine :
There was a time when Republicans campaigned on their ideas , programs and values .
This year — lacking ideas , programs or values — John McCain and Sarah Palin are running for the White House on an elaborate fictional narrative of victimhood … Creating the false impression that Democrats and journalists are unfairly attacking Palin serves another purpose as well :
It helps create the impression that legitimate and necessary questions about her record — such as her one - time support for the Bridge to Nowhere or her history of seeking the congressional earmarks she now claims to reject — are somehow out of bounds .
Chicago Tribune ( Steve Chapman )
To McCain the truth is expandable : McCain has concluded that a fact - based case about Obama is n’t enough to prevail in November .
So he has chosen to smear his opponent with ridiculous claims that he thinks the American people are gullible enough to believe .
He has charged repeatedly that his opponent is willing to lose a war to win an election .
What ’s McCain willing to lose to become president ?
Nothing so consequential as a war .
Just his soul .
Chicago Tribune ( Frank James )
“ McCain plays dirty on Obama & sex -ed ”
So the McCain ad , in the way it contorts the truth , is pretty shocking from a candidate who has promised to bring change and reform to Washington , a man who ’s urging Americans to live for a cause larger than themselves .
This is an old - fashioned , unreconstructed politics whose goal , first and foremost , is to get the candidate elected , the truth be damned .
McCain has said he ’d rather lose a campaign than lose a war .
But it appears from this ad he ’d rather lose any purchase he has on straight - talk than lose this presidential election .
Chicago Tribune ( Eric Zorn ) ` Sex ed’ ad educates us on the character of John McCain :
The surprise came at the end : I ’m John McCain and I approved this message .
With that infamous admission , McCain surrendered his integrity and signaled a willingness to say or do anything to get elected …
We used to expect better from John McCain .
No longer .
TIME ( Joe Klein ) : A new rule here : Rather than do the McCain campaign ’s bidding by wasting space on Senator Honor ’s daily lies and bilge–his constant attempts to divert attention from substantive issues –I ’m going to assume that others will spend more than enough time on the sewage that Steve Schmidt is shoveling and , from now on , try to stick to the issues .
TIME (
Joe Klein ) Apology Not Accepted : he is responsible for one of the sleaziest ads I ’ve ever seen in presidential politics , so sleazy that I wo n’t abet its spread by linking to it , but here ’s the McClatchy fact check ..
I just ca n’t wait for the moment when John McCain–contrite and suddenly honorable again in victory or defeat–talks about how things got a little out of control in the passion of the moment .
Talk about putting lipstick on a pig .
TIME ( Joe Klein ) Another McCain Flip Flop : Army Times , which is not–last time I checked –a radical left wing publication , takes John McCain to task for changing his position on the Future Combat Systems program .
This is yet another example of how running for President has driven McCain off the deep end .
In the past , he was one of the more consistent voices against foolish Pentagon weapon systems .
Here ’s a program that McCain previously wanted to end .
Then Obama says he wants to slow - walk it …and McCain–reflexively , it appears , and unable to recall that he previously opposed it –decides to support it .
New York Times ( Paul Krugman ) Blizzard of Lies : I ’m talking , instead , about the relationship between the character of a campaign and that of the administration that follows .
Thus , the deceptive and dishonest 2000 Bush - Cheney campaign provided an all - too - revealing preview of things to come …
And now the team that hopes to form the next administration is running a campaign that makes Bush - Cheney 2000 look like something out of a civics class .
What does that say about how that team would run the country ?
What it says , I ’d argue , is that the Obama campaign is wrong to suggest that a McCain - Palin administration would just be a continuation of Bush - Cheney .
If the way John McCain and Sarah Palin are campaigning is any indication , it would be much , much worse .
New York Times ( Editorial ) :
The most disheartening aspect of a scurrilous Republican ad falsely accusing Barack Obama of promoting sex education for kindergarten children is its closing line : “ I ’m John McCain , and I approved this message . ”
This from that straight - talker of yore , who fervidly denounced the 2004 Bush campaign ’s Swift Boat character attacks on John Kerry ’s military record .
What a difference four years makes , especially after Mr. McCain secured the nomination by hiring some of the same low - blow artists from the Bush campaign .
New York Times ( Larry Rohter ) :
The advertisement [ “ Disrespectful ” ] is the latest in a number that resort to a dubious disregard for the facts .
The nonpartisan political analysis group Factcheck.org has already criticized “ Disrespectful ” as “ particularly egregious , ” saying that it “ goes down new paths of deception , ” and is “ peddling false quotes . ”
New York Times ( Michael Cooper and Jim Rutenberg ) McCain Barbs Stirring Outcry as Distortions : Mr. McCain came into the race promoting himself as a truth teller and has long publicly deplored the kinds of negative tactics that helped sink his candidacy in the Republican primaries in 2000 .
But his strategy now reflects a calculation advisers made this summer — over the strenuous objections of some longtime hands who helped him build his “ Straight Talk ” image — to shift the campaign more toward disqualifying Mr. Obama in the eyes of voters .
ABC News - Political Punch ( Jake Tapper ) :
One can only imagine what the John McCain of 2004 – who called the Swift Boat Veterans for Truth ads “ dishonest and dishonorable ” – would say about this ad… I suppose one could twist this stuff any way you want if your only point is to make an inflammatory charge .
And win an election …
The New York Times ’ “ Checkpoint ” ( “ Ad on Sex Education Distorts Obama Policy “ ) , Factcheck.org ( “ Obama , contrary to the ad ’s insinuation , does not support explicit sex education for kindergarteners ” ) and the Washington Post ’s Fact Checker ( “ McCain ’s ‘ Education ’ Spot Is Dishonest , Deceptive “ ) say the ad is a gross distortion .
I agree — in both senses of the word “ gross . ”
AP ( Charles Babington ) : The “ Straight Talk Express ” has detoured into doublespeak .
Republican presidential nominee John McCain , a self - proclaimed tell - it - like - it - is maverick , keeps saying his running mate , Sarah Palin , killed the federally funded Bridge to Nowhere when , in fact , she pulled her support only after the project became a political embarrassment .
He said Friday that Palin never asked for money for lawmakers ’ pet projects as Alaska governor , even though she has sought nearly $ 200 million in earmarks this year .
He says Obama would raise nearly everyone ’s taxes , when independent groups say 80 percent of families would get tax cuts instead .
KABUL
Solid waste produced by the health - care system in Kabul and other major cities is not being properly managed and poses a serious public health risk , according to health experts .
Listen to the audio report in Dari and Pashto
Medical waste - including used needles and syringes , soiled dressings , body parts , diagnostic samples , blood , chemicals , pharmaceuticals and medical devices - is lying in open rubbish dumps near hospitals in urban areas .
Tonnes of vaccination waste resulting from an exercise to immunise about 1.6 million children against polio on 21 - 23 September have been thrown away in the open , health workers said .
Kabul Municipality has said it has little experience of safe waste disposal and few tools with which to separate and dispose of medical waste .
" It is the responsibility of hospitals and the Ministry of Public Health to safely dispose of medical waste , " Nisar Ahmad Habibi Ghori , director of Kabul Municipality 's waste management department , told IRIN .
Kabul is reeling under increasing mountains of rubbish with waste management apparently slipping out of control .
Lack of regulation
Afghanistan does not have bylaws on the safe management of medical waste , and over 60 public and private hospitals in Kabul do not have incinerators or other equipment to deal with the problem .
" We have instructed government hospitals to burn medical waste … but we have problems with private hospitals , " said Ahmad Shah Shokohmand , director of the health services department at the Ministry of Public Health ( MoPH ) .
At least two government hospitals in Kabul have dumped medical waste into open dustbins where poor children often scavenge for food and reusable items .
" We burn nothing .
We throw all sorts of waste into the rubbish bin or outside , " said an official at Jamhuryat hospital on condition of anonymity .
Cleaners at the Indira Gandhi Child Hospital also said they put medical waste into ordinary rubbish bins .

Infection risk
Some medical waste is classified as infectious or biohazardous and could potentially lead to the spread of infectious diseases , according to the UN World Health Organization ( WHO ) .
Epidemiological studies conducted by WHO showed that a person who experiences one needle stick injury - from a needle used on an infected patient - entails risks of 30 percent , 1.8 percent , and 0.3 percent of becoming infected with hepatitis B and C viruses and HIV / AIDS respectively .
At least seven children involved in scavenging in Herat Province , western Afghanistan , have been infected by hepatitis B , syphilis and suspected cases of HIV , the Children Protection Action Network ( C - PAN ) reported .
" These children were scavenging among hospital waste for food and usable items , " Mohammad Siddiq Mir , an official at C - PAN in Herat , told IRIN , adding that the children had collected contaminated needles , serum bags and bandages .
Officials at Kabul Municipality also reported at least two suspected cases of hepatitis B among city cleaners in September .

From Forbes comes the story of a report on the costs of marijuana prohibition .
Dr. Jeffrey Miron , visiting professor of economics at Harvard University , estimates that replacing marijuana prohibition with a system of taxation and regulation similar to that used for alcoholic beverages would produce combined savings and tax revenues of between $ 10 billion and $ 14 billion per year .
— Costs of Marijuana Prohibition
Most interesting is the fact that Milton Friedman and over 500 other economists have endorsed the report and its findings .
We therefore urge the country to commence an open and honest debate about marijuana prohibition .
We believe such a debate will favor a regime in which marijuana is legal but taxed and regulated like other goods .
At a minimum , this debate will force advocates of current policy to show that prohibition has benefits sufficient to justify the cost to taxpayers , foregone tax revenues , and numerous ancillary consequences that result from marijuana prohibition .
— Costs of Marijuana Prohibition
There is no logical basis for the prohibition of marijuana .
$ 7.7 billion is a lot of money , but that is one of the lesser evils .
Our failure to successfully enforce these laws is responsible for the deaths of thousands of people in Colombia .
I have n’t even included the harm to young people .
It ’s absolutely disgraceful to think of picking up a 22 - year - old for smoking pot .
More disgraceful is the denial of marijuana for medical purposes .
— Milton Friedman
It ’s about time we had some serious debate on this issue .
It ’s easy to show that marijuana is far less harmful than either alcohol or tobacco , two products which are legal .
But will we have any real thoughtful , informed debate ?
AlphaPatriot doubts “ that this will even set off any serious debate given the mindset of those driving the War on Drugs , but it should . ’
Indeed .

The cracker madness does n’t seem to come to an end , so I may as well post another recipe .
These are the crunchiest , crispiest crackers I ’ve managed to produce so far , and their secret ingredient is quite surprising : finely ground rolled oats !
I added a few dried herbs for a new flavor , but the texture is definitely what most impressed me when these came out of the oven .
I imagine oat flour can be bought commercially as well , but grinding rolled oats does the trick just fine .
I first learned about this method from a cookbook I checked out from the library a while back , Dreena Burton ’s The Everyday Vegan .
The oat cracker dough :
2 dl rolled oats , finely ground
1 and 1/4 dl wheat flour
3/4 dl nutritional yeast
1/2 teaspoon baking soda
3/4 teaspoon salt
1/2 teaspoon dried thyme
1/2 teaspoon dried marjoram
1 teaspoon dried basil
1/3 teaspoon cayenne pepper ( or to taste )
1/2 teaspoon turmeric ( for color )
1 dl water
2 tablespoons olive oil
1 tablespoon lemon juice
1 teaspoon Dijon mustard
3 cloves garlic , crushed
I set the oven to 175 degrees Celsius , and proceeded to make the crackers exactly like the last time .
The only thing I had to do differently was to ground the oats , which I did in our mini food processor .
I processed them until they were fine , much like whole wheat flour .
I combined water , olive oil , lemon juice , mustard , and garlic , and placed the resulting wet mix in the fridge .
Then I mixed the rest of the ingredients in a bowl , and covered a baking sheet with parchment paper .
When the oven was ready , I added the fridge - cold wet mix to the dry mix bowl , stirred with a fork until combined , and rolled it out on the baking parchment with the help of a little bit of extra flour .
I cut the cookies with a pastry wheel and baked them for 20 minutes , until nicely browned and crispy .

TrekMovie previously reported that JJ Abrams has completed a first rough cut of his Star Trek movie and now it appears that he is showing it off .
Jay and Silent Bob Strike Back director Kevin Smith was a guest on KROQ ’s Kevin and Bean show this morning and the subject of the new Star Trek movie came up with Smith giving a positive review of the movie , but in a roundabout way .
Kevin talks about what he can’t talk about
Although it was never said explicitly , it appears Kevin Smith was given an early viewing of Star Trek , but he was very much trying to deny that he had , or at least not come out and say anything that would break the ‘ cone of silence ’ around JJ Abrams ultra -secret project .
Early in the show when Kevin joined in , one of the hosts said " somebody ’s seen the new Star Trek movie , I understand ? "
At which point Smith sardonically dismissed the question .
Then much later in the show , after recounting his thoughts on his early screening of the Watchmen movie , Smith was asked if he has seen anything else .
Here is the exchange :
— — — — ——
Host :
So thumbs up on The Watchmen , what else you got ?
Smith : I saw a movie last night that I can not talk about .
Host :
Was it good ?
Smith :
It was phenomenal .
Host :
Any stars , any break out stars , and do they trek ?
Smith :
The stars absolutely trek in this film .
It is fantastic .
Anybody who was worried does n’t need to be worried –about this film I cannot talk about …
It was in very capable hands .
The director did a phenomenal job –the director and his crew .
Top notch cast and the guy that plays the lead is an instant star .
That dude is going to be so famous .
He is so wonderful .
He picked up a role that I would say is pretty challenging for someone to step into the shoes of , because it is a role that has been played before many times by the same guy .
Host : How do you out Shatner , Shatner ?
Smith : I do n’t know what you are talking about .
Host : I was just saying that as an expression .
Smith :
Yes , absolutely , in a world of expressions , I would agree with that …I am so not good with this game , you are going to bury me man .
Host :
We had you on before The Dark Knight and I remember asking you if you could direct a movie like Dark Knight and you said ‘ hell no ’ it was so far out of your sphere … but I bring that up to preface this .
Let ’s say a franchise like Star Trek , not that you have seen the movie or we are talking about the movie , but we are talking about it for example .
That is something that is so dangerous to attempt .
Is that the kind of project you would like to do ?
Would you like to be the guy who gets to do a movie like that ?
Smith : I would not like to be the guy .
In the case of something like Star Trek , it would take a really insanely talented filmmaker –storyteller .
Like in the case of Star Trek , JJ Abrams .
So leave it to the people who are best equipped for it .
I am just the guy who should be watching those movies .

Bonus Abrams Smith video : Smith hosts dinner with JJ and Luke Skywalker
Three years ago Kevin Smith stepped in for regular host Jon Favreau and guest - hosted the IFC show Dinner For Five , with guests Jason Lee , Stan Lee , Mark Hamill and JJ Abrams .
This was while Abrams was making Mission : Impossible : III and before it was announced he would be making Star Trek .
The group discuss Alias , MI : III , Tom Cruise , Star Wars , Chasing Amy , Comics , screenwriting , and more .
The entire episode is available on YouTube , check it out below .
With Rudy ’s speech , to riff on the brilliance of the immortal Molly Ivins , I think I preferred this speech in the original German .
On a more serious note , I think it will eventually be clear to people that the Republicans made a major mistake putting Rudy in prime time .
Given the state of the campaign , they have to take the fight to Obama .
But you need to choose the right person .
Rudy comes across as curdled and angry .
Great for rousing diehards .
But I do n’t see this speech working with undecideds .
10:27 PM … What ’s weird is that Rudy seems to get genuinely angrier the longer the speech goes on .
I will admit he ’s got the Joseph Goebbels hand gestures down pat .
Queensland state Labor MP Ronan
Lee says he has defected to the Greens because the Government has ignored his concerns about the environment .
Mr Lee says he had a tense conversation with the Premier Anna Bligh today when he told her he was resigning from the ALP to join the Greens .
" The message I gave to her on the phone today was you 've got to green up your government , " he said .
Mr Lee will give up a position as a parliamentary secretary to become the first Greens MP in the Queensland Parliament .
His opposition to Labor policies like building the proposed Traveston Crossing Dam near Gympie was behind his decision to jump ship from the Government .
" We can do much better than that here in Queensland , " he said .
" I think that my future as someone who wants to make positive change for my community and on the environment is with a wonderful party like the Queensland Greens . "
Ms Bligh says one MP 's defection does not mean her Government is in crisis .
" We are a strong Government with a strong majority and we are going to get on with the business of governing Queensland , " she said .
She says the people who got Mr Lee elected have a right to feel betrayed .
Leonard Pitts is one of the few newspaper columnists whose writing I consistently enjoy reading , even when I disagree with it .
In his October 19 column “ Fear Has Profoundly Changed Us , ” Pitts gives us a beautifully crafted statement on a supremely important subject : the kind of country the United States of America has become .
Recalling the aftermath of 9/11 , he observes that the fear that “ had cut through us like a hot poker ” soon changed ; it “ became instead a low - grade fever , ambient noise , wallpaper , something you feel without feeling , hear without hearing , see without seeing . ”
We hardly noticed what was happening to us .
Then you look up one day and realize how profoundly that fear has changed your world .
People are imprisoned without charges or access to attorneys , and it ’s routine .
People are surveilled , their reading habits studied , their telephone usage logged , and it ’s commonplace .
People , including children , end up on a secret list of those who are not allowed to fly , nobody will tell you why , there is no appeal , and it ’s ordinary .
We swallow lies like candy , nod sagely at babblespeak , and it ’s unexceptional .
Torture is inflicted with White House approval , the president lies about it and it ’s just another Tuesday .
Pitts is describing here the latest episode of a recurrent phenomenon that I have been studying and writing about for almost thirty years : the ideological transformation that follows the government ’s sustained conduct of extraordinary policies during a crisis , real or imaginary .
Living for years on end without previous freedoms , many people lose their awareness of the loss .
They become accustomed to the new normality .
In moments of rhetorical enthusiasm , freedom lovers often declare that the love of liberty cannot be stamped out .
They are wrong .
It can be , and it has been .
For most people , however , no stamping is required .
All that is necessary is that people , whether they approve or not , be made subject to extraordinary government powers , which are always justified by the supposed dangers of the moment .
Keep people in this condition for a few years , and most of them will accommodate themselves to it , first in their actions and eventually in their thinking , as well .
After a while , they will have lost not only their old liberties , but also their yearning to be free .
I give you Exhibit A : Nearly everybody in the United States today believes that he is living in a free country !
The disconnect between perception and reality is breathtaking .
With sadness and a deep sense of loss , we recall what Goethe declared long ago , “ None are more hopelessly enslaved than those who falsely believe they are free . ”
" In accordance with the constitution and the federal law , I , as president of Russia , am obliged to protect the lives and dignity of Russian citizens wherever they are located , " Mr Medvedev said in televised remarks .

" Strategists say that Mr. McCain can now count on a more motivated social conservative base to help him in areas like southern Ohio , where the 2004 race was settled . "
-- The New York Times , Sept. 7 , 2008 , A1 " In investigating the 2004 election in Ohio - - examining pollbooks , talking to pollworkers and election officials , as well as reading local newspaper accounts -- we could find no data of a late surge to the polls by born - again Christians .
What we did find is certified voting totals in areas favoring Bush that did n't match the number of voters who officially signed - in on the poll sign - in sheets . "
-- Email from Bob Fitrakis of The Columbus Free Press , Sept. 7 , 2008
To understand how Team McCain intends to get away with stealing this election , we must recall how Team Bush got away with it four years ago .
( Those are n't two different teams . )
The plan for stealing this contest has everything to do with the ostensibly surprising choice of Sarah Palin as McCain 's VP .
Here 's why ...
1. Election Day , 2004 : The Myth of Bush 's Christian " Surge "
First , let 's recall that , after the 2004 election , everybody said that Bush had won because the true believers of the Christian right had come out -- or , rather , poured forth -- in unprecedented numbers , often at the last minute , to support him .
Of course , by " everybody , " I 'm referring to the entire commentariate , both mainstream and left / liberal .
On TV and in print , in news analyses and op - ed articles , they all said that Bush / Cheney had been re-elected by America 's " values voters . "
And they said it with a certain awe -- as well they should , since Bush 's victory was a sort of miracle .
He had disapproval ratings in the upper 40's : higher than LBJ 's in 1968 , higher than Jimmy Carter 's in 1980 .
Nor was he very popular in his own party , as many top Republicans came out against him -- including moderates like John Eisenhower , rightists like Bob Barr , and many others such as William Crowe ( chair of the Joint Chiefs under Ronald Reagan ) , General Tony McPeak ( former Air Force chief of staff and erstwhile Veteran for Bush ) , libertarian Doug Bandow , neocon Francis Fukuyama , Lee Iacocca and Jack Matlock , Jr. ( Reagan 's ambassador to the USSR ) ; and many other , lesser figures in his party also publicly rejected him .
And so did sixty ( 60 ) newspapers -- all in " red " states -- that had endorsed Bush four years earlier : two thirds of them now going for Kerry , the others none of the above .
American Conservative , Pat Buchanan's own magazine , ran endorsements of five different candidates , only one of them for Bush .
And 169 tenured and emeritus professors from the world 's top business schools all signed a full - page ad decrying his economic policies , adducing them as reasons not to vote for him .
( The ad was written by top faculty at his own alma mater , Harvard Business School . )
The ad ran in the Financial Times , which , like The Economist , endorsed John Kerry .
And still Bush won , despite such big defections , thanks to that enormous turnout by the Christian right , as everybody kept on saying -- even though there were good reasons to be very skeptical about that notion .
2. Election Day , 2004 : There Was No Christian " Surge "
First of all , that talking point came from the Christian right itself , whose members certainly had every reason to exaggerate their clout .
That they thus credited themselves , and that the claim was duly amplified by their own party and its propaganda organs ( Rush Limbaugh , Fox News , et al. ) , should have been enough to make all non-believers doubtful .
And non-believers should have been especially suspicious of that claim because there 's not a shred of evidence to back it up .
On the other hand , there 's solid evidence that that immense , last - minute vote for Bush was nothing but a propaganda fiction , cooked up by Karl Rove to mask his party 's theft of that election .
To begin with , that fiction is preposterous on its face , since there were nowhere near enough of such right - wing believers to account for the incumbent 's staggering advance , as Bush reportedly received 11.5 million more votes than he had won four years before .
And how many evangelicals did that surge include ?
According to Karl Rove himself ( among others ) , there were 4 million evangelicals who had not voted for Bush / Cheney in 2000 .
So , even if Rove managed to get every single one of them to vote for Bush this time around ( and it 's unlikely that he did ) , they could not possibly have made so big a difference -- unless , of course , their numbers somehow magically increased inside the polls , like Jesus 's loaves and fishes .
In any case , Bush seems to have done worse with evangelicals than he had four years before .
Consider how his " base " performed , in fact , on that Election Day , as measured by the National Exit Poll ( and scrupulously analyzed by Michael Collins , whose essay , " The Urban Legend , " is included in Loser Take All ) .
Close study of the numbers in 2004 reveals that there was no big national surge of " values voters " : on the contrary .
First of all , the nation 's rural vote declined , dropping from 23 % to just 16 % of the overall national vote ; and Bush 's total rural vote went down from 14 million to just under 12 million .
And while the nation 's small town vote increased substantially - - by 88 % -- those voters did not favor Bush as they had done four years before , but opted in near equal numbers for John Kerry .
Of those 9.5 million votes , Bush got 4.9 million , while Kerry got 4.7 million .
( In 2000 , Bush had won 3.1 million small town votes , to Gore 's 2 million . )
And then there were the voters in the suburbs , who did come out for Bush in greater numbers than four years before -- but hardly by enough to make for a decisive jump of any kind , as Bush won 28.3 million of those votes , to Kerry 's 25.6 million .
On Nov. 11 , Pew published the results of their most precise survey of the electorate .
Having asked Americans to name the issue that most concerned them as they cast their ballots , Pew found that Iraq was Number One , noted by 25 percent , followed by " jobs and the economy , " noted by 12 percent , with 9 percent invoking " terrorism . "
Only 9 percent named " moral values " as their main concern -- with only 3 percent of them referring specifically to " gay marriage " ( and another 2 percent referring to the candidates ' own private lives ) .
Those numbers tell a very different story from the one hyped proudly by the men atop the Christianist machine .
In particular , they said that they helped Bush prevail through their well - managed opposition to gay marriage -- which Tony Perkins , head of the Family Research Council , called " the hood ornament on the family values wagon that carried the president to a second term . "
That there was evidently no such wagon did not blunt the impact of such theocratic propaganda , which quickly resonated all throughout " the liberal media , " so that it now stands as the truth .
Indeed , it was accepted as the truth so quickly that it went unquestioned even after the dramatic mass reaction to the Terri Schiavo case a few months later , when Bush and the Republicans in Congress intervened in that domestic tragedy , trying to force the very outcome that the Christianists were calling for : " Americans broadly and strongly disapprove of federal intervention in the Terri Schiavo case , " ABC News reported .
The public supported the removal of Schiavo 's feeding tube by 63 % to 28 % , according to the network 's polls .
And so it was throughout the media .
According to USA Today , 76 % disapproved of Congress 's handling of the case , while only 20 % approved .
CBS News found that 82 % believed that Bush and Congress should have stayed out of it .
And so it went , with poll after poll confirming that the Bush Republicans ' attempt to force their " moral values " on the situation was appealing only to a small minority , a /k / a the fringe .
" When nearly 70 percent of the American public disagrees with you , " wrote Eric Boehlert at the time , " you 're out of step with the mainstream . "
That strong reaction by ( at least ) two - thirds of us was far more telling than the press , and most top Democrats , were willing to perceive , and so they could n't , would n't see the awful truth : Either We the People had abruptly given up our " moral values " since Election Day , or our apparent vote for Bush was a deception , based on vote suppression and election fraud committed in Ohio and elsewhere throughout the nation .
Thus the myth of that immense , last - minute Christian turn - out was a rationale concocted to " explain " Bush / Cheney 's re-election -- and the US press immediately bought it , out of a clear eagerness to close the book on that election right away , and thereby black out all the glaring signs of fraud throughout Ohio ( and Florida , and elsewhere ) .
Indeed , the press at once laughed off the " theory " of widespread election fraud , dismissing all the facts as fantasy ; and in their place it offered fantasy as fact ( as they had done before , and have done since ) .
And so , because the media never did revisit the 2004 election , that groundless " explanation " quickly hardened into gospel ( so to speak ) -- which brings us to the present , and the strategy for stealing this election , too .
3. Election Day , 2008 : Another Christian " Surge " ?
The choice of Sarah Palin has been widely and repeatedly assailed as evidence of John McCain 's " bad judgement . "
Certainly that choice was very bad .
Indeed , it may prove to be catastrophic .
But to take it as a sign of John McCain 's mere recklessness is probably a big mistake .
First of all , there is no reason to believe that the decision really was McCain's , since Karl Rove 's minions are in charge of his campaign , which means that Rove himself is running it ( as he evidently has been from the start ) .
And while it surely was a rotten choice in moral and / or civic terms , it certainly was not an instance of " bad judgement " in Rove 's moral universe , where winning is the only thing that counts ; and Sarah Palin was selected so that ( she and ) John McCain could " win " -- and , even more important , get away with it .
They picked Palin not because she is a woman , and might therefore appeal to diehard Hillary supporters .
They picked Palin because she is a theocratic true believer , who has the Christianists all swooning at the prospect of her reign ( which will commence as soon as Jesus answers all their prayers for John McCain 's quick death ) .
To get some sense of their millennial excitement , read this excerpt from an email recently sent out by one of them , to others of her kind :
I believe you are aware that Dutch Sheets [ http://www.dutchsheets.org/ ] was used by the Lord to call prayer before the 2000 election that was so close .
He said this morning that this election is perhaps even more critical than 2000 because of the Supreme Court .
If the right political posture is not elected , we stand to lose decades of progress and the results could be enormous .
Last year Chuck Pierce and Greg Hood prophesied that in 2008 we would not be electing a president but a vice president .
Dutch said he could get no release in his heart to back Huckab [ ee ] even though he was pressured by many in the body of Christ .
Huckab[ee ] is a good man and a strong believer , but he was not God 's choice .
Dutch also told us that he knows a man who gave McCain a prophetic word that McCain had made a vow to God when he was at the bottom during his POW days and now God was calling in that vow .
McCain was visibly moved by this word .
Dutch was traveling to Texas on Friday and when he landed in the airport his wife called and told him to get to the TV asap .
He watched McCain introduce Governor Palin and he said he began to weep , even though he knew nothing about her .
He asked God , " What is the significance of this 44 - year - old woman ? "
And he saw the clock said 4:44 .
He asked the Lord what that was all about and the Lord said , " Ezekiel 44:4 . "
" He brought me by way of the north gate to the front of the temple ; so I looked , and behold , the glory of the LORD filled the house of the LORD ; and I fell on my face .
NKJV ..... North gate representing Alaska [ sic ] .
And so on .
Such fervor , which now unifies the Christianist community , was not stoked merely by the sight of Palin 's glowing kisser on TV .
More importantly , the governor became the instant darling of the Christianist far right once all the top dogs of the theocratic movement looked at her , and pronounced her good .
To some extent , she was their choice -- and so it 's wrong to claim , as some indignant pundits have , that Sarah Palin " was not vetted . "
The governor was vetted by the Council for National Policy , the secretive and highly influential steering committee of the Christianist far right , which seeks to junk the Constitution and replace it with Leviticus and other flights of Holy Writ .
They approved this choice , because Sarah Palin is quite willing to promote the Christianists ' apocalyptic program with a brazenness , and comprehensiveness , unprecedented in the history of American political campaigning .
Her disparate crackpot policies are all expressions of the same extremist creed .
There are , of course , all her Levitical sexual proscriptions : no abortions even for those women who 've been raped ( or raped by their own fathers ) ; no sex education ; no condoms .
There are her incremental steps to Christianize the public schools : her moves against their secular librarians ; her readiness to get Creationism into the curriculum .
And then there is her mad anti-environmentalism : her tacit eagerness for further global warming , and , therefore , her passion for oil - drilling everywhere ; her opposition to clean water legislation ; her willingness to see the polar bears die off ; her letting hunters gun down wolves and bears from low - flying planes , etc .
All such reckless policies derive from an apocalyptic wish to see the planet die , so that Lord Jesus will come back here , and start kicking ass and taking names .
( Palin 's pastor holds that He will set up his command post in Alaska . )
None of this insanity appeals to anyone outside the Christianist community , which is no larger than it was when Bush tried to " save " Teri Schiavo from " judicial murder " -- or when he was anomalously " re-elected " by those legions of fictitious " values voters . "
The choice of Sarah Palin , therefore , surely was not based on any rational calculation of some real electoral advantage ; for that ferocious bloc is far too small to pull that off , no matter how firm their conviction that God wants them to .
In fact , the only way that Palin and her doddering partner can prevail in this election is by stealing it , as Bush and Cheney did ( both times ) .
Certainly the ground has been prepared for yet another stolen race , Bush / Cheney 's party having made enormous strides in sabotaging our election system ( while the Democrats just sat there , whistling ) .
Now , from coast to coast , it 's far more difficult ( for Democrats ) to register to vote , and far more difficult ( for Democrats ) to cast their votes , while countless ( Democratic ) voters have been stricken from the rolls , through purges carried out by the Department of Justice .
Thus Bush 's government has legally diminished the electorate ( the Roberts Court approving every step ) .
Meanwhile , the regime also continues to suppress the ( Democratic ) vote illegally , either through voter " caging " prior to Election Day -- or , far more effectively , by fiddling with the numbers electronically at every level , and / or simply dumping countless names ( of Democrats ) from the electronic voter rolls , and / or putting far too few machines in ( Democratic ) polling places , and / or disinforming ( Democratic ) voters as to when and where to cast their votes , and / or simply scaring ( Democratic ) voters into staying home .
That is what it takes to steal elections in America -- all of that , and also something else : a quick - 'n - easy explanation for the outcome .
For if those final numbers are surprising , there must be some rationale that can ( apparently ) account for them .
And that is why the Bush machine put Sarah Palin next to John McCain .
By arousing the hard core of vocal Christianists , they prepared the ground for the eventual redeployment of the same canard with which they justified their last unlikely " win " : that millions of believers did the trick .
Indeed , it was not just the choice of Sarah Palin , but the whole convention , that was clearly calculated not to pull in undecided and / or independent voters , but to get the fringe alone to stomp and holler for the ticket .
The party platform -- crafted under the command of Christianist election - rigger J. Kenneth Blackwell - - is a ( literally ) scorched - earth " faith - based " document , calling even for a ban on stem cell research in the private sector .
And the convention spectacle itself was basically one long display of cultural resentment , with lots of loud , self - righteous jeering from the stage and on the floor ( with an epic show of ridicule by that fine Christian , Rudy Giuliani ) .
It was strongly reminiscent of the GOP 's 1992 convention -- a show that very clearly turned the nation off , and helped defeat Bush Sr. 's bid to stay in office .
Team McCain decided to revive that model , not because the nation has turned Christianist since then , but as a way to motivate the fringe , and thereby make it possible to tell the pundits , on Nov. 5 , that it was those Americans who turned the tide for John McCain .
4. A Word to the Wise
In fact , that claim will be the secondary " explanation " for McCain and Palin's " win . "
The first , of course , will be Obama 's race , and the sad " fact " that America 's just not ready to vote for a black man . "
We will hear endlessly ( as we have already ) about " the Bradley effect , " and how it struck again , with millions of white folks who had openly approved Obama suddenly deciding , in the sanctum of the voting booth , to vote like Klansmen , thereby electing John McCain .
We 'll hear from Clinton people that he lost because he did n't put her on the ticket .
We 'll hear from Michael Moore , Ralph Nader and The Nation that he lost because he ran too corporate - friendly a campaign .
We 'll also hear from Mark Penn and the Wall Street Journal that he lost because his campaign was too " populist . "
George Lakoff will tell us that Obama lost because he failed to frame the issues properly , Thomas Frank will note that all those Kansas - types are still too dim to know what 's good for them , and Thomas Friedman ( among others ) will point out that Obama lost because he never made that crucial " gut " connection with " Joe Six - Pack " ( whom Friedman and those others know so well ) .
Meanwhile , many others will ascribe Obama 's loss to all the lies and slanders heaped upon him by McCain 's campaign and its confederates , who , we 'll hear repeatedly , " Swift - boated " him to death , just as they did to Kerry ( as if Kerry really lost the last election ) .
Some of those assertions will be partly true -- and all of them are sure to be irrelevant .
For if McCain and Palin " win , " that victory will either be a miracle ( which is , of course , how some of their supporters will explain it ) or just another massive rip - off , perpetrated right before our eyes .
And no such miracle is likely ; for there is still no reason to believe that that old man and his demented running mate have any broad appeal .
The polls now putting them ahead are highly dubious , based on a ten - point over - sampling of Republicans , and crafted without any calls to cell phone users ( who comprise a large part of Obama 's base ) .
Otherwise there is no evidence of any large - scale movement toward McCain and Palin - - who have to trek to theocratic enclaves , like Colorado Springs , in order to draw cheering multitudes , while Obama / Biden draw them everywhere they go .
With Democrats all in a panic , let 's recall how few Americans turned out to vote in the Republican primaries , and how few new voters the Republicans have registered to date .
Compare that feeble record with the vastly larger numbers who came out for Obama ( and for Clinton ) , and all those whom the Democrats have registered to vote .
Since then , the prospects for McCain have not improved , regardless of the spin on Sarah Palin - - for this economy is in the crapper , and he has said repeatedly that he just does n't know about such things .
That issue , and his wild commitment to a war that most Americans oppose , make his victory in November quite improbable , to say the least .
And there you have the reason why the GOP must , once again , deploy its giant criminal machine : to cut the Democrats ' vast popular advantage .
And it is happening right now , as you sit reading this , as each day brings in new reports of voters purged , machines " malfunctioning , " ballots slyly misdesigned , and other measures meant to benefit McBush 's party .
( The fraud is not occurring " on both sides . " )
Such evidence is far more solid than the nervous speculation that Americans might vote on racial grounds -- or the fantasy that Sarah Palin 's co-religionists could really win it for McCain .
The theft of this next race is only possible because the Democratic Party and the media , and principled Republicans , have shut their eyes to this regime 's crusade against American democracy .
And now the only way to stop it -- or , if it does happen yet again , resist it -- is to face it at long last , and talk about it openly .
It 's therefore not enough to raise more money for the Democrats , and not enough to get more voters registered , and get them to the polls ; and not enough to spread the word about McCain and Palin , or to try to get the media to do a decent job ; and not enough to fight the smears and lies about Obama , and to demand that he and / or the Democrats get tougher .
While all of those activities are crucial , they 'll amount to nothing if the race is finally rigged , and most Americans do n't know a thing about it .
And so , whatever else we 're doing , we must also speak out loud and clear about that possibility .
Otherwise , if that disaster should befall us , we will be as much to blame for it as those Republicans who pulled it off , and all those Democrats who let them get away with it .

In the hot , dark water of a South African mine , scientists have found the world 's loneliest species .
Everywhere else biologists have studied life on our planet , they 've found communities of life , but today , biologists announced they have discovered an ecosystem that contains just a single species of bacteria .
In all other known ecosystems , the key functions of life – harvesting energy and elements like carbon and nitrogen from the environment – have been shared among different species .
But in the water of the Mponeng gold mine , two miles under the earth 's surface , Desulforudis audaxviator carries out all of those functions by itself .
In short , it 's the tidiest package of life found yet .
" It is possible to pack everything necessary for maintaining life into one genome , " said Dylan Chivian of Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory .
All known life forms need carbon , hydrogen , nitrogen and an energy source to live .
Plants need nitrogen , but can't just pull it from the atmosphere and start using it to make amino acids .
Instead , they rely on archaea for that task .
Interconnections like these form the basis of an ecosystem , often cheesily called the ' web of life ' .
What makes D. audaxviator so special is that its genome , cobbled together from bacterial and archaeal genes , can carry out all life 's functions by itself .
That could make the bug a prime candidate for any attempt to see if Earth 's microbes could live in some other extreme environment within the solar system .
" Since it could live on its own on Earth , if it were given a matching habitat elsewhere , it could live , " said Chivian .

One application , one team
That 's all very nice , but when do we get them ?
The initial public beta release of Chromium ( the open source project for Google Chrome ) builds and runs on Microsoft Windows , but we are actively working on versions for Mac OS X and Linux as well .
I 'm one of the people focusing on the Mac version .
In this blog post I 'll explain a bit about how we 're approaching the challenges of building a product on multiple platforms and what our goals are .
In some ways , working on Chromium is coming full circle for me .
I started my career writing Internet & web software for the Mac in the very early days , and it 's been exciting to get back to my roots as an engineer .
One overriding goal we have had from the start has been to build the best browser we can .
When it comes to Mac and Linux versions , this means that our goal is not to just " port " a Windows application to these other platforms -- rather , our goal is to deliver Chromium 's innovative , Google - style user interface without rough edges on any of them .
Chromium 's overall design has been multi-platform from the start , but we are also committed to getting the details right for users on each platform .
For an application that most of us " live in " most of the day , rough edges in the user experience or operating system integration are like having a stone in your shoe no matter how well the rest of the product works .
In order to make sure Chromium feels right , each platform 's version is being built by people who live and breathe that platform ; the engineers working on these versions are long - time Mac and Linux engineers who are just as picky about the details as anyone .
It 's also not just the engineers ; Macs and Linux machines are very popular at Google at all levels , so progress is already being followed avidly across all levels of the company .
These versions are not being built by separate teams , however .
Everyone working on Chromium can and does contribute to all platforms , in order to keep things from diverging too far , and all versions are built from the same sources .
You can see the first steps of this in the source tree right now : you can already build some modules ( and run unit tests ! ) on the Mac and Linux , and more will be landing in the tree as we move forward .
Our build infrastructure also notifies everyone when a change on one platform breaks the build on another , which keeps everyone in sync .
As the bigger pieces come together , parts of the existing Chromium code will need to be refactored or rethought , of course .
Sometimes even code written with multiple platforms in mind ( as much of the Chromium code already is ) will turn out to have embedded assumptions that are n't valid once it 's actually running on the other platforms .
The team is fully aware of this and is prepared for it , rather than dictating that everything accommodate to how things work on Windows .
We can't make concrete predictions yet ; the Windows version is going into beta first , simply by virtue of having had a head start .
For a number of reasons , much of the initial prototyping and design was done for Windows .
We wanted to make sure that the user experience was very smooth for Windows users as well , and when you 're hashing out and testing ideas it can be helpful to not have to do so on three platforms simultaneously .
However , once the design started to settle down , we started adding Mac and Linux engineers to the team , and they started getting the ball rolling on those platforms .
Since they are in many respects more similar to each other than either is to Windows , we 've ended up being able to share code between them , which has sped up development a bit .
Right now , both are in the " pieces build and pass tests , but there 's no Chromium application yet . "
While we 're working hard and fast on catching up to the Windows version , we 're not setting an artificial date for when they 'll be ready -- we simply can't predict enough to make a solid estimate , and we expect to learn a lot from the Windows public beta as well .
On the plus side , since the project is now public , you 'll be able to watch ( and maybe even contribute to ) the progress from week to week .
As these versions stabilize , we will create official betas , much as we are now for the Windows version .
While we can't give any dates yet , we 'll keep everyone informed as we get closer .

Gas prices are up and oil executives are once again testifying before Congress .
Clearly , many politicians , pundits , and consumers lament the rising cost of gas .
Before we join them in their chorus , let us take a step back and ask this question :
Are gas prices really all that high ?
A change in price can be a result of inflation , taxes , changes in supply and demand , or any combination of the three .
First , we need to take into account inflation .
The result of the Federal Reserve printing too much money is a loss of purchasing power of the dollar : something that cost $ 1.00 in 1950 would cost about $ 8.78 today .
As for gas prices , in 1950 the price of gas was approximately 30 cents per gallon .
Adjusted for inflation , a gallon of gas today should cost right at $ 2.64 , assuming taxes are the same .
But taxes have not stayed the same .
The tax per gallon of gas in 1950 was roughly 1.5 % of the price .
Today , federal , state , and local taxes account for approximately 20 % of gas 's posted price .
Taking inflation and the increase in taxes into account ( assuming no change in supply or demand ) the same gallon of gas that cost 30 cents in 1950 should today cost about $ 3.13 .
Neither have supply or demand remained constant .
The world economy is growing .
China and India are obvious examples .
At the same time , Americans continue to love driving SUVs and trucks .
As for supply , we are prohibited ( whatever the reasons may be ) from using many of the known oil reserves in our own country .
Furthermore , due to government regulation , the last oil refinery built in the United States was completed in 1976 .
In addition , the Middle East is politically unstable which leads to a risk premium on the world 's major source of oil .
It is obvious that the demand for oil has grown while supplies have been restricted .
The average price of gas in the United States today is approximately $ 3.25 .
The question is , why are gas prices not higher than they are ?
Blaming greedy oil companies on the rising price of gas is simply irresponsible .
The profit margins of a few selected industries are as follows :

The water utility industry has higher profit margins than major oil and gas firms !
Why is n't every CEO with profit margins above that of the oil companies made to testify before Congress for " price gouging " ?
Clearly , greedy corporate profits are not the issue .
Again , while just over nine percent of the price of a gallon of gas goes to oil company profits , approximately twenty percent of the price of a gallon of gas is composed of federal , state , and local taxes .
Those who want the government to step in and do something about the high price of gas are either forgetful of recent history or too young to remember the oil crisis of 1979 .
During that time , restrictions on the price of gasoline led to the inability of some to find gas at all .
Price ceilings always lead to shortages .
The only thing worse than having to pay " too much " for gas is not being able to find gas at any price .
Let us not be swayed by politicians out for power or by reporters out to create news where none exists .
Facts and economic logic should prevail rather than rhetoric .
Commerzbank ’s purchase of German rival Dresdner Bank AG will cost thousands of jobs , but analysts said Monday it will benefit insurer Allianz SE , which agreed to sell Dresdner over the weekend in a Euro 9.8 billion ( US $ 14.44 billion ) deal .
Anzeige
Shareholders appeared to agree , sending the Munich - based insurer ’s shares slightly higher in Frankfurt trading on Monday to Euro 114.42 ( US $ 168.60 ) , or up 0.28 percent .
Commerzbank shares suffered because many analysts were concerned about the boldness of such a major purchase in a German economic environment where growth has contracted and business and consumer confidence are at multiyear lows .
Shares of Commerzbank , Germany ’s second - biggest bank , slid more than 11 percent to Euro 17.71 ( US $ 25.89 ) .
Anzeige
The deal comes with a heavy toll in terms of job cuts : 9,000 workers out of the combined banks ’ ranks of 67,000 workers will go , including back office , production and investment bankers .
Of those cuts , 6,500 will take place in Germany with the other 2,500 abroad .
But by holding on to some 30 percent of Dresdner Bank , Allianz will be able to continue selling its insurance products through the branches of the new bank , which will be Germany ’s biggest in terms of branches and customers , overtaking Deutsche Bank AG .
Commerzbank Chief Executive Martin Blessing said it was also a chance for the German banking sector to become more competitive internationally .
Anzeige
Allianz CEO Michael Diekmann CEO said that a " merger of banks , especially clearing banks in Germany , is needed to – in times of crisis – have the necessary stability and strength to play a part in the European markets . “
That was a nod to the uncertainty swirling around the European banking sector which has seen wide exposure to the U.S. subprime crisis and led to major losses in earnings and confidence .
But Allianz also benefits from the deal because it will get Cominvest , Commerzbank ’s asset management unit , which is worth Euro 700 million ( US$ 1 billion ) .
Anzeige
" All in all , we think that an almost 30 percent stake in the new banking entity is not much less risky compared to the 100 percent stake in Dresdner Bank in terms of the business mix , “ said Andreas Weese , an analyst with UniCredit in Munich .
" However , advantages of the deal are the larger platform for the distribution of insurance products , the expansion of the asset management business via comdirect , and the participation in expected synergies . “
The new bank will have 11 million private customers in Germany and a network of 1,200 branches peppered across Europe ’s biggest economy .
It will also have more than 100,000 corporate and institutional clients and expand its wealth - management operations for well - heeled private clients , too .
What it does not yet have is a name , Blessing said .
At a news conference Monday , he said both Dresdner and Commerzbank were recognized and familiar brands in the country .
The logos of both banks dominate the skyline of Frankfurt .
Blessing said he was torn , given that he started out at Dresdner Bank , but said it made little sense to keep both names .

My post on hunting memory leaks in Python received a lot of feedback via email .
And both ^H^H^H^H most of them asked for the source code .
Aside : if someone could recommend a good spam - proof comments plugin for PyBlosxom , I 'd be very grateful .
I see six plugins on the main site and it's unclear which combination is the one I need .
So , here 's the mysterious checks module I used in the post .
There 's nothing complicated in it , just a bunch of ad - hoc functions I wrote in an afternoon .
I 'm sure you could do better .
import gc import inspect
The gc module gives us access to the Python garbage collector , which tracks object references .
The inspect module has useful functions for distinguishing certain kinds of built - in objects such as modules or call stack frames .
def count ( typename ) : return sum ( 1 for o in gc . get_objects ( ) if type ( o ) .
__name__ == typename )
A very simple function that counts the number of objects by the class or type name .
If you happen to use old - style classes , well , it wo n't work for you .
Before the great class and type unification in Python 2.2 , all instances of all classes were of type ' instance ' , and that 's what you 'll see today if you still use old - style classes .
Also , this simple function does n't distinguish between classes with the same name defined in different modules .
I did n't need it — I prefer to have unique class names , so that I can easily navigate my source tree with ctags .
def by_type ( typename ) : return [ o for o in gc .
get_objects ( ) if type ( o ) .
__name__ == typename ]
Essentially the same thing , but this function returns a list of objects instead of counting them .
def at ( addr ) : for o in gc . get_objects ( ) : if id ( o ) == addr : return o return None
This is a way to " dereference " a " pointer " in Python , the reverse to id ( ) .
If you see an interesting object in the graph , and want to get hold of it in the pdb prompt to do some manual looking , you can do that by calling at and passing the id shown in the graph .
Actually , it 's not a true reverse of id ( ) .
It can only find objects tracked by the garbage collector , such as lists , dicts , instances , functions and so on , but not trivial value objects ( such as strings or ints ) that never contain references to other objects
def find_backref_chain ( obj , predicate , max_depth = 20 , extra_ignore =( ) ) :
This function , given an object and a predicate , finds the shortest chain of object references from some source object such that predicate ( source_object ) is true .
It does a bog - standard Breadth - first search in a graph .
The max_depth argument limits the search so that I would n't have to wait too long to get a negative answer ( I 'm pretty sure any such chain should be shorter than 20 references ) .
The extra_ignore argument lets me specify additional ids of objects that I want to be ignored .
For example , if I stored the results of by_type ( ' Foo ' ) in a variable , I 'd have an extra list object referencing each of the Foo objects .
If I do n't want that list to clutter up my searches , I can pass extra_ignore = [ id( my_list ) ] .
queue = [ obj ] depth = { id ( obj ) : 0 } parent = { id ( obj ) : None }
The standard BFS elements : a FIFO queue , the mapping from a node to its depth ( depth[x ] = the length of the shortest path from obj to x ) , and the mapping that lets me construct the shortest path easily ( parent[ x ] = the next node on the shortest path from x to node ) .
ignore = set ( extra_ignore ) ignore .
add ( id ( extra_ignore ) ) ignore .
add ( id ( queue ) ) ignore .
add ( id ( depth ) ) ignore .
add ( id ( parent ) ) ignore .
add ( id ( ignore ) )
The objects that implement the search should not themselves become part of the search !
gc . collect ()
Just to make sure we have no collectable garbage lying around .
while queue : target = queue .
pop ( 0 ) if predicate ( target ) :
Found it !
Let 's reconstruct the reference chain now
chain = [ target ] while parent [ id ( target ) ] is not None : target = parent [ id ( target ) ] chain .
append ( target ) return chain
Otherwise , continue looking ...
tdepth = depth [ id ( target ) ] if tdepth < max_depth :
... but do n't dive deeper than the user asked .
referrers = gc .
get_referrers ( target ) ignore .
add ( id ( referrers ) )
We definitely do n't want new objects created during the search to become part of the search space ( you could easily get into an infinite loop ) .
And even if the referrers list got garbage collected at the end of the inner loop , this does n't hurt our search .
Even if the same id got reused by a different new object , we do n't want any new objects to become a part of the search space .
for source in referrers :
We look at each source object referring to the current target object ...
if inspect .
isframe ( source ) or id ( source ) in ignore : continue
... ignoring ones that we want to ignore .
Note that here I also ignore call - stack frames , even though I probably should n't .
Frame objects contain references to local variables in a function .
It is entirely plausible that some long - running function is the source of your memory leak , so I should n't do that .
However , in my particular case it was n't , and all the frame objects appeared in my graph solely because of locals I defined in the pdb prompt .
Adding this check simplified my object graphs without affecting the outcome .
if id ( source ) not in depth : depth [ id ( source ) ] = tdepth + 1 parent [ id ( source ) ] = target queue .
append ( source )
The standard BFS steps again .
return None
And if we ever get out of that loop , it means the search failed .
Since this post is getting excessively long , I 'll describe the show_backrefs function that you all really wanted to see in the next post .
Update : continue reading .
Update 2 : the ' checks ' module was open - sourced as objgraph .
Visit the Conference Web Site http://war-crimes.info
A conference on plans to bring high - level American war criminals to justice will be streamed live from Andover , Mass. , September 13 - 14 .
The conference has attracted eminent national and international legal authorities who will speak about the legal grounds for seeking prosecution of top administration officials , including George Bush , who appear to be guilty of war crimes .
The URL address to view the conference live or to view it afterwards from the archives is : http://www.ustream.tv/channel/warcrimesconference
“ All viewers need to do to follow the proceedings is to visit the Web address and they can watch everything ” , said the conference ’s convener , Lawrence Velvel , a prominent legal educator .
Viewing hours will be from 9 a.m. to 5:15 p.m. Eastern Standard Time ( EST ) on Saturday , September 13 , and from 9 a.m. to 2:30 p.m. ( EST ) on Sunday , September 14 .
In the tradition of Justice Robert H. Jackson , America ’s Chief Prosecutor at the Nuremburg War Crimes Trials after World War II , the Conference ’s purpose is “ to promote efforts to hold culpable officials accountable in courts of law ” , said Velvel .
“ Otherwise , the future could be threatened by additional examples of Executive lawlessness by leaders who need fear no personal consequences ” for their actions , leading to “ the possibility of more Viet Nams , and more Iraqs ” , he added .
Attendees will hear from prominent authorities on international law , criminal prosecutions , and constitutional law who are determined to give meaning to Justice Jackson ’s words :
“ The common sense of mankind demands that law shall not stop with the punishment of petty crimes by little people .
It must also reach men who possess themselves of great power and make deliberate and concerted use of it to set in motion evils which leave no home in the world untouched . ”

Interstate Electricity Transmission Superhighway Essential to Growth of Low - Carbon Technologies
August 3rd , 2008 by Carol Gulyas
Big money is backing wind power , and the number of investors ready to step up to the plate continues to grow .
But according to an article in Renewable Energy World , that growth is hampered by a lack of a nationwide “ electronic transmission superhighway ” .
In the sixties America created the interstate superhighways that now crisscross our nation .
Now , our country ’s energy security depends on a new interstate initiative .
Will the U.S. government step up to the plate ?
“ Across the country , hundreds of wind projects comprising tens of thousands of wind turbines are on hold because no one wants to step forward and pay for upgrades that will primarily benefit others .
The obvious solution to this problem is a policy framework that will allow firms interested in building new transmission to collect the costs of the infrastructure investment from those who will benefit from it . ”
Richard Sergel , president and CEO of the North American Electric Reliability Corporation ( NERC ) , and Kevin Kolevar , DOE ’s assistant secretary for electricity delivery and energy reliability , have pointed out in recent testimony before Congress that all low - carbon technologies , from large - scale wind projects to concentrated solar power , and even nuclear and “ clean coal ” technologies , require an updated electric grid because they are most often located in remote areas .
The map above shows the Transmission Superhighway Vision put forth by the American Wind Energy Association and American Electric Power , an investor - owned utility that spans 11 states .

Beyond speeding the transition to wind power , a new transmission grid is needed to avoid power disruptions like the electricity blackout of 2003 .
The American Institute of Physics reports that government deregulation has ignored the inherent physics of the nation ’s power grid , which should be viewed as one big machine .
This has created serious problems :
Instead of treating electricity as an essential service , it is treated as a commodity
Power companies compete regionally and avoid sharing usage and transmission data , such as blackout statistics
The national grid is not viewed as the single “ machine ” that it is , resulting in congestion at the regional level when demand increases unexpectedly
Independent power producers create generating units at “ essentially random ” locations due to low labor costs or lax state regulations , or tax incentive
The cost of electricity has increased to the end - users
It is hoped that a new administration will finally address the state of our national electricity grid .
If it does n’t it wo n’t be because of cost .
“ Given that electricity transmission infrastructure typically remains in service for 50 years or more , the cost of the investment for the average household would be equivalent to about US $ 0.35 per month , less than the cost of a postage stamp . ”

Latest Cleantech Talk Episode
At the launch of her new book , psychologist Dorothy Rowe said she intended it to act as a sequel to The God Delusion .
Dawkins , she said , had posed the question : " Why do intelligent people believe this garbage ? "
In What Should I Believe ? , Rowe gives an answer , though with less of a blanket judgment as to the rubbishness or otherwise of the religious outlook .
In fact , her explanation could be used to understand any form of belief , Dawkins ' included .
She starts from the premise that our greatest fear is annihilation , not physical death , necessarily , but annihilation as a person .
It is the desire to avoid this that motivates us throughout our lives .
For some , religion is the answer , because it tends to suggest quite straightforwardly that life carries on after death .
But a continuation of our existence is what we all clamour for , religious or not ; parents hope their worldview will shape the lives of their children ; some take comfort from the fact that their " blood " or " genes " will be around after they 've gone .
Artists imagine the work will stand as a monument to them .
Humbler people hope they 'll live on , at least , in their friends ' memories or through the effects of the good things they 've done .
To live without any hope of projecting one 's soul is , Rowe argues , impossible .
Test yourself , if you believe you do .
So why be the Pope rather than Picasso ?
Why choose religion as your balm , rather than some other route to eternal life ?
According to Rowe 's model , that decision is the result of a kind of cost - benefit analysis for the individual – and those costs and benefits can come from absolutely anywhere within the arena of personal experience .
And into the mix goes the cast of your personality – introvert or extrovert .
Will my father beat me if I 'm not devout ?
Well I had better believe then .
Or not , depending on which is worse , giving in to dad or getting hit .
Is it easier for me to believe that despite the dead - end job that absorbs all my time I will receive a reward in heaven , or to take the huge material risks involved in pursuing self - expression ?
Again , it depends .
All this presents a bit of an obstacle for those who think that the problem of religion can be " solved " .
When the explanation for religious belief is a question of individual psychology , there 's little room for the argument that it can be educated away .
There are always going to be situations where it makes ( personal ) sense to be a Muslim , Catholic or Hindu .
All this reminds me of Aldous Huxley , and the best book I 've ever read on the psychology of religion , the Devils of Loudun .
In it Huxley tells the story of the most notorious mass - possession in French history .
A bunch of sexually and emotionally thwarted nuns and some jealous politicians join forces to destroy a liberal , charismatic priest , Urbain Grandier .
Along the way , the drives that exist within us all manifest themselves in some particularly bizarre ways .
I say it 's a book about the psychology of religion , but we could leave out the religion part .
It so happened that at the time of the events at Loudun , society was ordered , nominally at least , along religious lines ( in fact it was ordered like any pre-industrial socially conservative society anywhere ) .
So the expressions of frustration , jealousy and rage were made to fit into a religious – in this case , Catholic – framework .
Grandier was tortured and burnt at the stake in the name of the Catholic God .
But it would be a mistake to assume that had religion not been there to justify the execution , it would n't have happened .
Some other justification would , of course , have been found ( as Arthur Miller showed by linking witch - paranoia and anti-communism – and before you counter that it was n't as bad , remember that people were put to death as a result of the red scare ) .
As Huxley puts it :
All the evils of religion can flourish without any belief in the supernatural …
Such behaviour patterns antedate and outlive the beliefs which , at any given moment , seem to motivate them .
What do Huxley and Rowe 's messages have in common ?
Both say : if you want to know where the trouble lies , look at the person and the reasons they have come to interpret the world in a particular way .
Most critics of religion do n't – they jump straight to content of the interpretation and become convinced that 's the root of whatever disaster has occurred .
It is a classic case of barking up the wrong tree .
I 've seen a number of comments , both at TheOilDrum and elsewhere , suggesting that the US is now less susceptible to supply disruptions because we have reduced our demand for oil by several hundred thousand barrels per day over the past year .
In general , I get the sense that people think we can insulate ourselves from supply disruptions , from our dependence on potentially unreliable foreign sources of oil , by improving our efficiency and eliminating " unnecessary " oil consumption .
In my opinion , this is backward .
In this post , I will argue that , because the demand that is destroyed first in a free market is the demand that is easiest to eliminate , the resulting consumptive system is more inelastic , more brittle , and more susceptible to systemic shock from supply disruption .
I will approach this argument by outlining what makes a system either resilient or brittle and why market - driven demand destruction creates a more brittle system .
I will conclude with a few thoughts on how we can increase the resiliency of our energy - driven economy in a future environment of declining energy supplies .
What Makes Systems Resilient or Brittle ?
A system is brittle if it is unable to effectively absorb shock .
Consider a plate glass window in comparison to a trampoline net .
The plate glass window can take a significant shock without budging , but at some point it can no longer absorb an impact and fractures .
It is brittle .
The trampoline net , on the other hand , will be moved by even a minor impact , but because of its ability to deform and stretch , it will not fracture ( or tear ) until far greater stress is applied then is needed to break the glass window .
The trampoline is resilient .
These same qualities of " brittle " and " resilient " apply to economies and financial markets .
The Problem with Brittle Systems
When an economic or financial system is brittle , it is less able to absorb the impact of a shock or ongoing stress -- say , a geopolitical disruption to oil supplies , or the ongoing , grinding problem of geological peak oil .
When a system is resilient it tends to be able to absorb such impacts , giving the underlying system time to reorganize to eliminate or mitigate the stress event .
When a system is brittle , however , it is more likely to shatter , after which point it can no longer bounce back to its original shape .
When an economic system shatters , we call it " collapse " -- the system enters a downward spiral into depression and dissolution .
This is one of the " worst case scenarios " for the impact of peak oil -- that it will overstress a brittle global economic system and act as the catalyst for economic , even societal collapse .
For this reason , it is important to understand what makes our economic system brittle or resilient , and how our personal economic choices and political / policy choices can influence the character of the system .
In this post , I will look specifically at the how crude oil demand destruction changes the systemic elasticity of demand for oil , and how this makes our economic system more brittle .
Why Demand Destruction Makes a System More Brittle
The basic mechanism underlying this theory is that , when forced to eliminate consumption of oil , individuals , and the market in aggregate , will eliminate the most discretionary consumption first .
As a result , the remaining consumption will be more valuable to the individual , firm , or economy in terms of GDP or quality of life produced per barrel of oil consumed .
This remaining demand is more inelastic .
When the oil demand -- whether it is for a family , industry , or nation - - becomes more inelastic there is greater exposure to supply disruptions .
For example , the US economy that consumed roughly 20 million barrels of oil per day in 2007 was less vulnerable to a theoretical geopolitical disruption removing 5 million barrels of oil per day from the world market ( say , war with Iran ) than a future US economy that only consumes 10 million barrels per day due to market - driven demand destruction .
The reason is that , presumably , that future US economy cut the least valuable , most discretionary 10 million barrels per day of consumption , and the remaining 10 million barrels per day of demand is far more inelastic .
Is Market - Driven Demand Destruction an Example of a Market Failure ?
The tendency of a free market to cut the most elastic demand first seems to be an example of market failure -- that is , where the market action produces a long - term result that runs counter to the goals of the market mechanism .
One of the classic causes of market failure is where the market acts to optimize short - term benefit , but in the process creates significant long - term problems that are n't adequately accounted for due to inability to incorporate these long term costs in the analysis of present decisions .
We saw exactly this in the rush to extend credit to increasingly low income home buyers resulting in today 's " credit crunch , " and I predict that we are currently seeing a similar market failure in the market 's destruction of the most elastic demand first .
The result will be an increasing vulnerability to future supply disruptions -- unfortunately , this will come exactly as the likelihood of more severe supply disruptions increases , as I discussed in my recent article on Geopolitical Feedback Loops .
Measuring Inelasticity : Is it Purely a Price Issue ?
The standard measure of demand elasticity is as a function of price .
Unfortunately , this is not necessarily a good measure of the impact on systemic resiliency .
Even if prices are going down , demand inelasticity can be increasing if the cause for the price drop is that high prices have caused an economic downturn that is eliminating the most elastic oil demand .
There are indications that this is exactly what is happening at present -- high prices are creating demand destruction , at least in the US , but the demand that is being eliminated appears to be the most elastic consumption .
A better measure of the impact of demand inelasticity on systemic resiliency may be price as a percentage of median disposable income .
Comparing the Credit Default Swap system to Demand Destruction
It is useful to compare the process of increasing inelasticity of demand due to market - driven demand destruction with the systemic brittleness created by the mushrooming market for credit default swaps .
I 've written a brief explanation of this shadowy corner of the financial world in Financial Wizardry & Collapse .
In brief , by spreading the risk of default on corporate bonds very thinly and widely , the global financial system becomes superficially more resilient as it is better able to absorb a handful of major failures .
However , because the system is so interconnected , at some tipping point of numerous defaults , the entire system would crash at once .
The result is a system that is actually far more brittle .
The credit default swap ( CDS ) system is in some ways useful in understanding how to reduce the brittleness caused by market - driven oil demand destruction .
In the CDS system , individual corporations or issuers essentially bet on the viability of corporate bonds -- they have the power to choose their level of exposure .
Of course , in seeking to maximize profits , there is a trend to maximizing revenues by maximizing exposure to systemic default .
Participants can , however , participate in the system while maintaining a safe , low level of overall exposure -- a level where they could absorb the impact of simultaneous default of every position they hold .
The lesson , roughly applied to energy demand inelasticity , seems to be to minimize the exposure to supply disruptions of the most inelastic sources of consumption .
For example , if winter heating by heating oil is a very " important " ( and thereby inelastic ) , source of consumption , it would make sense to move that use to a more reliable source of energy ( say , passive solar design and added insulation ) before converting gas - powered commuter cars to plug - in electric .
This also applies to electricity and natural gas use -- for example , the electricity used to pump water out of aquifers for a farmhouse is likely a very inelastic source of demand ; replacing this source of energy consumption with rainwater harvesting would improve the aggregate elasticity of demand .
This seems to run counter to what the market and non-market incentives ( subsidies & R&D funding ) are pushing for -- one reason why I think this process demonstrates a market failure -- and may be a good candidate for a centrally - planned policy push .
This is just one example of how the US could actually increase systemic resiliency by substituting renewable , domestic , alternative energy sources and conservation measures for the most inelastic sources of oil demand ( the red section of the Figure 1 , above ) , while retaining the more elastic and discretionary sources of oil consumption to buffer supply shocks .
What About Efficiency ?
Do improvements in efficiency have the same effect as involuntary , market - driven demand destruction ?
Maybe .
If the pace of efficiency measures decreases the scarcity of oil , then the result will be a less brittle system .
However , this tends to act as a negative feedback loop , as the exact stimulus that drives investment in efficiency ( high prices & scarcity ) will also be eliminated by efficiency gains rapid enough to decrease the overall scarcity of oil .
Conclusion
As a result of recent demand destruction , the US economy is becoming increasingly susceptible to shocks caused by supply disruptions .
The global economy appears to be following suit to some degree , though the process of demand destruction in the growing economies of China , India , Russia , and elsewhere in the developing world is currently less clear than the picture in the US .
It appears that the process of demand destruction in the US is a classic example of market failure -- not that it is a failure to reduce apparently " unnecessary " or frivolous consumption , but rather that by relying on market signals alone we are increasing the inelasticity of remaining demand and setting ourselves up for catastrophic system failure .
While anathema to the orthodoxy ( though certainly not orthopraxy ) of American capitalism , it is time to consider how we must use non-market mechanisms to plan for increasing our systemic resiliency .
While this may be unlikely to happen at a national level , the need to increase resiliency is scale - free : individuals , communities , bioregions , and nations can all benefit by the increase of resiliency at any level .
I have previously addressed one way to increase resiliency -- by addressing the Problem of Growth that tends to " eat up " systemic resiliency .
In this post I also recommended policy programs that would first transition our most inelastic demand to reliable , domestic , and renewable sources of energy .
If there is a " so what ? " point to this post , that is it : rather than work to create viable , stable , renewable substitutes to the more elastic components of oil demand , we would be better served by focusing subsidies and research grants on replacing our most inelastic demand first .
Implement policy and subsidy as necessary to replace or eliminate the most inelastic sources of demand first -- the exact opposite of what the market would do , but the best way to increase systemic resiliency .
UCLA mathematicians appear to have won a $ 100,000 prize from the Electronic Frontier Foundation for discovering a 13 - million - digit prime number that has long been sought by computer users .
While the prize money is nothing special , the bragging rights for discovering the 46th known Mersenne prime are huge .
“ We ’re delighted , ” said UCLA ’s Edson Smith , leader of the effort .
“ Now we ’re looking for the next one , despite the odds , ” which are thought to be about one in 150,000 that any number tested will be a Mersenne prime .
Prime numbers are those , like three , seven and 11 , that are divisible only by themselves and one .
Mersenne primes , named after the 17th century French mathematician Marin Mersenne , who discovered them , take the form 2P - 1 , where P is also a prime number .

In the new UCLA prime , P = 43,112,609 .
Thousands of people around the world have been participating in the Great Internet Mersenne Prime Search , or GIMPS , in which underused computing power is harnessed to perform the complex and tedious calculations needed to find Mersenne primes .
The prize is being offered for finding the first Mersenne prime with more than 10 million digits .
Smith and his UCLA colleagues have , since last fall , harnessed the power of the 75 machines in the university ’s Program in Computing / Math Lab , which is used by students for computer projects .
Smith realized that the lab was using only a fraction of its available processing power .
Rather than let it go to waste , he and his colleagues decided to use it for the GIMPS project .
The new Mersenne prime was discovered Aug. 23 on a Dell Optiplex 745 running Windows XP .
It was verified by a different computer system running a different algorithm .

The new prime is the eighth Mersenne prime discovered at UCLA .
In 1952 , mathematician Raphael Robinson found five of them using UCLA ’s Standards Western Automatic Computer .
They were the 13th through 17th Mersenne primes discovered , the first ones found in more than 75 years and the first to be discovered using a digital computer .
Each had a few hundred digits .
In 1961 , mathematician Alexander Hurwitz discovered two more , each with more than 1,200 digits , on the university ’s IBM 7090 mainframe .
The Electronic Frontier Foundation is an activist group supporting individual rights on the Web .
The group established a series of prizes in 1999 to promote cooperative computing on the Web .

In case your were wondering , it appears as though Barack Obama is totally fed up with the mainstream media right along with us .
In fact , he 's asking us to do something unprecedented in Presidential elections -- to target ( read : boycott ) media that runs the ' William Ayers ' attack ad .
We knew that the swiftboat attacks were inevitable but now we know damn well that we can help Barack defend himself as we should .
All we have to do is turn off the TV .
More details from Politico below .
the primary objective of Republican strategists is to portray Senator Barack Obama as a threat to our national security .
the cable networks have been scouring the streets in search of hostile protesters that could be linked to Obama in a way that undermines his peaceful grassroots movement for change
The recent William Ayers ad plays on the theme of Obama - is - the - enemy and highlights the Republican platform in 2008 .
Some Republican Billionaire and accomplice of the Swiftboat Veterans for Truth paid for the Ayers ad .
Fortunately for us , the Obama campaign is making good on its promise to prevent McSame 's efforts to extend the reign of Bush through the same old lies and tricks .
From Politico : Obama ’s campaign has written the Department of Justice demanding a criminal investigation of the “ American Issues Project , ”
Furthermore , the Obama camp has also written 2 letters to news networks
Here is the key of the whole article from Politico and the essence of the message from our most excellent Presidential nominee :
" The Obama campaign plans to punish the stations that air the ad financially , an Obama aide said , organizing his supporters to target the stations that air it and their advertisers . "
So far we have 93,000 emails from people like you and me supporting this target ( read : boycott ) .
KEEP UP THE GOOD FIGHT !
Note : CNN and Fox News would not comment on their willing participation in this unpatriotic , dangerous and possibly illegal attack on Obama .

AS I went on vacation at the end of July , Barack Obama was leading John McCain by three to four percentage points in national polls .
When I returned last week he still was .
But lo and behold , a whole new plot twist had rolled off the bloviation assembly line in those intervening two weeks : Obama had lost the election !
The poor guy should be winning in a landslide against the despised party of Bush - Cheney , and he ’s not .
He should be passing the 50 percent mark in polls , and he ’s not .
He ’s been done in by that ad with Britney and Paris and by a new international crisis that allows McCain to again flex his Manchurian Candidate military cred .
Let the neocons identify a new battleground for igniting World War III , whether Baghdad or Tehran or Moscow , and McCain gets with the program as if Angela Lansbury has just dealt him the Queen of Hearts .
Obama has also been defeated by racism ( again ) .
He ca n’t connect and “ close the deal ” with ordinary Americans too doltish to comprehend a multicultural biography that includes what Cokie Roberts of ABC News has damned as the “ foreign , exotic place ” of Hawaii .
As The Economist sums up the received wisdom , “ lunch - pail Ohio Democrats ” find Obama ’s ideas of change “ airy - fairy ” and are all asking , “ Who on earth is this guy ? ”
It seems almost churlish to look at some actual facts .
No presidential candidate was breaking the 50 percent mark in mid-August polls in 2004 or 2000 .
Obama ’s average lead of three to four points is marginally larger than both John Kerry ’s and Al Gore ’s leads then ( each was winning by one point in Gallup surveys ) .
Obama is also ahead of Ronald Reagan in mid-August 1980 ( 40 percent to Jimmy Carter ’s 46 ) .
At Pollster.com , which aggregates polls and gauges the electoral count , Obama as of Friday stood at 284 electoral votes , McCain at 169 .
That means McCain could win all 85 electoral votes in current toss - up states and still lose the election .
PRINCETON , NJ --
The latest Gallup Poll Daily tracking results for Sept. 10 - 12 show the race now statistically tied , with John McCain at 47 % and Barack Obama at 45 % among registered voters .
These results , based on interviewing conducted Wednesday through Friday , indicate that the presidential contest is -- for now , at any rate -- settling back into the close race that it was before the two weeks that marked both candidates ' selections of their vice presidential running mates and the two conventions .
In the weekend before the Democratic convention , the race was tied 45 % to 45 % .
Now , as the " convention dust " is settling , the race is at 47 % McCain , 45 % Obama , only slightly different .
During the time period of the conventions , of course , the race underwent predictable " bounces " -- first for Obama , who at one point had moved out to an eight percentange point lead , and then for McCain , who moved out to a five - point lead .
Now , it appears that the structure of the race -- after all the sturm und drang of the convention period -- ends up not all that different than when the conventions began .
Recent days have seen intense media focus on Republican vice presidential candidate Sarah Palin 's widely publicized television interviews with Charles Gibson of ABC News , hard - hitting television ads , and the usual campaign back and forth .
The next major planned event involving both candidates will be the first presidential debate on Sept. 26 .

BAGHDAD ( Reuters ) - A suicide bomber in an explosive vest killed 25 people at a dinner banquet in western Baghdad ’s Sunni Arab Abu Ghraib district on Sunday , police said .
Slideshow ( 2 images )
The attack , the biggest in weeks , took place at the home of a local sheikh who was holding the feast to celebrate the release of his son from U.S. detention , police said .
They said women and children were among the dead , as were some men believed to be members of U.S. - backed neighborhood patrols .
Police colonel Dawood Suleiman in the nearby city of Fallujah gave the initial death toll as 21 .
A police source in Baghdad who declined to give his name later said 25 had died and 32 were injured .
Iraqi police said U.S. helicopters had flown in to evacuate the wounded .
Abu Ghraib is a largely Sunni Arab district located between central Baghdad and Fallujah on the highway heading west from the capital into Anbar province , an area once in the grip of al Qaeda but now controlled by U.S. - backed tribal groups .
U.S. and Iraqi authorities say suicide bombings are the signature tactic of al Qaeda Sunni Arab militants , who frequently target other Sunnis since Sunni tribes turned against them over the past two years .
Iraq has become far less dangerous over the past year , but militants still retain the capability to conduct large - scaled bombings .
Four roadside bombs in other parts of Iraq -- a double bomb attack in central Baghdad and two separate strikes in Diyala province north of the capital -- killed 11 people on Sunday .
Diyala , where U.S. forces say al Qaeda has regrouped since being pushed out of other parts of the country , has been the scene of a major crackdown by U.S. - backed Iraqi forces and a bombing campaign by militants over the past few weeks .
Last week , Congress passed and the President signed the Emergency Economic Stabilization Act of 2008 ( the EESA ) .
Under the EESA , the Secretary of the Treasury is authorized to spend billions to purchase and manage troubled assets from financial institutions .
These troubled assets  developed from government - encouraged lending practices whereby mortgages were granted with practically zero down payments and minimal concern the about buyers  monthly income relative to their monthly payment amounts .
Americans bought McMansions they could not afford and the banks were left holding worthless commercial paper .
The debate over the EESA covered many subjects : executive compensation , the global economy , markets v. government planning , the importance of home ownership , etcetera .
Strangely missing from the debate was any meaningful discussion of the constitutionality of the EESA .
Whence does Congress derive the authority to give the Secretary of the Treasury the power to purchase and manage billions of dollars worth of private assets ?
Questions of constitutionality are unfortunately given short shrift by our leaders .
With any bill especially one as momentous as the EESA it should be the first question debated .
The Constitution is the fundamental law of the United States .
It was adopted not by state governments or legislatures , but by the people of the states assembled in convention and wielding sovereign authority .
Hence , the Constitution is not merely a framework of government , but the final word of the people on what powers the federal government may and may not exercise .
Today , many Americans see issues of constitutionality as belonging to the courts .
We must not forget , nor should our leaders , that all three branches of the national government ( Congress , the President , and the judiciary ) take an oath to support and defend the Constitution .
Constitutional interpretation and fidelity are as much the business of Congress as they are the business of the judges .
Congress powers are enumerated in Article I , Section 8 of the Constitution .
A number of specific powers are listed ( e.g. , coining money , establishing a post office , raising armies ) , but nothing is mentioned about intervening in private markets and managing large portfolios of assets .
According to James Madison , the powers of Congress were carefully enumerated so that the federal government can only operate in certain cases . 
Unfortunately , over the years Congress has become so used to exercising plenary authority that no one even discusses the basis of its power to act .
Questions of constitutionality were not raised by congressional leaders , the mainstream media , or by the presidential campaigns of John McCain and Barack Obama .
The peoples fundamental law received the silent treatment .
Enumerated powers aside , the national debate also ignored the EESAs lack of standards for directing the broad grant of discretion to the Treasury Secretary .
Even if one assumes that Congress may meddle in private markets at will , the method employed under the EESA is legally suspect .
Under separation of powers principles , legislative power typically cannot be exercised by members of the executive branch or the judiciary .
The Supreme Court , however , permits some delegation by Congress as long as Congress provides an intelligible principle to guide the executive branch officials .
With the EESA , the Secretary of the Treasury is given czar - like power over a large segment of the private market .
The purchase and management of bank assets is left to his best judgment .
Congress delegation of power under the EESA raises serious separation - of - powers concerns and threatens to improperly mix legislative and executive authority .
Americans should be concerned that a constitutional discussion was completely absent from the national debate about the bailout package .
The EESA is the largest government intervention in the private economy in the history of the United States it makes FDRs New Deal and President Trumans seizure of the steel mills look like Mickey Mouse .
Before our leaders ever reached the pros and cons of the bailout , they should have carefully examined the Constitution and considered whether the people ever delegated such broad powers to the national government .
Sadly , our fundamental law was never part of the discussion .
Undoubtedly , the bailout package will have long - term effects on the American economy .
The greatest impact , however , is the loss of any real constraint on government power .
If the Constitution is not consulted or debated when the government seeks to acquire and manage billions in private assets , then we may safely assume that there are no limits on Congress powers .
Untrammeled government authority not economic stabilization will be the lasting legacy of this Wall Street bailout .

When singerfound out that her new single White Horse would be featured on the first episode of ABC season five drama Grey 's Anatomy , she did what most teenagers would do .
She jumped up and down screaming , sobbing hysterically and hugging strangers in a hotel lobby .
Really .
The musical phenom loves the show and admits that her obsession can be embarrassing .
She was not able to enjoy last night 's season premiere in real time because of a concert commitment in Tulsa , Oklahoma .

“ Until He Comes ” by Rick Taylor on Herald Records .
Taylor quickly released his follow - up album , “ Rick Comes ” which critics called “ a mess ” and fans dismissed as “ over the top . ”
Unfortunately , his career ended prematurely , though he did make a brief comeback attempt in the early 80’s with the forgettable “ The Softer Side of Rick Tayor . ”

The Wall Street Journal is reporting Treasury Relents on Key Points .
The Bush administration and the Democratic Congress inched closer to agreement on a $ 700 billion plan to rescue troubled financial firms , with the Treasury making most of the concessions amid an increasing backlash from a range of economists and lawmakers .
The administration agreed to allow tougher oversight over the cleanup and provide fresh assistance to homeowners facing foreclosure , two Democratic priorities .
In addition , negotiators neared agreement on allowing the government to take equity stakes in certain companies that participate in the rescue .
But differences remain on two big items : possible limits on executive compensation at firms taking advantage of the bailout ; and changes to bankruptcy law that would let judges adjust the terms of mortgages .
And late Monday , negotiations were slowed -- but not derailed -- as Treasury was hit with congressional Republican concerns about the direction of talks , and as Democratic leaders heard a range of concerns from rank - and - file members of their party .
The plan 's reception -- from academics , politicians and commentators of varied stripes -- has been largely hostile , weakening the administration 's negotiating position on the remaining issues .
On executive pay , Republican presidential candidate Sen. John McCain has called for limits .
Sen. Richard C. Shelby , an Alabama Republican and the ranking Republican on the Senate Banking Committee , reiterated his distaste for the plan , calling it " neither workable nor comprehensive , despite its enormous price tag . "
Sen .
Shelby , whose influential position makes his opposition a potential stumbling block , called for Congress to look for alternative solutions .
Former St. Louis Federal Reserve Bank President William Poole , a senior fellow at the free - market Cato Institute , said , " The Treasury will be stuck with the least - attractive paper , and that means taxpayer losses will be large . "
Discontent continued to simmer among rank - and - file Republicans and Democrats .
In Republican ranks , especially among conservatives , there are concerns over the cost and over the scope of powers that would be concentrated with Secretary Paulson .
" Congress needs to slow down , take a breath , " said Rep. Mike Pence , an Indiana Republican .
He acknowledges the country faces a crisis but still intends to vote against the Treasury plan .
One broad area of agreement involves congressional oversight .
Rep. Frank said the Treasury agreed to an independent board to monitor the bailout and report on its progress to Congress and the public .
The board would n't have authority to veto
Treasury investment decisions , and the bailout 's launch would n't be delayed while a board was being put in place .
There has also been discussion among some Democratic leaders of breaking apart the package , with swift initial action on about a third of the borrowing authority , a senior congressional official said .
Approval of the balance of the funding would come later this year or early next year , giving lawmakers a chance to assess the success of the bailout and consider additional long - term overhauls .

Incredible !
One of the most elegant desserts in French cooking , the moelleux is arich like awith a .
Incredible !
The chocolate moelleux [ maw - ah - luh ] is one of the most chic desserts served in French restaurants .
As it arrives on the plate , you could think this is sort of chocolate muffin , but as you open it you realize the content is liquid .
Did the chef forgot to bake it through ?
you ask yourself as you take the first bite .
And then it dvelves on you - the core is not uncooked dough , but a delicate chocolate filling .
How the hell did they manage to keep the core liquid ?
When you 'll finish reading this article , you 'll know how to make this dessert just like a French chef with the simplest equipment and a French chef 's trick .
Chocolate - Raspberry Moelleux
A recipe by Pierre Hermé
For the ganache :
125 gr raspberries , fresh or frozen
100 gr black chocolate ( about 67 % cocoa content )
30 gr cream
For the biscuit dough :
70 gr flour
200 gr chocolate ( about 67 % cocoa content )
250 gr butter
4 eggs
220 gr sugar
Yields about 12 muffin - sized moelleux
The moelleux can be prepared with various stuffings , and you could substitute the raspberries with passion fruits for instance .
Place the chocolate in a bowl floating in a pot of hot water .
Melt slowly , making sure no water enters the chocolate bowl .
Crush the raspberries in a kitchen mixer .
Filter the raspberries through a sieve to extract 100 gr juice .
Heat in a small saucepan and add the cream .
Mix the chocolate with the raspberry juice and cream and whip slowly , without adding any air , to combine the ingredients intimately .
You have just made a very light ganache [ gah - nash ] , the mixture used by chocolate makers to stuff their chocolates .
Now for the trick that makes this incredible dessert possible .
Slowly pour the chocolate - raspberry ganache through a funnel into an icecube bag .
You could also use an icecube tray .
This is quite a magical moment to see the dark mixture slowly permeate the bag , colonizing the next cell drop by drop .
Just let gravity work for you and wait until the bottom cells are completely filled .
When there is no more ganache left in your funnel , push the ganache down the bag with your fingers so that each cell is equally filled .
Tie or use adhesive tape to close the bag and place in the freezer
While the ganache cores hardens up in the freezer we 'll prepare a very wet biscuit dough .
Work the butter with a spoon until it is soft .
Work the sugar into the butter .
Melt the chocolate like explained above and add the to the sugar - butter mixture .
Add the eggs and mix .
Finally add the wee bit of flour this recipe calls for .
As you can see , this is a very wet dough .
Buy the best raspberry jam you can find , if possible with the seeds .
Here is one I buy from a lady at my local farmer 's market who makes it with her own raspberries .
Heat the oven to 170 °C and take out a wire rack .
Bring the icecube bag out and check for hardness .
You can use small cake pans but I prefer muffin pans , so that each guest receives his own moelleux .
If you have a pastry bag fill it with the biscuit dough and fill each muffin pan to about a third of its height .
You can also use a spoon to fill the pan but it will be longer and more messy .
Carefully place one teaspoon raspberry jam in the center of the third - filled pans .
Cover with a ganache ice cube .
Finish with the remaining biscuit dough to cover the icecubes .
It quite crucial for the icecube to be placed right in the middle for if it does not you will have a hole - see hereafter .
Bake in the oven for about 14 minutes .
Remove from the oven and leave for about 10 minutes to cool before you unmold .
Now is the most crucial moment .
You have to make sure the ganache filling will neither escape from the top nor from the bottom ( like this ) .
Unmold on foil or a plastic sheet .
Cut the foil around the moelleux and carefully lay them on individual serving plates .
When done , remove the foil by sliding it carefully from under the moelleux .
The biscuit is soft , rich and velvety but the core is just pure happiness - rich but not fat , chocolatty and fruity at the same time .
This is one elegant dessert for a romantic dinner .

France heaped pressure on Gordon Brown last night by floating an ambitious plan for a €300 billion ( £ 237 billion ) bailout fund to rescue crippled banks across Europe .
A d v e r t i s e m e n t
As the world held its breath on the fate of America ’s $ 700 billion bank bailout plan , President Sarkozy was seeking the backing of European leaders for his own lifeboat .
Mr Brown also faced demands for action from British banks , furious that the Irish Republic ’s unilateral guarantee of all bank savings on Tuesday was robbing them of precious deposits .
The British Bankers ’ Association , which represents high street banks , said that the move was anti-competitive and that it was raising the issue with Dublin .
Some banks would like to see the UK respond with its own explicit guarantee .
The Prime Minister has begun to set up an emergency committee to take charge of Britain ’s response to the crisis .
The body will be similar to Cobra , which is composed of ministers and government officials and meets regularly during crises such as last summer ’s floods .
Its secretariat will be run from the Cabinet Office .

Telomere length is regarded as a potential biomarker of aging ; there is a growing body of evidence indicating that shorter telomeres are associated with various diseases , including cancer , infectious disease , psychological stress , and cardiovascular disease .
In cardiovascular disease in particular this had led to the hypothesis that premature , or accelerated , aging of the vasculature is a major contributing factor .
While a handful of papers have estimated telomere length in specific vascular tissues , the numbers and sizes of samples in these studies are usually small , due to the limitations in obtaining the tissues and cells of interest .
Thus , telomere length in genomic DNA obtained from circulating leucocytes is routinely used as a proxy for telomere length in other tissues .
However , the inflammatory processes involved in disorders such as cardiovascular disease can result in increased white cell turnover , raising the possibility that the shorter telomeres measured simply reflect recent replicative activity .
As many telomere researchers ( myself included ) believe that shorter telomere length is a primary abnormality that contributes to increased risk of cardiovascular disease , evidence demonstrating a correlation in telomere length between matched samples ( leucocyte and vascular DNA from the same individual ) is always welcome .
A recent paper presented at the European Society of Cardiology and published in European Heart Journal by Wilson et al. provides just such evidence :
Blood leucocyte telomere DNA content predicts vascular telomere DNA content in humans with and without vascular disease Blood leucocyte telomere DNA content predicts vascular telomere DNA content in humans with and without vascular disease .
Aims .
Previous studies have suggested that reduced telomere length in circulating leucocytes in humans is associated with premature vascular disease and by implication , accelerated vascular ageing .
Importantly , a link between telomere length in circulating leucocytes and the blood vessel wall has never been established .
We , thus , investigated the relationship between vascular wall and circulating leucocyte telomere length in humans with and without overt vascular disease .
Methods and results .
Aortic biopsies and paired blood leucocytes were obtained from 20 patients with asymptomatic abdominal aortic aneurysms ( AAAs ) , undergoing elective open repair , and 12 morphologically normal aortas from a group of cadaveric organ donors of similar mean age .
Telomere content was compared by quantitative PCR and expressed as telomere : genomic DNA ratio .
The telomere : genomic DNA content was significantly reduced in wall biopsies of AAA vs. normal aorta , and this difference remained after adjusting for age and gender .
There were strong correlations between leucocyte and vascular telomere content when the AAA and control groups were analysed either separately or grouped irrespective of the presence of vascular disease ( r = 0.62 , P < 0.001 ) .
Conclusion .
The findings demonstrate that leucocyte DNA content is predictive of vascular telomere content and is an accurate surrogate for human vascular age .
The authors showed that subjects with abdominal aortic aneurysms ( AAA ) had decreased telomere content in their vascular tissues , relative to tissues from subjects free of aortic disease , supporting the link between dysfunctional telomeres and dysfunctional vasculature .
However , the difference in telomere content between healthy and diseased vascular tissue appears to be smaller than the difference between leucocytes from healthy and diseased subjects .
Shorter telomeres in the vasculature may predispose to developing cardiovascular disease , but has increased white cell turnover in the systemic circulation of subjects with aortic disease led to the larger observed difference ?
If so , perhaps the differences in leucocyte telomere length between cases and controls in previous association studies of cardiovascular disease have resulted in a slight over - estimate of the differences in telomere length within the vasculature .
Nevertheless , after adjusting for age there was a strong and highly significant positive correlation between tissue and leucocyte telomere length .
This is the first study of its kind to demonstrate that “ telomere attrition in blood leucocytes is indicative of similar changes in the vascular wall ” .
So , is leucocyte telomere length a suitable proxy ?
The issue of increased white cell turnover in subjects with cardiovascular disease remains critical ; adjustments for markers of inflammation ( something that was not performed in the present study ) are crucial in downstream analysis and interpretation of results if the impact of cell turnover ( and the associated telomere attrition ) is to be assessed .
However , the data presented certainly indicate that differences in telomere length observed in circulating blood cells are reflected in the vasculature , providing support for the validity of previous association studies .
The probability is growing that the global economyâ € ” not just the United Statesâ € ” will experience a serious recession .
Recent developments suggest that all G7 economies are already in recession or close to tipping into one .
Other advanced economies or emerging markets ( the rest of the euro zone ; New Zealand , Iceland , Estonia , Latvia , and some Southeast European economies ) are also nearing a recessionary hard landing .
When they reach it , there will be a sharp slowdown in the BRICs ( Brazil , Russia , India , and China ) and other emerging markets .
This looming global recession is being fed by several factors : the collapse of housing bubbles in the United States , United Kingdom , Spain , Ireland , and other euro - zone members ; punctured credit bubbles where money and credit was too easy for too long ; the severe credit and liquidity crunch following the U.S. mortgage crisis ; the negative wealth and investment effects of falling stock markets ( already down by more than 20 percent globally ) ; the global effects via trade links of the recession in the United States ( which still counts for about 30 percent of global GDP ) ; the U.S. dollar 's weakness , which reduces American trading partners ' competitiveness ; and the stagflationary effects of high oil and commodity prices , which are forcing central banks to increase interest rates to fight inflation at a time when there are severe downside risks to growth and financial stability .
Official data suggest that the U.S. economy entered into a recession in the first quarter of this year .
The economy reboundedâ€ ” in a double - dip , W - shaped recessionâ € ” in the second quarter , boosted by the temporary effects on consumption of $ 100 billion in tax rebates .
But those effects will fade by late summer .
The United Kingdom , Spain , and Ireland are experiencing similar developments , with housing bubbles deflating and excessive consumer debt undercutting retail sales , thus leading to recession .
Even in Italy , France , Greece , Portugal , Iceland , and the Baltic states , frothy housing markets are starting to slacken .
Small wonder , then , that production , sales , and consumer and business confidence are falling throughout the euro zone .
Elsewhere , Japan is contracting , too .
Japan used to grow modestly for two reasons : strong exports to the United States and a weak yen .
Now , exports to the United States are falling while the yen has strengthened .
Moreover , high oil prices in a country that imports all of its oil needs , together with falling business profitability and confidence , are pushing Japan into a recession .
The last of the G7 economies , Canada , should have benefited from high energy and commodity prices , but its GDP shrank in the first quarter , owing to the contracting U.S. economy .
Indeed , three quarters of Canada 's exports go to the United States , while foreign demand accounts for a quarter of its GDP .
So every G7 economy is now headed toward recession .
Other smaller economies ( mostly the new members of the European Union , which all have large current - account deficits ) risk a sudden reversal of capital inflows ; this may already be occurring in Latvia and Estonia , as well as in Iceland and New Zealand .
This G7 recession will lead to a sharp growth slowdown in emerging markets and likely tip the overall global economy into a recession .
Those economies that are dependent on exports to the United States and Europe and that have large current - account surpluses ( China , most of Asia , and most other emerging markets ) will suffer from the G7 recession .
Those with large current - account deficits ( India , South Africa , and more than 20 economies in East Europe from the Baltics to Turkey ) may suffer from the global credit crunch .
Commodity exporters ( Russia , Brazil , and others in the Middle East , Asia , Africa , and Latin America ) will suffer as the G7 recession and global slowdown drive down energy and other commodity prices by as much as 30 percent .
Countries that allowed their currencies to appreciate relative to the dollar will experience a sharp slowdown in export growth .
Those experiencing rising and now double - digit inflation will have to raise interest rates , while other high - inflation countries will lose export competitiveness .
Falling oil and commodity pricesâ€ ” already down 15 percent from their peaksâ€ ” will somewhat reduce stagflationary forces in the global economy , yet inflation is becoming more entrenched via a vicious circle of rising prices , wages , and costs .
This will constrain the ability of central banks to respond to the downside risks to growth .
In advanced economies , however , inflation will become less of a problem for central banks by the end of this year , as slack in product markets reduces firms ' pricing power and higher unemployment constrains wage growth .
To be sure , all G7 central banks are worried about the temporary rise in headline inflation , and all are threatening to hike interest rates .
Nevertheless , the risk of a severe recessionâ € ” and of a serious banking and financial crisisâ€ ” will ultimately force all G7 central banks to cut rates .
The problem is that , especially outside the US , this monetary loosening will occur only when the G7 and global recession become entrenched .
Thus , the policy response will be too little , and will come too late , to prevent it .

The convention is an opportunity to show the American people what we stand for as a party and unite around our shared values .
In addition to fulfilling their nominating duties , Democratic Party members from across the country will also work together during the convention to adopt the official 2020 Democratic Party platform .
In July 2007 , Vijay and Supriti Soni of Corona del Mar paid $ 440,000 for a home at 2129 W. Civic Center Drive in Santa Ana .
Five weeks later , they resold the house to Javier Hernandez – the family gardener and handyman – for $ 660,000 .
That ’s a 50 percent gain in 38 days – at a time when real estate prices in Santa Ana were plunging .
But the lender that financed both mortgages – Washington Mutual Bank – took a bath .
In March of this year Hernandez ’s loan went into default and in July the bank foreclosed .
On the trustee ’s deed , the bank listed the home ’s value at $ 377,137 – $ 220,000 less than the outstanding loan .
Records show that Washington Mutual , America ’s largest savings and loan and one of its most precariously perched lending institutions , financed at least 43 mortgages worth $ 24.5 million on properties bought and sold by members of the Soni family since early 2007 .
Of the 22 homes sold in that period , at least six have become problems for Washington Mutual : Four were foreclosed , one received a notice of default and another was listed for sale at a $ 260,000 loss .
Total value of WaMu ’s mortgages on the troubled properties : $ 2.7 million .

Washington Mutual ’s lending practices resembled many other home loan institutions that have run into trouble , such as IndyMac Bank , which failed in July , and Countrywide Financial Corp. , which was rescued in a January merger with Bank of America .
They all offered complex adjustable - rate and subprime mortgages , approving many of the loans with limited scrutiny .
When soaring numbers of borrowers were unable to repay or refinance their loans , the banks collapsed .
A quality control problem
WaMu ’s $ 310 billion in assets , its diverse loan portfolio , its large base of depositors and conservative risk management were supposed to protect the thrift from collapse .
Now it appears to be the next domino in the row .
WaMu said it is investigating the Soni family ‘s transactions as part of a fraud scheme , and maintained that those loans are not a symptom of larger problems .
“ We have extensive controls in place to protect the integrity of our portfolio and loan processes , ” WaMu spokeswoman Sara Gaugl said .
“ We are continually enhancing our efforts to identify and prevent any potential illegal activity . “
But lending analysts said the Soni family ’s transactions raise troubling questions about standards at the Seattle - based thrift , which could face a federal takeover if it can not find a new source of credit .
The distressed WaMu properties would then belong to the taxpayers .
“ This is a quality control problem , ” said Paul Leonard of the Center for Responsible Lending ’s California office .
“ It certainly is curious WaMu ’s fraud detection system did n’t pick this up .
It looks very bad and it is bad .
The question is how widespread it is . ”
No criminal background checks
Leonard and others said the Sonis ’ transactions probably escaped notice because Washington Mutual , like many other lenders :
Allowed financing of property flips that occur less than 90 days after purchase .
The Federal Housing Administration imposed a ban on financing 90 - day flips in 2006 .
The FHA also requires a second appraisal for homes sold at a 100 percent gain less than 180 days after purchase .
Relied heavily on imperfect fraud detection software .
Computers are good at flagging statistical aberrations – such as unrealistic income statements – but can be deceived by knowledgeable and determined insiders .
Did not check criminal backgrounds .
The Sonis had been convicted in 2003 of numerous felonies for a real estate fraud scheme .
WaMu checks criminal backgrounds of loan originators , such as outside mortgage brokers , but not borrowers .
Last month , District Attorney investigators raided the family ’s homes and business offices .
Now , prosecutors are investigating the Sonis and other members of their family for criminal behavior .
“ Unfortunately , we are back looking at these characters again , ” said Doug Brannan , the deputy Orange County District attorney who prosecuted the Sonis in 2003 .
Washington Mutual declined to answer specific questions about the Soni family case .
“ This is an active investigation and we are fully cooperating with local law enforcement regarding this matter , ” Gaugl said .
“ We will not tolerate misrepresentation or fraud of any kind , and will aggressively pursue all legal means available to combat these offenses . ”
Tightened standards ?
Washington Mutual once aimed to be the Starbucks of banking : A shop in every neighborhood ; lending that was as simple as buying a double decaf latte .
That was before the mortgage lending industry began to implode .
In mid-2007 , WaMu ’s then chief executive officer , Kerry Killinger , boasted that his company had tightened lending standards to protect itself from the darkening real estate market .
“ It ’s been over two years since we first began talking to you about housing prices becoming inflated and of the high risk of a slowdown in housing with price declines in some parts of the country , ” Killinger said during his July 2007 quarterly earnings call .
“ As a result , we started to take actions to minimize our exposure , including tightening our underwriting . ”
It seems to have been too little , too late .
This summer , the bank reported a $ 4.8 billion loss in the first half of 2008 due mostly to souring home loans .
On Sept. 11 , the company ousted Killinger and said it was setting aside $ 4.5 billion for losses in the third quarter of this year .
Credit - rating agencies downgraded the bank ’s bond rating to junk status .
The stock sank to $ 2 on Sept. 15 , from a high of $ 39.25 a year ago .
Last week , the bank put itself up for sale .
48 percent gain in 92 days
The Soni family ’s transactions with WaMu , which took place from early 2007 through March of this year , indicate that Washington Mutual continued making risky loans long after its underwriting standards were supposedly tightened , said James Barth , a senior finance fellow at the Milken Institute in Santa Monica .
“ Lending institutions had an obligation to do due diligence to make sure the borrower can repay the loan , especially in 2007 and 2008 when they knew there was a mortgage meltdown taking place , ” Barth said .
Home prices in Santa Ana peaked in 2006 and have fallen more than 40 percent since .
While those prices were plummeting , members of the Sonis ’ family never sold for a loss .
A Register analysis of 22 Santa Ana properties flipped by the family in the past two years shows a total gain on sale of $ 3.7 million .
Average gain : 48 percent .
Average time between purchase and sale : 92 days .
Todd Lackner , a San Diego mortgage fraud investigator who has examined the transaction records , said the common thread of WaMu funding makes the Sonis ’ transactions even more disturbing .
“ To me , it looks as if WaMu had a failed policy of funding these flip transactions at drastically inflated prices , ” said Lackner , who furnished grand jury testimony about the real estate scheme that led to the 2005 bribery conviction of U.S. Rep.
Randall “ Duke ” Cunningham .
“ I find that disgusting .
Any idiot can see these sale prices are excessive . ”
Suit says WaMu picked appraisers
The FBI says mortgage fraud reports increased 31 percent nationally in fiscal 2007 , totaling 46,717 incidents with an estimated loss of $ 813 million .
“ During declining markets , mortgage fraud perpetrators may take advantage of industry personnel attempting to generate loans to maintain current standards of living , ” the FBI ’s annual fraud report said .
If , like most contemporary lenders , Washington Mutual continued to rely on fraud detection software to catch problems , it was n’t hard to slip under the radar , said Ann Fulmer , vice president for Interthinx , an Agoura Hills fraud detection company used by lenders .
Banks do n’t check criminal backgrounds of buyers or sellers , because it would be too expensive , Fulmer said .
People with experience – in real estate sales , appraisals , finance and escrow – know how to game the system , she said .
With a little creativity and an Internet search , they can obtain phony employment , tax and financial documents for loan applicants .
“ The problem with technology , it ’s very easy to fabricate documents to get them through , ” Fulmer said .
“ It ’s not a matter of what controls you put up .
If someone is determined and they know how to work inside the system and they ’re ethically challenged , there ’s no way to stop them . ”
In the past two years , Soni family members took out a total 14 mortgages with Wells Fargo , Countrywide Home Loans , Downey Savings & Loan , J.P. Morgan Chase Bank and HSBC Mortgage Corp .
But Washington Mutual was their preferred lender , with triple that number of loans .
One possible reason is suggested in a lawsuit filed in November by New York Attorney General Andrew Cuomo .
The suit claims that Washington Mutual had a history of pressuring appraisers to give properties high valuations so it could make more money .
The suit alleges that eAppraisIT , a subsidiary of Santa Ana - based First American Corp. , was strong - armed by WaMu into using pre-approved appraisers who offered higher property values for sales financed by the bank .
The suit says eAppraisIT caved because WaMu was its largest customer , paying for 262,000 appraisals between early 2006 and October 2007 .
“ By allowing Washington Mutual to hand - pick appraisers who inflated values , First American helped set the current mortgage crisis in motion , ” Cuomo said .
First American said Cuomo ’s allegations were “ largely based on a handful of emails that have been taken out of context or mischaracterized . ”
Washington Mutual ’s Gaugl said : “ After investigating these allegations , we can say with confidence that there has been no systematic effort by WaMu to inflate home appraisals . ”
That case is pending in New York State Supreme Court .
ID theft to buy a Mercedes
In August 2003 , an Orange County Superior Court jury found Vijay and Supriti Soni guilty of forgery , falsifying real estate documents , identity theft and grand theft .
Vijay Soni was sentenced to a year in jail .
He also surrendered his real estate license .
Supriti Soni was convicted on 19 counts in the case and sentenced to three years in prison .
Brannan , who prosecuted the case , said their scheme “ took advantage of their clients ’ trust when they exploited the unsuspecting customers ’ information for their own financial gain .
They left these families with large financial liabilities , goods and property purchased in their name without their knowledge , many hidden costs , and a huge amount of grief to clean up their credit . ”
Supriti Soni appealed , but her conviction was upheld .
The appeals court said that , under various names , the Sonis “ obtained confidential information from various people – one of whom worked for Vijay and the rest who were clients for properties or mortgages – and then used it to acquire furniture , loan proceeds and commissions , real estate deeds and commissions , a Mercedes Benz automobile and cash for themselves . ”
A Superior Court judge later agreed to reduce seven of the 15 felony counts against Vijay Soni to misdemeanors .
Homes and offices raided
On their Web site , Vijay and Supriti Soni posted a message :
“ Supriti Soni and Vijay Soni of Orange County have been acquitted of all charges and allegations .
Supriti and Vijay Soni have been in Real Estate Business for many years and have been extremely successful .
On their way toward success they were put under radar and charged with false allegations .
Through the Internet using search engines their reputation as a successful and an honest business people were compromised .
However the final judgment reveals that Supriti and Vijay Soni are innocent and acquitted of all charges and allegations . ”
Attached was a document showing that eight of Vijay ’s felony convictions had been reduced to misdemeanors .
Soni ’s attorney , Shirley Macdonald Juarez , told the Register she asked Soni to remove the Web posting , because it implies he has no felonies on his record .
In fact , eight felony convictions remain .
On Aug. 7 , 2008 , investigators from the Orange County District Attorney ’s office and state Franchise Tax Board served search warrants on nine locations , including the homes of the Sonis , her mother Sushama Lohia and the family of her sister Suniti Shah plus four family companies – SL Realty , California Escrow , New Age Realty and First Priority Escrow .
They carted out 154 cardboard boxes and 40 computers filled with evidence .
Family members declined to comment for this story , citing the advice of attorneys .
“ I ’m confident that the facts will reveal that Mr. Soni has not engaged in any wrongdoing , ” said Vincent LaBarbera , Vijay Soni ’s attorney .
Intra-family flipping
In the past two years , the Soni family essentially created their own market in Santa Ana by flipping enough homes in a small area , said Lackner , the appraisal fraud specialist .
In at least three cases , homes flipped from one family member to another – sales later used by appraisers to give credibility to high asking prices for other properties in the area .
One example : Lohia bought the bank - owned house at 827 S. Flower for $ 249,500 on Jan .
4 . She sold it 20 days later for $ 575,000 to her daughter , Suniti Shah , who financed the purchase with a $ 488,750 Washington Mutual mortgage .
That was a 121 percent increase in less than three weeks .
“ Selling to each other , that ’s something an appraiser should definitely discover , ” said Mike Sanders , a Laguna Beach real estate appraiser and expert witness in property value litigation cases .
“ If the appraiser finds all the same people ’s names on transactions , then that ’s something suspicious . ”
No money down
Vijay Soni provided another clue to his success at selling homes in a falling market :
They made the down payments for the buyers .
In an interview in June with the India Journal , Soni said his “ liquidation company ” bought foreclosed properties in Santa Ana , Riverside and Corona and sold them by offering “ 10 percent down free money to any qualified buyer .
With this big burden out of the way , they only have to worry about coming up with their monthly mortgage . ”
That would be the equivalent of 100 percent financing , experts said .
If loan documents do not fully disclose who made the down payment , it would misrepresent the purchaser ’s stake in the property and potentially is a form of criminal fraud or theft , said Fulmer of Interthinx .
“ Unfortunately , the bank does n’t know it ’s 100 percent financing , ” she added .
Documents show that all of the family ’s sales through Washington Mutual indicated that the buyer paid a down payment of 10 to 20 percent .
“ Up against a wall ”
But Elijio Servin Rojas told
The Register that he never made a down payment on the home he bought in November for $ 640,000 from Sushama Lohia .
Records show he paid at least $ 64,200 before closing .
Servin Rojas said he was renting when Lohia persuaded him to buy last year .
He said he has fallen behind on payments on the $ 575,800 mortgage from Washington Mutual .
He received a notice of default in July .
“ I ’m up against a wall , ” Servin Rojas , a tile worker who has been working only part time , said in Spanish .
“ They ’re just going to take away our house . ”
The Sonis were positioned to escape detection if in fact no money changed hands – because Lohia , a licensed real estate broker , also served as escrow agent on the transactions .
One alleged instance is detailed in a lawsuit filed in Orange County Superior Court in May after the Sonis unsuccessfully bid on a $ 13 million Newport Coast mansion .
The check bounced
Documents in the suit , filed by the home ’s seller Dr. William Dobkin , allege the Sonis deposited $ 450,000 as earnest money with California Escrow , an arm of Lohia ’s SL Realty .
But when Dobkin asked for the money as the first step of the sale , California Escrow failed to produce the cash , the suit says .
Vijay Soni then wrote a personal check for $ 460,000 to cover the debt .
The check bounced .
“ We ’ve determined , and they ’ve admitted , that the funds are no longer there – if they ever were , ” Dobkin ’s attorney , Jeffrey Simon , said of the California Escrow account .
Soni ’s attorney , Allan Leguay , said the case is not about fraud , but whether Dobkin can demonstrate he suffered a financial loss .
The lawsuit has been sent to arbitration .
Witness in identity theft case
In August , an investigator from Washington Mutual told Angel Enrique Torres that his name was on a bank account and real estate in Texas .
“ I do n’t know where that came from , ” Torres told the Register .
Torres ’ name is also on three Santa Ana properties purchased from the Sonis and their relatives , all financed with Washington Mutual mortgages .
One of the homes was foreclosed in July .
He said he has fallen behind on the payments of a second home .
County records show Torres refinanced his home at 339 S. Garnsey with a $ 496,000 mortgage from Washington Mutual in June 2007 .
Torres told a reporter he was unaware of the refinancing deal .
Torres is part of another family whose members both worked for the Sonis and bought properties from them and their relatives , using Washington Mutual financing .
His sister , Sara Torres , bought 1609 W. Raymar from Supriti Soni for $ 640,000 .
That ’s $ 111,000 more than Soni paid for the property five days earlier .
Sara Torres was a key witness in the identity theft case against the Sonis .
In 2000 , she filed a complaint with the City of Orange Police alleging the Sonis put her name on a deed without her consent and applied online for a $ 10,000 loan in her name .
But when Supriti Soni appealed her conviction , Sara Torres wrote to the judge that her police complaint resulted from a misunderstanding .
“ Gentle , harmless and giving ”
In court documents , Torres described herself as the cousin of Patricia Cruz Hernandez , whose husband was the Sonis ’ gardener , Javier Hernandez .
Hernandez purchased two Santa Ana homes from the Sonis in 2007 : 2129 w. Civic Center Dr. and 517 S. Garnsey St. Both are now in foreclosure .
Before the Sonis ’ sentencing in 2003 , Javier Hernandez wrote a letter to the judge in Spanish urging mercy .
“ I do n’t have words to express what good people they are , ” his letter said .
Sushama Lohia also wrote to the judge about her daughter and son - in - law .
“ They have become prey of misunderstanding and jealousy of heartless people .
If you watch them closely , you will find them gentle , harmless and giving . ”

CHICAGO ( Reuters ) - U.S. Democratic presidential candidate Barack Obama raised a record $ 66 million in August , a campaign spokesman said on Sunday .
US Democratic presidential nominee Senator Barack Obama ( D - IL ) speaks to the audience during a rally at Veterans Memorial Park in Manchester , New Hampshire , September 13 , 2008 .
REUTERS / Neal Hamberg
The latest figures may bolster expectations of a money advantage that Obama could have over Republican candidate John McCain in the final two months before the November 4 election .
Opinion polls show that the race between Obama , an Illinois senator , and McCain , an Arizona Republican is dead even .
Obama spokesman Bill Burton said the August figure was helped by 500,000 new donors .
The tally for the latest month exceeded the $ 55 million for February , which marked a record for Obama and an all - time high for any presidential candidate during a primary .
After far surpassing McCain in private fundraising , earlier this year Obama opted against taking public funds for the final stretch of the campaign .
McCain , who chose to take public financing , has access to an infusion of $ 84 million from a government presidential election fund for the period between the Republican convention and the November 4 election .
In August , his last month of private fundraising , McCain took in $ 47 million , a record for his campaign and a number that was helped by his announcement of his running mate , Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin .
Despite his prodigious private fundraising , Obama may not have as much of an advantage as he would when it comes to the amount of money he will have available to spend on advertisements and get - out - the vote efforts .
McCain benefits from money contributed to the coffers of the Republican National Committee , which has been more successful at raising money than the Democratic Party .
The need to raise money privately also means Obama needs to take more time off the trail to headline events with donors .
On Tuesday , Obama is attending a glitzy Beverly Hills fundraiser that will include a performance by singer - actress Barbra Streisand , a long - time Democratic activist .
That event could be one of the biggest Democratic fundraisers of the election cycle .
The Obama campaign said its cash on hand at the end of August was more than $ 77 million and that its total number of donors is now 2.5 million .

LIKE THE EXHORTATIONS OF JEREMIAH TO THE NATION OF Israel before the first temple 's destruction , the warnings of economist Nouriel Roubini fell on deaf ears .
For the past two years Roubini , a professor at New York University , has cautioned about a huge housing bubble whose bursting would lead to a 20 % drop in home prices ; a collapse in subprime mortgages ; a severe banking crisis and credit crunch ; the near - failure of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac , and a U.S. recession of a magnitude not seen since the Great Depression .
So far , this latter - day prophet of doom has been on the mark , though time will tell about the recession part .
A Turkish native who grew up in Italy , Roubini trained at Harvard and later advised the Clinton White House , after his blog on the Asian financial crisis attracted the attention of Washington 's economic and political elite .
Roubini still publishes the blog -- the RGE Monitor -- and teaches economics at NYU 's Stern School of Business .
We caught up with him recently at his offices in lower Manhattan , and continued the conversation at Barron's .
For his latest predictions , please read on .
" A systemic banking crisis will go on for a while , with hundreds of banks going belly - up . "
-- Nouriel Roubini Chris Casaburi
Barron's : Unfortunately for the rest of us , you have a pretty good track record .
How much more misery lies ahead ?
Roubini :
We are in the second inning of a severe , protracted recession , which started in the first quarter of this year and is going to last at least 18 months , through the middle of next year .
A systemic banking crisis will go on for awhile , with hundreds of banks going belly up .
Which banks , specifically , will fail ?
I do n't want to name names , but many , given the housing bust , will become insolvent .
Their losses are mounting because they have written down only their subprime loans so far .
They have n't started writing down most of their consumer - credit losses , and reserves for losses are much less than they should have been .
The banks are playing all sorts of accounting gimmicks not to recognize them .
There are hundreds of millions of dollars outstanding in home - equity loans that eventually could be worth zero , too .
So far , we have seen no recession in the technical sense : two consecutive quarters of negative growth in real GDP .
Why not ?
The definition of a recession is n't only two consecutive quarters of negative growth .
The NBER ( National Bureau of Economic Research ) puts a lot of emphasis on things like employment , and employment has already fallen for seven months in a row .
It also emphasizes income and retail and wholesale sales .
Many of these things are declining .
Maybe the recession started in January ; if you look at the data on gross domestic product on a monthly basis between February and April , GDP was falling .
Saying this is not a recession is just a joke .
Maybe instead of a ' U ' recession and recovery , it will be a ' W , ' with a rebound in the second quarter .
But by the third quarter , the effect of the government 's tax rebates is totally gone , because other forces on the consumer are more persistent and negative .
Which forces , for instance ?
The U.S. consumer is shopped out and saving less .
Debt to disposable income has risen to 140 % from 100 % in 2000 .
Hit by falling home prices , the consumer no longer can use his house as an ATM machine .
The stock market is falling and ( issuance of ) home - equity loans ( has ) collapsed .
We have a credit crunch in mortgages , and gas is around $ 4 a gallon .
Everyone says , ' yeah , that 's true , but as long as there is job generation there is going to be income generation and people are going to spend . '
But for seven months in a row , employment in the private sector has fallen .
The most worrisome thing is that in spite of the rebates , retail sales in June were up only 0.1 % .
In real terms , they were down .
If people were not spending their rebate checks in June , what will happen when there are no more checks ?
Good question .
How do you think Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke has handled the crisis so far ?
The Fed 's performance has been poor .
More than a year ago the Fed said the housing slump would end , but it has n't .
They kept repeating this was a subprime - debt problem only , whereas the problems of excessive credit involve subprime , near - prime , prime , commercial real estate , credit cards , auto loans , student loans , home - equity loans , leveraged loans , muni bonds , corporate loans -- you name it .
The Fed 's other mistake was to believe the collapse of the housing market would have no effect on the rest of the economy , when housing accounted for a third of all job creation in the past few years .
When the proverbial stuff started to hit the fan last summer , the Fed went into aggressive - easing mode .
But it has always been kind of catching up .
What should Bernanke have done a year ago , or even prior to that ?
The damage was done earlier , beginning when the Greenspan Fed lowered interest rates in 2001 after the bust of the technology bubble , and kept them too low for too long .
They kept cutting the federal funds rate all the way to 1 % through 2004 , and then raised it gradually instead of quickly .
This fed the credit and housing bubble .
Also , the Fed and other regulators took a reckless approach to regulating the financial sector .
It was the laissez - faire approach of the Bush administration , and ( tantamount to ) self - regulation , which really means no regulation and a lack of market discipline .
The banks ' and brokers ' risk - management models did n't make sense because no one listens to the risk managers in good times .
As Chuck Prince ( the deposed CEO of Citigroup ) said , ' when the music plays you have to dance . '
Now the regulators are attempting to make up for lost time .
What do you think of their efforts ?
The paradox is they 're going to the opposite pole .
They are overregulating , bailing out troubled participants and intervening in every market .
The Securities and Exchange Commission has accused others of trying to manipulate stocks , but the government itself is now the manipulator .
The regulators should investigate themselves for bailing out Fannie Mae ( FNM ) and Freddie Mac ( FRE ) , the creditors of Bear Stearns and the financial system with new lending facilities .
They have swapped U.S. Treasury bonds for toxic securities .
It is privatizing the gains and profits , and socializing the losses , as usual .
This is socialism for Wall Street and the rich .
So the government should have let Bear Stearns fail , not to mention Fannie and Freddie ?
If you let Bear Stearns fail you can have a run on the entire banking system .
But there are ways to manage Bear or Fannie and Freddie in a fairer way .
If public money is to be put at stake , first all the shareholders of these companies have to be wiped out .
Management has to be wiped out , and the creditors of Bear should have taken a hit .
Why did the Fed buy $ 29 billion of the most toxic securities , and essentially bail out JPMorgan Chase ( JPM ) , which bought Bear Stearns ?
Because JPMorgan was a counter - party ?
Exactly .
The government bailed out everyone .
Even the unsecured creditors of Fannie and Freddie should have taken a hit .
Sometimes it is necessary to use public money to rescue institutions , but you do it in a way in which you 're not bailing out those who made the mistakes .
In each one of these episodes the government bailed out the shareholders , the bondholders and to some degree , management .
At what point does the government run out of money to lend to troubled banks ?
Many public institutions are themselves going bankrupt .
The FDIC ( Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation ) has only $ 53 billion of funds , and has already committed almost 15 % of it to bail out depositors of IndyMac .
The FDIC 's deposit - insurance premiums were n't high enough , and now it is asking Congress to raise them .
Plus , the agency claims only nine institutions are on its watch list .
IndyMac was n't on the watch list until June , the month before it collapsed .
Studies done by experts in banking suggest that at least 8 % of U.S. banks are in big trouble .
Eight percent of the roughly 8,500 that the FDIC essentially is insuring equals about 700 banks .
Another 8 % to 16 % also are shaky , so some 700 potentially are going bust and another 700 eventually could join them .
Yet the FDIC is watching only nine institutions .
It 's a joke .
What recourse will the taxpayer have ?
The taxpayer 's bill is going to be huge .
I estimate this financial crisis will lead to credit losses of at least $ 1 trillion and most likely closer to $ 2 trillion .
When I made this analysis in February everybody thought I was a lunatic .
But a few weeks later the International Monetary Fund came out with an estimate of $ 945 billion , Goldman Sachs ( GS ) estimated $ 1.1 trillion and UBS ( UBS ) $ 1 trillion .
Hedge - fund manager John Paulson recently estimated the losses would be $ 1.3 trillion , and late last month Bridgewater Associates came up with an estimate of $ 1.6 trillion .
So , at this point $ 1 trillion is n't a ceiling , it 's a floor .
And the banks , as I 've said , have written down only about $ 300 billion of subprime debt .
How long will it take for the collapse in the banking sector to play out ?
It is happening in real time .
Many smaller banks are going bust already .
More than 200 subprime - mortgage lenders have gone bust in the past year alone .
And many community banks will go bankrupt .
Community banks usually finance everything : the homes , the stores , the downtown , the commercial real estate , the shopping center .
If you are in a town or a municipality where there is a housing bust , the bank is gone .
Of three dozen or so medium - sized regional banks , a good third are in distress .
That includes the Wachovias and Washington Mutuals of the world .
Half of this group might go bankrupt .
Even some of the majors could end up technically insolvent , though they might be deemed too big to fail .
Take Citigroup .
In 1991 there was a small real - estate bust , though the quarterly fall in home prices was only 4 % , based on the S&P / Case - Shiller indices .
Citi was effectively bankrupt and signed a memorandum of understanding with the Fed that allowed the government to give the bank regulatory forbearance .
Citi was allowed to ride it out and try to recapitalize in a few years , and thereby avoid bankruptcy protection .
This time around the S&P / Case - Shiller indices indicate home prices already have fallen 18 % .
The decline could be as much as 30 % , because the excess supply is huge .
Nouriel , have you always been so negative about everything ?
No .
I 'm actually a pretty mainstream economist .
I was trained first in Italy and then in the U.S. and earned my Ph.D. at Harvard .
My interests are in international market economics and international finance , and I 'm not a ' perma - bear ' on the stock market nor an eternal pessimist .
Leaving aside the fact that we are going to have a pretty nasty recession and international crisis , the global economy is going to grow at a sustained rate once this downturn is over .
There are significant financial and economic problems in the U.S. , and that 's why I 'm bearish about the U.S.
But the emergence of China and India and other powers is going to shift global economics and politics radically , and the world is going to be more balanced in the future , rather than relying on one engine , which has been the U.S.
There are big issues ahead :
How do you integrate the 2.2 billion Chinese and Indians into the global economy ?
There will be transitional costs and the displacement of workers , both blue - collar and white , in the advanced economies .
But I 'm quite bullish about the state of the global economy , and I 'm positive about the medium and long term .
That 's a relief .
Thank you .
Major highway projects take about 13 years from initiation to completion  too long to counteract any recession .
But at least they create a legacy that can improve the economic environment for decades to come .
A major infrastructure initiative would create jobs for the less - educated workers who have been hit hardest by the transition to an information economy .
It would allow the U.S. to return to the fundamentals .
There is a real danger that the U.S. is going to leap from one over - consuming era to another , from one finance - led bubble to another .
Focusing on infrastructure would at least get us thinking about the real economy , asking hard questions about what will increase real productivity , helping people who are expanding companies rather than hedge funds .
Moreover , an infrastructure resurgence is desperately needed .
Americans now spend 3.5 billion hours a year stuck in traffic , a figure expected to double by 2020 .
The U.S. population is projected to increase by 50 percent over the next 42 years .
American residential patterns have radically changed .
Workplaces have decentralized .
Commuting patterns are no longer radial , from suburban residences to central cities .
Now they are complex weaves across broad megaregions .
Yet the infrastructure system has n’t adapted .
The smart thing to do is announce a short - term infrastructure initiative to accelerate all those repair projects that can be done within a few years .
Then , begin a long - term National Mobility Project .
Create a base - closings - like commission to organize federal priorities ( Congress has forfeited its right to micromanage ) .
Streamline the regulations that can now delay project approval by five years .
Explore all the new ideas that are burgeoning in the transportation world  congestion pricing , smart highways , rescue plans for shrinking Midwestern cities , new rail and airplane technologies .
When you look into this sector , you see we are on the cusp of another transportation revolution .
A mobility project would dovetail with the energy initiatives both presidential candidates have offered .
It would benefit from broad political support from liberals and business groups alike .
It would rebalance this economy , so there is more productive weight to go along with Wall Street wizardry .
Smart investors are going to take advantage of the current panic to make money .
A smart president could take advantage of it to build something that will last for decades and decades to come .
Monsanto CEO
Hugh Grant and author Michael Pollan agree to disagree over the world ’s food crisis … kinda .
[ youtube=http://www.youtube.com/v/I9I1IkbcHNE&hl=en&fs=1]
In an unlikely pairing , both Michael Pollan and Monsanto ’s CEO Hugh Grant sat down with Google.org and YouTube for a discussion on the world ’s food crisis .
The two had met and became friends upon visiting the Doomsday Seed Vault in Norway .
The half hour chat – Creating a World That Can Feed Itself – was all together …flaccid .
Grant ’s primary focus to solving the world ’s food issues was about doubling yields within the next 20 years .
He boasted how a larger yield , requiring less water and less fertilizer , was the right solution .
But he says the science is n’t the main problem , it ’s getting the farmers linked up with government and also with Monsanto in order to transfer technology on things like soil and irrigation .
Pollan shot back that growing enough food and getting that food to people who need it both are separate issues .
He also noted that Monsanto mostly grows corn and soy as “ raw ” materials : these raw materials are mostly used for animal feed .
The forum did n’t provide anything groundbreaking , but if Michael Pollan and Monsanto can try to work together then maybe we stand a chance after all .

A baggage screener for the US Transportation Security Administration has confessed to brazenly stealing a trove of electronics gear from the luggage of passengers he was sworn to protect , federal prosecutors said .
Pythias Brown , 48 , of Maplewood , New Jersey , regularly sold the high - priced video cameras , laptop computers , and global positioning systems on eBay using the handle " alirla " , according to a criminal complaint filed in federal court in Newark .
Brown told investigators he began stealing the items in September 2007 while screening luggage at Newark Liberty International Airport .
Among the items Brown helped himself to was a Sony Camcorder and related paraphernalia from a Cable News Network employee who was flying to Houston .
The same day the items went missing , on August 12 , alirla posted them for sale on eBay .
After a federal investigator offered a winning bid and took possession of the gear , the investigator found it bore the serial numbers and bar codes contained on the CNN employee 's missing items .
A month later , while an employee of the Home Box Office network was traveling to London , a $ 48,000 Hasselblad camera and accompanying lenses disappeared from bags that passed through TSA screening at Newark Liberty .
One day later , alirla 's eBay account listed the identical items .
Investigators tracked the alirla account to Brown using the internet protocol address for his home computer .
They also found his physical address listed on the package that included the CNN camera .
Closed circuit TV recorded him mailing the package at a nearby post office .
Investigators searching Brown 's home recovered 66 cameras , 31 laptops , 20 cell phones , 17 electronic games , 13 pieces of jewelry , 12 global positioning systems , 11 MP3 players , eight camera lenses , six video cameras , and two DVD players .
He admitted to stealing two to three items per week .
Brown was freed on $ 100,000 unsecured bond , according to a prosecutor in the case .
He has not yet entered a plea .
He faces up to ten years in prison , according to news reports .
Brown 's attorney did n't return a phone call by time of publication .
No doubt , anyone who has ever flown has felt the ignominy of having a perfect stranger rifle through their stuff .
The accusations against Brown are n't likely to improve relations between passengers and TSA screeners .
Alirla , on the other hand , had a stellar reputation with the people he sold to .
His eBay feedback profile contains 205 positive reviews , one neutral review , and zero negative reviews .
Typical was this comment , from a buyer of a Sony Cyber - shot digital camera : " fast , friendly , awesome product .

Chagos islanders evicted by the British government in the 1970s today lost their long - running battle to return to the Indian Ocean archipelago .
The islanders had previously won the right to return to all islands except Diego Garcia , the main island , where there is a US military base .
The 3 - 2 ruling today by the law lords overturns the islanders ' victory and is the final stage of a legal battle that started 10 years ago .
Lord Hoffmann ruled the government was entitled to legislate for a colony in the security interests of the United Kingdom .
The US state department had argued that the islands might be useful to terrorists .
Lord Hoffmann said : " Some of these scenarios might be regarded as fanciful speculations , but in the current state of uncertainty the government is entitled to take the concerns of its ally into account . "
He rejected the argument by the Chagossians ' lawyers that the government did not have the power to remove their right of abode in what is now known as the British Indian Ocean Territory ( BIOT ) .
" The law gives it and the law may take it away , " he said .
Lord Rodger and Lord Carswell agreed .
Lord Bingham and Lord Mance dissented .
Olivier Bancoult , the evicted islander who put his name to the legal bid when it started in 1998 , said after the ruling : " We are deeply disappointed but of course we fight on .
We are consulting our legal team to see what we can do . "
Bancoult urged ministers to read the statements of the dissenting judges .
" They should put an end to the shameless victimisation of Chagossians and adopt a lawful policy of facilitating our return to our homeland . "
Britain took the Chagos islands from France in the Napoleonic wars .
In 1971 the British government used an immigration ordinance to remove the inhabitants compulsorily so Diego Garcia could be used as a US base .
Both the divisional court and the court of appeal had previously ruled that the Chagossians could return to the outer islands .
The Foreign Office appealed against those judgments to the law lords .
The foreign secretary , David Miliband , welcomed today 's judgment as a vindication of the government 's decision to appeal .
" We do not seek to excuse the conduct of an earlier generation .
Our appeal to the House of Lords was not about what happened in the 1960s and 1970s .
It was about decisions taken in the international context of 2004 .
" This required us to take into account issues of defence [ and ] security of the archipelago and the fact that an independent study had come down heavily against the feasibility of lasting resettlement of the outer islands of BIOT . "
In his dissenting judgment , Lord Bingham declared as void and unlawful a 2004 order to declare , without the authority of parliament , that no person had the right of abode in the Chagos islands .
The power to legislate without going to parliament was " an anachronistic survival " , he said .
" The duty of protection cannot ordinarily be discharged by removing and excluding the citizen from his homeland . "
Lord Mance said factors relied on as justifying the order were based on a " remote and unlikely risk " of large - scale resettlement of the outer Chagos islands .
Richard Gifford , who represented the Chagossians , said : " It has been the misfortune of the Chagos islanders that their passionate desire to return to their homeland has been caught up in the power politics of foreign policy for the past 40 years .
" Sadly , their struggle to regain their paradise lost has been dismissed on legal grounds , but the political possibilities remain open for parliament the British public and the international community to continue to support . "
The law lords were told during the hearing in July that Diego Garcia was regarded by the US since the 9/11 terrorist attacks as a " defence facility of the highest importance ... a linchpin for the UK's allies " .
The Foreign Office argued that allowing the Chagossians to return would be a " precarious and costly " operation , and the United States had said that it would also present an unacceptable risk to its base .
While there were " undeniably unattractive aspects " to what had happened to the islanders in the 1970s , that was no longer what the case was about , Jonathan Crow QC , for the foreign secretary , told the lords .
" The Chagossians do not own any territory , " Crow said .
" They have no property rights on the islands at all .
What is being asserted is a right of mass trespass . "
Ten years ago the Chagossians began legal action for the right to return , and in 2000 the divisional court ruled their eviction illegal .
The foreign secretary at the time , Robin Cook , agreed they should be allowed to return to all the islands except Diego Garcia .
But after the September 11 attacks in 2001 , the US said Diego Garcia had become an important base for the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq .
In 2004 , the UK government issued orders in council that negated the court 's ruling , but two years later the high court ruled in favour of the Chagossians .
In May last year the government lost again at appeal .
In November the lords granted the government leave to appeal but ordered it to pay all legal costs , regardless of the decision .
A recent study found the small number of islanders likely to want to return to the archipelago permanently would be able to make a sustainable living .
The study , backed by the Let Them Return campaign and written by John Howell , a former director of the Overseas Development Institute , suggested there were " no physical , economic or environmental reasons " to prevent resettlement on the islands of Peros Banhos and Salomon .
Howell suggested about 150 families - fewer than 1,000 people and about a quarter of those entitled to go back - would want to return .
Eco-tourism and fish exports could provide jobs and income .
The total cost to the UK of resettlement would be about £ 25 m , the report said .

The time span of the past few million years has been punctuated by many rapid climate transitions , most of them on time scales of centuries to decades or even less .
The most detailed information is available for the Younger Dryas - to - Holocene stepwise change around 11,500 years ago , which seems to have occurred over a few decades .
The speed of this change is probably representative of similar but less well - studied climate transitions during the last few hundred thousand years .
These include sudden cold events ( Heinrich events / stadials ) , warm events ( Interstadials ) and the beginning and ending of long warm phases , such as the Eemian interglacial .
Detailed analysis of terrestrial and marine records of climate change will , however , be necessary before we can say confidently on what timescale these events occurred ; they almost certainly did not take longer than a few centuries .
Various mechanisms , involving changes in ocean circulation , changes in atmospheric concentrations of greenhouse gases or haze particles , and changes in snow and ice cover , have been invoked to explain these sudden regional and global transitions .
We do not know whether such changes could occur in the near future as a result of human effects on climate .
Phenomena such as the Younger Dryas and Heinrich events might only occur in a ' glacial ' world with much larger ice sheets and more extensive sea ice cover .
However , a major sudden cold event did probably occur under global climate conditions similar to those of the present , during the Eemian interglacial , around 122,000 years ago .
Less intensive , but significant rapid climate changes also occurred during the present ( Holocene ) interglacial , with cold and dry phases occurring on a 1500 - year cycle , and with climate transitions on a decade - to - century timescale .
In the past few centuries , smaller transitions ( such as the ending of the Little Ice Age at about 1650 AD ) probably occurred over only a few decades at most .
All the evidence indicates that most long - term climate change occurs in sudden jumps rather than incremental changes .
Introduction
Until a few decades ago it was generally thought that all large - scale global and regional climate changes occurred gradually over a timescale of many centuries or millennia , scarcely perceptible during a human lifetime .
The tendency of climate to change relatively suddenly has been one of the most suprising outcomes of the study of earth history , specifically the last 150,000 years ( e.g. , Taylor et al. , 1993 ) .
Some and possibly most large climate changes ( involving , for example , a regional change in mean annual temperature of several degrees celsius ) occurred at most on a timescale of a few centuries , sometimes decades , and perhaps even just a few years .
The decadal - timescale transitions would presumably have been quite noticeable to humans living at such times , and may have created difficulties or opportunities ( e.g. , the possibility of crossing exposed land bridges , before sea level could rise ) .
Hodell et al. ( 1995 ) and Curtis et al. ( 1996 ) , for instance , document the effects of climate change on the collapse of the Classic period of Mayan civilization and Thompson ( 1989 ) describes the influence of alternating wet and dry periods on the rise and fall of coastal and highland cultures of Ecuador and Peru .
The beginning of crop agriculture in the Middle East corresponds very closely in time with a sudden warming event which marks the beginning of the Holocene ( Wright 1993 ) .
Even the burial in ice of the prehistoric mummified corpse of the famous ' Iceman ' ( e.g. , Bahn and Everett , 1993 ) at the upper edge of an alpine glacier coincided with the initiation of a cold period ( ' Neoglaciation ' ) after the Holocene climate optimum ( Baroni and Orombelli , 1996 ) .
On longer timescales , evolution of modern humans has been linked to climatic changes in Africa ( e.g. , de Menocal , 1995 ) .
But the full implications of these sudden changes for biogeography and for the evolution of human cultures and biology have barely begun to be considered ; there has simply not been time for the message to be absorbed by biogeographers , archaeologists and palaeoanthropologists , and this review is intended to help the process along .
Sudden stepwise instability is also a disturbing scenario to be borne in mind when considering the effects that humans might have on the climate system through adding greenhouse gases .
Judging by what we see from the past , conditions might gradually be building up to a ' break point ' at which a dramatic change in the climate system will occur over just a decade or two , as a result of a seemingly innocuous trigger .
It is the evidence for dramatic past changes on the timescale of centuries to decades which will be the subject of this review .
I. Broad climate variability ; the background of oscillations on the timescale of tens of thousands of years
Climatic variability on the timescale of tens of thousands of years has turned out to be a predominant pattern in earth history .
The last two and a half million years have been marked by many global climate oscillations , between warmer and cooler conditions .
This trend of oscillations appears to be merely the continuation of a pattern of variability extending back well into the Tertiary period and possibly beyond ( e.g. , Kennett 1995 ) .
During the last few million years , the length and the amplitude of these climate cycles has increased ( e.g. , Crowley & North , 1991 ; Hodell and Venz , 1992 ) .
Large global interglacial - glacial - interglacial climate oscillations have been recurring at approximately a 100,000 year periodicity for the last 900,000 years ( e.g. Berger et al.
1993 ; Mudelse and Schulz , 1997 ) , though each individual cycle has had its own idiosyncrasies in terms of the timing and magnitude of changes ( e.g. , Lyle et al. 1992 ) .
As is usually the case with the study of the past , data become more scarce with increasing age ( Winograd et al. 1997 ) ; even so , many detailed records are now becoming available ( e.g. Tzedakis et al 1997 ) .
Extended records of atmospheric gas concentrations and polar temperatures may also be expected from the continued deeper drilling of the Antarctic Vostok ice core ( Jouzel et al. 1996 , Petit et al. 1997 ) .
The most recent large climate oscillation spanning the last 130,000 years ( 130 ka ) has been the subject of the most intensive study , because it offers a relatively detailed climate record from the land , from the oceans and from the ice cores .
In the last few years , a considerable amount of new data on the warm period known as the Eemian ( the last major interglacial ) has become available ( e.g. Pewe et al. 1997 ) .
This interval has seen the global climate system switch ( Fig.1 ) from warm interglacial ( similar to present - day ) to cold glacial conditions , and back .
In stratigraphic terms , the last 100 ka oscillation began with the Eemian interglacial ( Isotope Stage 5e , possibly including part of the series 5d - a ; known as the Sangamon Stage on land in the USA ) , followed by the colder last glacial period ( Stages 4 - 2 ) , and the present Holocene Interglacial beginning around 11,000 years ago ( Isotope Stage 1 ) .
There is considerable evidence that similar events and processes were at work in previous glacial - interglacial cycles over the past 900,000 years .
The general background of continuous ( but less dramatic ) variability in the earth 's climate system is thought to extend well back into the Tertiary , and beyond ( e.g. , Crowley and North 1991 ) .
For the most recent Eemian - to - Holocene phase there is still significant ambiguity in terms of the errors in geological dating techniques , causing difficulties in correlation between different regions , so that it is difficult to know whether climate changes were truely synchronous globally .
However , in many other respects the record that has been assembled for this period is remarkably detailed .
There are apparently few gaps in the record among the many long ocean cores , though land and lake records are much patchier .
Indicator species on land ( e.g. , trees ) may respond slowly , but oceanic unicellular plankton ( such as diatoms , foraminifera and nannoplankton ) has such short generation times that it can potentially give a precise picture of events , at least where sedimentation rates are sufficient .
For instance , exciting new data can be expected from detailed analysis of the cores taken during Leg 172 of the international Ocean Drilling Program of 1997 , which concentrated on high sedimentation rate sediment drifts in the North Atlantic .
The general picture summarized here roughly reflects the present consensus gained from studies of ice cores , deep ocean cores , and terrestrial and lake sediments around the world .
This consensus is itself subject to sudden jumps when new data are presented , or as more thorough reanalyses of previous data come forth ; for this reason , our review is liable to be significantly out of date within only a few weeks or months of being written !
II .
The record of decade - to - century timescale changes during the last 130,000 years
II.1 . The Eemian , or last interglacial .
The last interglacial ( also called the Eemian ) has often been seen as a close counterpart of the present interglacial : sea surface temperatures were similar , and sea level was possibly somewhat higher ( e.g. , Imbrie and Imbrie , 1992 ) .
Going by the principle that there is a general similarity between these two warm periods , the Eemian has been used to predict the duration of the present interglacial , and also to study the possibility of sudden climate variability occurring within the next few centuries or millennia .
The dating of the warming event that begins the Eemian is still the subject of controversy , and this leads to greater uncertainty about what to make of it as an analogue for future climate change .
II .1.a. Controversy over the timing of the last interglacial .
The Eemian or Marine oxygen Isotope Stage ( MIS ) 5e interglacial ( Fig.1 ) began sometime between 130 - 140 ka ago ( Imbrie et al .
1984 ; Martinson et al. , 1987 ; Sarnthein & Tiedemann , 1990 ; Szabo et al. , 1994 ; Stirling et al. , 1995 ) with a warming phase ( of uncertain duration ) taking the earth out of an extreme glacial phase , into conditions generally warmer than those of today ( Frenzel et al. 1992 ) .
Warming into the Eemian may have occurred in two major steps , similar to the last deglaciation ( Seidenkrantz et al. , 1993 ; 1996 ) .
Though it was named after a warm - climate phase seen in the terrestrial pollen record of the Netherlands ( e.g. Zagwijn , 1963 , 1975 ) , the first generally accepted dates of the start of the Eemian came from the oceans ( e.g. Shackleton 1969 ) , based on interpretation of benthic foraminiferal oxygen isotope data .
Such oxygen isotope curves were later expanded and many curves were stacked ; the timing of maximum ice volume as estamited from oxygen isotope values was then ' tuned ' to astonomical variations in solar input ( see below ) .
This time scale is usually called the called the SPECMAP curve ( Imbrie et al. 1984 ; Martinson et al. , 1987 ) .
The warm MIS 5e , the warmest interval in the last 150,000 years , was correlated with the warmest interval in pollen records , the Eemian .
The land records were then dated by 14C for the younger parts of the records , by correlation with the marine records for the older parts ( e.g. , Woilard , 1979 ; Woillard and Mook , 1982 ) .
The age of the warming event ( or events ) at the beginning of stage 5e , however , is still under discussion .
Work on deep - sea sediments ( Imbrie et al. , 1993 ; Sarnthein and Tiedemann , 1990 ; Maslin et al. , 1998 ) and corals ( Szabo et al. , 1994 ; Stirling et al. , 1995 ; Slowey et al. , 1996 ) suggests that rapid warming could have started as early as 132 ka , while work on the Antarctic Vostok ice core suggests a possible initiation at 134 kyr ( Jouzel et al. , 1993 , Nature 364 , 407-411 ) .
Uranium - Thorium dated records from a continental karst sediment in the southwestern USA ( Devil 's Hole ; Winograd et al. , 1988 ; 1992 ; 1997 ) , however , suggest a much earlier start of warming at about 140 kyr.
Studies of an Alaskan site ( the Eve Interglaciation Forest Bed ) suggest , however , that the Devil 's Hole record may be in error and that the warming definitely postdated 140 kyr , because the tephra underlying this bed was dated at 140 kyr .
There has been much discussion about the reliablity of dating of the marine isotope stages as compared to the Devil 's Hole record ( e.g. , Imbrie et al. , 1993 ) , but new numerical dating methods have apparently confirmed that both records are reliable ( Protactinium - 231 dating of carbonates ; Edwards et al. , 1997 ) .
We must thus consider the possibility that warm conditions did not last for the same amount of time throughout the world ; for instance comparison of various land records also suggests that warming may have occurred at different times in the Alps and in northern France ( de Beaulieu and Reille , 1989 ) .
Winograd et al. ( 1997 ) date the ending of the warm period at about the same time as the SPECMAP time scale , so that they require the duration of the Eemian warm period to have been about twice as long as in the SPECMAP scheme of events ( i.e. lasting 22 kyr rather than about 10 kyr ) .
We need to consider the possibility that warm intervals as seen in pollen records have a longer duration than periods of high sea level and low ice volume in the marine record : Kukla et al. , 1997 , for instance , suggest that the Eemian ( as seen in the pollen records ) started at about 130 kyr , but ended much later than the end of MIS 5e , and that the duration of land interglacials thus is indeed longer than the period of low ice volume .
Such a difference in duration is also apparent in the comparison of terrestrial and land records by Tzedakis et al. , 1997 ( their fig . 2 ) .
If one accepts the contradictory picture obtained from comparing the Devil 's Hole record and some of the terrestrial pollen records with other parts of the world , it seems that for thousands of years warm ' interglacial ' type conditions in the mid-latitudes on land could have been occurring at the same time as much colder ocean temperatures and expanded Arctic ice sheets .
The Eemian , it appears , could have been a strange beast quite unlike our present interglacial phase ( which began rapidly and fairly simultaneously all around the world ) .
This confusion over the nature and duration of the Eemian adds to the difficulty in making simple , general comparisons with our present interglacial , and in interpreting the significance of some of the events seen in the marine and ice core records .
II .1.b. Evidence of climate instability during the Eemian
Whatever the true timescale of the Eemian , what has generated most widespread interest ( extending well beyond the usual geological community and into the popular media ) is that there are indications of large - scale climate instability in the middle of the Eemian ( e.g. , Maslin and Tzedakis , 1996 ) .
This finding is alarming , as we are presently living in an interglacial period ( called the Holocene ) which closely resembles the Eemian in many respects ( though it is not yet clear how closely ; Imbrie and Imbrie , 1992 ; fig. 48 ) .
If sudden , dramatic climate changes could occur within the Eemian , then they could perhaps occur in the future during our present interglacial , especially if we perturb the system by adding greenhouse gases .
Initial evidence from the GRIP ice core evidence ( Dansgaard et al. , 1993 ; Taylor et al. 1993 ) indicated that the Eemian was punctuated by many short - lived cold events , as shown by variations in electrical conductivity ( a proxy for windblown dust , with more dust indicating colder , more arid conditions ) and stable oxygen isotopes ( a proxy for air temperature ) of the ice were used by these workers infer the climatic conditions during the Eemian .
The cold events seemed to last a few thousand years , and the magnitude of cooling was similar to the difference between glacial and interglacial conditions ; a very dramatic contrast in climate .
Furthermore , the shifts between these warm and cold periods seemed to be extremely rapid , possibly occurring over a few decades or less .
A second ice core ( GISP2 ) from the Greenland ice cap ( Boulton , 1993 ) provided an almost identical climate record for the last 110 ka , shortly after the end of the Eemian .
GISP2 also shows apparent sudden climate jumps throughout the Eemian , but the two records diverge ( Grootes et al. 1993 ) .
Significantly , in GISP2 steeply inclined ice layers occur in this lower portion of the core , indicating that the ice has been disturbed , and that we cannot distinguish simple tilting from folding or slippage that would juxtapose ice of very different ages ( Boulton , 1993 ) .
For this reason .
the deeper GISP2 record has thus been interpreted as containing interglacial and glacial ice of indeterminate age , mixed in together by ice tectonics ( Grootes et al. , 1993 ) .
It has been suggested that the deeper parts of the GRIP ice core record ( referred to above ) , including the crucial Eeemian sequence , may also have been affected by ice tectonics ( e.g. Grootes et al. , 1993 ; Taylor et al. , 1993 ; Boulton , 1993 ) .
Johnsen et al. ( 1995 ) reported layers tilted up to 20 degrees within the Marine Isotope Stage 5 c ( 110 ka ) section of the GRIP ice cores , precisely where the correlation between GRIP and GISP2 breaks down .
The GISP2 - GRIP Joint Workshop in Wolfeboro , New Hampshire , USA ( September 1995 ) , concluded from data on ice trapped atmospheric CH4 and d18O from both Antartctica and Greenland , and from more detailed work on the structural properties of the cores , that both GRIP and GISP2 ice cores had suffered stratigraphic disturbances in ice older than 110 ka .
There are presently plans to obtain high resolution last interglacial records from both Greenland and the high accumulation rate West Antarctic ice sheet , which will add an interhemispheric dimension to the current Eemian debate .
Support for the occurrence of cold Eemian events was obtained from lake records from continental Europe ( de Beaulieu & Reille 1989 , Guiot et al. 1993 ) , the Massif Central in France ( Thouveny et al. , 1994 ) and Bispingen , Germany ( Field et al. , 1994 ) .
However , these records only suggest that the Eemian climate was more variable than that of the Holocene , not that it had the extreme frenetic variability of glaical times that the ice cores suggest .
Oceanic records from the North East Atlantic ( McManus et al. , 1994 ) and the Bahamas Outer Ridge ( Keigwin et al. , 1994 ) indicate very little or no climatic variability during the Eemian .
In contrast to this , records from both the Nordic Seas and west of Ireland show a cooling and freshening of the North Atlantic in the middle of the Eemain somewhere between 122 and 125 ka ( Cortijo et al. , 1994 ; Fronval and Jansen , 1996 ) .
These Nordic records also show highly variable surface water conditions throughout the Eemian period .
Records from slightly further south on the north - west European shelf sediments , suggest a similar picture of cold intervals during the Eemian ( Seidenkrantz et al. , 1995 ) .
Evidence for a single sudden cool event during the Eemian is also present in pollen records from a lake in central Europe ( Field et al. , 1994 ) , from loess sedimentology in central China ( Zhisheng & Porter 1997 ) , and from ocean sediment records from ODP Site 658 in the eastern sub-tropical Atlantic ( Maslin et al. , 1996 ; 1998 ; Maslin and Tzedakis , 1996 ) .
However , although widespread , it may not have been a global event , as it apparently does not show up in cores from some parts of the world ( e.g. , Oppo et al.1997 ) .
Overall , the combined sources of evidence suggest that at least one cold and dry event caused a change in circulation patterns in the North Atlantic , a several - degree decline in Atlantic surface temperatures , and on land opened up the west European forests to give a mixture of steppe and trees near the middle of the Eemian , about 122 ka .
This intra-Eeemian cold phase was less dramatic than had been suggested by the variability in the ice core records , but it was still a major climatic change .
Evidence from a high resolution marine core record at Site ODP 658 ( Maslin and Tzedakis , 1996 ) suggests that this event , which might possibly have come on in a few decades or less , lasted no more than 400 years .
Afterwards climate recovered , but conditions did not return to the full warmth of the early Eemian ' optimum ' .
Further support for the existence of the intra-Eemian cooling event comes indirectly from coral reef records .
New data from Stirling et al. ( 1995 ) from Western Australia and their review of other high precision U - series coral dates indicate that during the last interglacial period ( which they date to between 130 to 117 ka ) the main global episode of coral reef building was confined to just a few thousand years between 127 to 122 ka .
This period of reef building thus seems to have ended at the same time as the beginning of the Intra - Eemian cold event at about 122 ka .
This intra-Eemian event seems to have have a corresponding , though admittedly weaker , equivalent in the present interglacial ( the Holocene ) .
Around 4,800 - 4,500 ya , there was a 300 - year long colder phase that resembled the Intra - Eemian cooling event ( Fig. 3 ) in that they both occur after the interglacial peak and signal the beginning of a trend of climatic deterioration ( e.g. , Baroni and Orombelli , 1996 ; Bond et al. , 1997 )
Other large and relatively sudden cool and arid phases ( occurring against a background of similar - to - present conditions ) seem to have affected some of the previous interglacials before about 200,000 years ago ( Winograd et al. 1997 ) .
Again , the speed with which these climate transitions occurred is unclear through lack of detailed time resolution in these older records , but the possibility that these changes occurred over only a few decades must be considered a possibility .
II.2 . Sudden transitions after 115,000 years ago .
According to the marine records , the Eemian interglacial ended with a rapid cooling event about 110,000 years ago ( e.g. , Imbrie et al. , 1984 ; Martinson et al. , 1987 ) , which also shows up in ice cores and pollen records from across Eurasia .
From a relatively high resolution core in the North Atlantic .
Adkins et al. ( 1997 ) suggested that the final cooling event took less than 400 years , and it might have been much more rapid .
Following the end of the Eemian , a large number of other sudden changes and short - term warm and cold alternations have been recognized ; apparently many or all of these occurred on a global or at least a regional scale ( Fig.3 ; Ice core record ) .
The most extreme of these fluctuations are the warm interstadials and the cold Heinrich events .
These are most prominent in the ice - core record of Greenland , deep - sea cores from the North Atlantic , and in the pollen records of Europe and North America , suggesting that they were most intense in the North Atlantic region ( e.g. , Bond et al. , 1992 ; 1993 ) .
II .2.a. Interstadials .
Sudden and short - lived warm events occurred many times during the generally colder conditions that prevailed between 110,000 and 10,000 years ago ( isotope Stages 2 - 5.4 ) .
First picked up as brief influxes of warm climate plants and insects into the glacial tundra zone of northern Europe , they are known as ' interstadials ' to distinguish them from the cold phases or ' stadials ' ( Lowe & Walker 1984 ) .
The interstadials show up strongly in the Greenland ice core records .
Between 115,000 and 14,000 years ago , 24 of these warm events have been recognized in the Greenland ice cores ( where they are called ' Dansgaard - Oeschger events ' ; e.g. , Bond et al. , 1993 ; Bond and Lotti , 1995 ) .
Many lesser warming events have also been seen in the ice core records ( e.g. , Dansgaard et al. , 1993 ; Taylor et al. , 1993 ; 1997 ; Mayewski et al. , 1997 ) but have not yet been recognized elsewhere .
Short - lived and / or moist warm phases , coeval with interstadials , appear in the eastern Pacific ( Behl and Kennett 1996 ) , western Siberia , the Arabian Sea ( Schulz et al. , 1998 ) and possibly also in central China ( Behl & Kennett 1996 ) .
The duration of each interstadial in the can be counted in ice cores from the annual ' snowlayers that have accumulated for the younger parts of the records , or ( rather less precisely ) from the thickness of sediment accumulated in an ocean bed core .
In marginal ocean basins with low oxygenation , annual layers may be preserved in the sediment ( e.g. , Behl and Kennett , 1996 ; Ocean Drilling Program Leg 169S , Saanich Inlet , British Coumbia , Canada ) .
Ice core and ocean data suggest that interstadials both began and ended suddenly , though in general the ' jump ' in climate at the start of an interstadial was followed by a more gradual decline involving a stepwise series of smaller cooling events and often a fairly large terminal cooling event which returned conditions to the colder ' glacial ' state ( e.g. , Rasmussen et al. , 1997 ) .
From the ice core evidence from Greenland , warming into each interstadial occurred over a few decades or less , and the overall duration of some of these warm phases may have been just a few decades , while others vary in length from a few centuries to nearly two thousand years ( e.g , Mayewski et al. , 1997 ) .
II.2.b. Heinrich events .
Opposite in sign to the Interstadials are extreme and short - lived cold events , known as ' Heinrich events ' ( e.g. , Heinrich , 1988 ; Bond et al. , 1992 ; Grousset et al. , 1993 ; Andrews et al. , 1994 ) , which were first recognized as periods with very ice - rafting in the North Atlantic ( Ruddiman , 1977 ) .
These events occur against the general background of the glacial climate , and represent the brief expression of the most extreme glacial conditions .
The several massive ice - rafting events ( e.g. , Heinrich 1988 ; Broecker et al. , 1992 ; Bond et al. , 1992 ; 1993 ; Maslin et al. , 1995 ) ( Table 1 ) also show up in the Greenland ice cores as a further 3 - 6 deg .
C drop in temperature from the already cold glacial climate ( Bond et al. , 1993 ; Mayewski et al. , 1994 ) , and many of these events also been picked up as particularly cold and arid intervals in European and North American pollen records ( Grimm et al. , 1993 ) .
There is still considerable discussion as to the exact region of provenance of the icebergs participating in the Heinrich events ( e.g. , Gwiazda et al. , 1996a , b ; Revel et al. , 1996 ; Lehman , 1996 ; Bond et al. , 1997 ) .
At North Atlantic mid-latitudes , oceanic surface productivity dropped precipitously during Heinrich events ( Thomas et al. , 1995 ) .
It is thought that at least some of these events also affected the climate further afield from Greenland - giving cold , arid conditions as far away as central China and Antarctica ( Thompson et al. , 1989 ) .
Preliminary data ( C. Whitlock ..web page ) from marine sediments off California and Oregon , pollen records from Pacific Northwest lakes , cores from the Arabian Sea ( Schulz et al. 1998 ) and glacial records from western North America all reveal climate events that appear to be related to the Heinrich events of the North Atlantic .
Thus it appears that these may have been global events , although the climate shift may have been smaller outside the North Atlantic region .
The last Heinrich event ( known as H1 ) sensu stricto occurred just after the Last Glacial Maximum and seems to mark the extreme cold and aridity that occurs in many parts of the world around 17,000 - 15,000 years ago .
The Younger Dryas cold phase ( see below ) may also be regarded as a ' Heinrich ' climate event ( it is sometimes now referred to as H0 ) , and as it has been studied in considerable detail it may give clues to a general pattern true to all Heinrich climate events .
The detailed timescale on which most of these ice rafting and climate change events began and ended is uncertain , though it cannot have been very much longer than several decades because the events themselves lasted no more than a few centuries ( e.g. , Francois and Bacon , 1993 ; Mayewski et al. , 1994 ; Dowdeswell et al. , 1995 ) .
By analogy with the well - studied Younger Dryas event ( below ) , Heinrich events may be regarded as possibly beginning and ending with sudden climate ' jumps ' taking just a few decades .
However , this idea remains tentative without further work .
Recently , detailed studies of the sequence of events in ocean sediments and ice cores shows that Heinrich events actually occurred more frequently around the rim of the North Atlantic - about every 7,000 - 10,000 years on average , in the time interval between about 70,000 and 10,500 years ago .
In the later stage of this time span , after about 38,000 y.a. , they were even more frequent at about every 1,000 - 3,000 years , apparently following a mean cycle length of about 1500 years ( Bond et al. 1997 ) .
Similar but lower amplitude 1500 - year oscillations have been found to occur during the present Holocene interglacial ( Campbell et al. , 1998 ; see below ) as well as during earlier glacial and interglacial stages ( Oppo et al. 1998 ) .
II .2.c . The Younger Dryas .
The Younger Dryas cold event at about 12,900 - 11,500 years ago seems to have had the general features of a Heinrich Event , and may in fact be regarded as the most recent of these ( Severinghaus et al. 1998 ) .
The sudden onset and ending of the Younger Dryas has been studied in particular detail in the ice core and sediment records on land and in the sea ( e.g. , Bjoerck et al. , 1996 ) , and it might be respresentative of other Heinrich events .
A detailed study of two Greenland ice cores ( GRIP and GISP2 ; Taylor et al. 1997 ) , suggests that the main Younger Dryas - to - Holocene warming took several decades in the Arctic , but was marked by a series of warming steps , each taking less than 5 years .
About half of the warming was concentrated into a single period of less than 15 years .
A rapid global rise in atmospheric methane concentration which occurred at the same time suggests that the warming and moistening of climate ( causing more methane output from swamps and other biotic sources ) was a globally synchronized change ( Meeker et al.1997 ; Fuhrer and Legrand , 1997 ) .
According to data from the Greenland ice - cores , conditions remained slightly cooler than present for a while after the main warming period ; ' normal '
Holocene warmth was not reached for a further 1500 years ( up until around 10,000 calendar years ago ) .
It is not yet clear if the general pattern of the transition between the Younger Dryas and Holocene is representative of other rapid warming and cooling events in the past 110,000 years , but similar events seem to have occurred at the beginning of the Eemian ( Seidenkrantz et al. 1995 ) .
Other possibly sudden climate transitions since the start of the Holocene .
Following the sudden start of the Holocene about 11,500 years ago , there have been a number of rapid , widespread climate changes recorded from the palaeoclimatic record around the world .
The Greenland ice core data again show a clear record of these events ( O' Brien et al. , 1996 ; Mayewski et al. , 1997 ) .
At least in the North Atlantic region , these changes seem to have been paced according to approximately the same 1500 - year rhythm as that found for the last glacial and earlier glacial periods , according to Atlantic sediment records ( Bond et al. 1997 ; Campbell et al. , 1998 ) .
Generally , at the coldest point of each 1500 - year cycle surface temperatures of the North Atlantic were about 2 deg .
C cooler than at the warmest part , representing a fairly substantial change in climate .
Regional or global fluctuations of this order would be major events if they were to suddenly affect the present - day world with its high population and finely balanced food production .
It is uncertain whether these climate cycles indeed extended around the world or were generally confined to the region around the North Atlantic , but the 8,200 ka event ( see below ) ( which fits in as one of the more extreme cold events of this 1500 - year pattern ) does seem to have been widespread .
Other veents might be recognizable as variations in monsoonal intensity in the Indian Ocean , but there is still uncertainty in exact time correlations ( Sirocko et al. , 1993 ) .
The event at 8200 ka is the most striking sudden cooling event during the Holocene , giving widespread cool , dry conditions lasting perhaps 200 years before a rapid return to climates warmer and generally moister than the present .
This event is clearly detectable in the Greenland ice cores , where the cooling seems to have been about half - way as severe as the Younger Dryas - to - Holocene difference ( Alley et al. , 1997 ; Mayewski et al. , 1997 ) .
No detailed assessment of the speed of change involved seems to have been made within the literature ( though it should be possible to make such assessments from the ice core record ) , but the short duration of these events at least suggests changes that took only a few decades or less to occur .
Coeval records from North Africa across Southern Asia , show markedly more arid conditions involving a failiure of the summer monsoon rains .
Cold and / or aridity also seems to have hit northernmost South America , eastern North America and parts of NW Europe ( Alley et al. , 1997 ) .
Thinking of our densely populated present - day world , we can only hope that no similar event occurs in the near future .
Smaller , but also sudden and widespread , changes to drier or moister conditions have also been noted for many parts of the world for the second half of the Holocene , since about 5,000 years ago ( e.g. , Dorale et al. , 1992 ) .
One fairly strong arid event occurred about 4,000 years ago across northern Africa and southern Asia .
It remains to be seen whether these later events will eventually fit into a consistant global 1500 - year pattern of cold / arid events , the last of which may have been the Little Ice Age which ended about 350 years ago .
The effects which mid-Holocene climate fluctuations might have had on regional ecology are still being worked out .
In Holocene pollen records , this is the period when there was an elm ( Ulmus ) decline in Europe ( about 5,000 14C yrs or 5700 calendar yrs ) and the hemlock ( Tsuga ) decline in North America ( about 4,700 4C yrs or 5300 calendar yrs ) .
Both of these have been attributed to specific pathogen attacks ( Rackham , 1980 ; Peglar 1993 ) , but with the evidence from the Eemian it may now be worth considering these declines in terms of climate deterioration , or at least its effect on the spread of epidemics ( A. Parker pers . comm . )
II.2.d .
Other sudden climate jumps from the more distant past
Climate instability on the timescale of tens of thousands of years has been found in deep ocean and lake cores going back more than 40 Myr ( e.g. , Crowley and North , 1991 ) .
However , because these deeper records have a relatively poor time resolution , it is uncertain whether sudden decade - century timescale jumps in climate were common before the Quaternary Period ( the last 2.4 Ma ) .
Raymo et al. ( 1998 ) suggest that dramatic climate events were not confined to the last few large glacial - interglacial cycles .
Looking at a relatively high - resolution ocean core in the North Atlantic , Raymo et al. found that all through the last 1.5 Myr , large sudden climate events ( resembling Heinrich events and interstadials ) occurred during the cooler parts of the climate cycles .
This further suggests that dramatic instability is a ' normal ' part of the Earth 's climate system during this phase in its history , and that it is not merely confined to the extreme glacial - interglacial oscillations that have only operated for the last 900,000 years .
II.2.d .
Sudden climate jumps from the more recent past
Different sources seem to suggest differing speeds and intensities for Holocene climate events .
The Little Ice Age began in late Medieval times and played a role in extinguishing Norse colonies on Greenland ( e.g. , Barlow et al. , 1997 ) .
It ended at about 1650 AD ( Bradley and Jones , 1992 ) , and may have been the most rapid and largest change in polar circulation during the Holocene according to chemical indicators of windblown sea salt in the GISP2 ice core ( O' Brien et al. , 1997 ) .
The event even shows up in the marine record in the northern Atlantic ( Keigwin , 1996 ) , but may have been of less importance in other regions ( Bradley and Jones , 1992 ) .
If so , this would seem to imply that an event which was clearly intense in some regions ( such as the dry phase around 8,200 years ago across so many low and mid-latitude regions ) , was not relatively so important in other regions ( such as near to the poles ) .
The Little Ice Age was thus just another climate oscillation ( fairly small by comparison with many of the events recorded in ice cores and sediment records ) which gave cooler conditions over the lands around the North Atlantic between about 700 and 200 years ago .
Additional , smaller changes are observed in the detailed Greenland ice cap record , but it is important to note that not all the rapid changes observed in the Greenland ice cap correspond to large climate changes elsewhere .
For example , a warming of 4 deg .
C per decade was observed in an ice core from northern Greenland for the 1920's ( Dansgaard et al. 1989 ) , but this corresponded to a global shift of 0.5 deg .
C or less .
There is some evidence that this event may have been widespread ( Thompson et al. , 1993 ) , but by no means has it been demonstrated to have been global .
For this reason it is always desirable to have sources of evidence from other regions before invoking a broad , dramatic climate shift .
What this relatively recent climate shift does suggest though , is that the climate system tends to undergo most of its changes in sudden jumps , even if those changes are relatively small against the background of those seen during the Quaternary .
This is further evidence that if and when the next climate shift occurs , it will not be a gradual century - on - century change but rather a sudden step - function that will begin suddenly and occur over a decade or two .
III .
The mechanisms behind sudden climate transitions .
It is still unclear how the climate on a regional or even global scale can change as rapidly as present evidence suggests .
It appears that the climate system is more delicately balanced than had previously been thought , linked by a cascade of powerful mechanisms that can amplify a small initial change into a much larger shift in temperature and aridity ( e.g. , Rind and Overpeck , 1993 ) .
At present , the thinking of climatologists tends to emphasize several key components :
III.1 . North Atlantic circulation as a trigger or an amplifier in rapid climate changes .
The circulation of the north Atlantic Ocean probably plays a major role in either triggering or amplifying rapid climate changes in the historical and recent geological record ( Broecker 1995 , Keigwin et al. , 1994 , Jones et al. , 1996 ; Rahmstorf et al. , 1996 ) .
The North Atlantic has a peculiar circulation pattern : the north - east trending Gulf Stream carries warm and relatively salty surface water from the Gulf of Mexico up to the seas between Greenland , Iceland and Norway .
Upon reaching these regions , the surface waters cools off and ( with the combination of being cooler and relatively salty because it mixes with mid-depth overflow water from the Mediterranean ) becomes dense enough to sink into the deep ocean .
The ' pull ' exerted by this dense sinking water is thought to help maintain the strength of the warm Gulf Stream , ensuring a current of warm tropical water into the north Atlantic that sends mild air masses across to the European continent ( e.g. , Rahmstorf et al. , 1996 ; Schmitz , 1995 ) ( Fig. 3 ) .
If the sinking process in the north Atlantic were to diminish or cease , the weakening of the warm Gulf Stream would mean that Europe had colder winters ( e.g. , Broecker , 1995 ) .
However , the Gulf Stream does not give markedly warmer summers in Europe - more the opposite in fact - so a shutting off of the mild Gulf Stream air masses does not in itself explain why summers also became colder during sudden cooling events ( and why ice masses started to build up on land due to winter snows failing to melt during summer ) .
In the North Atlantic itself , sea ice would form more readily in the cooler winter waters due to a shut - off of the Gulf Stream , and for a greater part of the year the ice would form a continuous lid over the north Atlantic .
A lid of sea ice over the North Atlantic would last for a greater proportion of the year ; this would reflect back solar heat , leading to cooler summers on the adjacent landmass as well as colder winters ( e.g. , Jones et al. , 1996 ; Overpeck et al. , 1997 ) .
With cooler summers , snow cover would last longer into the spring , further cooling the climate by reflecting back the sun 's heat .
The immediate result of all this would be a European and west Siberian climate that was substantially colder , and substantially drier because the air that reached Europe would carry less moisture , having come from a cold sea ice surface rather than the warm Gulf Stream waters .
After an initial rapid cooling event , the colder summers would also tend to allow the snow to build up year - on - year into a Scandinavian ice sheet , and as the ice built up it would reflect more of the Sun 's heat , further cooling the land surface , and giving a massive high pressure zone that would be even more effective at diverting Gulf Stream air and moisture away from the mid-latititudes of Europe .
This would reinforce a much colder regional climate .
The trigger for a sudden ' switching off ' or a strong decrease in deep water formation in the North Atlantic must be found in a decrease in density of surface waters in the areas of sinking in the northern Atlantic Ocean .
Such a decrease in density would result from changes in salinity ( addition of fresh water from rivers , precipitation , or melt water ) , and / or increased temperatures ( Dickson et al. , 1988 ; Rahmstorf et al. , 1996 ) .
For example , an exceptionally wet year on the landmasses which have rivers draining into the Arctic sea ( Siberia , Canada , Alaska ) would lead to such a decreased density .
Ocean circulation modelling studies suggest that a relatively small increase in freshwater flux ( called ' polar halocline catastrophe ' ) to the Arctic Sea could cause deep water production in the north Atlantic to cease ( e.g. , Mikolajewicz and Maier - Reimer , 1994 ; Rahmstorf , 1994 ; Rahmstorf et al. , 1996 ; 141 ) .
During glacial phases , the trigger for a shut - off or a decrease in deep water formation could be the sudden emptying into the northern seas of a lake formed along the edge of a large ice sheet on land ( for instance , the very large ice - dammed lake that existed in western Siberia ) , or a diversion of a meltwater stream from the North American Laurentide ice sheet through the Gulf of St. Lawrence , as seems to have occurred as part of the trigger for the Younger Dryas cold event ( e.g. , Kennett , 1990 ; Berger and Jansen , 1995 ) .
A pulse of fresh water would dilute the dense , salty GulfStream and float on top , forming a temporary lid that stopped the sinking of water that helps drive the Gulf Stream .
The Gulf Stream could weaken and its northern end ( the North Atlantic Drift ) could switch off altogether , breaking the ' conveyer belt ' and allowing an extensive sea ice cap to form across the North Atlantic , preventing the ocean current from starting up again at its previous strength .
Theoretically , the whole process could occur very rapidly , in the space of just a few decades or even several years .
The result could be a very sudden climate change to colder conditions , as has happened many times in the area around the North Atlantic during the last 100,000 years .
The sudden switch could also occur in the opposite direction , for example if warmer summers caused the sea ice to melt back to a critical point where the sea ice lid vanished and the Gulf Stream was able to start up again .
Indeed , following an initial cooling event the evaporation of water vapour in the tropical Atlantic could result in an ' oscillator ' whereby the salinity of Atlantic Ocean surface water ( unable to sink into the north Atlantic because of the lid of sea ice ) built up to a point where strong sinking began to occur anyway at the edges of the sea ice zone .
The onset of sinking could result in a renewed northward flux of warm water and air to the north Atlantic , giving a sudden switch to warmer climates , as is observed many times within the record of the last 130,000 years or so .
The process of switching off or greatly dimishing the flow of the Gulfstream would not only affect Europe .
Antarctica would be even colder than it is now , because much of the heat that it does receive now ultimately comes from Gulf Stream water that sinks in the north Atlantic , travels in a sort of river down the western side of the deep Atlantic Basin and then rat least partially esurfaces just off the bays of the Antarctic coastline ( e.g. , Schmitz , 1995 ) .
Even though this water is only a few degrees above freezing when it reaches the surface , this water is much warmer than the adjacent Antarctic continent , helping to melt back some of the sea ice that forms around Antarctica in the ice - free regions called polynyas .
The effect of switching off the deepwater heat source would be cooler air and a greater sea ice extent around Antarctica , reflecting more sunlight and further cooling the region .
However , the north Atlantic deep water takes several hundred years to travel from its place of origin to the Antarctic coast , so it could only produce an effect a few centuries after the change occurred in the North .
It is not known what delay was present in the various climate changes that occurred between the north Atlantic region and Antarctica , but it is generally thought that other ( relatively indirect ) climate mechanisms , such as greenhouse gases in the atmosphere , linked these two far - flung regions and sometimes produced closely synchronised changes ( i.e. within a few centuries of one another ) .
Although the end of the Last Glacial and various other sudden climate events such as Heinrich events do show up in the Antarctic ice record , not all large changes show such a closely linked occurrence and timing around the world .
For example there is no clear trace of the Younger Dryas in the Vostok ice core from Antarctica ( Chapellaz et al .
1993 ; Broecker , 1998 ) , and the warming at the start of the Eemian also does not seem to particularly closely linked to the timing of the warming which took place in the northern latitudes ( Sowers et al. 1993 ) .
During the colder glacial phases , deep water formation in the present areas between Greenland , Iceland and Norway would have ceased or dimished due to a thick cap of sea ice ( though there is evidence it occasionally opened up to let Gulf Stream water through to the sea between Iceland and Norway , this did not result in much deepwater formation and so the pull and the northward heat flux seems to have been small ) .
Instead , during the most intense cold phases the deepwater formation area seems to have moved to the south of the British Isles , at the edge of the extended sea ice zone ( e.g. , , Imbrie et al .
1992 , Duplessey et al. 1984 ; Maslin et al. , 1997 ) .
Even here , deep water formation seems to have been weaker than at present , producing relatively small quantities which penetrated to mid-depths rather than to the deepest ocean basins .
This was probably at least partly because the whole surface of the Atlantic Ocean ( even the tropics ) was cooler ; with less evaporation from its surface , even the water that did reach northwards was less briney ( and thus less dense ) , so less able to sink when it reached the cold edge of the sea ice zone .
An initial slowdown of north Atlantic circulation may have been the initial trigger for a set of amplifying factors ( see below ) that rapidly led to a cooling of the tropical Atlantic , reinforcing the sluggish state of the glacial - age Gulf Stream .
The idea of Gulf Stream slowdowns as a mechanism in climate change is not merely theoretical .
There is actually evidence from the study of ocean sediments that deepwater formation in the north Atlantic was diminished during the sudden cold Heinrich events and other colder phases of the last 130,000 years , including the Younger Dryas phase ( e.g. , Fairbanks , 1989 ; Kennett , 1990 ; Maslin , 199x ) .
The same appears to have been true further back in time to 1.5 Myr ago ( Raymo et al. 1998 ) .
The process also ' switched on ' rapidly at times when climates suddenly warmed around the north Atlantic Basin , such as at the beginning of interstadials or the beginning of the present interglacial ( Ramussen et al. 1997 ) .
Decreasing deep water formation occurred at times when the climate was cooling towards the end of an interstadial , and it diminished suddenly with the final cooling event that marked the end of the interstadial ( Ramussen et al. , 1997 ) , and over a period of less than 300 years at the beginning of the Younger Dryas ( e.g. , Berger and Jansen , 1995 ) .
The Intra -Eemian cooling event - if it really did happen - is perhaps one of the most alarming of the changes observed from recent climate history , because it occurred in the midst of an interglacial not too dissimilar from our own .
There are strong signs that a rapid cut - off in NADW formation was associated with this climate change ( Maslin and Tzedakis , 1996 ) .
This event near 122 ka seems to have coincided with intense cooling and freshening in the seas west of Ireland and in the northern Norwegian Sea ( Cortijo et al. , 1994 ; Fronval and Jansen , 1996 ) .
Today any similar reduction in the salinity of the sea surface in these two areas would be enough to result in a reduction of deep water formation in the Nordic Seas ( e.g. Bryan , 1986 ; Dickson et al. , 1990 ; Seidov and Maslin , 1996 ) .
This reduction could explain why Europe ( and perhaps other areas ) cooled so dramatically ( Maslin et al. 1998 ) .
What might have caused this freshening of the North Atlantic seas ?
The fresh water could have come from melting icebergs , from increased rain and snowfall in the region , or a change in surface currents that brought in fresher water from another part of the ocean .
There is no evidence of an increased supply of melting icebergs ( Keigwin et al. , 1994 ; McManus et al. , 1994 ) during this phase .
Instead , one or more of the following factors seems a more likely cause : 1 ) greater incursion of relatively ' fresh ' North Pacific water through the Bering Strait and around the Arctic Seas to the North Atlantic during times of raised sea level during the Eemian ( Shaffer and Bendtsen , 1994 ) , 2 ) enhanced precipitation over the North Atlantic and seas between Iceland and Norway , due to the greater amount of solar heat reaching the northern latitudes during the summer at that time ( due to the Milankovitch rhythms in the Earth 's orbit ; see below ) , and 3 ) the closure of the Northern Baltic sea link to the North Atlantic ocean , which would ensure that more fresh water ended up in the area ( van Andel and Tzedakis , 1996 ) .
We do not yet know how widespread the event was , or what caused it , but its occurrence at least points to NADW formation being a ' weak point ' in the interglacial climate system ( e.g. , Broecker , 1997 ) , with potential to affect climate rapidly in the North Atlantic region and perhaps elsewhere .
This is rather worrying , for we are presently in the midst of an interglacial phase not greatly unlike the Eemian .
Broader changes in temperature and rainfall over much of the world are thought likely to have occured as a result of a switching on or off of the north Atlantic circulation ( Jones et al. , 1996 ; Rind and Overpeck , 1993 ) , and these changes would result in amplification by the feedback mechanisms suggested below .
As evidence of such a broader link to global climate , over recent years changes in the monsoon - belt climates of Africa and Asia have also been observed to occur in association with decadal - scale phases of weaker north Atlantic circulation ( e.g. , Hurrel , 1995 , 1996 ) .
By extrapolation , it is generally thought that bigger changes in the north Atlantic circulation would result in correspondingly larger changes in climates in the monsoon belts and in other parts of the world .
In addition to this relatively direct effect of deepwater on North Atlantic and Antarctic climate , other subtle effects on global climate would be expected to result from a sudden change in north Atlantic circulation , or indeed they may themselves trigger a change in the north Atlantic circulation by their effects on atmospheric processes .
These include the interaction with global carbon dioxide concentrations , dust content and surface reflectivity ( albedo ) .
II.2 Carbon dioxide and methane concentration as a feedback in sudden changes .
Analysis of bubbles in ice cores shows that at the peak of glacial phases , CO2 was about 30 % lower than during interglacial conditions ( e.g. , Jouzel et al. , 1993 ) .
We do not at present know whether the lower glacial CO2 levels were a cause or merely an effect of the ice ages .
Lower CO2 level might result from changes in plankton productivity ( e.g. , Lyle et al. , 1988 ; see also discussion in Thomas et al. , 1995 ) , drawing more carbon down out of the atmosphere once climate began to cool .
Terrestrial biomass reservoirs if anything seem to move in the opposite direction , releasing carbon to the atmosphere with the onset of glaciation ( Adams & Faure 1998 ) .
The lower carbon dioxide concentrations resulting from greater ocean carbon storage would cool the atmosphere , and allow more snow and ice to accumulate on land .
Relatively rapid changes in climate , occurring over a few thousand years , could have resulted from changes in the atmospheric CO2 concentration ( e.g. , Broecker , 1997 ) .
The actual importance of carbon dioxide in terms of the climate system is unknown , though computer climate simulations tend to suggest that it directly cooled the world by less than 1 deg .
C on average , but due to amplification of this change by various factors within the climate system such as the water vapour content , the resulting change in global climate could have been more than 2 deg .
C ( e.g. , Houghton et al. , 1995 ) .
In addition , warming as a result of increased atmospheric CO2 levels is greater at higher latitudes , possibly inducing snow and ice melt .
A problem with invoking atmospheric carbon dioxide levels as a causal factor in sudden climate changes is that they seems to have varied too slowly , following on the timescale of millennia what often occurred on the timescale of decades - but the resolution of our records may not be good enough to resolve this question now .
Methane , a less important greenhouse gas , was also 50 % lower during glacial phases ( e.g. , Sowers et al. , 1993 ) , probably due to reduced biological activity on the colder , drier land surfaces ( Meeker et al. , 1997 ) .
However , it does seem to have increased rapidly in concentration in association with changes in climate , reaching its normal Holocene levels in around 150 years or less during the global climate warming at the end of the Younger Dryas , around 11,500 years ago ( Taylor et al. 1997 ) .
Such sudden rises in atmospheric methane concentration were probably not important in affecting climate ; the warming effect of a 50 % change in methane would have been much less than an equivalent change in CO2 , because methane is at such a low overall concentration in the atmosphere .
It has been suggested that another mechanism , involving sudden and short - lived releases of massive amounts of methane from the ocean floors , could sometimes have resulted in rapid warming phases that do not leave any trace in terms of raised methane levels in the ice core data , where the trapped gas bubbles generally only indicate methane concentrations at a time resolution of centuries rather than the few years or decades that such a ' methane pulse ' might last for .
However , ice cores from areas where the ice sheet built up particularly rapidly ( Chapellaz et al. 1993 , Taylor et al. 1997 ) show detailed time resolution of the record of methane concentration in the atmosphere , and fail to show evidence of sudden ' bursts ' of methane .
However , the idea does remain a possibility , to at least some biogeochemists ( Brook et al. 1996 ) .
III.3 Surface reflectivity ( albedo ) of ice , snow and vegetation .
The intensely white surface of sea ice and snow reflects back much of the sun 's heat , hence keeping the surface cool .
Presently , about a third of the heat received from the sun is reflected back into space , and changes in this proportion thus have the potential to strongly influence global climate ( e.g. , Crowley and North , 1991 ) .
In general the ice cover on the sea , and the snow cover on the land , have the potential to set off rapid climate changes because they can either appear or disappear rapidly given the right circumstances .
Ice sheets are more permanent objects which , whilst they reflect a large proportion of the sunlight that falls upon them , take hundreds of years to melt or build up because of their sheer size .
When present , sea ice or snow can have a major effect in cooling regional and global climates , but with a slight change in conditions ( e.g. just a slightly warmer summer ) they will each disappear rapidly , giving a much greater warming effect because sunlight is now absorbed by the much darker sea or land cover underneath .
In an unusually cold year , the opposite could happen , with snow staying on the ground throughout the summer , itself resulting in a cooler summer climate .
A runaway change in snow or sea ice ( positive feedback ) could thus be an important amplifier or trigger for a major change in global temperature .
It is possible that by slow changes over millennia or centuries , the climate could be brought to a break point involving a runaway change in snow and ice reflectivity over a few decades .
These slow background changes might include variations in the earth 's orbit ( affecting summer sunlight intensity ) , or gradual changes in carbon dioxide concentration , or in the northern forest cover which affects the amount of snow that is exposed to sunlight .
It is possible that the relatively long - lived ice sheets might occasionally help bring about very rapid changes in climate , by rapidly ' surging ' outwards into the sea and giving rise to large numbers of icebergs that would reflect back the sun 's heat and rapidly cool the climate ( e.g. , MacAyeal , 1993a , b ) .
The intensely cold Heinrich events that punctuated the last ice age were initially thought to be caused by sudden slippage of the Laurentide ice sheet that covered most of Canada .
It appears , however , that all the separate ice sheets around the north Atlantic surged outwards simultaneously , and that their outwards movement probably thus represents a secondary response to an initial climate cooling ( e.g. a change in the deepwater formation system in the north Atlantic ) rather than the initial trigger ( Bond et al. , 1997 . ) .
This does not mean that ice surges and ice bergs were irrelevant in the extreme cold of Heinrich events ; by their albedo effects they may have helped to intensify and temporarily stabilize a cooling event that would have occurred anyway .
However , this amplification may have occurred decades or centuries after the initial ' step function ' event associated with the rapid cooling .
Another , possibly neglected , factor in rapid regional or global climate changes may be the shifts in the albedo of the land surface that result from changes in vegetation or algal cover on desert and polar desert surfaces .
An initial spreading of dark - coloured soil surface algae or lichens following a particularly warm or moist year might provide a ' kick ' to the climate system by absorbing more sunlight and thus warming the climate , and also reducing the dust flux from the soil surface to the atmosphere ( see below ) .
Larger vascular plants and mosses might have the same effect on the timescale of years or decades .
The detailed analysis of the ending of the Younger Dryas by Taylor et al.
1997 , suggests that warming occurred around 20 years earlier in lower and mid latitudes , perhaps due to some initial change in vegetation or snow cover affecting land surface albedo .
Some of the earlier climate warming events during the last 130,000 years show similar signs of changes in dust flux followed by changes in high - latitude temperature ( Raymo pers . comm. 1997 ) .
III .4
Water vapour as a feedback in sudden changes .
Water vapour is a more important greenhouse gas than carbon dioxide , and as its atmospheric concentration can vary rapidly , it could have been a major trigger or amplifier in many sudden climate changes .
For example , a change in sea ice extent or in carbon dioxide , would be expected to affect the flux of water vapour into the atmosphere from the oceans , possibly amplifying climate changes .
Large , rapid changes in vegetation cover might also have added to these changes in water vapour flux to the atmosphere .
In a recent ( 1997 ) lecture presentation and an article in Atlantic Monthly ( December 1997 ) the geologist W.S. Broecker suggested that water vapour may act as a global ' messenger ' , co-ordinating rapid climate changes , many of which seem to have occurred all around the world fairly simultaneously , or in close succession .
Broecker notes the evidence for large changes in the water vapour content of the atmosphere in terms of changes in the 18O content of tropical high Andean ice cores ( Thompson et al. 1995 ) .
III .5 . Dust and particulates as a feedback in sudden changes .
Particles of mineral dust , plus the aerosols formed from fires and from chemicals evaporating out of vegetation and the oceans , may also be a major feedback in co-ordinating and amplifying sudden large climate fluctuations .
Ice cores from Greenland ( Taylor et al. 1997 ; Mayewski et al. , 1997 ) , Antarctica ( Jouzel et al. , 1996 ) and tropical mountain glaciers ( Thompson et al. , 1987 ; 1995 ) show greater concentrations of mineral dust during colder phases .
This suggests that there was more dust around in the world 's atmosphere during cold periods that during warm phases .
It seems that the atmospheric content of dust and sulphate particles changed very rapidly , over just a few decades , during sudden climate transitions in the Greenland ice core record ( Taylor et al. 1997 ) .
The drier and colder the world gets , the more desert there is and the higher the wind speeds , sending more desert dust into the atmosphere where it may reinforce the cold and dryness by forming stable ' inversion ' layers that block sunlight and prevent rain - giving convective processes .
A run of wet years in the monsoon belt could trigger rapid revegetation of desert surfaces by vascular plants or algae , and a sudden decrease in the amount of dust blown into the atmosphere .
Less dust could help make conditions still warmer and wetter , pushing the climate system rapidly in a particular direction ( though dust and other particles might actually tend to warm the surface if they blow over lighter - coloured areas covered by snow or ice ; Overpeck et al. 1997 ) .
It has even been proposed that variations in the influx of dust from outer space ( Interplanetary Dust Particles , IDPs ) could have played a role in triggering the large - scale glacial / interglacial alternations at 100 kyr periodicities ( Muller and MacDonald , 1997 ; Farley and Paterson , 1995 ) .
It was proposed that the accretion rate of IPDs might be linked to the varying inclination of the Earth 's orbit with respect to the inavriable plane of the solar system .
It now appears , however , that this process is not likely to have been of influence on ice ages on Earth ( Kortenkamp and Dermott , 1998 ) .
Haze production is a poorly understood but potentially very significant factor in triggering or amplifying sudden climate changes .
Given what is known of the present - day patterns of emission of haze - producing compounds from land vegetation , decade - to - century timescale changes in vegetation distribution and activity could have resulted in rapid changes in global haze production ( Adams et al. submitted manuscript ) , although because this factor eludes the sedimentological record , it may be impossible to test it with observations from the past .
III .6 . Seasonal sunlight intensity as a background to sudden changes .
A major background factor in pacing climate switches on timescales of tens of thousands of years seems to have been the set of ' Milankovitch ' rhythms in seasonal sunlight distribution or insolation ( Imbrie and Imbrie , 1992 ; Imbrie et al. , 1992 , 1993 ) .
Although the insolation values change gradually over thousands of years , they may take the earth 's climate to a ' break point ' at which other factors will begin to amplify change into a sudden transition .
In one of the Milankovitch rhythms , the shape of the earth 's orbit shifts from more elliptical to more nearly circular at periodicities of about 100 kyr , which alters the total amount of solar radiation received on Earth .
In another the degree of tilt of the earth 's axis changes ( periodicty of 42 kyr ) , and in the third the timing of the seasons changes relative to the earth 's elliptical track nearer and further from the sun ( periodicities of 19 and 23 kyr ) .
These latter two rhythms alter the relative amount of solar radiation reaching the Earth 's Northern and Southern Hemispheres during summer and winter .
Times when summer sunlight in the Northern Hemisphere is strong ( but when the winter sunlight is correspondingly weak ) tend to be the times when the rapid global transition from glacial to interglacial conditions occurs .
These big glacial - interglacial transitions roughly follow the 100,000 - year timescale during the last 900 kyr , when the three different rhythms ( and possibly the poorly understood factors such as the internal structure of ice - sheets ; MacAyeal , 1993a , b ) line up to give a big increase in northern summer warmth .
However the lesser individual rhythms can also be detected in the temperature record on the 19,000 and 42,000 - year timescales , and in fact the timing of interglacial onset tends to more closely follow multiples of the 19,000 year cycle than an exact correspondence to the 100,000 year cycle ( Imbrie et al. 1992 , 1993 ) .
This is thought to be due to the effects of summer temperatures on various of the factors mentioned above ; for example , it ensures melting back of snow and sea ice in summer , helping the earth to absorb more solar radiation and thus to heat up further .
It is generally accepted that the effect of changes in heat budget as a result of the Milankovitch variations by themselves are not enough to bring about the large , rapid changes in climate that follow these rhythms in seasonal sunlight , and some set of positive feedback factors - directly or indirectly linked to the seasonal insolation changes - must be involved to bring the earth out of glacial and into interglacial conditions .
It is important to note , however , that most of the very rapid climate transitions during the last 100,000 years do not show any clear association in timing with the background Milankovitch rhythms , especially the fluctuations at periodicities below 19 kyr .
In these cases their ultimate trigger must lie in other factors , probably a combination of many processes that sometimes line up to set the climate system on a runaway course in either the direction of cooling or warming .
IV .
Could dramatic decade - timescale climate transitions occur in the near future ?
From present understanding of the record of the last 150,000 years , at least a few large climate changes certainly occurred on the timescale of individual human lifetimes , the most well - studied and well - established of these being the ending of the Younger Dryas , and various Holocene climate shifts .
Many other substantial shifts in climate took at most a few centuries , and they too may have occurred over a few decades .
The high time resolution in the climate record , however , is either not available , or records have not yet been studied in enough detail .
Some very interesting new data sets may be expected to become available within a few years , as a result of drilling by the Ocean Drilling Program in the Saanich Inlet ( western Canada ; Leg 169A ) and in the northern Atlantic ( Leg 172 ) .
It will take time before the meticulous work of logging year - by - year changes in long ice cores and lake records can give a relatively complete picture of when , and exactly how quickly , rapid climate changes occurred .
There are many ' suspected ' decade - timescale climate changes from the past ( just as the Younger Dryas was until recently a ' suspected ' but distinctly unproven decadal - scale climate shift ) , but very few ' proven ' ones .
Greater knowledge of how frequently such sudden events have occurred , and under what general circumstances , is required before a greater understanding can be reached .
It is difficult to say what the risks are of a sudden switch in global or North Atlantic region climate , because the mechanisms behind all past climate changes ( sudden or otherwise ) are incompletely understood .
They appear to be real , however , and relatively small - scale changes in North Atlantic salinity have been observed and studied in the last few decades ( Dickson et al. , 1988 ) .
Fluctuations in surface water characteristics and precipitation patterns in that region vary on decadal time scales with variations in the strength of high - pressure areas over the Azores and Iceland ( the North Atlantic Oscillation ; Hurrel , 1995 , 1996 ) , providing an observed apparent link between salinity and climate fluctuations .
The fear is that relatively small anthropogenic changes in high - latitude temperature as a result of increased concentrations of greenhouse gases might switch North Atlantic circulation and alter the course of the Gulfstream during such natural fluctuations .
Not even knowing how often decade - timescale changes occurred in the recent geological past , we are handicapped in trying to find mechanisms which might explain them and be used for forecasting future events .
Even if one knew everything there was to know about past climate mechanisms , it is likely that we would still not be able to forecast such events confidently into the future .
This is because the system will have been influenced by probabilistic processes ( due to the chaotic nature of the ocean - climate system , with runaway changes coming from miniscule differences in initial conditions ; e.g. Crowley and North , 1991 ) , so it is not justifiable to talk in terms of what ' definitely ' will or will not happen in the future - even though the public and policymakers are looking for certainities .
All that one can reasonably do is set out what the current understanding is , acknowledging that this understanding is limited and may turn out to be wrong in certain key respects , and then talk in terms of probablities of particular events occurring .
At the outset , there is the possibility that most of the climate instability seen in the recent geological past is not relevant to our immediate future , because it represents a different system ; a ' glacial ' state , almost certainly charcaterized by a different pattern of deep - sea circulation ( e.g. , Rahmstorf et al. , 1996 ) .
Most of the rapid climate transitions during the last 150,000 years seem to have occurred against the background of a world with a larger northern ice sheet extent than at present , perhaps indicating that in this glacial mode the climate is predisposed to be more unstable than in our present interglacial state ( e.g. , Rind and Chandler , 1991 ) .
Even the sudden and widespread early - to - mid Holocene arid event ( 8,200 y.a. ) occurred at a time when large parts of the Laurentide ice sheet remained unmelted over Canada .
However , there were at least some rapid climate transitions which occurred when ice sheet extent was no greater than at present , such as the apparently widespread late Holocene cool / arid events at 8200 yrs BP , at around 3,800 yrs BP , and another cool event around 2,600 yrs BP .
( although the time taken for onset of these later Holocene changes in regional and global climates does not yet seem to have been determined ) .
Various large full - interglacial climate changes during the Holocene and certain earlier interglacials ( e.g. the Eemian and the Holstein Interglacials in Europe ; Winograd et al. 1997 ) that show up in the Greenland ice cap also seem to correlate with genuinely large climate shifts in Europe and elsewhere , taking conditions from temperate to boreal or even sub-arctic .
Whether they occurred over decades , centuries or thousands of years , they offer a worrying analogue for what might happen if greenhouse gas emissions continue unchecked .
Judging by its past behaviour under both glacial ( e.g. the ending of the Younger Dryas ) and interglacial conditions ( e.g. the various Holocene climate oscillations leading up to the 20th century ;
Alley et al. , 1997 ) , climate has a tendency to remain quite stable for most of the time and then suddenly ' flip ' ; at least sometimes over just a few decades , due to the influence of the various triggering and feedback mechanisms discussed above .
Such observations suggest that even without anthropogenic climate modification there is always an axe hanging over our head , in the form of random very large - scale changes in the natural climate system ; a possibility that policy makers should perhaps bear in mind with contingency plans and international treaties designed to cope with sudden famines on a greater scale than any experienced in written history .
By starting to disturb the system , humans may simply be increasing the likelihood of sudden events which could always occur .
Another source of evidence seems to underline the potential importance of sudden climate changes in the coming centuries and millennia : computer modelling studies of the ( still incompletely understood ) north Atlantic deepwater formation system suggest that it is indeed sensitive to quite small changes in freshwater runoff from the adjacent continents , whether from river fluxes or meltwater from ice caps ( Rahmstorf et al. , 1996 ) .
Some scenarios in which atmospheric carbon dioxide levels are allowed to rise to several times higher than at present result in increased runoff from rivers entering the Arctic Basin , and a rapid weakening of the Gulf Stream , resulting in colder conditions ( especially in winter ) across much of Europe .
Just doubling the amount of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere could be enough to set off such a change ( Broecker , 1997 ) .
Whilst these are only preliminary models , and thus subject to revision as more work is done , they do seem to point in the same direction as the ancient climate record in suggesting that sudden shutdowns or intensification of the Gulf Stream circulation might occur under full interglacial conditions , and be brought on by the disturbance caused by rising greenhouse gas levels .
To paraphrase W.S. Broecker ; ' Climate is an ill - tempered beast , and we are poking it with sticks ' .

When you build a Domain Specific Language ( DSL ) , how do you go about making it executable .
This is an easy question to answer for an internal DSL , since they are embedded into real languages .
An external DSL needs more work .
Here I take a simple DSL example and show a few simple ways to generate code from it .
I recently wrote an article describing language oriented programming and the recent evolution of a bunch of tools which I call language workbenches .
In that article I used a simple Domain Specific Language to illustrate my points .
Although I discussed what this DSL looked like in the article , I did n't talk about how you would actually make that language executable by generating code .
It 's useful to get an appreciation of this because that can help you understand the nature of a language workbench 's abstract representation and how a language workbench 's generator works .
So in this article I 'll take the simple example from that article , and show some simple ways by which we could go about generating code .
This will lead from a simple single - pass approach to ones that involve building up an abstract representation and using templating to generate the code .
When thinking about the trade - offs in using DSLs , you do n't really need to understand how generation works .
As I delve into how language workbenches work , however , this will be handy .
I 'll start with the custom language case .
To refresh your memory the custom language looks like :
mapping SVCL dsl.ServiceCall 4-18 : CustomerName 19 - 23 : CustomerID 24 - 27 : CallTypeCode 28-35 : DateOfCallString mapping USGE dsl .
Usage 4 - 8 : CustomerID 9-22 : CustomerName 30 - 30 : Cycle 31 - 36 : ReadDate
In order to get the custom case to work we need to transform it into the equivalent of the internal DSL case .
public void Configure ( Reader target ) { target .
AddStrategy ( ConfigureServiceCall ( ) ) ; target .
AddStrategy ( ConfigureUsage ( ) ) ; } private ReaderStrategy ConfigureServiceCall ( ) { ReaderStrategy result = new ReaderStrategy ( " SVCL " , typeof ( ServiceCall ) ) ; result .
AddFieldExtractor ( 4 , 18 , " CustomerName " ) ; result .
AddFieldExtractor ( 19 , 23 , " CustomerID " ) ; result .
AddFieldExtractor ( 24 , 27 , " CallTypeCode " ) ; result .
AddFieldExtractor ( 28 , 35 , " DateOfCallString " ) ; return result ; } private ReaderStrategy ConfigureUsage ( ) { ReaderStrategy result = new ReaderStrategy ( " USGE " , typeof ( Usage ) ) ; result .
AddFieldExtractor ( 4 , 8 , " CustomerID " ) ; result .
AddFieldExtractor(9 , 22 , " CustomerName " ) ; result .
AddFieldExtractor ( 30 , 30 , " Cycle " ) ; result .
AddFieldExtractor ( 31 , 36 , " ReadDate " ) ; return result ; }
The reader framework is very simple , there 's just the reader class that processes a file of events that has strategies for each kind of event that may appear in the file .
The reader reads each line , extracts the event code , and hands off to the strategy for the particular line .
The job of configuration is to create the right strategies and send them to the reader .
To encapsulate the code for creating the readers from an external configuration file I that code is a separate reader builder class .
We 'll explore a number of ways to do this as we go , so you 'll see several varieties of reader builder .
The first one just simply reads the custom configuration file and sets up the reader .
Single Pass Builder
I create a builder by telling it which configuration file to use .
I then use it to configure a reader .
class ReaderBuilderTextSinglePass ... public ReaderBuilderTextSinglePass ( string filename ) { _filename = filename ; } private string _filename ; public void Configure ( Reader reader ) { _reader = reader ; using ( TextReader input = File. OpenText( _filename ) ) { while ( ( _line = input. ReadLine ( ) ) != null ) ProcessLine ( ) ; } } private Reader _reader ; private string _line = null ;
To process a line of the custom configuration file , I test the line with various regular expressions and react depending on what kind of line I see .
Blanks and comments are ignored .
class ReaderBuilderTextSinglePass ... private void ProcessLine ( ) { if ( isBlank ( ) ) return ; if ( isComment ( ) ) return ; else if ( isNewMapping ( ) ) makeNewStrategy ( ) ; else makeFieldExtract ( ) ; } private bool isBlank ( ) { Regex blankRE = new Regex ( @ " ^\s * $ " ) ; return blankRE.IsMatch ( _line ) ; } private bool isComment ( ) { return _line [ 0 ] == ' # ' ; } private bool isNewMapping ( ) { Regex blankRE = new Regex ( @ " \s* mapping " ) ; return blankRE.IsMatch ( _line ) ; } When I see a mapping declaration I make a new strategy .
class ReaderBuilderTextSinglePass ... private void makeNewStrategy ( ) { string [ ] tokens = _line . Split( whitespace ( ) ) ; _currentStrategy = new ReaderStrategy ( tokens [ 1 ] . Trim ( whitespace ( ) ) , Type.GetType(tokens [ 2 ] ) ) ; _reader .
AddStrategy ( _currentStrategy ) ; } private char [ ] whitespace ( ) { char [ ] result = {' ' , '\t '} ; return result ; } When I see a field declaration I add a new field extractor to the strategy .
class ReaderBuilderTextSinglePass ... private void makeFieldExtract ( ) { string [ ] tokens1 = _line .
Split ( ' :' ) ; string targetProperty = tokens 1 [ 1 ] .
Trim (' ' ) ; string [ ] tokens2 = tokens 1 [ 0 ] .
Trim ( whitespace ( ) ) .
Split ('-' ) ; int begin = Int32.Parse ( tokens2 [ 0 ] ) ; int end = Int32. Parse ( tokens2 [ 1 ] ) ; _currentStrategy .
AddFieldExtractor( begin , end , targetProperty ) ; } This is certainly not the prettiest parser that 's been written - even by me - but it 's simple and does the job .
Essentially what I 'm doing is parsing the configuration file and configuring the reader as I go .
For a simple example like this a single pass transformation from custom DSL to framework is quick and easy .
Two Pass Builder
Now let 's look at a slightly different way of doing it .
What I 'm going to do now is a two pass process .
The parser reads the configuration file and produces a data structure .
A separate generator then looks at this data structure to configure the reader .
Figure 1 : The data structure for the abstract representation of the language .
Figure 1 shows this data structure .
As you see it represents the abstract syntax of our mapping language .
People who remember their compiler classes will recognize this as an Abstract Syntax Tree for the language .
Two classes manipulate this tree .
The parser reads the text input and creates the tree .
The generator then reads the tree and configures the reader object .
The parser is very similar to the parser we saw before .
The basic flow of control is identical .
class ReaderBuilderTextSinglePass ... public ReaderBuilderTextSinglePass ( string filename ) { _filename = filename ; } private string _filename ; public void Configure ( Reader reader ) { _reader = reader ; using ( TextReader input = File. OpenText( _filename ) ) { while ( ( _line = input. ReadLine ( ) ) != null ) ProcessLine ( ) ; } } private Reader _reader ; private string _line = null ;
The only change in this start up code is to return the root of the AST rather than a reader .
This decision making is entirely the same .
class BuilderParserText ... private void ProcessLine ( ) { if ( isBlank ( ) ) return ; if ( isComment ( ) ) return ; else if ( isNewMapping ( ) ) makeMapping ( ) ; else make Field ( ) ; } private bool isBlank ( ) { Regex blankRE = new Regex ( @ " ^\s * $ " ) ; return blankRE.IsMatch ( _line ) ; } private bool isComment ( ) { return _line [ 0 ] == ' # ' ; } private bool isNewMapping ( ) { Regex blankRE = new Regex ( @ " \s* mapping " ) ; return blankRE.IsMatch ( _line ) ; } private char [ ] whitespace ( ) { char [ ] result = {' ' , '\t '} ; return result ; }
The changes occur in the actions once the parser has parsed out the broad tokens .
In this case the parser adds mapping objects to the root of the AST when it sees the mapping line .
class BuilderParserText ... private void makeMapping ( ) { _currentMapping = new ReaderConfiguration .
Mapping ( ) ; _result.Mappings.Add(_currentMapping ) ; string [ ] tokens = _line . Split( whitespace ( ) ) ; _currentMapping .
Code = tokens [ 1 ] . Trim ( whitespace ( ) ) ; _currentMapping .TargetClassName = tokens [ 2 ] . Trim ( whitespace ( ) ) ; } Similarly when it sees fields it adds field objects .
class BuilderParserText ... private void makeField ( ) { ReaderConfiguration .
Field f = new ReaderConfiguration .
Field ( ) ; string [ ] tokens1 = _line .
Split ( ' :' ) ; f. FieldName = tokens 1 [ 1 ] . Trim (' ' ) ; string [ ] tokens2 = tokens 1 [ 0 ] .
Trim ( whitespace ( ) ) .
Split ('-' ) ; f. Start = Int32.Parse ( tokens2[ 0 ] ) ; f. End = Int32.Parse ( tokens2 [ 1 ] ) ; _currentMapping .
Fields .
Add(f ) ; } }
The generator now reads this structure to configure the framework .
It 's very simple class .
class BuilderGenerator ... public void Configure ( Reader result , ReaderConfiguration configuration ) { foreach ( ReaderConfiguration .
Mapping mapping in configuration .
Mappings ) makeStrategy ( result , mapping ) ; } private void makeStrategy ( Reader result , ReaderConfiguration .
Mapping mapping ) { ReaderStrategy strategy = new ReaderStrategy ( mapping .
Code , mapping .
TargetClass ) ; result .
AddStrategy ( strategy ) ; foreach ( ReaderConfiguration .
Field field in mapping .
Fields ) strategy .
AddFieldExtractor ( field .
Start , field .
End , field .
FieldName ) ; } What 's the advantage of separating the two stages ?
It does cost us a bit of complexity - we have to add the AST classes .
If we were only reading and writing to a single format it 's arguable whether the AST is worth the effort - at least for this simple case .
The real advantage in the AST lies when we want to read or write multiple formats .
Let 's allow our DSL to be written in an XML concrete syntax as well as the custom one .
Again to save you running around this document here 's the XML version .
< ReaderConfiguration > < Mapping Code = " SVCL " TargetClass = " dsl.ServiceCall " > < Field name = " CustomerName " start = " 4 " end = " 18 " / >
< Field name = " CustomerID " start = " 19 " end = " 23 " / >
< Field name = " CallTypeCode " start = " 24 " end = " 27 " / >
< Field name = " DateOfCallString " start = " 28 " end = " 35 " / > </ Mapping > < Mapping Code = " USGE " TargetClass = " dsl. Usage " >
< Field name = " CustomerID " start = " 4 " end = " 8 " />
< Field name = " CustomerName " start = " 9 " end = " 22 " / >
< Field name = " Cycle " start = " 30 " end = " 30 " / >
< Field name = " ReadDate " start = " 31 " end = " 36 " / > </ Mapping > </ ReaderConfiguration >
To read this format all we have to do is write a new parser - we can use the same generator .
class BuilderParserXml ... ReaderConfiguration _result = new ReaderConfiguration ( ) ; string _filename ; public BuilderParserXml ( ) { } public BuilderParserXml( string filename ) { _filename = filename ; } public void run ( ) { XPathDocument doc = new XPathDocument ( File.OpenText( _filename ) ) ; XPathNavigator nav = doc.CreateNavigator ( ) ; XPathNodeIterator it = nav.
Select ( " // Mapping " ) ; while ( it.MoveNext ( ) ) ProcessMappingNode( it. Current ) ; } public ReaderConfiguration ReaderConfiguration { get { return _result ; } } private void ProcessMappingNode ( XPathNavigator nav ) { ReaderConfiguration .
Mapping currentMapping = new ReaderConfiguration .
Mapping ( ) ; _result.Mappings.Add(currentMapping ) ; currentMapping .
Code = nav.GetAttribute ( " Code " , " " ) ; currentMapping.TargetClassName = nav.GetAttribute ( " TargetClass " , " " ) ; XPathNodeIterator it = nav.SelectChildren ( " Field " , " " ) ; while ( it.MoveNext ( ) ) currentMapping .
Fields.Add(ProcessFieldNode( it.Current ) ) ; } private ReaderConfiguration .
Field ProcessFieldNode ( XPathNavigator nav ) { ReaderConfiguration .
Field result = new ReaderConfiguration .
Field ( ) ; result .
FieldName = nav.GetAttribute ( " name " , " " ) ; result .
Start = Convert.ToInt16(nav.GetAttribute ( " start " , " " ) ) ; result .
End = Convert.ToInt16(nav.GetAttribute ( " end " , " " ) ) ; return result ; } The XML parser is a bit easier to write , because the tools do all the text munging for us , all we have to do is read the resulting XML tree .
It creates exactly the same objects as the custom text parser , so the same generator will work the same .
( A further advantage of the two step process is that we test each step independently too . )
Writing a parser like this by hand is okay for a language as simple as this , but I would n't suggest it for more complicated languages .
Parser generator tools exist that can take a grammar definition of a language and help you generate an AST .
You do n't have to get much more complex than this example to make these tools worthwhile .
Although it takes a bit of effort to learn how to use them , the results are much easier to deal with .
( Essentially grammars are a DSL for helping you parse languages into an abstract representation . )
I wo n't discuss parser generators any more here because the parsing part of the process is n't important for language workbenches .
In a language workbench , the abstract representation takes a much more central role than it does in conventional programming - together with the idea that you can have multiple human readable forms for the same abstract representation .
Using Templates for Generation
In the above examples , we used some procedural code to generate the framework classes , which works very nicely in this case .
Another approach to the generator is to actually produce C# output which can then be compiled in with the framework .
This allows the configuration files to be brought into the system at compile time rather than runtime .
Depending on the situation this can be a bane rather than a boon , but it 's worth exploring this approach here - again because we 'll see it again in language workbenches .
The idea behind templates is to edit your output file in its final format , but with little markers to indicate where you want the generator to insert code .
The various server page technologies ( PHP , JSP , ASP ) use templates to add dynamic content to web pages .
In this case we 'll use templates to add generated content to a skeleton C# file .
To demonstrate I 'm going to use NVelocity .
NVelocity is the .NET port of the popular Java templating engine : Velocity .
I like Velocity because it 's simple - many people like to use Velocity instead of JSPs .
NVelocity is still in development and as I used it I found its documentation to be very limited .
Fortunately the template language ( VTL ) is the same as the Java version , and the documentation there is usable .
Running NVelocity can be the tricky bit .
Here I have a velocity builder class that creates an instance of the velocity engine which I can use to build the files I need .
class VelocityBuilder ... public Velocity Builder ( string templateDir , string configDir , string targetDir ) { engine = new VelocityEngine ( ) ; this .configDir = configDir ; this .
targetDir = targetDir ; engine .
SetProperty(RuntimeConstants_Fields.FILE_RESOURCE_LOADER_PATH , templateDir ) ; engine .
Init ( ) ; config = new BuilderParserText( configDir + " ReaderConfig.txt " ) .
Run ( ) ; } VelocityEngine engine ; string configDir ; string targetDir ; ReaderConfiguration config ;
When I 'm doing templating I usually like to first write a hard coded class for a single case , get that class working and debugged , and then ( as gradually as I can ) replace the hard coded elements with templated elements .
I 'll show this two ways .
First I 'll use templating to generate our C# configuration code from earlier on .
This is n't typically how you would do it , but it gives me a chance to demonstrate templating on something familiar .
The configuration code looks like this .
public void Configure ( Reader target ) { target .
AddStrategy ( ConfigureServiceCall ( ) ) ; target .
AddStrategy ( ConfigureUsage ( ) ) ; } private ReaderStrategy ConfigureServiceCall ( ) { ReaderStrategy result = new ReaderStrategy ( " SVCL " , typeof ( ServiceCall ) ) ; result .
AddFieldExtractor ( 4 , 18 , " CustomerName " ) ; result .
AddFieldExtractor ( 19 , 23 , " CustomerID " ) ; result .
AddFieldExtractor ( 24 , 27 , " CallTypeCode " ) ; result .
AddFieldExtractor ( 28 , 35 , " DateOfCallString " ) ; return result ; } private ReaderStrategy ConfigureUsage ( ) { ReaderStrategy result = new ReaderStrategy ( " USGE " , typeof ( Usage ) ) ; result .
AddFieldExtractor ( 4 , 8 , " CustomerID " ) ; result .
AddFieldExtractor(9 , 22 , " CustomerName " ) ; result .
AddFieldExtractor ( 30 , 30 , " Cycle " ) ; result .
AddFieldExtractor ( 31 , 36 , " ReadDate " ) ; return result ; }
The templated version of this looks like this .
public void Configure ( Reader target ) { # foreach ( $ map in $ {config. Mappings} ) target .
AddStrategy ( Configure${map.TargetClassNameOnly} ( ) ) ; #end } # foreach ( $ map in $ config .
Mappings ) private ReaderStrategy Configure${map.TargetClassNameOnly} ( ) { ReaderStrategy result = new ReaderStrategy ( " $map. Code " , typeof ( $map.TargetClassName ) ) ; # foreach ( $f in $ map .
Fields ) result .
AddFieldExtractor ( $f. Start , $ f. End , " $ f. FieldName " ) ; #end return result ; } #end Since I wo n't assume you 're familiar with VTL ( Velocity Template Language )
I 'll explain the elements I 'm using .
The first bit is references to parameters .
You can refer to a parameter in VTL by using the syntax $ parameterName or $ {parameterName} ( the latter is best when you are running the parameter references directly against other text with no spaces ) .
Once you have the parameter you can call methods and access properties on that parameter freely .
To set things so the parameter is accessible you need to put the object into the context of the engine when you run the mapping .
private void GenerateParameterized ( ) { VelocityContext context = new VelocityContext ( ) ; context .
Put ( " config " , this.config ) ; using ( TextWriter target = File.CreateText( targetDir + " ReflectiveTemplateBuilder.cs " ) ) engine.MergeTemplate (" ReflectiveTemplateBuilder.cs.vm " , context , target ) ; } ( You 'll notice I 've defined a property TargetClassNameOnly on Mapping .
This returns the name of the target class as ServiceCall rather than dsl .
ServiceCall , useful since I 'm preserving the breakout of methods in the generated configuration code .
Although the AST is mostly a dumb data structure there 's no reason why you should n't move useful behavior in there to avoid duplication . )
The second bit of VTL is the looping directive # foreach ( $item in $ collection ) .
This allows me to loop through the mappings and fields .
The resulting generated code looks like this .
public void Configure ( Reader target ) { target .
AddStrategy ( ConfigureServiceCall ( ) ) ; target .
AddStrategy ( ConfigureUsage ( ) ) ; } private ReaderStrategy ConfigureServiceCall ( ) { ReaderStrategy result = new ReaderStrategy ( " SVCL " , typeof ( dsl.ServiceCall ) ) ; result .
AddFieldExtractor ( 4 , 18 , " CustomerName " ) ; result .
AddFieldExtractor ( 19 , 23 , " CustomerID " ) ; result .
AddFieldExtractor ( 24 , 27 , " CallTypeCode " ) ; result .
AddFieldExtractor ( 28 , 35 , " DateOfCallString " ) ; return result ; } private ReaderStrategy ConfigureUsage ( ) { ReaderStrategy result = new ReaderStrategy ( " USGE " , typeof ( dsl.
Usage ) ) ; result .
AddFieldExtractor ( 4 , 8 , " CustomerID " ) ; result .
AddFieldExtractor(9 , 22 , " CustomerName " ) ; result .
AddFieldExtractor ( 30 , 30 , " Cycle " ) ; result .
AddFieldExtractor ( 31 , 36 , " ReadDate " ) ; return result ; }
The line formatting is a bit messed up , but other than that it 's pretty close to the original .
So this generates the same code that we wrote by hand - but this is n't typically the way you 'd work with a generator .
What we 've done is generated the configuration of the runtime interpretor which uses reflection to populate classes and fields .
That 's what you have to do for a runtime interpreter , but when you use code generation you can do it all with compile time constructs .
Instead of using a single strategy class that uses reflection to do its work I can use multiple strategy classes , one for each kind of event .
These strategies can then call classes and methods directly .
Such a strategy might look like this .
public class InlineStrategy : IReaderStrategy { public string Code { get { return " SVCL " ; } } public object Process ( string line ) { ServiceCall result = new ServiceCall ( ) ; result .
CustomerName = line .
Substring ( 4,15 ) ; result .
CustomerID = line .
Substring ( 19,5 ) ; result .
CallTypeCode = line .Substring ( 24,4 ) ; result .
DateOfCallString = line .Substring ( 28,8 ) ; return result ; } } Again I did this by writing this one case first , getting it working and then turning it into a template .
Here 's the template .
public class $ map.MapperClassName : IReaderStrategy { public string Code { get { return " $ map. Code " ; } } public object Process ( string line ) { $ map.TargetClassName result = new $ {map.TargetClassName} ( ) ; # foreach ( $f in $ map .
Fields ) result .$f .
FieldName = line .
Substring ( $f. Start , $ f. Length ) ; #end return result ; } } This produces two classes for our sample .
public class MapSVCL : IReaderStrategy { public string Code { get { return " SVCL " ; } } public object Process ( string line ) { dsl.
ServiceCall result = new dsl.ServiceCall( ) ; result .
CustomerName = line .
Substring ( 4 , 15 ) ; result .
CustomerID = line .
Substring ( 19 , 5 ) ; result .
CallTypeCode = line .
Substring ( 24 , 4 ) ; result .
DateOfCallString = line .Substring ( 28 , 8 ) ; return result ; } } public class MapUSGE : IReaderStrategy { public string Code { get { return " USGE " ; } } public object Process ( string line ) { dsl .
Usage result = new dsl .
Usage ( ) ; result .
CustomerID = line .
Substring ( 4 , 5 ) ; result .
CustomerName = line .
Substring ( 9 , 14 ) ; result .
Cycle = line .
Substring ( 30 , 1 ) ; result .
ReadDate = line .
Substring ( 31 , 6 ) ; return result ; } }
To hook these classes into a reader , we need to generate a builder that will know about the classes we 've just generated .
Here 's the template for that public class ReaderBuilderInline { public void Configure ( Reader target ) { # foreach ( $ map in $ config .
Mappings ) target .
AddStrategy ( new $ {map.MapperClassName} ( ) ) ; #end } } which generates public class ReaderBuilderInline { public void Configure ( Reader target ) { target .
AddStrategy ( new MapSVCL ( ) ) ; target .
AddStrategy ( new MapUSGE ( ) ) ; } }
The resulting code is more voluminous , but usually that does n't matter much .
You can now have the compiler check this code - after all if you 're using a statically typed language you might as well the benefit of it .
Often people find this kind of code easier to follow than configuration code , at least once they get used to manipulating VTL .
It does stop you from modifying the configuration at runtime , so this would n't be suitable for some scenarios .
However there 's no reason why you can't use similar techniques to generate scripts that can be executed at runtime .
Indeed the lisp style of language oriented programming is more like this , you write a generator that generates lisp code that 's executed at run time .
This is where lisp 's macro capabilities shine .
