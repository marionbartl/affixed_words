The business of reviewing games can be hard to understand .
The publishers hold almost all the cards , which means if you want readers , you have to have reviews early , and if you want an early copy of the game , you better not do anything to annoy whoever is in charge of handing those games out .
The art of handing out " exclusive reviews " is mostly a clever way of hiding what amounts to a bribe in terms of guaranteed readers .
Being black - listed from events , having your ads pulled , not received review samples of games ... no matter what you want to think about the power of the press , the gaming companies have much more power over us than we do over them .
A recent post over at the Sore Thumbs blog contains thoughts from someone in the industry who wields this power , and he wants you to know : the journalists are just as guilty .
For him , this is war .
" A great unspoken truth is that those involved in games development and publishing feel that many journalists feel a sense of entitlement — that they deserve to have their asses kissed because of the power they wield over the sell - in ( convincing retail buyers to take a game ) and the final sell - through of games to gamers , " the anonymous poster states .
" The fact is game journalists — of which there are hundreds at the moment — are living off the blood , sweat and tears of creative people who love games and regularly work 100 hours [ sic ] weeks .
The fact they casually rip on a game gives others involved in the development and marketing process good reason to pissed . "
Dan Hsu , the former Editor in Chief of Electronic Gaming Monthly , vouches for his source 's authenticity .
It 's a good thing , because the poster pulls no punches describing the ways he can hurt a journalist .
" I have been one of those people ...
I have pulled ad buys in protest of what I felt were unfair review scores .
I have spoken to the ' boss ' of publications before , and complained about certain journalists .
I have ' banned ' certain media outlets from getting pre-release access to games , because of previous unfavorable coverage . "
This is the stress that writers at the biggest gaming sites deal with , and with ad dollars being more important than ever , you better believe that your critical thinking skills should be in full effect when you see the words " exclusive review " next to coverage or you see ads for the game flanking the site 's front page .
A sponsored collection of codes and coverage on the game , in its own branded section of the site ?
That 's an advertisement , and should be treated as such .
The web sites reviewing games mostly want to get as many readers as possible , while the publishers want the highest scores possible , and they 're willing to work together in a slightly unholy way to make sure both of these things happen .
And woe unto him who breaks the covenant .
It 's an interesting world to work in , and when you 're punished for coverage it can be subtle .
Sometimes you 'll notice review samples dry up , other times they simply come a little later than normal .
Communication can be cut off entirely , with phone calls and e-mails not returned .
You may not even know why , but you 'll suddenly find yourself in a very cold place when it comes to some companies after an article or two that does n't paint them in a favorable light .
The source blames the shoddy work of the writers for these underhanded tactics .
" Let 's say you have a game that takes 30 hours to complete , and reviewer plays two hours of it and gives it [ a ] mediocre review based on the first few levels ...
Or when an editor of a big games website gives his FPS guy a sim racing game to review .
Or when someone looks at all the other reviews online for a game , and just follows the crowd by posting a similar review ...
These things happen all the time . "
He points to the Too Human reviews as an example of this group - think .
There is no easy solution for the acrimony between PR and game reviewers ; readers simply have to be aware of how the business works .
It 's also possible that PR professionals need to realize that reviews may not carry the weight they once assumed , Too Human still seems to be selling well despite the lukewarm reviews , and many games that were trashed critically go on to be commercial successes .
No matter what side you 're looking at , the process of reviewing a game is political , complicated , and often bitter ... is the writer muzzled by his site 's ad campaign any more or less angry than the publisher who feels slighted by an unfair review ?
Dr. Prasher said his proposal included speculation on how the fluorescent protein might be used as a beacon to light up structures in cells .
“ That would have certainly been part of my research program , ” Dr. Prasher said .
“ I knew it could serve as a genetic marker and it would be really , really useful , which it has turned out to be . ”
That application was turned down .
A parallel proposal to the American Cancer Society succeeded , giving Dr. Prasher only two years of financing , enough time to isolate the gene , but not pursue any applications .
By then , however , Dr. Prasher had decided that Woods Hole was not the place for him .
Instead of going through the tenure process  he thought he would be turned down , anyway  he looked for a new job .
Dr. Chalfie and Dr. Tsien independently contacted Dr. Prasher asking about the jellyfish gene .
Dr. Prasher generously shared the gene with both of them .
Dr. Prasher then worked for the United States Department of Agriculture , first on Cape Cod and later in Beltsville , Md. , developing methods for identifying pests and other insects .
Again , he was not happy , experiencing the beginning of bouts of depression .
“ I was not happy with management there , so I looked for another position , ” he said .
His next move was to Huntsville , where he worked for a NASA subcontractor that was developing mini-chemistry laboratories , which would be needed as health diagnostic tools for a potential human flight to Mars .
Dr. Prasher loved that job , but NASA eliminated the financing for the project .
For family reasons , he stayed in Huntsville , which restricted his opportunities .
“ The amount of life science done here is very limited , ” he said .
HP has released a roadmap outlining future development of OpenVMS , the operating system that commercialized many features that are now considered standard requirements for any high - end server operating system .
( Such as Integrated networking , Symmetrical , asymmetrical , and NUMA multiprocessing , including clustering , distributed file system ( Files - 11 ) ,
Integrated database features , support for multiple computer programming languages , hardware partitioning of multiprocessors , etc ) .
With over 30 years of development , OpenVMS has stood the test of time and has continued to evolve as one of the most secure and trusted mission critical OS ’s of our time .
The Price of Disgust
So the bailout proposal before Congress seems to have been rejected because legislators were worried that voters back home saw it as a bailout of Wall Street at the expense of Main Street .
Is such a fear rational ?
It may be that voters simply do n’t understand or believe that a broader Wall Street failure could quickly trickle down and harm their Main Street interests .
Or could it be that they ’re willing to pay a price to exhibit their disgust even if it ultimately harms their self interest ?
Consider the popular academic experiment known as the ultimatum game :
The ultimatum game is an experimental economics game in which two players interact to decide how to divide a sum of money that is given to them .
The first player proposes how to divide the sum between themselves , and the second player can either accept or reject this proposal .
If the second player rejects , neither player receives anything .
If the second player accepts , the money is split according to the proposal .
The game is played only once , and anonymously , so that reciprocation is not an issue .
Very often , the first player offers a 50 - 50 split .
But what happens when he offers the second player only 30 percent of the total , or 20 percent ?
It turns out that the second player often rejects a 20 percent offer , which means that both players walk away empty - handed .
Many economists cannot understand why they ’d do such a thing .
To an economist , an offer of even 1 percent would be worth accepting since it is free money , and because for the second player it is ultimately irrelevant how much money the first player takes home .
But most people do not think like economists .
When offered 10 percent or 20 percent or even 30 percent of the total , they are disgusted by the inequity — and willing to pay the price for that disgust by rejecting the offer .
Is that what we ’re seeing now in the vigorous antipathy toward a government bailout ?
Perhaps , at least in part — although there are a lot of super - rational reasons to dislike the bailout as well .
This disgust factor , and the disconnect between Wall Street and Main Street , seems to be where the bailout ’s supporters have focused their attentions .
( They are also adamant that it should n’t be called a “ bailout ” at all , but rather a “ rescue . ” )
In the coming days , look for the public debate to move strongly in this direction .
From this morning ’s Wall Street Journal :
Google Inc. ( NASDAQ : GOOG ) and General Electric Co. ( NYSE : GE ) announced Wednesday that they 'll work together to integrate electric vehicles , renewable energy and " smart grid " technologies into the nation 's electric grid .
The two companies said they will push these goals both through technology development and by advocating for federal policies they call " critical for building a 21st century U.S. electricity system . "
The technological push will initially focus on preparing the nation 's grid for plug - in vehicles and exploring the potential for " enhanced geothermal technology " to become a major supplier of renewable power , the two companies said .
Google in August said it had invested $ 10.25 million into three companies working on geothermal technology that injects water deep into the earth to create steam to generate electricity ( see Google Funds Hot Rock Technology ) .
GE and Google also plan to develop enhanced reservoir - visualization systems to allow geothermal resources to be better measured and exploited .
The companies ' focus on plug - in vehicles will include developing software , controls and services to help electric utilities manage the new power requirements that may arise if hundreds of thousands of plug - in hybrid or electric vehicles come onto the market in coming years .
As for the policy piece , the companies plan to push for increased transmission capacity to bring more renewable energy to consumers , as well as to build a " smart " electricity grid that will help utilities and their customers use energy more efficiently .
Those smart grid technologies include energy - management systems that can monitor and reduce energy use and so - called " smart meters " that can track and manage power flows remotely .
Google and GE 's financial heft may serve them well in their combined push for more smart grid- friendly policies .
Google , well known for its information technology expertise , has been a major proponent of solar - friendly policies in Washington D.C. , and GE 's position as a premiere energy company could add weight to its energy policy prescriptions .
Google and GE did n't elaborate much on how the new partnership will play out beyond its initial technology and policy goals .
" We 're not ready to start a broad - based organization to advance this agenda , " the companies wrote in a prepared statement .
" But we will be looking to work with other companies and organizations " that share similar goals .
From Jesse Brandeburg <> Subject [ PATCH 2.6.27-rc8 0/1 ] e1000e nvm fix Date Wed , 01 Oct 2008 17:18:30 - 0700
Please apply to 2.6.27
This is related to regression bugzilla :
http://bugzilla.kernel.org/show_bug.cgi?id=11382
This patch is meant to prevent all future corruptions of the
e 1000e NVM ( non volatile memory ) after the driver is loaded .
The
registers stay locked until the machine is power cycled .
This should allow us to move forward with debugging without
allowing any other bad element or the e1000e driver , to write to
the NVM area unexpectedly .
Currently we ( Intel Ethernet ) are reproducing the issue on
multiple machines in house , we are working on the issue with the
other core Linux teams here at Intel and within the community .
No
resolution yet but we are much closer now .
Later we will post patches to help users who have had this
problem restore their eeprom from either a saved image from
ethtool -e or from another identical system .
There is a set of patches to help clean up the driver 's use of
the hardware / software semaphore , but those are un-necessary to be
immediately applied once we 're locking the NVM .
We will push
those for inclusion within the merge window for 2.6.28 .

" The government ’s top economic experts warn that , without immediate action by Congress , America could slip into a financial panic and a distressing scenario would unfold .
More banks could fail , including some in your community .
The stock market would drop even more , which would reduce the value of your retirement account .
The value of your home could plummet .
Foreclosures would rise dramatically .
And if you own a business or a farm , you would find it harder and more expensive to get credit .
More businesses would close their doors , and millions of Americans could lose their jobs .
Even if you have good credit history , it would be more difficult for you to get the loans you need to buy a car or send your children to college .
And , ultimately , our country could experience a long and painful recession . "
~ President George W. Bush , September 24 , 2008
" The whole aim of practical politics is to keep the populace alarmed and hence clamorous to be led to safety by menacing it with an endless series of hobgoblins , all of them imaginary . "
~ H.L. Mencken
The urge to compare the current financial crisis to the Great Depression has proven irresistible .
Pundits , economists and investment gurus have all invoked its specter .
However , this time in a bit of role reversal it is Uncle Sam with the tin cup in hand asking taxpayers , " Buddy can you lend me …700 billion ? "
Actually , Uncle Sam does not want your money , he just wants to help out his buddies on Walls Street .
Gee , what a guy !
To Sam ’s amazement , those hearing his plea have turned him down flat .
This has included a host of foreign governments who evaluate Sam as a lousy credit risk .
So Sam ’s begging has turned to threats .
No more Mr. Nice Guy !
Taxpayers would surrender or face certain disaster .
Congress would ignore its constituents and approve the package or else .
What began as a recommendation quickly morphed into a threat .
It was Eco ( as in economic ) terrorism by the government , which included hostage taking .
As the week progressed and it was becoming increasingly clear that the government ’s latest scam was not selling well on Main Street , the doom - and - gloom forecasting was increased .
President Bush was trotted out before a public which had largely forgotten about him .
Like the boy who cried wolf , Bush used dire predictions in hopes of reversing public opposition to the bailout package .
We had heard it all before .
If we did not authorize him to invade Iraq we could all perish within 45 minutes .
If we did not surrender our rights through the Patriot Act we would be overcome by Muslim hoards .
Now we would all be living in the streets if we did not authorize Uncle Sam to spend $ 700 billion to reward bad business practices on Wall Street .
The fear ploy went over like a lead balloon .
It had been used once too often .
So , the government began " offing " its hostages to enforce the President ’s threat .
WAMU was " taken out " by federal regulators Friday morning .
The point of the gesture was unmistakable .
The longer Congress refused Sam ’s demand for the loot the more " hostages " would be executed .
As of Friday the stand - off continued .
The hostage negotiating team of McCain and Obama volunteered their services but were politely asked to butt out by those who saw their offer as a ploy to move their sorry campaigns back to the front pages .
The game of grand theft taxpayer will continue .
It ends when Congress fulfills its constituents ’ determination to defeat the crime by ignoring the fear - mongering and threats in favor of honoring the Constitution and establishing sound fiscal policy .

The Best of John M. Peters
jvm 32 - bit , 64 - bit , Compressed Oops , hotspot , jvm , memory usage Ismael Juma 7:07 am
Before x86 - 64 came along , the decision on whether to use 32 - bit or 64 - bit mode for architectures that supported both was relatively simple : use 64 - bit mode if the application requires the larger address space , 32 - bit mode otherwise .
After all , no point in reducing the amount of data that fits into the processor cache while increasing memory usage and bandwidth if the application does n’t need the extra addressing space .
When it comes to x86 - 64 , however , there ’s also the fact that the number of named general - purpose registers has doubled from 8 to 16 in 64 - bit mode .
For CPU intensive apps , this may mean performance at the cost of extra memory usage .
On the other hand , for memory intensive apps 32 - bit mode might be better in if you manage to fit your application within the address space provided .
Would n’t it be nice if there was a single JVM that would cover the common cases ?
It turns out that the HotSpot engineers have been working on doing just that through a feature called Compressed oops .
The benefits :
Heaps up to 32GB ( instead of the theoretical 4GB in 32 - bit that in practice is closer to 3GB )
64 - bit mode so we get to use the extra registers
Managed pointers ( including Java references ) are 32 - bit so we do n’t waste memory or cache space
The main disadvantage is that encoding and decoding is required to translate from / to native addresses .
HotSpot tries to avoid these operations as much as possible and they are relatively cheap .
The hope is that the extra registers give enough of a boost to offset the extra cost introduced by the encoding / decoding .
Compressed Oops have been included ( but disabled by default ) in the performance release JDK6 u6 p ( requires you to fill a survey ) , so I decided to try it in an internal application and compare it with 64 - bit mode and 32 - bit mode .
The tested application has two phases , a single threaded one followed by a multi - threaded one .
Both phases do a large amount of allocation so memory bandwidth is very important .
All tests were done on a dual quad - core Xeon 5400 series with 10 GB of RAM .
I should note that a different JDK version had to be used for 32 - bit mode ( JDK6u10r c2 ) because there is no Linux x86 build of JDK6 u6 p .
I chose the largest heap size that would allow the 32 - bit JVM to run the benchmark to completion without crashing .
I started by running the application with a smaller dataset :
JDK6u10rc2 32-bit
Single - threaded phase : 6298ms
Multi - threaded phase ( 8 threads on 8 cores ) : 17043ms
Used Heap after full GC : 430MB
JVM Args : -XX: MaxPermSize=256 m - Xms3328 m - Xmx3328 m - server -XX :+UseConcMarkSweepGC
JDK6u6 p 64 - bit with Compressed Oops
Single - threaded phase : 6345
Multi - threaded phase ( 8 threads on 8 cores ) : 16348
Used Heap after full GC : 500MB
JVM Args : -XX: MaxPermSize=256 m - Xms3328 m - Xmx3328 m - server -XX :+UseConcMarkSweepGC
-XX:+UseCompressedOops
The performance numbers are similar and the memory usage of the 64 - bit JVM with Compressed Oops is 16 % larger .
JDK6u6 p 64 -bit
Single - threaded phase : 6463
Multi - threaded phase ( 8 threads on 8 cores ) : 18778
Used Heap after full GC : 700MB
JVM Args : -XX: MaxPermSize=256 m - Xms3328 m - Xmx3328 m - server -XX :+UseConcMarkSweepGC
The performance is again similar , but the memory usage of the 64 - bit JVM is much higher , over 60 % higher than the 32 - bit JVM one .
Let ’s try the larger dataset now :
JDK6u10rc2 32-bit
Single - threaded phase : 14188ms
Multi - threaded phase ( 8 threads on 8 cores ) : 73451ms
Used Heap after full GC : 1.25 GB
JVM Args : -XX: MaxPermSize=256 m - Xms3328 m - Xmx3328 m - server -XX :+UseConcMarkSweepGC
JDK6u6 p 64 - bit with CompressedOops
Single - threaded phase : 13742
Multi - threaded phase ( 8 threads on 8 cores ) : 76664ms
Used Heap after full GC : 1.45 GB
JVM Args : -XX: MaxPermSize=256 m - Xms3328 m - Xmx3328 m - server -XX :+UseConcMarkSweepGC
-XX:+UseCompressedOops
The performance difference and memory overhead are the same as with the smaller dataset .
The benefit of Compressed Oops here is that we still have plenty of headroom while the 32 - bit JVM is getting closer to its limits .
This may not be apparent from the heap size after a full GC , but during the multi- threaded phase the peak memory usage is quite a bit larger and the fact that the allocation rate is high does not help .
This becomes more obvious when we look at the results for the 64 - bit JVM .
JDK6u6 p 64 -bit
Single - threaded phase : 14610
Multi - threaded phase ( 8 threads on 8 cores ) : 104992
Used Heap after full GC : 2GB
JVM Args : -XX: MaxPermSize=256 m - Xms4224 m - Xmx4224 m - server -XX:+UseConcMarkSweepGC
I had to increase the Xms / Xmx to 4224 m for the application to run to completion .
Even so , the performance of the multi- threaded phase took a substantial performance hit when compared to the other two JVM configurations .
All in all , the 64 - bit JVM without compressed oops does not do well here .
In conclusion , it seems that compressed oops is a feature with a lot of promise and it allows the 64 - bit JVM to be competitive even in cases that favour the 32 - bit JVM .
It might be interesting to test applications with different characteristics to compare the results .
It ’s also worth mentioning that since this is a new feature , it ’s possible that performance will improve further before it ’s integrated into the normal JDK releases .
As it is though , it already hits a sweet spot and if it were n’t for the potential for instability , I would be ready to ditch my 32 - bit JVM .
Update :
The early access release of JDK 6 Update 14 also contains this feature .
Update 2 : This feature is enabled by default since JDK 6 Update 23 .

McCain connections coming back to haunt him Nick Juliano
Published : Tuesday October 7 , 2008
Print This Email This Shared stage with abortion doc shooter sympathizer John McCain , who along with his running mate has been attacking Obama over decade - old associations with unseemly figures , is not without his own nefarious associations .
One association , which seems to have gone unreported until now , involves a delegate who represented McCain at this year 's Republican convention and previously expressed sympathy for an activist accused of shooting a doctor who performed abortions .
Applying the same logic as Sarah Palin , one could argue that the members of the GOP ticket are " palling around " with abortion clinic attack sympathizers , supporters of right - wing militants , perpetrators of political espionage and revolutionaries seeking to secede from the United States .
More attention is falling on the Arizona senator 's own past since his attacks on Obama and former radical Bill Ayers .
The Obama campaign 's disquisition on Charles Keating just scratches the surface of what 's out there , as reporters and liberal activists dig into McCain 's web of connections .
Blogger Jed Lewison highlighted McCain 's opposition to a 1994 law that made it a federal crime to bomb or blockade abortion clinics or to attack abortion doctors .
McCain 's vote against the Freedom of Access to Clinic Entrances
Act put him in league with the Senate 's most radical anti-abortion advocates , who split with more than two dozen anti-abortion senators who voted to crack down on clinic bombers as a matter of preserving law & order .
What 's received less notice is where McCain was a few months before casting that vote .
In August 1993 , McCain traveled to the Pacific Northwest where he earned the illustrious distinction of becoming the first major politician to address the ultra - far - right Oregon Citizens Alliance .
He was apparently making good on a promise he had made to the group the year before as he and other GOP leaders negotiated to prevent the Christian conservatives from running a third - party candidate against Sen .
Bob Packwood , who would resign a few years later amid a sex scandal .
The OCA attracted national attention in 1992 for sponsoring an anti-gay ballot initiative in Oregon , and McCain ignored advice to steer clear of the gathering .
At the Portland fundraiser , McCain gently admonished the group to observe the " essence of tolerance , " according to contemporaneous news reports .
His speech was preceded by some kind words for an anti-abortion activist accused of shooting a doctor .
McCain quickly got a first - hand flavor for the OCA .
Marylin Shannon , the vice chairwoman of the Oregon GOP , had a spot on the program to give an opening prayer .
In short order , she praised the Grants Pass woman accused of shooting an abortion doctor in Wichita and thanked the Lord ``for Lon Mabon and the vision you put in his heart . ''
Shannon , the GOP chairwoman , referred to the accused shooter of the abortion doctor as a " fine lady , " who should n't be judged solely based on the single act of violence , according to a letter she wrote to The Oregonian , which was accessed via Lexis Nexis .
While she did not endorse violence against abortion providers , she wrote , she recognized the " debate stirring within the anti-abortion movement " over whether killing abortion providers was a " just cause . "
My kind comments about Shelley Shannon , the Grants Pass woman accused of wounding abortion provider George Tiller , ( ``I 'm not related to Shelley Shannon , but I think she 's a fine lady , '' ) reflected what I had learned about her from people who have known her for many years .
They say she has led a responsible life as a wife , mother and concerned citizen and do n't want her judged by this one action .
Acknowledging this side of her does not meant that I approve of others doing what she did .
I do not .
However , since that night I have learned much about the current debate stirring within the anti-abortion movement :
Is killing abortion providers a ``just cause '' ?
There 's no indication that McCain took issue with Shannon 's comments , and it 's unclear whether any group members lobbied him regarding the abortion clinic protection bill .
A search of the Congressional Record in 1993 and 1994 indicates McCain did not speak during debate over the bill , and McCain 's campaign did not immediately return RAW STORY 's request for comment .
Shannon traveled to the Republican convention as a McCain delegate , and she proclaimed herself a huge fan of Palin as McCain 's VP pick .
She could not be reached for comment .
To be sure , there is nothing to suggest that McCain supports bombing abortion clinics .
But there 's also nothing to suggest Obama supports the Weather Underground bombings , which by the way were carried out when he was 8 years old .
McCain at least was a sitting member of Congress who took a legislative position on clinic bombings when they were a current issue .
Other ties McCain might prefer to forget include his membership on the board of the US Council for World Freedom , which The Associated Press describes as " part of an international organization linked to former Nazi collaborators and ultra - right - wing death squads in Central America . "
McCain was something of a de facto member of the group as he launched his political career in the early 1980s , just one of several prominent " names on a letterhead , " as the council 's founder told AP .
But , that membership at least seemed to indicate a tacit endorsement of its goals in Central America , supporting the contras .
Elected to the House in 1982 and at a time when he was on the board of Singlaub 's council , McCain was among Republicans on Capitol Hill expressing support for the Contras , a CIA - organized guerrilla force in Central America .
In 1984 , Congress cut off CIA funds for the Contras .
Months before the cutoff , top Reagan administration officials ramped up the secret White House - directed supply network and put National Security Council aide Oliver North in charge of running it .
The goal was to keep the Contras operational until Congress could be persuaded to resume CIA funding .
[ Retired Army Maj. Gen. John ]
Singlaub 's private group became the public cover for the White House operation .
McCain says he was unaware of the full extent of the group 's activities and claims to have resigned from the council in 1984 and asked to have his name removed from its letterhead two years later .
According to AP , that 's all news to founder Singlaub .
" I do n't ever remember hearing about his resigning , but I really was n't worried about that part of our activities , a housekeeping thing , " Singlaub said .
" If he did n't want to be on the board that 's OK .
It was n't as if he had been active participant and we were going to miss his help .
He had no active interest .
He certainly supported us . "
Earlier this year , when Obama 's past connection to Ayers first crept into national headlines , some observers began to remember McCain 's " own Bill Ayers -- in the form of G. Gordon Liddy . "
The Watergate break - in mastermind , who spent more than four years in prison for his crimes , has called McCain an " old friend " and hosted the candidate on his conservative talk radio show .
Palin , McCain 's running mate whose " gloves off " approach has aided Ayers return to the headlines is not without her own questionable connections .
Her husband is a past member of the Alaska Independence Party , and she has addressed the group on several occasions .
The party 's goal is Alaska 's secession from the United States and its founder has said " the fires of hell are frozen glaciers compared to my hatred for the American government . "
Beyond a 13 - minute documentary on Keating , who was a key player in the savings & loan crisis of the late 1980s , the Obama campaign does n't seem too concerned about publicly digging for dirt in McCain 's past .
Economic concerns have spurred a spectacular rise in Obama 's poll numbers , and a struggling McCain campaign seems to be doing all it can to stop the election from slipping away .

This is a very simple animated version of Alex Jones ’s talk on the fraudulent left - right 2 - party paradigm that we are all locked into .
In the original version , Alex uses pen and paper to sketch out the 2 - party paradigm .
I was already aware of how the 2 - party system is used to contain revolution in most “ democratic ” countries .
But I was very impressed with the way that Alex sketched it out in simple , easy - to - understand terms .
I therefore decided to spend an afternoon transferring his sketches into a 2D animation .
It is very important for us all to realise that we are living under a simple but clever system that has been designed to contain revolution whilst projecting the illusion of being a free , fair and open democracy .
The 2 - party system provides firm support for the elite to implement their agenda from the top down , whilst the ordinary people at the grassroots level squabble between themselves over which political party is the best .
In reality , it does n’t matter which of the two parties you vote for because the same agenda will unfold regardless .
Hence , both parties are controlled at the very top by the same force .

ANCHORAGE , Alaska ( Reuters ) - Alaska ’s political climate , with the state hiking oil taxes and asserting claims against oil companies , is discouraging investment needed to offset the decline in oil production as Alaska fields age , the head of BP ’s Alaska unit said on Monday .
“ Together we can work to attract new investment , ” BP Exploration ( Alaska ) Inc President Doug Suttles told the Anchorage Chamber of Commerce .
“ But it ’s going to take a new level of cooperation and a different environment . ”
Suttles criticized the state for enacting a new production tax , passed in a special session last November at the urging of Gov. Sarah Palin , that increased tax rates and narrowed allowable deductions and credits .
The new system , with its progressively higher rates as oil prices rise and its new restrictions on operating - cost deductions , has substantially jacked up taxes at the biggest U.S. oil field , Suttles said .
“ Today , by our calculations , Prudhoe Bay has the highest production tax now in the world , ” he said .
Palin , a Republican , had urged the rewrite of an oil - tax system passed in 2006 under a cloud of political corruption .
A federal investigation has resulted in trial convictions and guilty pleas from former legislators and oil - service executives charged with bribery , extortion and other crimes .
More charges are widely expected .
In his speech on Monday , Suttles also criticized the Palin administration for pressing forward with a likely lawsuit for lost state revenues stemming from a partial shutdown in 2006 at Prudhoe Bay , which BP operates , after two oil spills leaked from corrosion - eaten holes in transit lines there .
Suttles also predicted failure for Palin ’s strategy to develop a huge natural gas pipeline to send the North Slope ’s vast natural gas reserves to domestic markets .
At Palin 's urging , the legislature last year passed the Alaska Gasline Inducement Act , which established a system for prospective sponsors of a natural gas pipeline to submit competing bids for a state license .
BP and the other major North Slope producers , ConocoPhillips COP.N and Exxon Mobil XOM.N , opposed Palin 's approach as too restrictive .
Although five proposals were submitted in November , only one , from TransCanada Corp , was considered to have conformed to the act ’s requirements .
None of the major producers submitted a competitive bid under the Alaska Gasline Inducement Act .
The proposed Alaska natural gas pipeline would be the “ largest industrial project ever done in North America , ” Suttles said .
“ So you would have thought that the world ’s big companies , whether they were pipeline companies or whether they were gas companies , would want to be part of it .
But only one showed up .
I think that tells you about the framework that we have in place today and the problems with that framework , ” he said .
ConocoPhillips is promoting a separate plan that does not meet the Alaska Gasline Inducement Act ’s mandates , but Palin has seemed it unacceptable .
So we have McCain today getting his crowd riled up asking who Barack Obama is and then apparently giving a wink and a nod when one member of the crowd screams out “ terrorist . ”
And later we have Sarah Palin with the same mob racket , getting members of the crowd to yell out “ kill him “ , though it ’s not clear whether the call for murder was for Bill Ayers or Barack Obama .
It did n’t seem to matter .
These are dangerous and sick people , McCain and Palin .
Whatever it takes .
Stop at nothing .
BEIJING ( Reuters ) - A rare condition still haunts the poorest villagers on the Tibetan plateau but improvements in nutrition and grain handling could help eradicate it , the head of a Belgian group fighting Kashin - Beck disease said on Tuesday .
The poorest farmers tend to be most susceptible to the disease , which causes painful swelling in joints and retards limb growth , resulting in dwarfism in the most severe cases .
China ’s Ministry of Health estimates about 2 million people have it , out of the 30 million who live in areas where it is endemic .
A multi-year study showed lower incidences in children who took multivitamin and mineral supplements , said Francoise Mathieu , director of programs for the Kashin - Beck Disease Foundation , which has been working in valleys around Lhasa where the disease is common .
“ It ’s been very encouraging and we hope to see more signs of improvement , ” she told reporters in Beijing .
First identified by doctors stationed with Cossack units by Lake Baikal , Kashin - Beck disease was once found in an arc from Siberia , through northeast China and down into the southwest .
Advances in nutrition mean it has largely disappeared , except in remote valleys around Lhasa and elsewhere on the plateau .
Risk factors include lack of selenium and other nutrients in the diet , fungi that grow in grains and farming in mineral - poor soil .
In addition to the nutritional study , the foundation is encouraging farmers to treat seeds and store grains in clean , dry and ventilated rooms to avoid fungal growth .
“ I think they live with much more suffering than we could , ” said Philippe Goyens , a doctor who said severely deformed victims continue to farm and work in remote villages .
Better roads and more trade outside the valleys could help improve diets and reduce incidence of the disease , Mathieu said .
Last summer , the head of the Tibetan regional government said it had relocated 1,000 households affected by the disease , adding that people were only moved if they were willing , according to the Xinhua news agency .
Another 77,000 people in endemic areas in the Aba prefecture , in the high grasslands of Sichuan province , will be relocated by 2013 , Xinhua said this spring , citing a local official .

He ordered the government to turn over almost all its files to the defense , saying he no longer believed in the ability of prosecutors to make full disclosure on their own , as is customary .

The surprise development came after prosecutors late Wednesday night sent to the defense team a copy of an F.B.I. report of an agent ’s interview with Bill Allen , an Alaska oil services executive who is the prosecution ’s chief witness and has been on the stand this week .
In addition to the judicial scolding of the government , the revelation produced a heated confrontation between the chief defense lawyer , Brendan Sullivan , and the chief prosecutor , Brenda Morris , outside the presence of the jury .
Mr. Stevens is charged with failing to list on Senate disclosure forms some $ 250,000 in gifts and services he received from Mr. Allen and his company , the Veco Corporation , for renovations of his home in Girdwood , Alaska .
The issue at the heart of the trial is whether Mr. Stevens knowingly failed to list the gifts and services .
Mr. Allen has already testified that he did not send any bills to Mr. Stevens because he had been told not to by Robert Persons , his liaison to the senator .
The belatedly disclosed document is the agent ’s handwritten report of an interview of Mr. Allen in which Mr. Allen said he believed that Mr. Stevens would have paid the bills had they been sent to him .
Mr. Sullivan , a well - known defense lawyer , opened the day with a theatrical protest , throwing down papers at the lectern , saying that in his 40 years of practice he had never encountered such blatant government ineptitude .
The American Civil Liberties Union demanded information from the government about reports that an active military unit has been deployed inside the U.S. to help with " civil unrest " and " crowd control " – matters traditionally handled by civilian authorities .
This deployment jeopardizes the longstanding separation between civilian and military government , and the public has a right to know where and why the unit has been deployed .

Finding venues may be problematic Choosing a domain name is one of the most important decisions you 'll make when setting up a website .
It 's even more important when that website is a political one because you have a very limited time in which to publicize your site , get the voters to visit , and convince them to vote your way .
A good ballot measure domain name can help voters find your site more easily and hear the message that you want to deliver .
A New Domain Strategy for Your Campaign
Your campaign website is at the center of your voter education and fundraising efforts .
It also plays a major role in the all - important branding of your campaign .
Your most basic message to the voters is Vote Yes On # " or just simply .
Consider making “ Yes On # ” your brand and repeating it often and everywhere , including as your domain name that is printed on every single piece of campaign signage and literature .
This will transform your domain name from a passive web address into an active marketing tool !
YesOn#.org will help brand your campaign and send a subtle message to voters every time they see it !

Data Mining for Terrorists Does n't Work
According to a massive report from the National Research Council , data mining for terrorists does n’t work .
Here ’s a good summary :
The report was written by a committee whose members include William Perry , a professor at Stanford University ; Charles Vest , the former president of MIT ; W. Earl Boebert , a retired senior scientist at Sandia National Laboratories ; Cynthia Dwork of Microsoft Research ; R. Gil Kerlikowske , Seattle ’s police chief ; and Daryl Pregibon , a research scientist at Google .
They admit that far more Americans live their lives online , using everything from VoIP phones to Facebook to RFID tags in automobiles , than a decade ago , and the databases created by those activities are tempting targets for federal agencies .
And they draw a distinction between subject - based data mining ( starting with one individual and looking for connections ) compared with pattern - based data mining ( looking for anomalous activities that could show illegal activities ) .
But the authors conclude the type of data mining that government bureaucrats would like to do–perhaps inspired by watching too many episodes of the Fox series 24 – ca n’t work .
“ If it were possible to automatically find the digital tracks of terrorists and automatically monitor only the communications of terrorists , public policy choices in this domain would be much simpler .
But it is not possible to do so . ”
A summary of the recommendations : U.S. government agencies should be required to follow a systematic process to evaluate the effectiveness , lawfulness , and consistency with U.S. values of every information - based program , whether classified or unclassified , for detecting and countering terrorists before it can be deployed , and periodically thereafter .
Periodically after a program has been operationally deployed , and in particular before a program enters a new phase in its life cycle , policy makers should ( carefully review ) the program before allowing it to continue operations or to proceed to the next phase .
To protect the privacy of innocent people , the research and development of any information - based counterterrorism program should be conducted with synthetic population data …
At all stages of a phased deployment , data about individuals should be rigorously subjected to the full safeguards of the framework .
Any information - based counterterrorism program of the U.S. government should be subjected to robust , independent oversight of the operations of that program , a part of which would entail a practice of using the same data mining technologies to “ mine the miners and track the trackers . ”
Counterterrorism programs should provide meaningful redress to any individuals inappropriately harmed by their operation .
The U.S. government should periodically review the nation ’s laws , policies , and procedures that protect individuals ’ private information for relevance and effectiveness in light of changing technologies and circumstances .
In particular , Congress should re-examine existing law to consider how privacy should be protected in the context of information - based programs ( e.g. , data mining ) for counterterrorism .
Here are more news articles on the report .
I explained why data mining would n’t find terrorists back in 2005 .
EDITED TO ADD ( 10/10 ) : More commentary :
As the NRC report points out , not only is the training data lacking , but the input data that you ’d actually be mining has been purposely corrupted by the terrorists themselves .
Terrorist plotters actively disguise their activities using operational security measures ( opsec ) like code words , encryption , and other forms of covert communication .
So , even if we had access to a copious and pristine body of training data that we could use to generalize about the “ typical terrorist , ” the new data that ’s coming into the data mining system is suspect .
To return to the credit reporting analogy , credit scores would be worthless to lenders if everyone could manipulate their credit history ( e.g. , hide past delinquencies ) the way that terrorists can manipulate the data trails that they leave as they buy gas , enter buildings , make phone calls , surf the Internet , etc .
So this application of data mining bumps up against the classic GIGO ( garbage in , garbage out ) problem in computing , with the terrorists deliberately feeding the system garbage .
What this means in real - world terms is that the success of our counter - terrorism data mining efforts is completely dependent on the failure of terrorist cells to maintain operational security .
The combination of the GIGO problem and the lack of suitable training data combine to make big investments in automated terrorist identification a futile and wasteful effort .
Furthermore , these two problems are structural , so they ’re not going away .
All legitimate concerns about false positives and corrosive effects on civil liberties aside , data mining will never give authorities the ability to identify terrorists or terrorist networks with any degree of confidence .

Index Holdings , a mobile communications and media group , has launched a China office , Index China , through group company Index Asia Pacific , the company announced Thursday .
In partnership with China Mobile , Index China will transmit Japanese comics and games to Chinese mobile users , with service skedded to start next spring , in time for the 2008 Beijing Olympics .
As part of the tie - up agreement , China Mobile will have exclusive rights to Index content in China .
The content line - up for the new service has yet to be announced , but Index Holding is negotiating with major Japanese publishers and other content owners .
China Mobile owns a 70 % share of the Chinese market , with 300 million users .
Also , China itself is huge and booming market for Japanese manga and games , though competition among the Japanese companies hoping to reap the rewards of this market is fierce .
Through its partnership with China Mobile , Index hopes to quickly expand its market footprint — and take a giant step past its rivals .
Lessons From The Science of Nothing At All
Richard P. Gabriel
Where I come from we make things from nothing - from dreams and fantasies .
The laws of physics do n't apply .
Our products weigh zero .
We 've explored just about every product development approach there is - extreme or otherwise : waterfall , iterative , rapid prototyping , community development , and mobs .
Imagine this : Dionysus has deleted all the software on the planet - what 's going to happen ?
You wo n't be able to surf the Web , send email , make and run spreadsheets , use word processors , and download music .
No more anonymously available dirty pictures , no more mapping services , no more reading newspapers from around the world , no more computer and video games , no more pocket organizers , no more modern warfare , governments will come to a halt .
Well , that 's not so bad .
Oh , and movies will have cheesier special effects , Playboy centerfolds will seem to have more blemishes , buying airline tickets wo n't work well , booking hotels will take longer , no one will be going into space , you 'll mostly be watching local TV , you wo n't be getting the New York Times , Wall Street Journal , and The Economist in the mail , some airplanes will fall out of the sky .
Wait , what 's that ?
-
This is getting serious .
No more telephones , some buildings will stop being livable , most cars will stop running , food wo n't be delivered efficiently , health care - do n't want to think about that .
We'd be thrown suddenly back into the 1950s or 1940s .
Just about everything we do every day will change or disappear .
Software is a real part of our lives , a real part of the world .
If it was n't real , then why does deleting it break so many things ?
Well of course it 's real : Big companies make lots of money creating it : Microsoft , Oracle , IBM ; even smaller ones : Netscape , Borland , Adobe .
A few million people earn their livings writing software , an equal number attend to those who create programs : documentation writers , testers , managers , customer support folks .
What 's writing software like ?
Suppose I showed you two rooms where in one a group of programmers was developing a program to monitor a heart patient and keep him alive until the doctors arrive if something goes wrong and in the other a group of street people was using Microsoft Word to write letters to their parole officers .
You would not be able to tell the rooms apart .
Here 's the problem and the intriguing possibilities of studying software and how to make it as exemplars for all sorts of making - or if you prefer , product development .
What a lot of you make uses stuff in the physical world .
You hammer it together , stick one thing to another , screw this into that .
The stuff wears out , you put oil on it to make it run smoother .
A guy in overalls can fix it .
You deliver it to people in boxes .
When you take your product to the post office and they put it on a scale , it weighs something .
That is , you have reality on your side .
You make things in 3 - dimensional space .
Maybe it seems to you that these are limitations that you 'd like to unload .
Do n't .
Hang onto those things .
In my business , we do n't have simplifying constraints like these .
On the other hand , we have some things better .
I 've never had a few thousand gross of bad IF statements delivered .
Let 's look at some statistics .
You can hardly pin anyone down on numbers like these , but a typical number you 'll see for an average programmer is 50 lines of tested code produced per day .
At delivery , there can be about 30 defects or bugs per 1000 lines of code .
Bugs are probably not quite what you think .
Imagine you 've designed a car and built it , but someone designed the wrong size tires for it .
If the car were software , maybe this would cause the car to not start , or you would n't be able to steer it , or maybe the car would explode .
Or maybe everything would go fine until the driver tuned to NPR and then the gas tank would spring a leak .
Windows NT has nearly 50 million lines of code in the full build .
That would take one person about 2700 years to complete .
Oh yeah , and it would have about 1.5 million bugs .
Adding people to a project can speed things up , but not linearly .
If you add a programmer to a team larger than 50 people , it 's not unlikely the productivity of every programmer will drop , and at some point , increasing the number of people on a team will reduce its total productivity .
Bugs are not a good thing .
Some of the recent Ariane rocket failures were the result of bugs - some of them downright silly .
The Ariane 501 was the European Space Agency rocket that self - destructed after its engine nozzles all swiveled into an extreme position , causing the rocket to veer abruptly , which caused it to self - destruct .
The bug had to do with some alignment software on the navigational computer that normally runs right after they put the rocket on the launchpad , but in this case it kept running well into the launch , during which time it computes nothing meaningful .
This software eventually encountered a bug since no one was aligning anything .
The navigational computer sends navigational data to a command computer , which directs the rockets .
The navigational computer put a textual error message on the data bus to the command computer and then shut itself down .
The command computer took the textual error message as extreme navigational data and swerved the nozzles .
Then it noticed the navigational computer was off and switched to the other one , which had also shut down for the very same reason .
The stumped command computer turned to its backup , which was also stumped , and after noticing the extreme aerodynamic stress on the rocket , one of the two decided to self - destruct .
You might think that the software running on the navigational computer was n't mature or well - tested .
In fact , it was used by the Ariane 4 rockets for many years without any problems at all , and not a single line of code was changed when it was put on Ariane 5 rockets .
Software for space rockets is written much more carefully than commercial software .
Here 's how the software for the space shuttle is written .
SEI Level 5 is the highest rating for a software methodology assigned by the CMU Software Engineering Institute .
Lockheed Martin Corporation employs an SEI Level 5 software group that puts together the shuttle software .
The software is not very big - only 420,000 lines of code .
It was developed over a 20 - year period by a group of 260 people .
These numbers imply that each line of code has had 25 person - hours of attention , and that each person has been responsible for a little over 1600 lines of code - 25 pages .
$ 700,000,000 was spent to develop this code , or about $ 1700 per line .
Further , the software had been completely specified in pseudo - code agreed to beforehand .
The task of a programmer in this regime is to translate pseudocode to actual code .
But , all this work does buy NASA only 1 error in each of the last three releases of the code .
Because we cannot afford to have deaths in the space program , the cost and effort are worth it .
The cost amounts to making each subroutine a career - long research project .
Twenty years , 8 hours a day , studying and eliminating errors from 1600 lines of code .
This sort of slow , deliberate process of creating software is good at producing bug - free code .
Variants of this approach have been used since the beginning of programming .
One popular variant created in the 1970s is called the Waterfall Model which breaks up the process into 5 stages :
The first stage is understanding the concept , doing analysis , and defining the requirements ; the second stage is design ; the third stage is implementation and coding ; the fourth stage is integration of the parts and testing ; and the fifth stage is operation and maintenance .
The Waterfall Model was a response to earlier methodologies that quite essentially started with someone shouting , " hey , let 's make a text editor , " and proceeded with people running toward the keyboards .
Deep thinkers realistically believed that by using the Waterfall Model , the quality of software could be improved and the process of creating software could become much more predictable .
Shallow thinkers quickly noticed that this reality thing was going to be a problem .
Recall , software creation does n't get the benefit of reality and 3 - dimensional space .
What does this mean ?
When you 're designing a real product , you have centuries of experience with the world and real artifacts to base your designs on .
Designing a new hand tool ?
- 60 centuries of experience , has to fit human hands , has to accomodate human motion .
Does it cut ?
Done that .
Does it fasten ?
Done that .
Does it make holes ?
Done that .
Designing a new telephone ?
Two or three generations of experience there .
New door ?
Has to open and close , has to be big enough to let what 's to move through , move through .
New stove - people have been cooking for hundreds of centuries .
But , consider the first people to design and build a text editor .
Before that , there was never a text editor .
Changes to a manuscript were always made by retyping or retypesetting .
How would people want to make textual changes ?
How would people want to navigate ?
Searching ? - no one ever heard of that before .
Systematic changes ?
Huh ?
By the way , there were no display terminals , so how do you even look at the manuscript ?
So what do you think would happen if you tried to design and implement a text editor for the first time ?
You 'd maybe talk to some folks and decide what it was going to do .
Then you 'd design and build the software - keeping in mind that the slightest , most picayune mistake and maybe nothing works at all .
Designing and implementing it so it works maybe would take a couple of people 6 months .
Once it sort of worked , you 'd let people use it , and once they had seen what can be done , then they would start saying , " oh , now I get it , well , how about if you add this and that to it and change this so it works like that . "
Then the developers would go back and make another few months of changes , and the process would repeat .
Why ?
No one has ever seen a text editor before or maybe only the previous versions , and so they can't imagine how they would really use it and what the experience would be like until they had one .
Then they would start to use their imaginations to guess what it could be like , but they are only guesses .
The people who are burdened with coming up with the requirements for the first text editor cannot do it because first , they have never even heard about a text editor before , and second , they have no idea what is possible or impossible for software to do .
Usually they require only modest and conservative things because they think what they can imagine is too hard or impossible , and once they see that something they thought would be impossible can be done , they start expanding their imaginations .
So they iterate and try and try things .
For products in the real world , you have already had the decades , centuries , and millennia to go through this iterative process , and we software guys have had 50 years total .
Let 's go back to that Waterfall Model .
Here 's its first step : Understand the concept , do analysis , and define the requirements .
If you can do that , then the model will produce a program that satisfies the requirements .
The Waterfall Model depends on having the right requirements , and initial requirements are usually just a guess .
A number of software processes in use assume that the real requirements can be fully and accurately specified beforehand .
Why do they think that when it is clear that when you 're building something no one has ever seen or had experience with before , you are at best guessing every step of the way ?
In response to the Waterfall Model , other methods were proposed : the Iterative Method and Rapid Prototyping , for example .
Rapid prototyping uses a special prototyping language to make quickly a prototype of a system .
With this prototype , potential users can try out the software , and the real requirements can be figured out .
Then a more traditional method like the Waterfall Model can be used to implement the requirements using a real programming language .
In the old days - 15 years ago or so - prototyping languages were distinguished from real programming languages by not requiring as much description of the program as is needed for real programming languages .
The reason real programming languages require a lot of description is so that a compiler can produce very efficient programs using highly compressed data representations - a compiler is a program that translates computer programs that people write into code that computers can execute .
A way to look at the difference between prototyping and real programming languages is that the prototyping language spares the programmer from typing in a lot of extra stuff , which means the computer needs to do more work while the real programming language makes the programmer do the extra stuff so a computer does n't have to do as much .
The result is that with a prototyping language , you can write code a lot faster and with fewer bugs than you can with a real programming language , and with a real programming language it takes a lot longer to program , but the code runs fast .
In the old days when computers were slow , it was worthwhile to make people work hard in service of computers .
In the old days , Java would probably be called a prototyping language .
The Iterative Method employs use cases to define what the software will do .
A use case is a scenario of usage and what should happen - that is , a person does this , that , and the other thing , and this is what the software does in response .
The total specification of what an interactive program should do can be made by describing all the possible use cases .
The iterative method proceeds by gathering use cases , then implementing enough of the system to implement a small batch of the use cases , trying the system out , then adding new use cases or modifying existing ones , and then doing more implementation , etc .
The idea is to intersperse understanding the nature of the software being written with its implementation .
With both rapid prototyping and the iterative method , the goal is to speed up understanding what software should do and how people can best interact with it - because with software we are building things that have no physicality and which do not adhere well to physical metaphors .
In many cases we are creating things which have never been created before , and we have no idea how people will use them , what they will find hard , what they will find confusing , and the process of writing software is so arduous , time - consuming , and money - intensive , that we have not yet been able to try enough experiments to know the answers to those questions .
Here is one way to look at it :
If you place almost anyone from a Western culture in front of any desk that they have never seen before , he or she will be able to look through the drawers , find pens and pencils , and otherwise do their work there .
The primary computer metaphor is the desktop , developed by Xerox PARC in the 1970s and " borrowed " by Apple and then Microsoft .
But it is n't a real desktop - it 's a metaphor , and not such a good one at that .
Stuff appears on a vertical screen and not a horizontal desk .
The sorts of things that appear there are not books , pencils , and papers , but documents and applications - or nicknames for applications .
You do n't reach for these things with your hands , but maneuver a small arrow using a round brick on your desk or by twirling a ball mounted on a holder ; you do n't grasp them with your fingers but operate them by pushing buttons on the brick or ball - holder .
Here , the designers have tried to use a physical metaphor to make understanding the software easier , but operating within a metaphor is not the same as operating in the world .
Moving a mouse and clicking buttons to get things done is not natural to people nor are there the centuries of experience with machines similar to computers .
Today we take for granted the relatively new idea of a steering wheel on a car .
But such steering wheels have been around for about a hundred years , and the use of a " steering wheel " for controlling the direction of ships has been around since the 18th century , where it was found to produce better control with less effort because it used a block and tackle for mechanical advantage .
And the steering wheel is a physical device - not a picture of one - and it's operated by placing one 's hands on it - not by pointing an arrow at it and pushing a little button twice .
The two most successful software applications have been the spreadsheet and the text editor .
The spreadsheet , developed by Dan Bricklin and Bob Franskton in 1979 , mimicked the tabular notation of bookkeeping and married it with the functionality of popular business calculators of the time .
The result - called " VisiCalc " - was something both familiar and new .
Given the familiar , the new was easier to learn than if it were all new .
The familiar parts were common to people who did business financials - the layout on the screen was not a metaphor , but a duplicate of what accountants would use on paper .
What was new was the command - style programming of the spreadsheet .
Nevertheless , the spreadsheet was something never seen before .
A chart indicating the 64 greatest events in accounting and business history contains VisiCalc .
The text editor is nothing more than the combination of a piece of paper in a typewriter with other commands and functionality that before could only be performed by retyping or retypesetting .
Again , the software combined the familiar with the new : typing , moving around on the page using simple commands like < space > , < tab > , and < return > along with new functionality like search and replace , text justification , font control , and line wrapping .
Nevertheless , habits die hard .
Some fiction writers are used to revising their stories and novels by literally retyping their manuscripts and regaining the feeling and rhythms of typing the words .
Such writers continue to do so : Printing out the manuscript and retyping it rather than fooling with small changes , looking for larger changes with deeper significance .
The first recognizable text editors were developed about 30 years ago .
Since then we have gone through 3 generations and we 're on the 4th - Microsoft Word being somewhere between the 3rd and 4th generations , not having become competent at typesetting .
Yet people do not fully utilize the functionality available , or they get confused by the user interface .
There are icons and tool interfaces all over the screen , and it's hard to tell what is controlled by what .
Except for the typewriter part of the interface , nothing about what confronts a writer is familiar and is not part of the physical world .
The physical controls of a computer control the virtual world of the software , and that virtual world need not obey any laws of physics or common sense .
People are not used to making up paragraph templates or styles , they cannot make cross-references or indexes .
Nevertheless , they can operate complex physical machines like lathes and trucks , cook using sophisticated stoves and ovens , ride bicycles with 24 gears , fly airplanes , and sail boats
These , though , are the simple cases .
Most business software has no physical equivalents , and even metaphors are hard to come by .
The people who pay for the software sometimes are n't the ones who will use it , and the people who use it will not be well - trained - they will simply have to " pick it up , " so to speak .
Because there is no requirement for the innards of software to make physical or common sense , and because the connections between the cartoonish controls on a computer screen do n't have to have a physical or logical connection to what happens inside , people - whether trained or not - can develop incorrect mental models of what 's going on inside the software and how their actions control things .
Designers of physical devices have an expert collaborator : the physical world .
Because the physical world can , in theory , make it possible for someone to figure out the innards of the device and how they work , the designer can take advantage of his or her helper to make things sensible to a person using it .
The designer of software has no one to help simplify things .
The complexity of the model embodied in the software - which sometimes does n't correspond to any real - world situation or any " model " of the problem being solved - is inscrutable , and leads directly to difficulty using the software .
Keep in mind that the software not only has to model the objects and operations involved in the problem but also has to model objects and operations for presenting itself to the user , and for interacting with the user .
The physical world of inanimate objects does not care about interacting with us , and leaves that messy job to the laws of physics .
For software developers , it 's left up to the laws of the imagination .
As software developers we face two grave difficulties :
One is that we are building things that have never been seen on the planet before , and the other is that the tools we use to build it with are so brittle that it takes an enormous effort to get it done , and the smallest slip - up can cause none of it to work .
We learned these lessons in the 1970s , but things take time to percolate to the industry .
In the mid-1980s , Harlan Mills at IBM introduced the Cleanroom Process .
This process considers the program you are trying to write as an expression of a mathematical function .
Here 's how it works :
First , you specify all the components of what you want to write and how they interact .
Each component is assigned to a person or team which performs stepwise refinement using structures called " box structures . "
Through reviews and verification , all the components are shown to be correct .
Then by testing statistically determined uses , an operational view of the software including its performance and correctness can be drawn .
This testing is done by a separate group , and no code is executed by the development team prior to the independent testing .
If at some point a problem is discovered with the design or specification , the development group goes back to the design phase .
In this sense it is an incremental process .
With this process as well as with the Waterfall Model , you had better know what you want to build , because if it turns out you 've built the wrong thing , going back and fixing it is going to take a long time given the programming languages and tools we use .
The processes I 've talked about up until now generally focus on the predictability of what will be built - that is , if you really know what is wanted and needed down to the last detail , then you can use one of the planning - heavy processes or methodologies to build it effectively and predictably .
For some software like the space shuttle software , this is a great thing to do :
Plan it out , design it to the last detail , prove everything you can about it , then build it as carefully and deliberately as you can .
But progress and business wo n't wait for that .
Businesses thrive by being agile - adapting to changes rapidly .
And if you are building something that has never been built , then you 'd better be prepared for surprises - if for no reason than if you happen to come up with something great that was n't what you were planning , you'd be smart to exploit it rather than throw it away .
The other issue is that the people who are best at building software that has never been built before are usually quite talented , creative , and intelligent .
It is not going to work to design out to the last detail something that has never been built before and then ask talented , creative , intelligent people to build it but not react when things go wrong or a better design or approach pops up .
They will not work for you if you do this .
Think about how bridges are designed and built .
Designers first come up with a detailed plan for the bridge based on geological investigation , centuries of experience building bridges , and careful , precise mathematical analysis , an analysis made possible by the nature of the physical world and science .
Then , another company is hired to apply physically skilled construction workers and unskilled laborers to construct the bridge according to a relatively predictable schedule and known costs .
Many would like software to be like that .
It can not be because we do n't have the physical world and experience to make things predictable - you need them both .
We have neither .
In response to recognizing that what we are doing is unpredictable and requires very smart people , the software community has developed a group of processes or methodologies noted for being lightweight and adaptable .
Such methodologies are sometimes called agile methodologies .
The best known of these methodologies is called Extreme Programming .
It exemplifies the agile methodologies in all but one particular way , which is that it does not emphasize adapting the process itself to the team and circumstances as much as other agile methodologies do .
Extreme programming expounds practicing to an extreme activities that other methodologies promote .
Code reviews by others are considered an important part of ensuring quality early in the implementation of a program .
Therefore , Extreme Programming requires that developers work in pairs , sitting at the same computer all the time with one then the other controlling the keyboard and mouse so that the code is being continually reviewed , not simply periodically .
Testing is important to quality , and usually it is performed toward the end of a project when it is almost too late .
Therefore , Extreme Programming requires that tests be written at the same time as the code or before , and that all written code must pass all its tests all the time .
This way , testing is continuous .
Design is important to any piece of software .
Therefore , Extreme Programming requires that design be part of everyone 's daily business .
Simplicity of code and design is good .
Therefore , Extreme Programming requires that the code in the current system be the simplest code that could possibly support the current functionality .
Architecture is the fundamental stuff of a maintainable and changeable system .
Therefore , Extreme Programming requires that everyone with a stake in the software should continually work at defining and refining the architecture .
Short iterations and frequent integrations are good because they enable the team to see where the software is going , to see how users respond to it , and to adapt to newly learned requirements .
Therefore , Extreme Programming requires that iterations be very short - seconds , minutes , and hours rather than weeks , months , and years - and that integration tests be performed several times a day rather than every few weeks or months .
Other agile methodologies build self - review into the responsibilities of each team , so that not only are the plans and designs for the software subject to adaptation , but so is the process itself .
Extreme Programming results in quick turnaround for small additions and changes , so adaptation to what 's learned can be immediate , and such a process keeps talented developers challenged and alert .
For predictable software - software that 's been written dozens of times before or which is the result of some sort of detailed mathematical analysis - you would n't use a methodology like this .
But for something never built before ?
Or heard of before ?
Or never heard of by you and your team ?
I believe creating a completely new product is a hard concept to understand for someone who has not either developed software or been deeply involved with some creative activity .
It seems that making software must be like designing and building a house , or a car , or a highway , or a TV , or a stove .
Let me try to provide a scenario that might make it clear .
Suppose you wanted to design and build a gas stove , but no one had ever used gas to cook with before .
In fact , assume that before this , all that had ever been used was a wood stove .
Here are some things you would n't know :
Will you use the gas flame to heat a piece of metal on which the pots and pans will sit , and that metal will transfer the heat , or will the flame be applied directly to the pots and pans ?
How will you control the temperature ?
Will you require that people move their pans from places of intense heat to places of less heat ?
Will you provide a gas flow controller that will reduce the amount of fuel to the flame ?
Will you move the flame closer or farther away from the pan or heat transfer metal ?
Will the heat be a manageable temperature for all kinds of cooking or only for limited use ?
Will cooks be afraid of using gas ?
How will you get it into the stove ?
Will it be stored or continuously supplied ?
How will you control the temperature of an oven using gas ?
Will a stove designed this way be affordable ?
Will the stove explode ?
Will the gas smell funny ?
Will the stove need to be inside or outside the house ?
There are thousands of questions like this in every software project I 'm calling unpredictable , and I 'm also claiming that almost all software projects are unpredictable .
Recall that I said that unpredictability is only half the problem . -
That the other half had to do with the programming languages and tools we use which make it very hard to write software that is n't brittle .
-
And that the brittleness had only a shallow relation to cause and effect .
Writing a correct program requires enormous attention to picayune details written in a language designed for mathematical computation , not symbolic or business reasoning .
Because of that , design , proving correctness , and testing are required .
Extreme Programming makes you test continuously .
The Cleanroom Process makes you both prove correctness and test .
Programming is very hard work because in many ways , the stuff inside a program is too much like a complicated mathematical function that somehow does what you want , even when mathematics is not part of your game .
Computers deal with bits , bytes , and simple logical and arithmetic operations on them .
Most of the programming languages we use do not raise the level of abstraction much higher than that , though when designing software we hardly ever think in those terms .
I mentioned prototyping languages before .
Those languages did raise the level of abstraction quite a bit .
This made creating software a lot easier and quicker , and they were less prone to errors .
In many prototyping languages , errors were assumed to be common and such languages provided easy mechanisms for programmers to decide how to deal with them or for programmers to decide how the programs would decide how to deal with them .
Today , programming languages call errors " exceptions , " and deal with them that way .
Languages like these could make a big difference today in how fast we learn and the satisfaction level for consumers .
But over 10 years ago the computing world decided to give up on languages like those .
They ran way too slowly .
They were a little too big .
Of course , now that computers are 500 times more powerful and 250 times larger than back then , maybe this would n't be as true , but computer science research and computing practice have both forgotten about these languages and approaches and , in some cases , essentially outlawed using or thinking about them .
Well , so we program in the dark ages - what of it ?
Actually , we 've figured out a way around that too .
Because programming languages are too primitive , a large program is too complicated for one person to understand and get right , and there are too many bugs and other errors for one person to find and fix , and it 's just too large for one person to get done quickly .
How do you solve a problem like this ?
You have thousands of people work on it .
This is called Open Source .
To understand how this works requires a little explanation .
When you design , build , and sell a car and it 's sitting in someone 's garage , its innards and how it works can be - more or less - discovered by opening it up and peering inside .
In fact , if something goes wrong with the car , maybe you can fix it yourself , or maybe you can take it to a repair shop where someone will fix it .
Or suppose you do n't like the shocks or fuel injection system .
If you 're real good , you can change those things or someone can do it for you .
You could even install a nitrous oxide system if you wanted an extra 200 horsepower for short periods at a time .
In fact , just about everything we as consumers can buy has the property that there are plenty of physical things about it that a consumer can fix or customize or pay someone to do for them .
Not so with software .
Imagine that you open up your hood and what you see is sand .
Open up your TV - sand .
Look in the back of your refrigerator - sand .
Unscrew any access plate anywhere in your house - and it's more sand .
Change or move one grain of it and - ka ! boom !
- it does n't work anymore or does something you do n't like such as show only the Home Shopping Network , heat up your ice cream , or make your car go only backwards honking the horn .
Sounds a little nuts does n't it ?
But that 's exactly what software is like .
The software in a form that people have a chance to understand is transformed by the software maker into something only a particular set of computers can understand , and that 's what you buy .
Even if you were capable of finding and fixing a bug in Microsoft Word , you could n't do it unless you worked for Microsoft .
Let 's go back to the real world example .
If the innards of your car were like software , then when it needed to be fixed , the original manufacturer would have to be contacted .
They would prepare a new batch of sand , and that batch would replace the sand in your car .
Ask a software company why they want you to not even see what is inside what they sell and they will tell you that either it's too complicated for you to understand or that this way they can protect their trade secrets .
Both patent law and copyright law apply to software - this is more protection than the auto manufacturers have - so that can't be a good explanation .
Cars are pretty complicated too , so that can't really be the reason .
Maybe the clue is in the idea that for you to get anything changed about the software you need to go back to the software maker .
In the auto industry there is an aftermarket for spare parts , custom kits , instruments and tools for diagnosis and repair , and repair shops .
We 've got that for most consumer electronics , white goods , lawn mowers , houses , bicycles , musical instruments , on and on , and even computers .
But not for software .
The only aftermarket is for designed - in software customizations and fixing user configuration mistakes .
If you buy a book and find a typographic error , you can take out your pencil and fix it .
If you find a similar typo in the user interface of a program , only the software maker can fix it .
Sounds like they 've maneuvered themselves into quite a nice place , do n't you think ?
Well , Open Source is out to change all that .
In Open Source , all the source code for a system is available for anyone to look at and modify for their own purposes .
The source code is what the software makers turn into sand .
In an Open Source project , the mechanisms for turning source to sand is freely available .
The source for the project is kept in a special , open place , and changes to the official source are loosely controlled by a group of developers and perhaps some governance process .
This group of developers is dedicated to enabling the community to move the software along without hogging control of it .
If anyone finds a bug and sends the fix to this group , the fix will be put in right away .
If anyone makes an improvement , the same is likely to happen .
If someone thinks they have a better way to do part of the system and the developers in charge do n't agree , that someone can fork off the source and start their own competing project .
Typically , the Open Source project has an active community with mailing lists , a Web site , and email archives containing all the design and implementation changes .
Alterations to the software are openly discussed and such discussions can be brought up by anyone .
Usually some consensus is arrived at and changes are made .
Companies can take the results and by either adding functionality , providing support , or surrounding it with other software , make money from it - often as much as closed source companies do .
In an Open Source project , there can be tens of thousands of people who use the code and help fix it , and hundreds or thousands who contribute to its development .
In any given day there can be hundreds of email exchanges about the software .
The community itself is the support organization , and just about every question is answered by the community or by its archives .
Testing is continuous , integrations and releases happen just about every day .
Design and implementation is done in the open on mailing lists .
All the design decisions are thereby written down .
Architecture , design , implementation , and testing are done in parallel by hundreds or thousands of people , not just by a pair or a small group .
There are two important things this accomplishes .
One is that the fact that programming languages are backward does n't matter too much to the project , because there are lots of people to share the burden with .
And the direction of the software is subject to comment by thousands of people , and if there are severe disagreements , a competing project can start up from the same source base .
This way , the process of finding out the true requirements for a piece of software never yet built can be rapidly discovered .
What I 've been talking about is creativity in a hostile medium - making things that have never been made before using tools not suited for it .
But we 're doing a pretty good job .
Creativity is a funny thing .
It takes lots of practice and lots of whacks to get something right .
A professional photographer will shoot many , many shots of the same subject , bracketing exposure , trying different exposure durations , moving the camera around , trying different angles , different lighting , different filters , different props if that makes sense .
The results will be in a distribution - a few not so good , most pretty good , and maybe a few that are really great .
Now all the photographer has to do is select the best ones and work with them a bit in the darkroom or on the computer .
The number of photographs taken to get some good shots can be staggering .
For one piece in National Geographic Magazine using 22 photographs , the photographer took about 40,000 photographs - this is over a thousand rolls of film to select just 22 photos .
This might seem like a typographic error or a fluke .
Here is an excerpt from a story about another photographer , Joel Sartore :
The standards are incredibly high .
For a photo story on Nebraska that ran øin the November 1998 [ National ] Geographic [ Magazine ] , Sartore had eight weeks total to shoot , which he broke up into several one and two - week intervals over two years of time .
Of the 31,320 photos he shot for the Nebraska story , only 16 ran in the magazine .
Once the film is shot , the best ones are selected and then the photographer works in the darkroom or with Adobe¨ Photoshop¨ to perfect them .
We all believe the perfection part of the story , but we do n't believe as deeply or appreciate the selection part .
Another example is filmmaking .
The movie Apocalypse Now runs about two and half hours .
To get those 2.5 hours , the filmmakers shot 250 hours of film .
That means that for every hour of film on screen in the final version , over 100 hours of film were shot .
Once the film is shot and selected , the work of perfection goes on in the darkroom , perhaps on a computer workstation , and then in the editing room .
When the poet James Dickey wrote a poem , he would sometimes do 500 drafts to get the right one .
Great art is a process of making lots of things , knowing how to select the good ones , and knowing how to perfect them - making stuff , choosing critically , making some mistakes , being able to recognize them , and then being able to correct them .
When you design for the physical world , you design with it .
Nature is your collaborator .
Most product designers have the advantage of centuries of experience with artifacts in the physical world , and so they 've had 500 drafts or 40,000 attempts in their experience base .
Software is fiction , it is imagination .
Not many rules apply .
We are just 50 years into it and going as strong as we can .
But the software creation discipline has n't gotten to the selection part yet - each methodology I 've described operates under the assumption that someone can know what to build and that by either thinking hard or making small , incremental modifications , we can build the right thing .
No other practice of art demonstrates the truth of this proposition .
We can build OK things , but not great things .
In only a small number of cases have we made a diversity of software and the selected , and in most of those cases - such as for text editors - the ones we selected were not the best .
And the software world has not yet figured out how to engage effectively in the design process the people we call " end-users . "
Almost all software is designed by software developers with no training - and not much interest - in how non-programmers will use it .
These chapters in the history of software development are blank pages .
As time goes on , your process of product design will blend with mine - you 'll have reality on your side for part of it and your imagination in the way for other parts .
Before this , you 've had the benefit of centuries to work out what people want and need , but now you need to figure out how to involve users from the start .
If you 've included software in your product before , you 'll find that as you include more , you 'll need to iterate , to produce diversity , to select , to hone , and perhaps to use the mob and not just your own developers .
You 'll find creativity working hand in hand with engineering .
It will feel strange and you might feel like things are out of control .
Relax - they are .
What we 've learned in software so far is that you can build things out of junk , but that finding out what to build and how to best design it takes creativity - that is , lots of tries , working with the folks who will use the stuff in the end , and perfecting the best attempt .
It 's too bad building software is n't like building bridges .
It 's more like writing novels - maybe like writing science fiction .

The olor is held in place by a rope or an elastic strap Maasai herdsmen in Kenya have turned to an age - old contraceptive device , the " olor " , to protect their precious goat herds from an ongoing drought .
The olor is made from cowhide or a square piece of plastic , and is tied around the belly of the male goat .
It prevents the bucks from mating with the female goats .
The herdsmen are using the device to limit the goat population and ensure there are not too many animals grazing on sparse vegetation .
" We do n't want them to breed in this drought , " says Mr Ole Ngoshoi Kipameto , a goat owner in Kajiado district .
Vital assets
The area , which is 80 km ( 50 miles ) from the capital , Nairobi , has received insufficient rainfall , making the landscape barren and forcing residents to move from place to place in search of pasture and water .
In the Maasai community , livestock are often people 's only assets and sole means of survival .
" We tie this hide under the belly of the buck for three months .
After that we remove it and then they can breed by November when the short rains come , " Mr Kipameto says .
The olor saves employing separate herdsmen for male and female goats
The rectangular piece of cowhide is passed over the buck 's head and front legs and secured under the belly in front of the hind legs with a rope or elastic strap .
" It looks like an apron , " Mr Kipameto says .
Peter Ndirangu , the area livestock officer , says the olor is very effective .
" In the modern method , we advocate keeping the bucks separate from the breeding goats .
But that is an added cost as you require two herdsmen - one for the bucks and one for the goats , " he says .
" This [ device ] will play the part of a herdsman . "
He says the device is very useful in keeping the herd numbers down and controlling when the goats give birth .
" If they give birth during harsh conditions like now , the mothers - the does - are going to be very weak , they 're not going to feed their young ones properly , " he says .
The device helps the herdsmen to restrict kidding to the period during and after the rains .
If the rains fall in October and November , the dry landscape will turn green again and the herdsmen will be able to settle with their livestock .
Until then , the herdsmen will have to employ the olor to protect their livestock and livelihood safe .
Those who do not use it could face a hefty fine if their bucks are found guilty of impregnating another herder 's doe .

What are these ?
Murray Waas has a huge breaking story .
This just gets better and better .
William Timmons , the Washington lobbyist who John McCain has named to head his presidential transition team , aided an influence effort on behalf of Iraqi dictator Saddam Hussein to ease international sanctions against his regime .
The two lobbyists who Timmons worked closely with over a five year period on the lobbying campaign later either pleaded guilty to or were convicted of federal criminal charges that they had acted as unregistered agents of Saddam Hussein 's government .
During the same period beginning in 1992 , Timmons worked closely with the two lobbyists , Samir Vincent and Tongsun Park , on a previously unreported prospective deal with the Iraqis in which they hoped to be awarded a contract to purchase and resell Iraqi oil .
Timmons , Vincent , and Park stood to share at least $ 45 million if the business deal went through .
Timmons ' activities occurred in the years following the first Gulf War , when Washington considered Iraq to be a rogue enemy state and a sponsor of terrorism .
His dealings on behalf of the deceased Iraqi leader stand in stark contrast to the views his current employer held at the time .
John McCain strongly supported the 1991 military action against Iraq , and as recently as Sunday described Saddam Hussein as a one - time menace to the region who had " stated categorically that he would acquire weapons of mass destruction , and he would use them wherever he could . "
Timmons declined to comment for this story
There is a lot riding on the shoulders of T - Mobile 's G1 Android phone .
In some ways , it carries the collective hopes of Linux , open source and Google fans everywhere .
It 's open , collaborative and community - based , in other words , everything the iPhone and Windows Mobile are n't .
As so many onlookers crowd around this newborn phone , there 's no way it can hold up all of their expectations — and it does n't .
After spending a week using the G1 , I can say it 's a good start , and a clear indication of good Android developments to come .
But the phone itself has some serious problems with accessibility and usability , issues that no number of third - party apps are going to be able to solve .
Here 's what I loved and hated about the T - Mobile G1 .

Body :
The body was made by HTC , a Taiwanese company that makes Windows Mobile devices for Motorola , Palm and its own line .
This phone is built just like those .
The back is classic matted and grip - friendly HTC .
The swivel - flip feels almost exactly like earlier HTC phones , only it extends out and then back in again , revealing the keyboard underneath .
This motion gives a satisfying snap when opened , though it might be too loud in a quiet office .
Keyboard :
It 's got numerous problems .
First , it 's set so that the raised section on the right , with scroller ball and home and menu keys , is always in your way when you 're trying to type .
This is annoying , even after you figure out how to work around it .
The individual keys are n't raised high enough over the body for easy touch typing , though at least the keyboard is backlit , in case you 're texting in the dark .
The space and backspace key are tinier than we 'd like .
And it 's even more awkward than normal to type while charging the phone , because the miniUSB cable is in the way .

Buttons :
There are five face buttons on the device — call , home , back , power / end and menu — and they 're all fairly straightforward .
Hit home to bring you back to the home screen , menu to bring up a popup menu in your current app , and power / end button to lock your phone or hang up your call .
That last part takes the most getting used to , since you 're naturally going to want to use the red power button to quit apps or end tasks , but all that does is lock your phone .
Trackball :
It feels great , better than on the BlackBerry Pearl , and it clicks down solidly .
Still , switching between the trackball and the touchscreen can get awkward .
Screen :
The touchscreen is bright , renders text clearly and is , on the whole , pretty great .
It uses capacitive touch , like the iPhone , so you use your fingertip , not a stylus , to poke around .
There are cases when screen presses do n't register properly — they 're not too often , but often enough to be noticeable .

Battery : A full charge lasts about a day , mainly because push Gmail grabs the internet every time the account receives an email , and mine receives plenty .
Couple that with 3G data browsing and app usage — which you 're most likely going to be doing a lot of — and you 'll need to get used to a mid-day charge at work .
Thankfully charging from near empty to near full takes only about two hours .
Wi - Fi : The Wi-Fi range seems slightly to be on par with comparable smartphones ( HTC's Windows Mobile phones , iPhone ) , showing just about as many Wi -Fi hotspots in my house as the other ones did .
3G : I got noticeably decent browsing speeds , with an actual test registering 433 kbps .
This , of course , is only the case if your city has 3G access at all , since T - Mobile 's only just starting to roll out their network .
Camera :
It 's passable and on par with previous HTC efforts .
It does have autofocus , but other than that there 's nothing spectacular with the G1's camera .
GPS : GPS is actually off by default , which produces a very inaccurate location when you try and find yourself on Google Maps .
You 'll have to switch this on manually .

Other Issues :
It 's hard to fathom why HTC left out a 3.5 mm headphone jack in 2008 , same for USB mass storage mode for Windows or Mac. Really ?
You have to pop out that microSD card and use a card reader every time you want to load a ringtone or a song or a photo or a video ?
Seriously ?
Apologies , there actually IS a USB mass storage mode , but you have to use the bundled HTC proprietary mini USB cable .
Any old mini USB cable wo n't do !
But yes , it 's possible .
Also , when the screen is flipped open , it 's tilted down about three degrees — really annoying to certain people who like clean lines .
Operating System and Usability
Advertisement
Calling : Making phone calls on this thing works well .
Call quality is good , but the screen annoyingly times out after about 10 seconds .
If you want to power on the screen again , you have to hit the menu key or the " call " key , which takes you to the dialpad .
It may just be that we punch in our credit card numbers or find contacts during a call more often than most people , but always having to bring up the screen again is a pain .
And pressing the power / end button , which you 'd think would power up the screen , actually just hangs up the call .
Annoying .
But as for the actually making calls part ?
No complaints from us .
Texting :
Texts are arranged per contact in threads , and works well enough since texting is so simple .
No cockups here .
Stability :
The one word I 'd use to describe the Android operating system is " solid " .
It 's been my main device for a week , and I 've yet to see the entire OS hang or freeze ( have n't had to reboot yet ) .
Individual apps have crashed or frozen , but Android handles this spectacularly well by using the PC paradigm where you can choose to Force Quit a frozen app or wait for it to unstick itself .
This way , very little can take down the entire phone under everyday use .
( Buggy hardcore apps that snake deep into core functions could probably succeed . )
Background Apps : Multitasking is one thing Android does really well .
Apps can run in the background , receiving data and continuing to " exist , " even though you do n't see them .
The OS handles memory management for you invisibly , giving processes a lower CPU priority and taking away their RAM when other programs need it .
For now , examples are simple , like opening a browser , then a bunch of other apps , then returning to the browser .
You can use four or five apps before before the browser has to re-fetch data on the web page .
Presumably , programmers will soon make more impressive use of the background processing power .
Advertisement
Window Shade : Google 's most unique multitasking helper is the notification window shade , which serves as an infodump of all incoming emails , messages , IMs and missed calls .
Tapping a notification will take you to its corresponding app .
No matter what app you 're in , the shade drops smoothly into place when you pull it down , dragging your finger from the top .
( Just opposite the window shade is the pull - up app menu .
If you run out of room on your three desktop screens , you 'll be visiting here for lesser used programs . )
Long Clicks :
One convention that 's used often — but not consistently — is the long press .
Long presses are a mix between right clicking and playing the lottery .
Hold down an area of the screen — you may see a menu pop up or you may get absolutely nothing .
Long click on the main screen and it asks you which app shortcut you want to move to your desktop .
Long click on the text message screen and you 'll be prompted to delete or view a thread .
Long click on Google Maps or a page in the browser , however , and nothing happens .
Interface :
As we have observed , the UI suffers from general usability issues such as inconsistent actions or surprisingly unclickable regions like the browser 's URL bar or the home screen 's clock .
But when you use it , you realize it is kinda pretty .
Like the window shade , many of the transparencies , transitions , fade - ins , fade - outs , popups and other UI elements are slick , and definitely win out in aesthetics over smartphones like Windows Mobile .
Compared to the iPhone , it still loses , but this comes down to a lack of multitouch capability — on the G1 , for instance , you zoom by clicking + and - magnifier buttons .
Like I said , it 's definitely a solid OS , but it also needs some real work by some UI experts to make it easier to pick up and play with .
Apps Contacts :
Phone contacts sync nicely with Google 's Gmail contacts — great if you use Gmail , and an extra place to backup your contacts if you do n't .
You can even scroll through them fast by dragging a bar on the right .
The problem though is that the quick - scroll dragger is hyper - sensitive , and holding your finger still in one place can make the phone jitter between letters .
Each contact has a default phone number displayed under his name — when you tap a contact it feels like you 're dialing his number , even though you 're just pulling up details .
Advertisement
Mail :
There are actually two mail programs on the G1 : Mail and Gmail .
Mail lets you manage five accounts , while Gmail makes you tie your phone to just one account .
But Gmail is one of the best apps on the phone , giving you 90 % of the desktop features you use on a day - to - day basis .
Archiving , labeling , reporting spam , deleting and starring are super easy and sync to webmail almost instantly .
The best part of this Gmail implementation is that it's push the only push Gmail on any mobile device ( Helio 's phones also have it ) .
T- Mobile failed to mention its cool keyboard shortcuts — I had to fiddle to figure out that you can hit " r " for reply or " a " to reply all .
( Surely there are more . )
A dumb flaw is that it wo n't auto - complete names when you start with someone 's last name .
I have to sort through 10 Brians to find Lam 's address , when I should be able to just type Lam and have this be smart enough to figure out who I mean .
Advertisement
Marketplace : The Marketplace is divided into Games and Applications , with sub-categories such as Lifestyle , Productivity , Shopping and Tools .
Downloading and installing apps are pretty much 1 - click , like the iPhone App Store , and most apps launch just fine .
However , since most developers do n't have an actual Android phone to test their apps on , a lot of programs will be sluggish or even crash - prone in the first few weeks .
Expect this to be fixed soon .
IM : The IM app is a very good client that supports AIM , Google Talk , Windows Live ( MSN ) , and Yahoo .
It 's intuitive , works well with the keyboard and even offers background notification — unlike iPhone — so you can switch to other apps but still get incoming messages delivered to you via the top status bar .
Advertisement
Browser :
The G1 browser , like Chrome on the desktop , is based on WebKit , the open source browser engine that also powers Safari and Mobile Safari .
This means it 's pretty damn good .
That said , the lack of multitouch gestures in Android 's version makes zooming a pain .
It does n't have Flash support ( YouTube gets forwarded to the YouTube app ) and it does n't auto - zoom to maximize the column you want to read in your display .
It can , however , remember your password for logins , like a desktop browser does .
Advertisement
Google Maps : Gmaps has most of what you 'll find in the desktop version , including Satellite , Traffic and Street View .
Once you turn on GPS , the phone 's fairly decent at locating where you are even indoors , and Compass View is a gimmick that works sometimes and does n't work other times — but then again , spinning around like an idiot makes you look like an idiot all the time .
Music Player :
It 's no iPod , but the G1's built - in music player gets the job done decently .
It fits in fairly well with the rest of the Android experience , but we 're definitely looking at third - party apps like TuneWiki to pick up the slack here .
That 's not to say the Music app is bad — it 's perfectly fine .
It 's just not great .
Third - Party Apps : Some of the more promising apps like Tunes Remote , TuneWiki and Video Player are n't as fleshed out and stable as we like .
Tunes Remote lags and crashes a lot , TuneWiki can't find our music and Video Player only supports a handful of codecs .
We expect these all to be fixed soon .
Other apps like AccuWeather , Barcode Scanner and Pac - Man work just fine despite being developed on the Android emulator .
We 're looking forward to good things here .

Verdict The G1 phone and the Android operating system are not finished products .
There are only three working Google Apps here — Gmail , Maps and Calendar — while Google Docs , Google News , Google Reader , Google Shopping , Google Images , Google Video , Blogger and Picasa are nowhere to be found .
What 's the deal ?
We have high hopes for third - party coders to fill in gaps Google intentionally or unintentionally left in this OS .
There 's already a video player , and we 're sure VLC will try and port some kind of version over .
But your question is not whether the phone will be great down the line , it 's whether or not it 's good enough for you to buy it now .
The answer depends most on who you are .
Despite all the UI quirks and bad design decisions , it 's still better than other smartphone OSes out there .
It 's not perfect , but for people who like tinkering , its cons are outweighed by its pros such as Gmail and the Marketplace .
Hopefully Android updates and more ports of Google apps will augment not just future phones but this one too .
This is n't something you 're going to give your mom for Christmas , but if you 're an adventuresome gadget guy with some money to spend ( $ 179 ) on a totally new , pretty exciting venture , then why not ?

TiVo 's patent battle with Dish Network Corp. turned in favor of the Alviso company Monday when the Supreme Court declined to take up Dish Network 's appeal , forcing the satellite television company to pay $ 104 million in damages .
Dish Network , which operates the No. 2 satellite TV service , said it will release the full amount from escrow to TiVo in the coming days .
TiVo originally won a patent infringement case in 2004 against Dish , which was then named EchoStar Communications .
It charged that Dish illegally copied its technology , which allows people to pause , rewind and record live television on digital video recorders .
EchoStar had wanted the Supreme Court to review a U.S. appeals court ruling that upheld a district court judgment of willful patent infringement , full award of damages and an injunction against Dish Network 's infringing DVR products .
" We are extremely pleased that the United States Supreme Court has denied EchoStar 's petition , " TiVo said in a statement .
MBA BY THE BAY : See how an MBA could change your life with SFGATE 's interactive directory of Bay Area programs .
Dish Network said the ruling will not disrupt its customers ' continued use of its video recorders because it has deployed work - around software that it says does not infringe on TiVo 's intellectual property .
But Dish still needs to prove that its work - around software does not violate TiVo 's patents .
A lower court had issued an injunction against Dish , ordering it to stop the distribution of its DVRs .
Dish continued to sell the set - top boxes , saying the DVRs did not employ software that infringed on TiVo 's patents .
U.S. District Judge David Folsom of Texas will now decide if Dish was successful in steering clear of TiVo 's patents .
If not , the company could face additional damages for failing to comply with the injunction .
" We believe that the design - around does not infringe TiVo 's patent and that TiVo 's pending motion for contempt should be denied .
We look forward to that ruling in the near future , " the company said in a statement .
TiVo 's shares finished up 11 cents , or 1.76 percent , to $ 6.37 per share on Monday .
Scientists from Penn State University have designed the future of refrigerators and other cooling devices through magnetic field refrigeration .
The investigation pertaining to electrically induced heat effects of some ferroelectric polymers might remove electrically powered refrigerators and their compressors and coils .
The researchers are focusing on ferroelectric polymers that exhibit temperature changes at room temperature under an electrical field .
Professor Qiming Zhang
( Credit : Pennsylvania
State University )
“ This is the first step in the development of an electric field refrigeration unit , ” explained Professor Qiming Zhang .
“ For the future , we can envision a flat panel refrigerator .
No more coils , no more compressors , just solid polymer with appropriate heat exchangers . ”
The polarpolymers that are used in testing include poly ( vinylidene fluoride - trifluoroethylene ) and poly ( vinylidene fluoride - trifluoroethylene ) chlorofluoroethylene .
Zhangs ’s method changes the form of the polarpolymer from disorganized to organized when positioned in an electric field .
The molecules of the polarpolymer are usually disordered and when electricity is passed through , the molecules grow to be highly ordered .
This then disperses heat and the material becomes colder .
However , if the electricity is switched off , the polarpolymer returns to its disorganized state and eventually increases its temperature to become hot .
Repetitive randomizing and rearranging of the material , in addition with a suitable heat exchanger , could provide a wide range of heating and cooling temperatures .
Researchers estimate a difference of 22.6 degrees Fahrenheit ( 12.5 degree Celsius ) between the highest and lowest temperatures .
Current refrigeration and cooling systems , such as air conditioners , are designed to utilize the change in density of gases when set to different pressures .
These coolants are both harmful to humans and the environment .
A previously used coolant was Freon , which is a banned chlorofluorocarbon due to the negative effects it had on the ozone layer .
The current day coolants are relatively safer for humans and the environment , but still have high energy consumption from compressors and an excessive amount of heating coils .
Using the new system , the environment will not be polluted and destroyed by gasses and it can also be used around humans safely .
Other than air conditioners and refrigeration units , the technology can be applied to heating or cooling of clothing , cooling of protective gear for fire fighters , heating of mittens , socks or shoes , and even cooling of mascot and cartoon character costumes .
An additional application would be in electronics , where tiny amounts of the polymers could efficiently lower the temperature of over - heated circuit boards and thus tolerating closer packing , and in the process producing miniature devices .
TFOT has previously written about refrigerators which cool future computers which is a miniature refrigeration system , small enough to fit inside laptop computers .

John McCain , R - Ariz. , signs autographs after campaigning at Wake Forest University in Winston - Salem , N.C. last May .
McCain forced to defend N.C .
ASHEVILLE , N.C. —
For the third weekend in a row , Barack Obama campaigned in North Carolina as part of the most vigorous Democratic effort since at least 1992 to win this reliably Republican state .
At a surprise stop Saturday night at a North Carolina Democratic Party dinner and again a rally here Sunday in the state ’s conservative western edge , Obama sounded a confident note :
Advertisement
“ Despite the pundits , despite the prognosticators , despite the cynicism , ” Obama said at the dinner , “ we are right here in the hunt in North Carolina .
We can win at the top of the ballot in North Carolina .
And we win at the bottom of the ballot in North Carolina .
We can win in the eastern part of the state and in the western part .
We can elect a new Democratic governor here in North Carolina and we can elect a new U.S. senator here in North Carolina . ”
To the dismay of North Carolina Republicans , Obama may not be overstating matters .
Aides to John McCain consider North Carolina a must - win state and expressed optimism last week about their chances here , but there are signs of concern : Vice - presidential nominee Sarah Palin this week will make the Republican ticket ’s first visit to the state since June , and the first public appearance since a McCain speech at Wake Forest University during the primaries in May .
“ They ’re having to defend their turf — Republicans — in a way that they have n’t had to since 1992 , ” said Ferrel Guillory , director of the Program on Southern Politics , Media and Public Life at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill .
“ And so , even if Obama does n’t win the electoral votes here , McCain ca n’t take the state for granted . ”
The turmoil on Wall Street and the economic downturn have helped turn North Carolina into more fertile ground for Obama , who took his first lead over John McCain in the Real Clear Politics average of state polls a week ago .
As a national leader in the banking industry , the state suffered more bad news last week as it faces the loss of thousands of high - paying bank jobs — and a blow to its state pride — when Charlotte - based Wachovia Corp .
put itself up for sale last week .
Similar to its flood - the - zone strategy in Virginia , which is experiencing its first competitive presidential race in decades , the Obama campaign has been aggressive in its pursuit of North Carolina .
Obama chose this city in the Blue Ridge Mountains to prepare for Tuesday ’s presidential debate with the state 's 15 electoral votes in mind .
It ’s his fifth visit since clinching the Democratic nomination in June , while vice - presidential nominee Joe Biden has made two stops and Michelle Obama traveled to Charlotte and Greensboro last month , and returns again Tuesday .
Obama is also dominating the airwaves , running about three TV ads for every one from McCain , according to North Carolina political experts .
The prospect of North Carolina as a battleground has put the McCain campaign in a bind , stirring a debate on how much time and resources it should devote to a state that has voted for Republican presidential nominees since 1976 .
“ Obama has basically gotten a free ride , ” said a North Carolina Republican strategist who asked to remain anonymous so that he could talk candidly about the race .
“ He is killing McCain on the air , even running two - minute ads and new radio ads .
Meanwhile , most of what we have seen from McCain has come from national cable buys .
That is not a recipe for success in a state that no one thought we ’d be talking about this late . ”
McCain has not visited the state since June , when he met privately with evangelists Billy and Franklin Graham .
There are no immediate plans for McCain to return to North Carolina , according to Brent Woodcox , a spokesman for the state Republican Party .
" Certainly we would love to see the senator in the state , " he said .
" But with 30 days left , the campagn has to make the decision on where to go . "
Palin ’s trip Tuesday to East Carolina University in Greenville for a rally shows the campaign , which has also increased its ad buys in recent weeks , is beginning to make a stronger push in the unexpectedly competitive state .
McCain advisers said they expect North Carolina , similar to other GOP states where Obama is competitive , will go with the Republican nominee at the end of the day because the Democrat is out of step with voters .
“ One of the strategic decisions our campaign has made is to let Mr. Obama spend his resources in there to the point that we got closer to the election , ” McCain senior advisor Greg Strimple said .
“ These are states with conservative voting constituencies where you have the most liberal member of the U.S. Senate running on the top of the ticket . …
I believe he is going to have a hard time winning votes and I think it will be money he has spent in vain . ”
Obama chief strategist David Axelrod countered , “ I am happy to have them wallow in their self confidence . ”
Woodcox acknowledges that the race is competitive , but said that the GOP retains the edge because it knows how to win statewide races there .
“ The events nationally have an effect on how the race plays in North Carolina and there has been a lot of up and down since the convention , gaining momentum and losing , ” Woodcox said .
“ We may still see two or three up - and - down , game - changing moments .
I still think we can feel confident because of our past experiences . ”
But the Obama campaign , which political observers say is waging the most organized Democratic bid here since Bill Clinton ’s 1992 effort — when he fell just 20,000 votes short of victory , out of two - and - a - half - million cast — is drawing its confidence from a mix of factors .
Obama already built a statewide political network during the North Carolina Democratic primary , which he won by 14 percentage points despite a serious effort from Hillary Rodham Clinton .
North Carolina voter rolls gained more than 600,000 new registrants this year , with almost half choosing the Democratic Party and one third registered as independent .
Of the state ’s 6 million voters , 45 percent are Democratic , 32 percent are Republican and 22 percent are independent .
A surge in population over the last 20 years in the metropolitan areas has reshaped the electorate , as well .
“ They do n’t necessarily fit the old pattern , or at least the old pattern is n’t imbedded in their head , ” Guillory said .
“ And so there are a lot of persuadable voters out there , and that ’s why this state has been more competitive .
It is n’t the old South , or the more rural part of the state that has become more competitive .
It ’s these surging metropolitan areas that make this state more competitive . ”
As the momentum has shifted in Obama ’s direction over the last two weeks , state political experts are just beginning to consider the real possibility of North Carolina as decisive on Election Day .
“ Someone asked me the other day , ‘ Do you really think at the end of the day that North Carolina voters will vote for an African American ? ’
I ’ve got to tell you , I think the worse the economy gets , the less race matters , ” said Morgan Jackson , a North Carolina Democratic political consultant .
“ The economy changes the dynamics so much that people do n’t care what race , or creed , or gender you are .
If the economy is in such decay , they ’re going to want somebody who can make a change . ”
A week after Sen . John McCain stood him up to deal with the economic crisis , CBS late - night host David Letterman has n't let up on the Republican ticket .
On tonight 's " Late Show , " he went after Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin again .

6 . “ We ’re screwed ! ”

Our dear friend Larry Sechrest , professor of economics at Sul Ross University , and a long - time writer and speaker for economic liberty , died this morning ( October 30 , 2008 ) .
He was born in 1946 .
The cause was heart failure , and he died with his wife Molly by his side .
She says that it meant so much to him that only recently the Mises Institute was able to bring back his marvelous book Free Banking into print .
Of course this book , which is a prophetic attack on the dangers of the central bank , is a gift he has given the ages .
In addition , here is his scholarly article archive on MIses.org .
This past year , he delivered the Mises Memorial Lecture , which was widely read and commented on : The Anti-Capitalists : Barbarians at the Gate .
Larry earned his PhD late in life from the University of Texas , Arlington , and immediately went to work teaching .
He was person of great charity and optimism , but also courage , as was shown a few years ago when a controversy arose about some of his writing .
He had written a hilarious and wonderful essay about the trouble with today ’s students , singling out his own students as examples .
The essay appeared in Liberty Magazine and is online here .
What followed was an amazing spectacle .
The locals were very upset .
The mayor of Alpine , Texas , got involved and denounced him , as did many others .
There was even a “ support Sul Ross ” parade right there in town , with floats and posters , all to protest the words of Sechrest .
The students , the professors , the merchants , everyone , was against Sechrest – except that in private everyone knew he was right and let him know , again privately .
It was a sight that H.L. Mencken would have adored .
Then the New York Times got involved ( article here ) with a huge feature , with interviews with townspeople and many others .
Rarely does
Alpine make the national news but this one time , all thanks to Larry , who was just one man of integrity who dared tell the truth .
Throughout the ordeal , he showed what he was really made of .
He was light and funny and charming , making jokes and tossing off wry one - liners .
He did n’t have a heavy heart about it at all .
On the contrary , he seemed completely calm and entirely amused by it all .
Not once did he back down or back - pedel .
He stuck by every word in the piece , and used the occasion to explain ever more .
Behind this sweet and dear exterior , then , what we saw at work here was something very rare : moral courage .
He did n’t buckle even in the face of widespread denunciation and pressure .
In the end , of course , he came out on top .
The parades died down and people calmed down , and then everyone began to take notice : this man is completely devoted to teaching and completely dedicated to his vocation and to his students .
His writing was not motivated by spite , but by love and his profound desire for students to take their jobs as seriously as he takes his .
On a personal note , I will always be grateful to Larry for the friendship he had with my own father , who taught at Sul Ross before he died .
Larry spent many hours with my father , talking to him about politics and economics .
They were both of a type : independent intellectuals and pioneers , men who would never give up their personal freedom or integrity at any price .
They enjoyed their time together , and Larry was heartbroken when he died .
We are all similarly and deeply saddened to hear of his passing now .
But we are grateful that his intellectual gifts to the world will last and last .
He is survived by Molly ( Mary Ann ) Sechrest who has been Larry ’s great champion .
She attended the Scholar ’s Conference this past year to provide support for his lecture .
She asks that gifts in his memory go to the Mises Institute , Auburn , Alabama .
* Photo : Thomas Hannich * Aluminum hydroxide
In the acidic confines of your stomach , Al ( OH ) 3 acts as a relatively strong base , with three hydroxide ( OH - ) groups eager to hook up with any excess hydrogen ions ( H+ ) floating around .
When combined , all those Hs and Os form harmless water .
But too much aluminum can cause constipation , so Mylanta has to deploy a counterattack .
Magnesium hydroxide
You know Milk of Magnesia ?
The chalky white liquid has been sold since the 1880s as a remedy ( albeit a harsh one ) for " irregularity . "
In your gut , this ingredient neutralizes acid just like aluminum hydroxide .
But downstream , it causes you to retain water , which accumulates in the colon , building pressure until ... well , you get the idea .
With equal amounts of Al ( OH ) 3 and Mg( OH ) 3 in Mylanta , their constipating / laxative effects should cancel each other out .
In some people , however , they simply alternate .
Simethicone
An antigas agent made from polydimethylsiloxane , the polymer goop that makes Silly Putty , bathtub caulk , and breast implants possible .
When diluted with water to 50 parts per million , it reduces the surface tension of all those little gas bubbles in your belly so they can merge into one big bubble that 's more easily burped up .
Excuse you .
Butylparaben
Sometimes it's a preservative ( the probable use in Mylanta ) .
Sometimes it kills the bacterium responsible for dental plaque .
And sometimes butylparaben is absorbed into the bloodstream of lab mice , where it mimics estrogen and retards sperm production .
Perhaps Mylanta has a future as a rodent contraceptive .
Hypromellose
This stuff gained fame as " artificial tears , " an eye lubricant used in ophthalmic surgery .
In Mylanta , its plant origins are put to work :
The cellulosic lattice structure holds some of the active ingredients hostage , releasing them slowly over time .
Carboxymethylcellulose Sodium
Another cellulose product .
In libraries and museums , it 's used as a " bandage " to cover small rips in antique papers .
Here it likely serves as both a backup to hypromellose and a thickener .
Watery antacid just would n't seem as effective .
Microcrystalline Cellulose
A nearly perfect oral drug carrier , MCC is stable , inert , and tasteless , with a creamy mouthfeel .
And like simethicone , it destabilizes gas bubbles .
Just do n't tell anyone it's made from wood pulp — some people are squeamish about eating lumber .

AIG Still Paying For Luxury Suite at Madison Square Garden Meanwhile , under pressure the company will cancel over 160 events .
October 16 , 2008  -- ABC
News has learned that the beleaguered insurance company AIG is still paying hundreds of thousands of dollars for a luxury suite at Madison Square Garden , the home of the New York Knicks and Rangers .
AIG told ABCNews.com that the contract for the suite was signed in February and is for the exclusive use of its " brokers and clients . "
" We have a number of sponsorships and commitments that are all being reviewed right now , " said AIG spokesperson Peter Tulupman .
While Tulupman would not confirm how much AIG is paying for the MSG suite , a year - long contract for a " Club Suite " ranges from $ 225,000 to $ 500,000 .
Although AIG is stuck with paying for the suite , Tulupman said it will no longer be used by the company .
Meanwhile , AIG said it will immediately cancel more than 160 planned events , including a $ 750,000 conference in Las Vegas and a $ 350,000 sales conference at Sea Island , GA .
AIG CEO Edward Liddy agreed to the action after a meeting today with Attorney General of New York Andrew Cuomo , who is currently investigating AIG .
All told the costs of the planned events would have run to more than $ 8 million , according to Cuomo .
AIG has been the target of national outrage after it was revealed that the company spent $ 440,000 for a luxury retreat at a California resort just days after receiving an $ 85 billion bailout from the federal government .
ABC News has also learned of another high - priced AIG junket that took place after the company received the bailout loan .
AIG confirmed that on October 3rd , a team of AIG executives accompanied by their wives , flew on private jets to Las Vegas for an insurance conference .
" The taxpayers of this country do n't need to fund luxury expenses for business executives , " said Cuomo .
" After my meeting with Mr. Liddy , he understands the need for reform , and understands the new culture that must be brought to AIG . "

This is a little difficult to explain .
But , in the weirdly wondrous world of Washington , it all seems to make sense .
Do you remember that female CIA agent ( we 'll call her Veronica -- not her real name ; her real name is Valerie ) who had a prominent husband sent to Africa by the White House to investigate Saddam Hussein 's attempt to get uranium for the Bomb but later he wrote an op - ed article opposing the Iraq war and his wife 's alleged cover got blown in print allegedly because the White House was angry at him ?
And the couple was so concerned about their secret identity that he wrote a book and did a lot of media publicity selling it and they both posed for photos for a big shishy magazine in a convertible driving past the White House ?
And there was a veteran columnist who'd identified her in his column , which we 're not going to do because of the secrecy thingy , and the writer refused to say who leaked her name to him ?
Eventually , he did disclose who told him her name and it was n't the guy from the vice president 's office who got charged , so the trial went on nonetheless .
Well , anyway , a lot of people forget there was another newspaper reporter in on that story .
She went to jail for 85 days in 2005 because she would not identify her source for the Valerie name , which is an excellent way to become famous as a reporter because your media pals portray you as a regular Nathan Hale , who was a real spy and had only one life to give for his country but got caught and hanged by the British once because there was no 24 - hour media to generate protective publicity in those days .
So , when the reporter got out , she cracked like pretty much all do and did point the finger and her employer got unhappy and because she had been kinda officious as an editor , her so - called colleagues were leaking bad stuff about her to other reporters about her pre-war writing on Iraq 's weapons of mass destruction , which turned out to have been wrong unlike any other newspaper story in printing history .
But those leakers did n't get charged because nobody thinks she 's a CIA agent probably , so she has no cover to blow .
Eventually , her newspaper kinda fired her , but as always it was n't called that because there was probably a bunch of money involved , which is that company 's favorite way of handling trouble .
So she went on to join the Manhattan Institute as a writer - researcher .
And then Monday the fair and balanced news came out that Fox News has hired her as a commentator , which there sure are a lot of on television these days , most of them having been involved in government or politics and trouble , or all three .
In fact , that seems to be a major qualification to become a commenting entertainer .
So now she 'll be on TV a whole bunch and , when you think about it , everything turned out just fine for everyone as it somehow always seems to do in Washington scandals because everyone gets famous and makes a whole bunch of money unlike the rest of us out here watching with our mouths open .
But all that 's gonna change for sure with the next administration .
You can believe in that .
The new commentator 's name is Judith Miller .
She 's 60 .

The Internet has transformed the world -- connecting cultures , streamlining commerce , and revolutionizing communication .
Oh yeah , and turning dudes bawling about Britney into international celebrities .
Not unlike a mosquito - infested swamp , the Web has been a rich breeding ground of viral phenomena .
But no sooner do they become worldwide stars than these cicada - lived celebs cease to exist .
Or so it might seem .
I tracked down some of the Internet 's biggest overnight / one - night sensations to see what they 've been up to since their 15 minutes on the Warhol clock expired .
Some have settled into lives of quiet anonymity ; others are now making grand livings off their Net - based notoriety .
But enough talk - - ninjas , dancers , and a Turkish guy who just wants a kiss await .
Start clicking and get caught up .
Ralph Nader thinks he will be a factor in the presidential race again this year , but this time , he says , he is drawing votes from the Republican ticket .
He sparked the wrath of Democrats in 2000 , when many said his third - party candidacy cost Al Gore the election .
He strongly disputes that notion —
“ There were 19 independent variables , and each one would have put Gore in the White House ” he said in an interview today , citing the Supreme Court decision and Mr. Gore ’s loss of his home state of Tennessee among them .
And he called up The Caucus to boast that he seems to be draining votes from Senator John McCain , the Republican nominee , not Senator Barack Obama , the Democrat ’s presidential candidate .
His evidence ?
He said polls show that when his name is added to the mix , Mr. McCain ’s numbers go down .
But those polls also include Bob Barr , the Libertarian candidate , so it is not clear who is taking votes from Mr. McCain .
In addition , at least one recent poll shows that in a four - way race , Mr. Obama ’s numbers drop from where they would be in a two - way race .
Mr. Nader also pointed to the fact that the Democrats are not trying to bump him off the ballot in various states , as they tried to in 2004 .
“ Last time , the Democrats filed 24 lawsuits in 18 states in 12 weeks to get us off the ballot , ” he said , but this year , they have not filed any .
He is now on the ballot in 45 states .
It is possible that no one has sued to remove Mr. Nader because they do n’t think he will be a factor .
While he won 2.7 percent of the popular vote in 2000 , the closest election in modern history , he won just one - third of 1 percent in 2004 .
But Mr. Nader says “ it ’s a very volatile year ” and “ you ’re getting defectors from the whole spectrum of politics . ”
He is trying to get included in the presidential debates , which start Friday , and is encouraging his supporters through his Web site ( votenader.org ) to call Mr. Obama ’s campaign and say that having Mr. Nader in the debates “ could help Senator Obama challenge the corporate Republicans . ”
( The site refers elsewhere to both parties as representing corporate interests . )
The commission on debates limits participation to candidates who have the support of at least 15 percent of voters in the polls ; whatever support is being registered for Mr. Nader in a handful of states , it is nowhere near 15 percent .
Yarn is such an amazingly versatile material .
It can be made out of practically anything .
I am still amazed at what yarn can be made from , and even more amazed that it can be a fine looking , soft feeling yarn to boot .
Sea Silk yarn is one such yarn that rocks my socks off .
This yarn has been around a while , but is making its way around again .
It is a blend of Sea Cell and cotton , silk , wool , or a blend of silk and wool .
Sea Cell is a plant fiber created from seaweed and tencel or Lyocell .
The yarn comes in several blends and can come in a 70 - 30 blend or an 80 - 20 blend , with Sea Cell always the lesser number .
Seaweed is used not only for its sustainability but also for its purported health benefits ( skin protection and anti-inflammatory properties . )
It is an interesting concept , as seaweed is found in a number of cosmetics and other bath and body products .
The overall amount of seaweed per skein is small , but it adds that extra something to the fiber .
Handmaiden Fine Yarns offers Sea Silk in two blends .
Their Sea Silk comes in 70 percent silk and 30 percent Sea Cell .
They also offer Great Big Sea with 50 percent silk , 30 percent wool and 20 percent Sea Cell .
The yarn is light , shiny and soft , more suitable for lace work than hats .
The colorways are down right dreamy , with variegates reminiscent of slow sunsets on the water and bright solids , like the sun glinting off of tide pools .
They are relaxing and brilliant all at the same time .

Yes , Virginia , there was a Santa Claus .
He was making $ 175 an hour greeting children at Tysons Corner Center before he was suddenly fired .
He did what any self - respecting 21st - century Santa would do :
He lawyered up and hired a public relations firm to mount a campaign to get his job back .
In an attempt to keep his lucrative 18 - year gig , veteran elf Michael Graham hired an attorney , Pamela Deese of Arent Fox in the District , and a public relations firm , Brotman Winter Fried Communications of Falls Church .
Tysons Corner has a new contract with World Wide Photography , which will supply a new Santa for the shopping center .
The Cypress , Texas , company respects Mr. Graham for his Santa skills but did not think his asking price was fair .
“ I have nothing but positive things to say about him , ” said Steve Hardin , senior partner with World Wide Photography .
“ He ’s a wonderful person and a wonderful Santa , but $ 175 an hour to play Santa ? ”
That sum is about 10 times the going rate , he said .
“ I ’ve seen probably 12 or 14 different photographers so it was never an issue that I would be leaving any time soon , ” Mr. Graham said .
“ In 2006 , they approached me to extend my contract until 2012 , so I thought I was set . ”
Mr. Graham , who in real life is a carpenter from Tennessee , thinks Tysons Corner shoppers have a lot to lose from this personnel change .
“ After 18 years of visiting with them , people start to know who you are , ” said Mr. Graham .
“ You feel like a part of their family .
People come as far away as California so the pictures look the same and there is consistency to show the children growing up . ”
Mr. Graham said he is losing much more than the money .
“ The emotional portion of it is such a big benefit to me because there is such a magical time in having a child walk toward you in awe and want to sit on your lap , ” Mr. Graham said .
“ It makes me keep wanting to come back year after year . ”
Other Santas expressed solidarity with their fellow elf .
“ It ’s not very nice , naughty actually , that photo companies are basically forcing people out and just saying goodbye , ” said Nicholas Trolli , president of the Amalgamated Order of Real Bearded Santas .
“ There may be families who will be very disappointed , who bring children back year after year and now find a different person playing that role . ”
Not only does Mr. Graham want his job back , but he also is demanding a down payment that was due Oct. 1 — before he was so unceremoniously dumped .
But his attorney called the termination more of a moral breach than anything else .
“ Given his personality , Santa is something of a trusting soul , ” Miss Deese said .
“ He never understood that a 10 - year agreement , which all agree he has performed successfully , could be terminated by the mall without cause on short notice . ”
Mr. Graham is now worried that he will not be able to find other work , because most shopping centers have already booked the talent for their Christmas attractions .
The shopping mall defended its move as a business decision that did not reflect on Mr. Graham ’s performance .
“ We did follow normal , legal protocol in notifying Mr. Graham of our change in direction , ” said Allison Fischer , spokeswoman for Tysons Corner Center .
“ That decision was made so we could make a better experience and a more magical experience for the children and our shoppers . ”
Regardless of how this dispute is resolved , Miss Fischer said , discretion is paramount .
“ It is our first priority above all else to try to keep this behind the scenes , not for our own benefit but to try to preserve the children ’s belief in Santa , ” Miss Fischer said .
“ I have a 2 - year - old and when I look at the experience my child will have with Santa this year , we want to make it truly magical and do the best we can . ”
Tysons is making a variety of changes to the Santa attraction this year , devoting more space to its display and creating a pager system so parents and children will not have to wait in line for hours before getting to see Santa .
So Santa Claus is still coming to town .
It appears , however , that for the first time in 18 years , he will look a little different at Tysons Corner Center .

Bayes , Moravec and the LHC : Quantum Suicide , Subjective Probability and Conspiracies
The recent transformer trouble at the LHC has got many commenters to remember the somewhat playful scenario in Hans Moravec 's Mind Children ( 1988 ) : a new accelerator is about to be tested when it suffers a fault ( a capacitor blows , say ) .
After fixing it , another fault ( a power outage ) stops the testing .
Then a third fault , completely independent of the others .
Every time it is about to turn on something happens that prevents it from being used .
Eventually some scientists realize that sufficiently high energy collisions would produce a vacuum collapse , destroying the universe .
Hence the only observable outcome of the experiment occurs when the accelerator fails , all other branches in the many - worlds universe are now empty .
( This then leads up to a fun discussion on quantum suicide computation )
As Eliezer and other bright people realize , one transformer breaking before even the main experiments is not much evidence .
But how much evidence ( in the form of accidents stopping big accelerators ) would it take to buy the anthropic explanation above ?
Here is a quick Bayesian argument :
Let D be that the accelerator is dangerous , N be that N accidents have happened so far .
P( D|N ) = P( N|D ) P( D ) / P( N ) = P( N|D ) P( D ) / [ P( N|D ) P( D ) + P( N| -D ) P( - D ) ]
Since P( N|D ) =1 by assumption we get
P( D|N ) =P( D ) / [ P( D ) + P( N| - D ) ( 1 - P( D ) ) ]
Let X=P ( D ) be our prior probability that high energy physics is risky in this way , and Y= P ( 1| - D ) be the probability that one accident happen in the non-dangerous case .
We also assume the accidents are uncorrelated , so P ( N| - D ) =Y^N .
Then we get
P( D|N ) =X/ [ X + ( 1 - X ) Y^N ]
Below is a plot for N=1 and another one for N=10 :
I think Y can safely be assumed to be pretty big , perhaps ~ 1/2 or even more .
X depends on your general faith in past theoretical papers showing the safety of accelerators .
In particular , I think Hut , P. and M. J. Rees ( 1983 ) .
" How Stable Is Our Vacuum . " Nature 302( 5908 ) : 508-509 makes a very solid argument against vacuum decay ( especially when combined with Tegmark , M. and N. Bostrom ( 2005 ) .
" Is a doomsday catastrophe likely ? " Nature 438( 7069 ) : 754-754 ) , so X < 10 - 9 .
Plugging in N=1,X=10 - 9 and Y=0.5 gives us P ( D|N ) =2*10 - 9 .
Wow !
A doubling of the estimate , all because of a transformer .
Claiming the closure of the SSC is another datapoint would bring up the chance to 4 chances in a billion .
In fact , I think this is a gross overestimate because the X above is the risk per year ; we did n't even get one second of collisions .
If the risk is actually on the order of one disaster per year , we should expect to run the accelerator for about half a year before something happens preventing the collision .
If the risk is much higher , then we should expect an earlier shut - down .
So given that we got one or two early shut - downs , we should ( if we believe they were due to branch - pruning ) think the risk is much higher , say about 31 million times higher ( number of seconds in a year ) or more .
But if we were to live in such a dangerous universe where every TeV interaction had a decent chance of destroying its future lightcone , then the Tegmark and Bostrom argument suggests that we are in a really unusual position .
So getting a consistent and likely situation is hard if you think disaster is likely .
So , how many accidents would be needed to make me think there was something to the disaster possibility ?
Using the above estimates , I find P ( D|20 ) =0.001 and and P ( D|30 ) =0.52 .
So if about 30 uncorrelated , random major events in turn prevent starting the LHC , I would have cause to start thinking there was something to the risk .
However , the likelihood of some prankster or anti-LHC conspiracy trying to trip me or the LHC people up seems to be larger than one chance in a billion per year .
This would add an extra term to the equation , giving us P ( D|N ) =X / [ X + ( 1 - X ) ( Y^N + Z ) ] where Z is the probability of foul play .
Adding just one chance in a billion reduces the P( D|30 ) estimate to 0.34 , which is still pretty big .
If it is one chance in 100 million it becomes 0.08 , and one chance in 10 million gives 0.01 .
However , I think the chance for the existence of a conspiracy able to successfully cause 30 LHC shutdowns in a row ( without anybody finding any evidence ) is hardly on the order of one in 10 million .
In the unlikely case we actually get a high P ( D ) estimate , it might seem we have got a way of doing quantum suicide computing ( connect it to a computer trying random solutions , destroy the universe if the wrong one is found , reap benefits in all remaining universes ) or even terrorism prevention ( automatically destroy all universes where terrorist attacks occur , to the surviving observers it will look like terrorism magically has ceased ) .
Unfortunately Y is likely pretty big .
We should hence expect to see a lot of universes where the LHC simply fails because of the usual engineering problems , and leaves us with the wrong solution or the aftermath of terrorism .
Quantum suicide computing / omnipotence requires absurdly reliable equipment .

So much for suspending the campaign .
And John McCain could n’t just lie about putting America first and suspending his campaign , when he did no such thing , but now Sarah Palin is campaigning and doing a press event at Ground Zero .
Yes , using Ground Zero as a press event , and doing it on the day that supposedly the McCain campaign has suspended their campaign .
I ’d say it takes real chutzpah , but when you see our next post , you wo n’t want to be using any Yiddish to describe Sarah Palin ever again .
Doctors Try to Determine Why 11 - Month - Old Baby 's Weight Skyrocketed to 62 Pounds
Friday , August 29 , 2008
ADVERTISEMENT
South American doctors are trying to find out the reason behind the hefty weight of an 11 - month - old baby .
The baby weighs nearly 62 pounds , which is the average weight of an 8 - year - old in Colombia , where he was born .
The baby 's mother , Milena Orosco de Agudelo , said he began to balloon when he was just 2 months old .
" He had some test done and the results show that he has a thyroid malfunction , " said Orosco .
But the doctors are still uncertain .
" The baby will have tests done to see if he 's obese or we 're dealing with hypothyroidism , " said doctor David Dias of the Barranquilla Pediatric Hospital in Colombia .
Hypothyroidism is most commonly a result of an autoimmune condition known as Hashimoto 's thyroiditis , in which the body 's own immune cells attack and destroy the thyroid gland .
Symptoms include fatigue and weight gain .
The normal weight for a boy his age is between 13 and 16 pounds .

Microsoft may have announced plans yesterday to shut down Ensemble Studios when Halo Wars ships , but Age of Empires fans are told not to worry !
" I want to reassure you that Microsoft will still own the Age of Empires intellectual property , " Games for Windows boss Kevin Unangst wrote on Gamerscoreblog overnight .
So that 's alright then .
" As a company , we 're very excited about the future potential for Age of Empires , and as a PC gamer I 'm looking forward to what that future holds .
Stay tuned , " he concluded .
Microsoft yesterday said its decision to close down Ensemble Studios , which it bought in 2001 on the strength of the PC Age of Empires series , was " a fiscally - rooted decision that keeps [ Microsoft Game Studios ] on its growth path " .
The Xbox corporation said it would try and re-home as many jobless Ensemble veterans as possible and that the Dallas dev's " leadership team " would form a new studio to provide ongoing support for Halo Wars and work on other MGS titles .
ST . PAUL , Minnesota ( CNN ) -- Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin introduced herself to the world Wednesday by calling herself a " hockey mom " and then asking what the difference was between a hockey mom and a pit bull .
Sarah Palin ripped Barack Obama and said she 's ready for the " challenge of a tough fight . " more photos »
" Lipstick , " the Republican vice presidential nominee said .
She promptly went on to prove the point , tearing into Democratic presidential nominee Barack Obama as two - faced , inexperienced and intoxicated by the sound of his own voice .
" This is a man who can give an entire speech about the wars America is fighting and never use the word ' victory ' except when he 's talking about his own campaign , " she said .
She slammed Obama for " saying one thing in Scranton and another in San Francisco , " argued that he had written two memoirs but never authored a major piece of legislation and asked what he would do " when those Styrofoam Greek columns are hauled back to some studio lot , " a reference to the stage where Obama gave his acceptance speech last week .
Watch Palin attack Obama »
Thousands of delegates at the party conference roared their approval at Palin 's speech , bursting into chants of " Sarah ! Sarah ! " and " Zero ! Zero , " the amount of executive experience Republicans say Obama has accumulated .

" I think Sarah Palin can do a one - two punch better than Muhammad Ali , " Kansas state Sen.
Karin Brownlee said after the speech .
" And I think she delivered it just square on the opponents ' face .
I think she has energized the Republican Party like we have n't seen in a long time . "

Conventioneers waved banners reading " Palin Power " and " Hockey moms for Palin . "
Delegates from her home state of Alaska were spotted wearing buttons calling her " the hottest VP from the coolest state . "
" I love those hockey moms , " she said .
Palin began with a lengthy , minutes - long standing ovation as she accepted the Republican Party 's nomination for vice president .
It marked the first time in history that a woman has taken the stage as the GOP vice presidential pick .
" I accept the challenge of a tough fight , " said the woman nicknamed " Sarah Barracuda . "
The Obama campaign dismissed Palin 's speech as " well - delivered " but said it was " written by George Bush 's speechwriter and sounds exactly like the same divisive , partisan attacks we 've heard from George Bush for the last eight years . "

Bush aide Matthew Scully was largely responsible for the speech .
Palin's opposite number , Democratic vice presidential nominee Joe Biden , praised her speech as " incredibly well crafted and delivered , " but said Palin 's rhetoric lacked substance .
" I did n't hear the phrase ' middle class . '
I did n't hear a single word about health care .
I did n't hear a single word about helping people get to college , " Biden , a U.S. senator from Delaware , told CNN's " American Morning " on Thursday .
" They do n't have a single answer [ for ] how to dig us out of the hole we 've been dug into the last eight years , " Biden added .
Palin , whose son is to deploy to Iraq soon , praised her running mate John McCain as a man who has met grave challenges and " knows how tough fights are won . "
She criticized Obama 's stance on Iraq , saying he " wants to forfeit " while victory is " finally in sight . "
Watch Palin say McCain has fought for change his entire life »
She praised McCain , a decorated war hero , as a " true profile in courage . "
" In politics , there are some candidates who use change to promote their careers .
And then there are those , like John McCain , who use their careers to promote change , " she said .
Throughout the speech , it was clear the first - term governor of Alaska had won over the hearts of the crowd .
" What exactly is our opponent 's plan ?
What does he actually seek to accomplish after he 's done turning back the waters and healing the planet ?
The answer is to make the government bigger and take more of your money . "
Palin , the former mayor of Wasilla , Alaska , contrasted her résumé as a former mayor of a small town with that of Obama .
" I guess a small - town mayor is sort of like a ' community organizer , ' except that you have actual responsibilities . "
Palin presented herself as both a mother and as an outside - the - Beltway reformer in the McCain mold , saying she " took on the old politics as usual in Juneau " and " stood up to the special interests , the lobbyists , big oil companies , and the good ol ' boys network . "
She tied oil , a major industry in her home state of Alaska , to foreign policy and national security on a night when convention delegates repeatedly burst into chants of " Drill now , baby , drill now ! "
She insisted that the United States seek " energy independence , " including through more drilling , in the face of threats as diverse as hurricanes in the Gulf and Russian military power in the Caucasus .

Palin , whose youngest child has Down syndrome , also promised that families of special needs children will have " a friend and advocate in the White House . "
At the end of the speech , McCain came on stage amid raucous cheers and said , " Do n't you think we made the right choice for the next vice president of the United States ? "
Watch McCain take stage , get crowd fired up »
Just before Palin took center stage , former New York Mayor Rudy Giuliani warmed up the crowd by continuing the barrage on Obama , calling him a " celebrity senator " with no leadership experience .
" He 's never had to lead people in crisis , " Giuliani said .
" This is not a personal attack ; it 's a statement of fact .
Barack Obama has never led anything .
Nothing .
Nada . "
" The choice in this election comes down to substance over style .
John McCain has been tested .
Barack Obama has not .
Tough times require strong leadership , and this is no time for on - the - job training . "
His speech was the third of the evening by former GOP presidential candidates who pumped up the Republican faithful ahead of Palin .
Former Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee got the crowd cheering when he ripped Obama for looking to Europe for ways to change America .
" Barack Obama 's excellent adventure to Europe took his campaign for change to hundreds of thousands of people who do n't even vote or pay taxes here , " he said .
" The fact is , most Americans do n't want more government ; they want a lot less . "
Huckabee said McCain represents small government and has ideas for change that will make the nation 's economy better .
He added that McCain is " a man with the character and stubborn kind of integrity that I want in a president . "
Huckabee took a jab at the " elite media " for " unifying the Republican Party and all of America " in support of McCain and Palin .
" The reporting of the past few days has proven tackier than a costume change at a Madonna concert , " Huckabee said .
Former Massachusetts Gov. Mitt Romney blasted " liberal Washington , " saying McCain is a " prescription for every American who wants change in Washington . "
He added that it 's time to take a " Weedwhacker " to excessive regulation and to impose lower taxes and to stop big - government spending .
" Throw out the big - government liberals and elect John McCain , " Romney said .
" We need change , all right : change from a liberal Washington to a conservative Washington . "
He also threw his support behind Palin , saying the McCain - Palin ticket " will keep America as it has always been : the hope of the world . "
" We will never allow America to retreat in the face of evil extremism , " Romney said .
The Republican Party officially nominated McCain for president at the convention Wednesday .
McCain will give a speech accepting the nomination Thursday night .
Police said two protesters were removed during Palin 's speech .
They said they were members of the anti-war group Code Pink .
A representative for the Joint Information Center said the two women were escorted by law enforcement officers from the Xcel Center for heckling .
They stood and yelled off to the side of the podium during Palin 's speech .
They were not charged and have been " sent on their way , " this representative said .
CNN 's Kristi Keck , Dana Bash , Ed Hornick , Paul Steinhauser and Scott J. Anderson contributed to this report .

Armchair adventurers with high - speed Internet have a new window into the natural world .
National Geographic has added an underwater WildCam to its portfolio that includes Mashatu Game Reserve in Botswana and others that allow viewers to watch the activities of grizzlies , polar bears and other charismatic megafauna .
The new camera pans the undersea world 66 feet below the surface at Glover 's Reef , a World Heritage Site on the barrier reef off the Central American country of Belize .
Think of it as one of those video fish tanks , but the fish are real .
Web watchers can see wild marine life swim past in real time -- at least during daylight hours .
The reef has crystal - clear waters , colorful reef fish and the hypnotic sashaying of sea fans and soft corals .
Glover 's Reef is also designated a marine reserve -- a special place to be highlighted by Google 's long - anticipated rollout of interactive views of protected areas and other ocean mapping as part of Google Earth .
" Both of these are two new , really cool tools that will make the oceans much more widely accessible , " said Jane Lubchenco , a marine ecologist at Oregon State University .
The idea is to help people appreciate these special places , she said , so they 'll want to preserve them .
And in this case , you do n't need to get certified for scuba diving or even get wet .

As we head towards the PDC later this month , Microsoft today pre-announced some of the things you can expect to see there .
To meet the evolving needs of service - oriented applications , Microsoft is extending the capabilities of Windows Server , by adding a set of capabilities , " Dublin " , aimed at making it easier to deploy , manage and monitor WF / WCF applications .
For developers creating WF - based solutions , this is great news , because it means you will get an enterprise - grade runtime environment to host your WCF / WF .
Prior to this , the only WF host from Microsoft was MOSS , you would have had to write your own host , which is a non-trivial task .
Now , Microsoft has solved all those hard problems for you .
If you 're a BizTalk developer , then rest assured that you will get a host too that will run in this platform , and that all your investments are protected , BizTalk Server 2009 and the roadmap was announced recently , I blogged about it here .
I 'm also excited about the enhancements to WF : workflows become declarative , and are XAML - based .
You get a new flowchart workflow style .
This is all building towards the future , and gets even more interesting with the Oslo modeling platform .
I 'll have a lot more to say about that later , starting after PDC .
I 'd also like to clarify something that may be , or could become , a source of confusion for you .
There has been a subtle morphing recently of what the code name " Oslo " means .
When there was just the vision , " Oslo " was used to refer to the entire spectrum of technologies that needed to be built to support the vision .
Now that we are further along in the lifecycle , and bits are becoming real , those bits are naturally migrating towards what will ultimately be their ship vehicles .
You can see some of that now , with the enhancements to WF / WCF that will be in .NET 4.0 , and the process server capabilities that will be in the OS : these are things that used to be part of what " Oslo " was .
So to be clear , when we say " Oslo " today , we are now referring ONLY to Microsoft 's modeling platform .
I like this shift , and it makes a lot of sense , although I find myself saying " Oslo and related technologies " a lot now when I refer to the whole vision .
Some early bits will be made available to PDC attendees , with betas to follow some time in the future .
You can get an overview here .
Steven Martin , Senior Director of Product Management in Microsoft's Connected Systems Division ( CSD ) , wrote about it this morning here .
We 're in for an exciting ride folks , this is just the start ....
Liberals Storm GOP Hotels in St. Paul
Created : September 02 , 2008 15:03 | Last updated : July 31 , 2020 00:00
As Republican delegates gather in St. Paul this week , two liberal groups are storming their hotels .
The Campaign for America ’s Future lays out its advertising campaign :
When Republican delegates check - in to their hotel rooms in St. Paul this week , they will receive a “ thank you ” message on their televisions .
An ad called “ Thanks For The Memories , ” produced by Campaign for America ’s Future , will broadcast unforgettable moments from the last eight years that conservatives wish the country would forget .
With Hurricane Gustav on the nation ’s mind , the ad reminds viewers of the bungled response to Hurricane Katrina .
It also highlights skyrocketing gas prices , soaring home foreclosures , the infamous “ mission accomplished ” banner …
The Campaign for America ’s Future is a major progressive organization , and this effort is designed not only to cross enemy lines , but draw media attention ( like this ! ) and fire up liberal supporters .
The effort has already raised thousands online .
Another liberal group , however , with far less funding and no headquarters , is also running ads in St.
Paul this week .
Many activists who criticized Sen. Barack Obama for changing his vote on surveillance have organized an ad campaign targeting the Republican National Convention .
Jon Pincus , who helps organize the “ Get FISA Right ” group — to reform the Federal Intelligence Surveillance Act — recently emailed me about their goals .
( We came into contact online while both working against the FISA Amendment Act . )
Pincus says civil - liberties activists can pivot from criticizing Obama to helping him beat McCain — who is worse on these issues :
We believe we ’re much more likely to get meaningful reform with an Obama administration … from a timing perspective , the man ’s got an election to win ; as Obama supporters , it ’s important for us to criticize his opponent as well as him .
We think that [ running ads during the RNC ] is an effective way to take up Obama on his invitation to continue to engage in a dialogue — while simultaneously getting publicity for the FISA issue and starting to lay the groundwork for the battle next year .
One homemade ad invites Republicans to join a “ new movement that puts the Constitution above politics . ”
Like the other effort , the ultimate goal is to leverage a targeted ad buy to reach voters far outside St. Paul
Witches Begone ! / Sarah Palin was de-witched by nutball pastor ?
What a shame
Here 's one way to make a small child 's eyes go wide in creepyfun terror : Mention the existence of witches .
Real ones .
Living ones .
Witches living and existing right over there , just off the highway , in sad eerie - looking ramshackle hovels and trailers and barns not a mere few hundred yards from your speeding car , right up there in the parts of rural 1970s Idaho my family would pass through on the way to our little getaway lake cabin up north , deep in the misty , foggy , sunbaked summerland memories of my childhood .
Oh yes , the witches were there all right .
At least , my parents sometimes hinted that they were , relating , as we zipped by these sweet - but - gloomy little towns , tallish tales of mysterious disappearances and unsolved murders and maybe a mutilated farm animal or two , and then they 'd chuckle and wink to each other as my sisters and I stared out the windows , equal parts enchanted and suspicious and petrified .
Of course , to my 8 - year - old imagination , these Podunk witches were at once terrifically real , and yet somehow , given how they lived in these weatherbeaten tobacco - spit burgs , also sort of tacky , like a cross between the Blair Witch and an emphysemic Wal - Mart greeter -- gaunt harridans in bad housedresses who kept small oozing things in jars and ate live rabbits and picked their six remaining teeth with the bones of small children and watched too much daytime TV and chain - smoked Winston menthols .
Makes me a little sad , then , that trophy VP nominee Sarah " I ( Heart ) Gibberish " Palin apparently had herself anointed by a true - blue witch - hunter nutball of a pastor , a Kenyan priest name of Thomas Muthee , up at her Wasilla church a few years back , just before becoming governor .
Is n't that sweet ?
Did you see the infamous grainy YouTube video ?
Did you read the disquieting little sidebar story about Muthee and his now - infamous witch huntin ' treks down to Kenya , like that time he stormed into a village and formed an angry mob to drive out an old woman by the name of " Mama Jane " who was supposedly causing illness and traffic accidents and really crappy Wi-Fi connections at the local Starbucks ?
Charming .
Have you read , furthermore , about Palin 's adorable Pentecostal church where Muthee preached , where they like to speak in tongues and lick the skins of serpents and watch NASCAR while shooting moose from the backs of animatronic dinosaurs adorned with " Jesus is My Co- Pilot " bumper stickers ?
( Note : possible slight exaggeration .
But not by much . )
It 's all sorts of Disney - on - acid fun .
As for Palin , turns out Muthee laid on some hands , delivered a garbled serpents n' brimstone prayer designed not merely to help her leap from Mayor of Nowheresville to perky gubernatorial fireplug , only to later become , thanks to McCain 's appalling judgment , the most insulting caricature of female empowerment in modern history who , as the VP debate painfully revealed , still knows not a single substantive thing about American domestic or foreign policy , but also to protect her from that same silly / terrifying witchcraft I imagined in my youth .
So I 'm sad , but not necessarily because Palin credits Muthee , who likes to ramble about " spiritual warfare " and " the python spirits , " with helping her win the governorship , or even that Palin doubtlessly called upon those same kooky Wasilla extremists to protect her from demonic forces far more horrifying than witches -- like , say , condoms , or gay people , or Charles Darwin .
No , mostly I 'm a bit sad because the real , true , lovely witches I now know are nothing like Palin and her clan imagine , and she might never know it -- or , better yet , get a chance to become one herself .
See , not only have I happily outgrown my 8 - year - old 's fear and ignorance and blind dependence on others -- priests , Bibles , departments of Homeland Security -- to tell me what I should be afraid of , or which gods I must kneel before , or how blessed I will be if I only turn off my brain and anesthetize my soul and send in my cash , but I 've also learned a thing or two about paganism , Wicca , witchcraftery -- you know , all those juicy beliefs and practices that still give the evangelical set , as the late DFW might say , the howling fantods .
Is it worth setting the record straight ?
Pointing out how true ' n ' deep witchcraftery has nothing to do with evil or Satan or excessive black eyeliner or sacrificing newborn babies while listening to Ministry and smoking cloves ?
That those who 've taken up this most ancient and potent of callings actually study their enchanted craft for years and know more about , say , the cycles of the moon and the body and the rhythms of the planet than Sarah Palin 's most secretest pagan fever dream could ever conjure ?
Really , the irony of this whole affair is just too tasty to pass up .
Because real witches are , of course , all about self - determination , complete spiritual freedom , and are often practiced in the innate magic of the earth , the body , the self .
Most follow no particular deity or dogma , though that 's entirely optional ( you can be a witch and a Christian , for example ) .
Truth is , it 's too bad Palin 's not a witch herself .
She 'd be so much more interesting .
And , you know , useful .
Hell , I know a number of happy , accomplished , practicing witches at work and play in the normal world right this very minute , running errands and playing with their kids and texting their boyfriends , not a single one of whom is currently indulging in a ritualistic blood - drenched sex orgy at the feet of Lucifer .
Wait , let me check Facebook ... nope , all normal .
As for the Wiccans , well , those witches are , of course , even more about nature and fertility and earthly ritual , a deep , life - affirming reverence for the cycles of life , for protecting the environment and celebrating the body , and it's all wrapped in a rather limitless chthonic self - determination and therapeutic ritual magick that 's essentially the ideological opposite of what evangelical Christianity often wallows in .
I mean , is it any wonder they 're so terrified ?
Ah , but Muthee and his clan are probably right about one thing :
It 's extremely likely that most Wiccans and witches of the world are , right this moment , holding all sorts of ceremonies and casting all sorts of spells against the idea of a Palinocracy , working hard to conjure great heaps of positive , divinely feminine energy so as to thwart the rise to power of this imposter female .
Makes perfect sense , really .
After all , as any real witch knows , it 's when you give the real demons of the world -- fear , intolerance , dogma , narrow - mindedness , ignorance , lack of choice , religious fanaticism -- too much sway , well , that 's when all hell breaks loose .

As we emerge from Labor Day , college students are gathering back on campuses not only to start the fall semester , but also , in some cases , to vote for the first time in a presidential election .
There is no bigger issue on campuses these days than environment / energy .
Going into this election , I thought that  for the first time  we would have a choice between two “ green ” candidates .
That view is no longer operative  and college students ( and everyone else ) need to understand that .
With his choice of Sarah Palin  the Alaska governor who has advocated drilling in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge and does not believe mankind is playing any role in climate change  for vice president , John McCain has completed his makeover from the greenest Republican to run for president to just another representative of big oil .
Given the fact that Senator McCain deliberately avoided voting on all eight attempts to pass a bill extending the vital tax credits and production subsidies to expand our wind and solar industries , and given his support for lowering the gasoline tax in a reckless giveaway that would only promote more gasoline consumption and intensify our addiction to oil , and given his desire to make more oil - drilling , not innovation around renewable energy , the centerpiece of his energy policy  in an effort to mislead voters that support for drilling today would translate into lower prices at the pump today  McCain has forfeited any claim to be a green candidate .
So please , students , when McCain comes to your campus and flashes a few posters of wind turbines and solar panels , ask him why he has been AWOL when it came to Congress supporting these new technologies .

I have mixed feelings about the new Stadium , but it really is starting to look great .
I 'm sure when it 's finished the outside will be beautiful , but it 's the inside , and that stupid restaurant in center field , that I 'm worried about .
The restaurant reminds me of a cross between Rogers Centre , and US Cellular .
In fact , a lot of the interior reminds me of US Cellular .
One of the things that make Yankee Stadium , YANKEE STADIUM , is how close the upper deck is to the field .
Players say it feels like the fans are right on top of you .
This part of the Yankees home field advantage will be lost forever in the new Stadium .
The upper deck will be pushed back in the new place for better sight lines ... great .
Here is a profile comparison of the current and future Yankee Stadiums :
I hope I 'm wrong and they build the greatest stadium in the world , because that 's what it 's going to be replacing .
Tommy Lee To Go Off - Grid , Install Fake Lawn

The current article you are reading does not reflect the views of the current editors and contributors of the new Ecorazzi
Even though filming for Planet Green ’s new show Battleground Earth has wrapped , it seems that rocker Tommy Lee is pretty keen to carry the green banner beyond the camera lens .
What greater result could we possibly hope for ?
We mentioned earlier that the 45 - year - old musician was transitioning to a vegetarian lifestyle , but now he ’s shed a bit more light on what ’s happening on the homefront as well .
“ I ’ve learned so much .
I ’m about to go solar and get totally off the grid , ” he recently told Blender Magazine .
“ All the grass on my property is going to be replaced – this s**t , I ’m telling you , it does n’t smell , but it looks and feels exactly like real grass . ”
“ No watering , no pesticides or fertilizers .
It ’s insane . ”
Taking a look at aerial photographs of Tommy ’s house , it looks like that fake grass will save a great deal of water .
The only thing I ’m suspect of is the size of the array that will be needed to take his almost 9,000 square - foot home completely off - grid .
I ’m not saying it ca n’t be done , but it ’s going to be a sizeable investment .
At least he ’s got the roof space .
Colin Powell danced and sang to Olu Maintain 's hit Yahoozee
Ex -US Secretary of State Colin Powell has joined a hip - hop band on stage in London to dance and sing in a celebration of African culture .
America 's former top diplomat took centre stage along with Nigerian performer Olu Maintain , who sang his hit Yahoozee .
It is not clear if Mr Powell was aware that the song was about Nigeria 's notorious internet fraudsters .
The song tells of an easy - money lifestyle of women , cars and alcohol .
The scammers , known as " yahoo yahoo boys " make money by advance fee fraud , known as " 419 " after the legal statute that outlaws it .
Some people came into the world to work , some people came into the world to live large
Yahoozee lyrics Nduka Obaigbena , publisher of Nigeria 's This Day newspaper which sponsored the Africa Rising Festival in London , said it was a misunderstanding .
" Mr Powell could not have been aware of the lyrics of the song , " he told the BBC .
The former general had been addressing the crowd at the Royal Albert Hall when the musicians came on stage .
" It would have been rude for him to have refused , " he said .
Olu Maintain - real name Olumide Edwards Adegbolu - says his song is a satire , deriding " yahoo - yahoo " culture , not glorifying it .
" The message of the song is that if you want the lifestyle of drink cars and women you have to work hard , hustle means work , not cheat , " he told the BBC .
' Africa 's turn '
Mr Powell told the audience his own black identity mattered as much as ever and that Africa , with hard work and foreign investment , could prosper like Asia and Eastern Europe .
It was a brilliant mix of western and African music and fashion and the whole atmosphere was just one big party .
Kenneth Hilton , who attended the event
' My night at Royal Albert Hall ' " I stand before you tonight as an African - American , " Mr Powell said .
" Many people have said to me you became secretary of state of the USA , is it still necessary to say that you are an African - American or that you are black , and I say , yes , so that we can remind our children .
" It took a lot of people struggling to bring me to this point in history .
I did n't just drop out of the sky , people came from my continent in chains . "
A lot of wrongs had been done to Africa by Western powers faced with " an iron curtain and a bamboo curtain " , he said in an apparent reference to the USSR and communist China .
These barriers had fallen , he argued .
" Asia is expanding , it created jobs for people , and Eastern Europeans are doing the same ... it 's now Africa 's turn . "
Wads of cash
But the theme of the song he was dancing to is quite different .
The Nigerian smash hit , sung in Yoruba and pidgin by Olu Maintain is about people spending money they made from US fraud victims .
The BBC's Andrew Walker in Abuja says the track is also accompanied by a dance move popular in Nigerian clubs that involves hand movements that represent stacking up wads of dollar bills .
" Some people came into the world to work , some people came into the world to live large , " the song says .
Colin Powell , a distinguished former military commander , served as US secretary of state during the first term of the Bush administration , from 2001 to 2005 .

What are these ?
One of the more sordid and long - running stories in Anglo - American colonial history –- that of Diego Garcia , the chief island of the Chagos Archipelago in the Indian Ocean –- reared its ugly head again on Friday when the UK ’s all - party foreign affairs committee announced plans to investigate long - standing allegations that the CIA has , since 2002 , held and interrogated al - Qaeda suspects at a secret prison on the island .
The shameful tale of Diego Garcia began in 1961 , when it was marked out by the US military as a crucial geopolitical base .
Ignoring the fact that 2,000 people already lived there , and that the island –- a British colony since the fall of Napoleon –- had been settled in the late 18th century by French coconut planters , who shipped in African - and Indian - born labourers from Mauritius , establishing what John Pilger called “ a gentle Creole nation with thriving villages , a school , a hospital , a church , a prison , a railway , docks , a copra plantation , ” the Labour government of Harold Wilson conspired with the administrations of Lyndon Johnson and Richard Nixon to “ sweep ” and “ sanitize ” the islands ( the words come from American documents that were later declassified ) .
Although many islanders traced their ancestry back five generations , a British Foreign Office official wrote in 1966 that the government ’s aim was “ to convert all the existing residents … into short - term , temporary residents , ” so that they could be exiled to Mauritius .
Having removed the “ Tarzans or Men Fridays , ” as another British memo described the inhabitants , the British effectively ceded control of the islands to the Americans , who established a base on Diego Garcia , which , over the years , has become known as “ Camp Justice , ” complete with “ over 2,000 troops , anchorage for 30 warships , a nuclear dump , a satellite spy station , shopping malls , bars and a golf course . ”
So thoroughly were the islands cleared –- and so stealthy the procedure –- that in the 1970s the British Ministry of Defence had the effrontery to insist , “ There is nothing in our files about a population and an evacuation . ”
Diego Garcia ’s former residents in happier times .
Suffering in exile , the Chagos islanders have struggled in vain to secure the right to return to their ancestral home , winning a stunning victory in the High Court in 2000 , which ruled their expulsion illegal , but then suffering a setback in 2003 , when , with typically high - handed authoritarianism , Tony Blair invoked an ancient and archaic “ royal prerogative ” to strike down their claims once more .
Although the appeal court reversed this decision in May 2006 , ruling that the islanders ’ right to return was “ one of the most fundamental liberties known to human beings , ” it remains to be seen how this belated judicial recognition of their rights can be squared with the Americans ’ insistence that their military - industrial archipelago must remain unsullied by outsiders .
In their resistance to the islanders ’ claims , Blair and the Foreign Office were clearly protecting the interests of their American allies , for whom the geopolitical importance of Diego Garcia as a strategic base had recently been augmented by its use –- and the use of some of the ships moored there –- as fabulously remote offshore prisons in which to hold and interrogate “ high - value ” al - Qaeda suspects .
The suspicion , which the foreign affairs committee has pledged to investigate , is that on Diego Garcia the Americans found a far more compliant partner in torture –- the British government –- than they found in most other locations chosen for secret CIA prisons .
According to various reports over the years , the Americans ’ other partners in the offshore torture game –- Thailand , Poland and Rumania , for example –- were only prepared to be paid off for a while before they got cold feet and sent the CIA packing .
Whether the committee will probe deeply or not remains to be seen .
The British - based legal charity Reprieve , which has called for such an investigation for some time , has already told the committee in a submission that it believes that the British government is “ potentially systematically complicit in the most serious crimes against humanity of disappearance , torture and prolonged incommunicado detention . ”
Clive Stafford Smith , Reprieve ’s legal director , told the Guardian that he is “ absolutely and categorically certain ” that prisoners have been held on the island .
When questioned by diligent MPs like Andrew Tyrie , the Conservative MP for Chichester , who is a staunch opponent of the CIA ’s use of “ extraordinary rendition , ” the British government has persistently maintained that it believes “ assurances ” given by the US government that no terror suspects have been held on the island , but there are several compelling reasons for concluding , instead , that the government is actually being economical with the truth .
Studies of planes used by the CIA for its rendition program –- which can be found on Stephen Grey ’s excellent Ghost Plane site –- have established that on September 11 , 2002 , the day that 9/11 plotter Ramzi bin al - Shibh was seized after a firefight in Karachi , one of the CIA ’s planes flew from Washington to Diego Garcia , via Athens .
Bin al - Shibh did not resurface again until September 2006 , when he was moved to Guantánamo , and he has not spoken about his experiences .
Unlike his supposed mentor Khalid Sheikh Mohammed , he refused to take part in his tribunal at Guantánamo earlier this year , but this is not the only piece of the torture jigsaw that has been reconstructed by diligent researchers .
In June 2006 , Dick Marty , a Swiss senator who produced a detailed report on “ extraordinary rendition ” for the Council of Europe , also concluded that Diego Garcia had been used as a secret prison .
Having spoken to senior CIA officers during his research , he told the European Parliament , “ We have received concurring confirmations that United States agencies have used Diego Garcia , which is the international legal responsibility of the UK , in the ‘ processing ’ of high - value detainees . ”
Anecdotally , Marty ’s findings have been confirmed by other sources .
Manfred Novak , the UN ’s Special Rapporteur on Torture , declared that he heard from “ reliable sources ” that the US has “ held prisoners on ships in the Indian Ocean , ” and detainees in Guantánamo have also told their lawyers that they were held on US ships –- in addition to those held on the USS Bataan and the USS Peleliu , which are discussed in my book The Guantánamo Files .
One detainee told a researcher from Reprieve , “ One of my fellow prisoners in Guantánamo was at sea on an American ship with about 50 others before coming to Guantánamo .
He told me that there were about 50 other people on the ship ; they were all closed off in the bottom .
The people detained on the ship were beaten even more severely than in Guantánamo . ”
The most incriminating evidence of all , however , has come not from opponents of Guantánamo , or , indirectly , from those subjected to some of the regime ’s most horrendous abuses , but from an upstanding insider .
Barry McCaffrey , a retired four - star US general , who is now professor of international security studies at the West Point military academy ( whose recent report on Guantánamo was ridiculed here ) , has twice let slip that Diego Garcia has , as the administration ’s opponents have struggled to maintain , been used to hold terror suspects .
In May 2004 , he blithely declared , “ We ’re probably holding around 3,000 people , you know , Bagram air field , Diego Garcia , Guantánamo , 16 camps throughout Iraq , ” and in December 2006 he slipped the leash again , saying , “ They ’re behind bars … we ’ve got them on Diego Garcia , in Bagram air field , in Guantánamo . ”
Do we need any further proof ?

See here for further developments in the story of the secret prison on Diego Garcia .
On Wednesday , Antifascist Calling reported on moves by the Department of Justice to seek blanket immunity for AT&T under provisions of the disgraceful FISA Amendments Act ( FAA ) .
If approved by Judge Vaughn Walker , the presiding magistrate hearing the landmark Hepting v. AT&T lawsuit in federal district court in San Francisco , the giant telecommunications corporation and Bush crime family partner would walk away scott free .
The suit , brought by the Electronic Frontier Foundation ( EFF ) on behalf of AT&T customers caught up in the state ’s illegal internet and telephone driftnet surveillance , is challenging unconstitutional spying on U.S. citizens and legal residents .
The shocking extent of the “ public - private partnership ” in political repression was first revealed in depth when former AT&T technician Mark Klein filed an affidavit in support of EFF ’s contention that AT&T had systematically violated their customers ’ right to privacy .
As Antifascist Calling has previously reported on many occasions , the telecommunications giant had constructed a secret room ( SG3 Secure Room , room number 641A ) for the exclusive use of the National Security Agency ’s spying operations at AT&T ’s Folsom St. office .
On Saturday , EFF reported that the government “ started the formal process for retroactive immunity for the telecommunications companies sued by EFF and others for their involvement in the warrantless surveillance of millions of ordinary Americans . ”
That hearing is set for December 2 , 2008 in San Francisco .
The state filed a secret “ certification ” by U.S. Attorney General Michael Mukasey with the court along with a public submission of its claim of limitless executive power “ during a time of war . ”
However in a bold , preemptive move on Thursday , EFF filed a new lawsuit against the government .
That suit , Jewel v. NSA , targets the National Security Agency , President Bush , Vice President Dick Cheney , Cheney ’s sinister chief of staff , David Addington , and former U.S. Attorney General Alberto Gonzales .
Filed “ on behalf of AT&T customers , ” the civil rights organization has opened a new front against the government and their corporate partners .
EFF declared :
The lawsuit , Jewel v. NSA , is aimed at ending the NSA ’s dragnet surveillance of millions of ordinary Americans and holding accountable the government officials who illegally authorized it .
Evidence in the case includes undisputed documents provided by former AT&T telecommunications technician Mark Klein showing AT&T has routed copies of Internet traffic to a secret room in San Francisco controlled by the NSA .
( “ EFF Sues NSA , President Bush and Vice President Cheney to Stop Illegal Surveillance , ” Electronic Frontier Foundation , Press Release , September 18 , 2008 )
As in Hepting v. AT&T , the identical evidence of gross malfeasance on the part of well - heeled corporate lawbreakers who acted in concert with unaccountable secret state agencies , is central to Jewel v. NSA .
These covert intelligence operations arose as the result of secret Department of Justice memorandums written by the Office of Legal Counsel ( OLC ) .
According to an unsigned and undated memo released by by the OLC , the Justice Department claims that President Bush has an “ inherent right ” to carry out “ communications intelligence targeted at the enemy . ”
Indeed , as the extent of these illegal programs have revealed , the “ enemy ” is none other than the American people themselves !
A January 19 , 2006 Justice Department White Paper , Legal Authority Supporting the Activities of the NSA Described by President Bush , states :
The NSA ’s activities are supported by the President ’s well - recognized inherent constitutional authority as Commander in Chief and sole organ for the Nation in foreign affairs to conduct warrantless surveillance of enemy forces for intelligence purposes to detect and disrupt armed attacks on the United States .
Under color of the dubious theory of the “ unitary executive , ” propounded by ultra-rightist outfits such as the Federalist Society , Americans ’ Fourth Amendment rights are flagrantly –and illegally –violated on a daily basis by the Bush administration .
Such specious assertions represent nothing less than an open declaration of war on our rights and the framework for a limitless presidential dictatorship .
Senior EFF Staff Attorney Kevin Bankston commenting on the intent of Jewel v. NSA averred ,
“ In addition to suing AT&T , we ’ve now opened a second front in the battle to stop the NSA ’s illegal surveillance of millions of ordinary Americans and hold personally responsible those who authorized or participated in the spying program .
For years , the NSA has been engaged in a massive and massively illegal fishing expedition through AT&T ’s domestic networks and databases of customer records .
Our goal in this new case against the government , as in our case against AT&T , is to dismantle this dragnet surveillance program as soon as possible . ”
By targeting the individuals responsible for these illegal programs , EFF intends to bring these felons to justice by holding them accountable for the destruction of our constitutional rights .
The Fourth Amendment states in plain and simple language :
The right of the people to be secure in their persons , houses , papers , and effects , against unreasonable searches and seizures , shall not be violated , and no Warrants shall issue , but upon probable cause , supported by Oath or affirmation , and particularly describing the place to be searched , and the persons or things to be seized .
But in a perverse interpretation of the constitutional separation of powers , Bushist minions such as torture - enabler John C. Yoo , formerly an attorney with the DoJ ’s Office of Legal Counsel and currently a tenured professor at the University of California ’s Boalt Hall Law School , stated publicly that the President , in his role as “ Commander - in - Chief , ” has the authority to bypass , indeed subvert , laws passed by Congress .
Under this novel interpretation of the Constitution , the President has the right under the theory of the “ unitary executive ” to grab unlimited executive power to conduct foreign and domestic policy as he sees fit .
As limited as the Watergate - era Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act ( FISA ) was , it represented an attempt by Congress after Nixon ’s resignation to curtail unchecked Executive branch surveillance of domestic dissidents under color of “ national security . ”
Indeed , Nixon ’s blatant and illegal surveillance of his political opponents was included in Article 2 of the impeachment articles against him .
In the view of miscreants such as Cheney , Addington and Yoo , congressional limitations on the president ’s power are “ unconstitutional ” maneuvers meant to strip the Chief Executive of his rightful power to act as he–and the corporatists setting policy–see fit .
Under their reading , the Executive , particularly in his role as “ Commander - in - Chief , ” must interpret laws on an equal footing with the courts , if he is to perform his “ wartime ” function .
However , no such provision exists in the U.S. Constitution and in fact , the “ unitary executive ” is a fantasy .
Since 1803 , U.S. constitutional tradition has recognized that the courts wield what Supreme Court Chief Justice John Marshall called “ judicial supremacy , ” that is , the court is the final arbiter of what is and what is not the law .
Bushist ideologues stand this principle on its head and transform a society based on law into a “ managed democracy ” predicated on the whims of corporations and the men who wield executive power in their “ unitary ” interests .
If such flagrant violations of democratic and republican norms go unchecked –either by the coequal branches of government or salutary direct action by the people themselves , the rights of citizens to determine the fundamental nature of society is replaced by a Führerprinzip , that is to say , a “ leader principle ” rooted in an antidemocratic hierarchy of warlords that resemble the military structures of the Nazi Party .
In other words , a high - tech , panoptic police state .
Since September 11 , 2001 , the United States Government has launched systematic assaults against the constitutional rights of American citizens and legal residents .
As the illegal aggression against the people of Iraq has revealed in all its ghastly horror , the “ war on terror ” is a war of terror against anyone who would challenge U.S. imperialism ’s claim to be undisputed “ masters of the universe . ”
From warrantless wiretapping to torture , from preemptive wars of aggression and conquest to the plunder of the environment on behalf of corporate “ friends , ” and from indefinite detention of “ enemy combatants ” to secretive plans for martial law , the Bush administration and their congressional enablers in both capitalist political parties demonstrate on a daily basis that the greatest threat to the American people comes , not from foreign terrorists or Islamic jihadists , but from neofascist fundamentalists here at home .
DOVER , N.H. ( Reuters ) - Republican vice presidential nominee Sarah Palin on Wednesday likened efforts to revive the flagging U.S. economy to a “ war ” and said her running mate Sen.
John McCain would prevail .
“ We are going to win the economic war that we are in , ” the Alaskan governor told several hundred supporters in Dover , New Hampshire in a speech amid mounting pressure on McCain ’s campaign to sharpen its economic message .
McCain and his Democratic rival Sen. Barack Obama are courting New Hampshire ’s famously independent voters , as shifting political allegiances in the state make it one of several toss - ups in the tight November 4 election .
Republican President George W. Bush won New Hampshire in 2000 by just 7,000 votes .
In 2004 , Democrat John Kerry carried the state by just 9,000 votes but lost the general election .
While only four electoral votes are at stake , the close fight for the 270 electoral votes needed to win the White House makes New Hampshire and other “ swing ” states such as Virginia , Nevada and Colorado critical to both Obama and McCain .
Democratic vice presidential nominee Sen. Joe Biden held a rally on Monday in Rochester , New Hampshire and Obama is scheduled to speak about the state of the U.S. economy in the southern town of Londonderry on Thursday .
Both campaigns are trying to persuade voters in the rural , mountainous state that they offer the best way to help struggling American workers .
Palin drew parallels between New Hampshire and Alaska , including a shared love of moose hunting , and said her state should adopt New Hampshire ’s motto : “ Live Free or Die . ”
“ I know that we can count on the good people in New Hampshire because you are a lot like the people of Alaska , ” she said of the two states about 4,500 miles apart on the opposite sides of the continent .
As opinion polls suggest the race could tip decisively toward Obama , Palin cast her running - mate as the underdog who would tap voter anger over the economy , “ corruption ” in Washington and “ voter fraud , ” saying : “ John McCain is going to turn that anger into action . ”

Are like oil and water .
In the opening graph of another screed at John McCain ’s official campaign blog , Goldfarb states the following :
Today the New York Times launched its latest attack on this campaign in its capacity as an Obama advocacy organization .
Let us be clear about what this story alleges :
The New York Times charges that McCain - Palin 2008 campaign manager Rick Davis was paid by Freddie Mac until last month , contrary to previous reporting , as well as statements by this campaign and by Mr. Davis himself .
From the headline of the NY Times :
McCain Aide ’s Firm Was Paid by Freddie Mac
One of the giant mortgage companies at the heart of the credit crisis paid $ 15,000 a month from the end of 2005 through last month to a firm owned by Senator John McCain ’s campaign manager , according to two people with direct knowledge of the arrangement .
Ben Smith is having none of Goldfarb ’s nonsense .
It is time for a new rule , which I will name after Hank Paulson , who yesterday proved to be incapable of providing his opening statement without lying .
At any rate , Paulson ’s Law goes like this :
“ If the very first thing that comes out of your mouth is a lie or an outright distortion , there is no reason for anyone to pay any attention to or believe anything you have said afterwards . ”

Tim Wolfenden , Head of Communications at uSwitch.com , comments :
 The solution is easy , broadband companies should not be allowed to class their packages as unlimited if they are not .
Providers are confusing consumers to the extent that broadband users do not even know if they are exceeding a user limit .
Broadband usage levels have gone through the roof as more and more consumers are using things such as on - demand TV services .
With so much reliance on broadband , having the service disconnected could feel to someone as serious as having their electricity cut off .
As providers arent choosing to be fully transparent about this issue , people need to be savvy when choosing their broadband packages and pay close attention to the small print . 
The ASA and Ofcom need to take firm action and actually set strict guidelines on the advertising of broadband packages .
Broadband policies are confusing enough without customers having to worry if they are going to have their service terminated .
It would be great if all providers could follow Skys lead and remove fair usage policies altogether .
In the meantime , broadband companies need to make clear and define these limits that they hide in the small print to make sure customers are fully aware of all the details when they sign up .
Tim Wolfenden continues ; 
The latest study from uSwitch has revealed that 86 % of UK broadband users still dont understand the usage limits on their service and nearly one million have reached or exceeded their ISPs limit in the last year alone .
This is particularly important because 56 % of major providers are prepared to disconnect those that abuse the service .
However it also shows how damaging bad marketing can be , with 6.2 m people believing they have an " " service with no restrictions :
The Advertising Standards Authority ( ASA ) is also blamed for making the problem worse by allowing providers to describe their services as " " even if there is a fair usage cap ( FUP ) , as long as it is detailed in the small print .
However , consumers are none the wiser with over 10 million broadband customers never reading their FUP and a further 1.8 m do not know if they have read it or not .
Unsurprisingly 7.5 m do not even know their download limit , which is understandable when so few providers clarify it :
Sadly just 22 % of the major broadband providers are transparent and advertise the true limits of their packages .
However limits are usually necessary to help maintain a good balance of price and service quality , though some ISPs do indeed need to end the culture of vague FUP's and the  style approach to broadband advertising .
YahooFinance has an interesting article on Roubini called Rate Cuts Reduce Crash Risk , But Dow 7,000 Likely ' Sometime Next Year '
....
The financial market crisis has unfolded even quicker than Roubini expected ( which is saying something ) , and the economist now thinks the Dow and S&P will suffer 50 % declines from last October 's peak vs. 40 % previously .
In other words , the Dow is going to 7,000 , but over the course of months vs. days if Roubini is right , as -- unfortunately for bulls -- he mostly has been for the past two years .
Because of growing slack in the global economy , Roubini says deflation is going to become a much bigger threat in the next six months vs. inflation .
In such an environment , cash , Treasuries and gold are the only safe bets he says -- provided your holdings are within the FDIC 's new $ 250,000 insurance cap .
Deflation Models
I had several models for how deflation might play out .
Here they are .
Everything but treasuries sink Everything but treasuries and gold sink Gold sells off initially then rallies with treasuries
Yes , this treasury bull is extremely long in the tooth .
And yes there will be a time to short treasuries .
But there has not been a bull market in history , in anything , that ended with that asset class being nearly universally despised .
And make no mistake about it , treasuries are despised .
Foreign central banks do not count because they are not buying treasuries to make a profit , and they are relatively unconcerned about losses .
Risk Of Severe Global Depression
The US and advanced economies ’ financial system is now headed towards a near - term systemic financial meltdown as day after day stock markets are in free fall , money markets have shut down while their spreads are skyrocketing , and credit spreads are surging through the roof .
There is now the beginning of a generalized run on the banking system of these economies ; a collapse of the shadow banking system , i.e. those non-banks ( broker dealers , non -bank mortgage lenders , SIV and conduits , hedge funds , money market funds , private equity firms ) that , like banks , borrow short and liquid , are highly leveraged and lend and invest long and illiquid and are thus at risk of a run on their short - term liabilities ; and now a roll - off of the short term liabilities of the corporate sectors that may lead to widespread bankruptcies of solvent but illiquid financial and non-financial firms .
The crisis was caused by the largest leveraged asset bubble and credit bubble in the history of humanity were excessive leveraging and bubbles were not limited to housing in the US but also to housing in many other countries and excessive borrowing by financial institutions and some segments of the corporate sector and of the public sector in many and different economies : an housing bubble , a mortgage bubble , an equity bubble , a bond bubble , a credit bubble , a commodity bubble , a private equity bubble , a hedge funds bubble are all now bursting at once in the biggest real sector and financial sector deleveraging since the Great Depression .
And in a world where there is a glut and excess capacity of goods while aggregate demand is falling soon enough we will start to worry about deflation , debt deflation , liquidity traps and what monetary policy makers should do to fight deflation when policy rates get dangerously close to zero .
At this point the risk of an imminent stock market crash – like the one - day collapse of 20 % plus in US stock prices in 1987 – cannot be ruled out as the financial system is breaking down , panic and lack of confidence in any counterparty is sharply rising and the investors have totally lost faith in the ability of policy authorities to control this meltdown .
When in markets that are clearly way oversold even the most radical policy actions do n’t provide rallies or relief to market participants you know that you are one step away from a market crack and a systemic financial sector and corporate sector collapse .
A vicious circle of deleveraging , asset collapses , margin calls , cascading falls in asset prices well below falling fundamentals and panic is now underway .
At this point severe damage is done and one cannot rule out a systemic collapse and a global depression .
The main reason the ban on marriage rights for gay and lesbian couples has been able to finance a massive advertizing campaign is that the LDS church is bankrolling the entire effort .
Up to 40 percent of the financing comes from Mormons , who have also sent countless volunteers to the state to canvass door to door .
It 's all legal , and totally within their democratic rights , but it is striking that one single religious grouping could invest so much in attempting to strip civil equality from gay couples :
Pollsters say that fueling the rise in support for Proposition 8 is an advertising blitz heavily bankrolled by the Mormon Church , which suggests , among other things , that if Proposition 8 does n't pass then schoolchildren will be indoctrinated about gay marriage .
Between 30 % and 40 % of the $ 25.5 million in donations raised as of last week by the " Yes " campaign has come from the Utah - based Church of Jesus Christ of Latter - day Saints , supporters of the measure say .
This strong alliance between the Mormon church and the Christianist evangelicals on the marriage issue in California goes back some way .
Mitt Romney explained the Mormon - Falwell connection in Christianity Today :
[ S] everal months ago , not long before he died , I had the occasion of having the Rev. Jerry Falwell at our home .
He said that when he was getting ready to oppose same - sex marriage in California , he met with the president of my church in Salt Lake City , and they agreed to work together in a campaign in California .
The No on 8 side has made some errors : poor advertizing and the self - inflicted wound of Gavin Newsom .
But watching one religious group swamp an initiative to remove civil rights from a minority is troubling to me .
It appears to be based on religious doctrine , not secular argument .

FEATURES
According to the company , the GeoEye - 1 satellite is the highest resolution commercial satellite orbiting the planet right now .
It reached orbit yesterday , but in reality , it 's not an ordinary commercial satellite : it 's fully controlled by the Department of Defense 's U.S. National Geospatial - Intelligence Agency .
And two guys named Larry and Sergei .
Part of the US National Geospatial Intelligence Agency NextView program , the SUV - sized GeoEye - 1 launched yesterday in a Delta II 7326 rocket from the Vandenberg Air Force Base in California - without exploding .
Hours later , GeoEye 's ground station in Norway confirmed that the rocket had delivered its payload right on target .
The satellite was alive , fully armed and operational on its 423 - mile orbit above the Earth .
Advertisement
Built by General Dynamics , the GeoEye - 1 is equipped with a next - generation camera made by ITT .
This camera can easily distinguish objects 16 inches long , with 11 - bits per pixel color .
In other words : this thing can see the color of your shorts .
It will be up there , looking at your pants every single day , the time it takes for it to complete one orbit .
And it will keep doing that for more than ten years , its expected life .
Of course , there 's nothing new here until you notice the huge Google logo on the rocket , signaling the fact that Sergei and Larry own the exclusive rights to the GeoEye - 1 images .
Yes , no other company will be able to access this information , only Google .
And they will be there , available for the public in Google Maps and Google Earth .
But do n't fret , tin-foil hatters , because Google wo n't be able to access the highest resolution images because of US government regulations .
Sure , the other guys will , but then again , their big bad satellites can see closer than this one .
Still , you can rest safe that your underpants will be safe from public scrutiny .
For now .
Unless you do like me and keep flashing them around .

Working With Video From Ruby
By Peter Cooper
With only the performance of a scripting language , Ruby is n't considered a particularly suitable choice for intense video work ( direct transcoding , encoding , and the like . ) .
Nonetheless , there are a handful of Ruby libraries and Ruby - based technologies you can use to work with video and movie files - primarily through interacting with faster tools or libraries .
RMov ( Ruby Quicktime Library )
RMov is an awesome new Ruby library by Ryan Bates that wraps around Apple 's QuickTime API and allows you to open , edit , and export QuickTime movies from within Ruby .
It is , unfortunately , OS X only .
RVideo ( Ruby Video Processing )
RVideo ( Github ) is a Ruby library that interfaces with tools like ffmpeg to let you inspect and process video and audio files .
For example , you can use RVideo to help you convert videos into FLVs .
Panda ( Video Encoding and Streaming Platform )
Panda is a Ruby - powered open source " video uploading , encoding and streaming " solution .
While it uses Ruby as an interface ( in the shape of a Merb application ) , it relies on tried and tested tools like FFMpeg to do the heavy lifting but may be perfect if you have an Amazon EC2 account and fancy offloading the CPU intense video work .
Hey !Spread ( Video Promotion Web Service )
Hey !Spread makes it easy to upload videos to YouTube and Google Video - each operation essentially becoming a method .
Fliqz4R ( " White - Label YouTube " API )
Fliqz is a provider of " plug and play video solutions . "
Effectively they provide the backend infrastructure for hosting and playing videos , a kind of white - label YouTube , if you will .
Libin Pan has put together a tutorial that demonstrates how to use Fliqz from Ruby / Rails using the Fliqz4R Rails plugin .
Any other libraries to recommend ?

An Arizona shrimp farmer has emptied the crustaceans from some of his ponds and filled them instead with algae to turn to biofuel .
Gary Wood ’s Phoenix - area shrimp farm was highly profitable in the 90’s , but after an increase of imports from Asia , Wood went looking for something else to fill his ponds .
Now that biodiesel is cost - competitive with its petroleum cousin , algae - farms have been popping up around Arizona and other warm areas .
But Wood has an advantage : his shrimp already eat algae , so he knows exactly how to grow it .
“ We will harvest the algae in a very similar way we took the buildup from the shrimp ponds , ” Wood said .
“ It is just amazing we are in this position right now .
Up until a couple of years ago , we did n’t realize we ’d done so much of this research . ”
The next step is to process the green gunk into fuel .
Wood said he plans to process it on - site , with hopes to produce 15,000 barrels per acre , three times what is necessary to make a profit .
While so far algae - based biofuel has not faced the same political scrutiny as food crop fuels , Wood ’s decision presents an interesting situation where he ’s choosing to produce algae instead of shrimp .
Imported shrimp is often fed a harmful antibiotic called chloramphenicol , while shrimp raised in America can not be fed the drug .
Check your labels , since under a new law , all shrimp should now be labeled with its country of origin .

Astronomy Picture of the Day Discover the cosmos !
Each day a different image or photograph of our fascinating universe is featured , along with a brief explanation written by a professional astronomer .
2008 October 22
Explanation : A favorite target for astronomers , big , beautiful spiral galaxy NGC 7331 is one of the brighter galaxies not found in Charles Messier 's famous 18th century catalog .
About 50 million light - years distant in the northern constellation Pegasus and similar in size to our own Milky Way Galaxy , NGC 7331 is often imaged as the foreground of a visual grouping that includes an intriguing assortment of background galaxies some ten times farther away .
This striking image of the well - studied island universe and environs was produced using data from the Calar Alto Observatory in southern Spain .
Perhaps the deepest view of the region yet , the image data were processed to reveal sharp details of all sizes in both bright and faint areas .
A color balance was chosen so that white would be the result of averaging colors over the entire galaxy .
The result shows off a wealth of remarkable features in NGC 7331 and its surroundings .

CAPE TOWN , Oct 9 ( Reuters ) - Angola ’s oil production has dipped to 1.959 million barrels per day after touching 2 million bpd earlier in 2008 , a senior official with the state - run Sonangol oil firm said on Thursday .
“ The production is about 1.959 million barrels per day , ” Sonangol chief geologist Francisco Lopes da Cunha said in a presentation at the Africa Upstream 2008 oil conference in Cape Town .
He cited production problems in one of the country ’s offshore oilfields for the drop , but added that output would return to the 2 million bdp mark within about three weeks .
Oil has been the backbone of an economic boom in Angola , which is rebuilding its infrastructure after a 27 - year civil war that ended in 2002 .
Angola ’s government has encouraged foreign firms to invest in the oil sector .
American oil giant Chevron Corp. CVX.N is among the companies that have increased investments in Angola 's oil sector .
Chinese firms also have gained a foothold , with a series of deals backed by loans and credit from Beijing .
Offshore production , especially in the deeper waters off Angola ’s northern coast , will continue to be the mainstay of the country ’s oil output , which is expected to level off just over 2 million bpd before declining modestly after 2015 , da Cunha said .
( Reporting by Paul Simao ; editing by James Jukwey )
The oil market took a look at U.S. growth figures and decided they were n't just ugly �they were a double - bagger .
You 've got company ( AP ) Crude futures , which had risen for two days on the back of interest rate cuts , fell back below $ 65 a barrel after third - quarter U.S. GDP numbers showed a 0.3 % contraction in the world 's biggest oil consumer .
That sharpened minds in trading pits , as Bloomberg reports :
" The GDP number is a reminder that the economy , and with it energy demand , wo n't be recovering anytime soon , " said Phil Flynn , senior trader at Alaron Trading Corp. in Chicago .
" After yesterday 's rally the focus is returning to fears about demand destruction . "
Analysts that just a few months ago were forecasting $ 200 oil keep slashing their projections ; UBS slashed its 2009 forecast from $ 105 a barrel to $ 65 .
With the global economy headed south for the winter , does anybody expect oil to bounce back ?
Barclays Bank does .
Their reasoning ?
All the panic about falling demand overlooks an even larger drop in supply .
OPEC has already cut output twice and promises to keep cutting later this year .
Greenspan : Gold is " the Ultimate Form of Payment in the World " due to " Fiat Money in Extremis "
Gold fell yesterday as the dollar rallied ( gold closed at $ 874.00 down $ 14.4 0 while silver closed at $ 12.18 down 75 cents ) .
In after hours trading there was determined selling which pushed the price as low as $ 860 prior to rallying above the New York close and as high as over $ 883/ oz .
In the titanic battle between the gold bulls and the gold bears , the gold bears and powerful selling entities have again won the short term battle .
But this looks set to be another pyrrhic victory as the shorts are likely to get their heads handed to them on a plate when gold 's supply demand fundamentals ( as seen in many articles in recent days and in the Financial Times articles today - see our News section and below ) which become more bullish by the day , ultimately overwhelm the short sellers .
Gold would appear to be well supported at the $ 850 / oz to 860 / oz level but anything is possible given the unprecedented nature of the volatil ity in global money markets .
However , with interbank rates continuing to rise to new record levels , systemic risk remains elevated which will support gold .
Gold , unlike all other asset classes , is up some 1 7 % in the last 3 weeks ( since it 's recent Sept e mber 11th lows it has gone from $ 750 / oz to $ 87 8 / oz today ) and may need to consolidate between $ 850 and $ 910 prior to rechallenging $ 1,000 / oz in the coming weeks .
Gold remains very firm and near recent record highs in Euros and GBP as these currencies have weakened significantly in recent weeks .
We have not witnessed the dollar strengthening rather all fiat currencies weakening vis a vis the dollar as contagion has spread from the original epicentre in the US to financial systems and economies internationally .
Greenspan : Gold is " the Ultimate Form of Payment in the World "
The Financial Times ' Javier Blas has written two excellent articles examining the surging demand for gold amid a growing lack of supply ( ' Investors start fresh Gold Rush ' and ' Wealthy investors hoard bullion ' ) < see News section of homepage > .
In them he outlines how " investors in gold are demanding “ unprecedented ” amounts of bullion bars and coins and moving them into their own vaults as fears about the health of the global financial system deepen . "
He astutely notes Alan Greenspan 's observations regarding fiat paper money and the value of gold as being the " ultimate form of payment in the world "
" “ Fiat money , in extremis , is accepted by nobody , ” Alan Greenspan , the former chairman of the US Federal Reserve , told lawmakers in Washington almost a decade ago .
“ Gold is always accepted , ” he added .
The “ in extremis ” scenario was for years only a possibility in the mind of die - hard gold bugs , but the financial crisis is leading regular investors – from the ultra-rich to middle - class savers – to believe that the environment in which Mr Greenspan said fiat money would be worthless is now around the corner .
. . .
The investors ' response is a rush into physical gold not seen since the second oil crisis in 1979 , bankers say .
The shift into gold coins and bars is so extreme that it is causing shortages at refineries and mints around the world . "
W ith the Federal Reserve and global central banks injecting thousands of billions of dollars , euros , pounds , yen and swiss francs ( primarily dollars though ) into the global financial system in order to prevent a systemic meltdown and contagion , a degree of monetary debasement is taking place that has not been seen in wealthy industrialised economies since Germany 's Weimar Republic 's money printing in order to pay off World War I debt reparations .
This led to hyperinflation and destruction of the German mark and economy and the rise of the Nazis .
The scale of the money printing today is more akin to that seen in badly mismanaged less developed countries such as Argentina and other South American and African countries in the late 20th century .
The fiscal ramifications of the money printing are massive and yet to be realised .
A more recent example of massive money printing is Zimbabwe , one of Africa 's most prosperous nations until recently , which is now suffering from a crushing hyperinflation , last reported to be at 11.2 million percent .
The Zimbabwean central bank has unveiled a series of ever - larger notes since August , when it struck 10 zeros off the local currency that had become so weak that billions of dollars were required just to buy a loaf of bread .
Few are suggesting that America will go the way of Zimbabwe , but the present bout of " fiat money in extremis " risks a severe bout of stagflation that would make the stagflation of the 1970's look positively benign .

THE one - liner from which the headline above was borrowed comes from a review of “ I am a Camera ” — a stage play and subsequently a movie ( and later still the musical “ Cabaret ” ) based on Christoper Isherwood 's stories about Berlin before the second world war .
The witticism has been attributed to countless critics , from Dorothy Parker to Kenneth Tynan .
But most now accept it was Walter Kerr who coined this widely plagiarised putdown in 1951 .
Last week , while passing the house in Santa Monica where Isherwood lived for many years and ended his days , your correspondent 's mind wandered to the well - worn Leica IIIf sitting on a shelf beside his desk .
Like Isherwood 's masterpiece , the Leitz company 's III series of Leica range - finder cameras had their gestation in Germany during the 1930s , and reached their pinnacle in the 1950s .
With its screw - mounted interchangeable lenses , virtually silent shutter , synchronised flash and programmable delay , the compact IIIf was widely copied by camera makers around the world .
Painstaking ripoffs by Canon in Japan and Reid in Britain have become collectors ' pieces in their own right .
So long , old soldier
But the rugged IIIf remained the photojournalist 's camera of choice during the turbulent post - war years until it was replaced in 1957 by the ultimate range - finder , the Leica IIIg .
No one since has built a more trustworthy companion .
What finally relegated your correspondent 's Leica to the top shelf was n't having to carry a separate light - meter all the time , but a pair of scissors as well .
In their bid to simplify loading 35 mm film , Kodak , Fuji and other photographic firms squared off the 35 mm roll 's lead - in tab — so a modern SLR 's motor - driven loading mechanism could grab the film 's sprocket holes and wind it automatically onto the take - up spool .
Unfortunately , the Leica 's take - up spool needs a long tapering tongue of film , which users must wedge under a spring clip on the spool 's barrel before manually wrapping a few turns of film around it .
That meant yanking four inches of unexposed film out from the 35 mm roll and trimming it to shape each time you loaded the camera .
Doing that while running to keep up with the crowd could be a bit of a drag .
While your correspondent takes his little Leica with him less and less these days ( and his bulky old Hasselblad 500C even less so ) , he has n't abandoned film entirely .
He has , however , finally begun to waver .
Ever since Casio introduced the first digital camera for the masses back in 1995 , he has toyed with practically every new model to arrive in the stores .
He keeps a tiny 10 megapixel wonder in a drawer for taking e-mailable household snaps .
No matter how dismal the images , the satisfaction of being able to see the result on the camera 's little screen within seconds — and zap the many disappointing pictures — never fails to amuse .
Meanwhile , printing the digital images with an ink - jet printer at home brings back fond memories of darkrooms under the stairs with trays of developer , acetic acid and hypo .
The question now is whether to go the whole hog and buy a serious digital camera for work as well as play .
Two things have prompted this act of blasphemy .
One is the arrival of more attractively priced digital SLRs with “ full - frame ” image sensors — that is , with the same dimensions ( 24 mm by 36 mm ) as a full frame of 35 mm film .
The largest sensors used previously in “ prosumer ” SLRs had the same APS format ( 16 mm by 24 mm ) as disposable cameras .
The sensors used in pocket - sized digital cameras and mobile phones are truly minuscule ( 5 mm by 7 mm ) by comparison .
Bigger image sensors are better because they allow the pixels embedded in their surface to be larger .
And larger pixels capture more photons — something that 's especially useful when lighting conditions are poor .
Bigger pixels also emit more current , allowing their signal to swamp the electrical noise in the system .
Just as grain size in silver halide film ultimately limits the amount of detail you can see in a photograph , the background noise produced by the sensor does much the same in digital imaging .
Another virtue of full - frame digital SLRs is that , provided they have similar mounts , you can use lenses designed for 35 mm cameras .
You can't do that with lesser digital SLRs because of the so - called “ crop factor ” .
With a smaller image sensor , a lens designed for a 35 mm camera captures only the inner part of the image , cropping off the edges that the sub - size sensor chip can't see .
So special lenses have to be designed for less - than - full - frame digital cameras .
To keep the price down , that often means their optical performance is compromised and the choice of focal lengths limited .
But larger sensors allow another neat trick that serious picture - takers appreciate .
They offer the chance to use a much shallower depth of field .
Photographers like to isolate the subject matter by focusing tightly on it and blurring out the background .
They do that with a conventional camera by opening up the aperture of the lens and selecting a faster shutter speed .
That 's impossible with a little photographic gizmo .
The detail in a photograph taken by a pocket - sized digital camera is roughly in focus from a few feet away to almost infinity — just like a pin-hole camera children make in school .
Given the same field of view , a typical digital SLR will show a far shallower depth of field , but still 1.6 times larger than that of a full - frame digital camera .
Professional photographers who specialise in studio work have started using cameras with “ over - size ” ( 30 mm by 45 mm ) sensors that provide still shallower depths of field — so they can make the subject matter “ pop out ” against the background even more .
Apart from the arrival of less pricey full - frame digital SLRs , the other recent development that has impressed your correspondent is the way imaging chips are migrating from CCD ( charge - coupled device ) technology to CMOS ( complementary metal - oxide semiconductor ) , used widely in the computer industry .
The best thing about CMOS is that , unlike CCD , chipmakers have poured billions into shrinking the components on such devices and making them run faster , cooler and smarter .
Because the power consumption of a CMOS chip is so much lower to start with , full - frame sensors can be made that run cool , generate less noise and offer longer battery life .
What to buy ?
When released later this year , the new full - frame , 21 megapixel Canon 5D Mark II will doubtless fly off the shelves , despite the $ 2,700 sticker price for the body alone .
But do n't get caught up in the megapixel race — a marketing ploy if ever there was one .
The key thing is the size of the sensor , not the millions of pixels on your plate .
Indeed , a six megapixel SLR camera like the Nikon D - 40 that has room for decent sized sensor will blow a 12 megapixel pocket camera away .
With the arrival of full - frame CMOS sensors , digital photographers are about to have a ball .
Your Leica - loving correspondent is finally ready to join them .

Sixty years after their discovery , the Dead Sea Scrolls still spark controversy and debate .
What , if anything , have they established so far , and how will they be remembered ?
Proclaimed as the greatest discovery of the century , the Dead Sea Scrolls ( DSS ) quickly became the preserve of a limited academic circle .
That meant that any hope they would increase our collective understanding of the Bible became rather remote .
In July 2008 , leading DSS scholars gathered at an international conference to commemorate the 60th anniversary of the scrolls ’ discovery .
The event , titled The Dead Sea Scrolls and Contemporary Culture , took place at the Israel Museum ’s Shrine of the Book , designed and built specifically to house seven of the celebrated scrolls , and now home to all of them that are in Israel ’s possession .
The declared focus of the conference was “ to reflect on the progress made in the last ten years and to articulate our hopes for the future of Qumran studies . ”
“ There is no denying that Dead Sea Scroll research is a stormy and dramatic field , an uncommon mix of great scholarship and crackpot ideas , of collusion and scandal , of passion and intrigue . ”
With respect to the scrolls , the program notes raised the question , “ How can we dispel myths and inaccuracies ? ”
Answering that question may have been an impossible goal , however , as myths and inaccuracies will always abound with a trove of documents as old as these .
But the conference did reveal something of even greater importance : the diversity of opinions that surround the body of related evidence from the pre-Christian settlement at Khirbet Qumran , near the caves where the scrolls were discovered .
The ongoing debate strikes at the foundation of some dearly held views regarding the scrolls ’ significance .
Qumran Connection
To lend context to the current discussion , let ’s take a brief historical tour of DSS scholarship .
Eleazar Sukenik and Roland de Vaux were two of the earliest scholars to work with the first scrolls discovered in 1947 .
Sukenik almost immediately linked them to the settlement at Qumran , above the northwest shore of the Dead Sea , and specifically to a Jewish sect known as Essenes .
In 1951 de Vaux excavated the area and discovered pottery in the ruins of Qumran that was identical to pottery found in nearby Cave 1 ( the scrolls were taken from a series of 11 caves , each of which was numbered by archaeologists in order of discovery ) .
This solidified Sukenik ’s connection between the caves and their contents and the nearby archaeological ruins of the Qumran settlement .
The Qumran - Essene hypothesis established by these two titans of archaeology became , in the words of Edna Ullmann - Margalit of Hebrew University , the “ mainstream theory ” that would be popularized in books on the subject and accepted in reference works .
While a coterie of specialists began work on translating the scrolls in the 1950s , the rest of the academic world waited for almost 40 years to view them .
During these decades , scholars speculated and rumors of conspiracy proliferated .
Was important evidence being withheld ?
Eventually impatience led to a short - circuiting of established procedures by a pair of researchers who took matters into their own hands .
With the aid of sophisticated computer software and a concordance of all the words found in the already - published scrolls ( as compiled by the DSS scholars ) , they reconstructed the remaining scroll fragments and released their own volume ahead of the “ authorized ” version .
Though the official team was n’t happy about this circumventing of their work , it did serve to dissipate the conspiracy theories and to confound the critics .
No startling evidence had been withheld after all .
The eventual release of the complete transcripts and official translations in a 39 - volume series , titled Discoveries in the Judaean Desert , led to much scholarly activity relating to the scrolls and their origins .
But as thoughtful debate and examination continued , scholars began to take issue with the “ mainstream theory , ” challenging Sukenik ’s and De Vaux ’s belief that the scrolls belonged to the Essenes .
One of the first challengers was professor Norman Golb of the University of Chicago .
He sought to remove the link between the scrolls and the archaeological evidence at Qumran by asserting that the scrolls had all been brought from Jerusalem for safekeeping prior to the Roman siege that began in 68 C.E .
Since Golb published his hypothesis , many differing ideas have been put forward about Qumran ’s use and purpose .
While many held to the view that it was the home of the Essene sect , others suggested that it was a country estate , a hostelry for traders crossing the Dead Sea , a fortress of the Hasmoneans , or a pottery factory .
Still others noted that Qumran may have performed all or some of these functions at various times in its history .
Nevertheless , despite beliefs to the contrary , certain features consistently tied the ruins to the Essenes .
One interesting but controversial fact is that the site has apparently yielded more inkwells than any other recorded archaeological site in the area .
Some of them clearly had been used and were therefore not necessarily part of the manufactured products of a pottery factory , as some suggested .
Although de Vaux ’s idea of a major scriptorium — a place for copying the scrolls — is largely rejected today , the inkwells are an indication that some scribal activity ( a highly professional undertaking ) took place at Qumran .
Another feature of the site is the ancient cemetery , which contains predominantly male remains .
Though this seems to reinforce claims made by Philo of Alexandria and Pliny the Elder that the Essene community was celibate , German DSS scholar Hartmut Stegemann suggested that this was an unfortunate exaggeration .
Stegemann held that conditions in Qumran were simply too harsh for women and that as a result , few men brought their families to the site .
He adamantly opposed what he called the “ idealistic ” view that the Essenes practiced a principled celibacy , nevertheless conceding in 1998 that “ the old reports of the Essenes ’ celibacy on principle continue to shape opinion . ”
To bolster his own theory , Stegemann pointed to the discovery of a Qumran cemetery containing women ’s and children ’s graves .
But some scholars now identify those remains as Bedouin .
The question of whether the Essene community was indeed celibate therefore continues to be problematic .
Adding to the difficulty of analyzing and interpreting the various archaeological claims , de Vaux died in 1971 without ever publishing his findings .
Much of our knowledge about Qumran archaeology is gleaned from his public lectures or from interpretations of the notes he took on site as excavation progressed .
The Scrolls Debate
If interpretation of the remains of Khirbet Qumran have been subject to debate , the same is true for the scrolls themselves .
Now that they have been fully translated and published , another generation of scholars is looking carefully at the evidence , and they too have taken differing approaches to analyzing them .
First , the ideas found in the scrolls have been studied to see whether they convey a unified view of Scripture , religion or theology .
If they do not convey a cohesive , systematic view , can they have come from a single group ?
And if they do not represent the ideas of a single group , did one group collect documents of other groups in the manner in which we would establish a library today , assembling works that cover a variety of approaches to a subject ?
One consideration is that no known scrolls can be clearly identified as originating with major Jewish sects such as the Pharisees or the Sadducees .
This strengthens the Essene connection , as they were very conservative and derided the views of the priesthood who controlled the temple in Jerusalem .
On the other hand , because some of the scrolls were written in the Greek language ( which indicates a more Hellenistic approach toward the Scriptures than the Hebrew or Aramaic of the majority ) , it would be reasonable to posit that the scrolls are from more than one group .
A further complicating factor is that attempts to date the scrolls have proven difficult : most of them are leather , and establishing how long the leather existed before being made into scrolls is currently beyond the ability of experts .
However , carbon - 14 dating of the linen cloths in which many of the scrolls were wrapped has led to a claim that the entire collection could have been in the caves by the time of the Roman general Pompey ’s entry into Judea in 63 B.C.E .
This claim , though not widely accepted , has led to other attempts to date the scrolls .
One scholar has used paleography , or the study of the handwriting styles found in the scrolls , to establish their age .
On that basis Daniel Stökl Ben Ezra holds that some caves contained older material than other caves , meaning that the scrolls must have been placed in the various caves at substantially different times .
Others have sought to categorize the caves by material or type .
For example , because Cave 7 contained only scrolls written in Greek , it would appear that some form of categorization occurred in the placement of the scrolls .
Professor Stephen J. Pfann of the University of the Holy Land in Jerusalem analyzed the caves by usage and contents .
He concluded that each cave served one of four purposes : a library , an archive , a repository for scrolls that had to be hidden in some emergency , or a genizah ( a place where old , worn scrolls were stored ) .
The latter use is particularly interesting .
Jewish communities avoided destroying old sacred texts , instead collecting them in places where they would be left untouched unless and until ceremonially buried elsewhere .
Other genizahs from this time include one at Masada and another in Cairo , which was discovered at the end of the 19th century and contains materials dating to the 10th .
Pfann concluded that the specific use of a given cave could be established from the types of scrolls it contained and the way in which those scrolls were placed in the cave .
Having determined each cave ’s use , he then analyzed the texts it contained .
He posited that Cave 4 , in which were found largely fragmentary remains of scrolls that appear to have been neither wrapped in linen nor placed in pottery jars , served as a genizah .
On the other hand , Cave 1 — with its treasure trove of almost complete scrolls that were wrapped and placed in jars ( such as the famous Isaiah scroll ) — could have served as a library .
The Question of Ownership
Pfann ’s position portrays how far the study of the scrolls has come .
At the outset of DSS research , Sukenik concluded that based on the findings from Cave 1 , the scrolls belonged in their entirety to the Essenes , a group of Jews who espoused a different interpretation of the Scriptures than the dominant groups of the day , the Sadducees and the Pharisees .
But modern scholars wonder :
If Cave 7 or Cave 11 had been discovered first , would Sukenik ’s conclusions have been the same ?
Thirty years and 10 caves later , University of Chicago ’s Golb rejected Sukenik ’s idea and concluded that the collection of scrolls represented the remains of the temple library , smuggled out of Jerusalem at the time of the Roman siege in 68 –70 C.E .
“ It appears to be high time to abandon the monolithic approach to the caves that assumes a common owner or origin for all the caves .
Rather , each cave must be assessed on its own merits . ”
But time has a way of undercutting absolutist readings of history .
Based on current findings , it now appears that the scrolls probably belonged to not one but several groups .
And if , as Pfann and others believe , some of the caves were also used as genizahs , then some of the scrolls may have been in the caves for a long time even before Pompey ’s Judean incursions in 63 B.C.E. and the siege of Jerusalem a century later .
But what of the idea that some caves were used as an emergency repository ?
Here Pfann provides perhaps the greatest challenge to the link between the scrolls and the Qumran community .
Caves 7 , 8 and 9 are closest to Qumran and are accessed through the walled remains of the settlement .
Hence scholars most often connect them with the people who last inhabited the settlement , commonly believed to be the Essenes .
Yet Cave 7 contained only Greek - language material , a very strange collection for the conservative Essene Jews .
Food remains and lamps also discovered in Cave 7 could provide a clue ; they suggest that it may have been used as a refuge during the siege .
Accordingly , Pfann relates those scrolls to the refugees who escaped Jerusalem at that momentous time .
This leads to the conclusion that the contents of Cave 7 likely had no relation to the Essenes or to their settlement a few meters above the cave .
If Cave 7 can be demonstrated to have no connection with the settlement at Qumran , could that also be true of the other caves ?
Biblical Studies
At the time of their discovery , scholars and theologians heralded the scrolls as keys to increased understanding of the Bible .
And despite areas of intense controversy , it must be conceded that some aspects of biblical history have been illuminated .
Whereas previous commentators and historians , including Jewish scholars , portrayed Judaism in the first century as monolithic , the Dead Sea Scrolls demanded that its true diversity be appreciated .
This had a profound effect on the study of the New Testament and brought Jewish scholars into a field in which previously they ’d had no major interest .
Although no scroll appears to directly address individuals named or referred to in the New Testament , they do represent an additional source by which to study the milieu of the characters and events written about .
Now both the people and the events of early Church history can be viewed in a different light .
Two notable results are the so - called new perspective on Paul and the recasting of John ’s Gospel as a profoundly Jewish text , whereas previously it had been considered Hellenistic or Greek in its influences .
The Dead Sea Stone , or “ Gabriel ’s Revelation ”
The 60th anniversary of the Dead Sea Scrolls discovery spotlights another archaeological find that has been waiting in the wings for some time .
After an initial burst of energy in this area , however , progress on the application and relevance of the scrolls to the study of the New Testament subsided to the point that a moderator at the November 2007 Society of Biblical Literature meeting in San Diego lamented the loss of interaction and called for a renewal of interest and study .
Perhaps her plea was answered by the recent notoriety surrounding the stone known as “ Gabriel ’s Revelation . ”
Academic benefits from DSS studies are not limited to a better understanding of the New Testament , however .
Ideas about the validity of the Greek Septuagint translation of the Hebrew Scriptures or Old Testament , known to us principally through Origen and the Codex Sinaiticus , have been challenged after the discovery of older Greek translations among the DSS .
Documents from Qumran showed that multiple Greek translations of Scripture existed at that time in addition to the one that supposedly became the basis of what is called the Septuagint today .
The multiplicity of Hebrew manuscripts has also given rise to questions about the timing and creation of the Hebrew canon of Scripture .
At the end of the day , the goals of the conference to mark the 60th anniversary of the Dead Sea Scrolls discovery may have been laudable , yet it would appear that continued study of the scrolls will lead to the deconstruction of many more theories associated with their times .
This in itself may not be a bad thing .
Nevertheless , the diversity of views and opinions developed through the study of the DSS provides a dilemma for both Jewish and Christian scholarship , as the evidence shows that modern rabbinic Judaism and Christianity are clearly the products of other centuries and milieus , with little connection to the materials from Qumran .
“ Pitre ’s bold thesis offers a portrait of Jesus that can only emerge when Jesus is interpreted within his own first - century Jewish context . ”
Orthodox Jewish scholarship focuses on rabbinic issues that arose in centuries subsequent to the DSS .
The scrolls do not address rabbinic issues and in fact validate other ideas within Judaism that the rabbis sought to bury .
For the Christian community , study of the DSS creates an uncomfortable realization of how far Christianity has wandered from the paths of its founder , as Christian theology bears little resemblance to the Hebraic underpinnings of Jesus Christ ’s teachings .
And that has a direct influence on what His would - be followers believe and do .

We have dissed our own record : Astonishing secret memo in which Blair accuses Brown of ‘ hubris and vacuity ’
Tony Blair has delivered a savage attack on Gordon Brown in a secret memo accusing him of playing into David Cameron ’s hands by his ‘ lamentable ’ and ‘ vacuous ’ performance as Prime Minister .
The former Prime Minister boasts that Mr Cameron was ‘ in trouble ’ before he resigned a year ago .
And he claims Mr Brown ’s incompetence has made the Tories look like the party of the future and on course to win the next Election .
Furious : Blair 's memo says Gordon Brown ' junked ' the policy agenda he inherited but had ' nothing to put in its place ' ( file pictures )
The memo reveals Mr Blair ’s fury at the way Mr Brown turned his back on his predecessor ’s achievements , accusing him of ‘ dissing our own record ’ .
He pours scorn on Mr Brown for claiming he would turn his back on the ‘ spin ’ of Mr Blair ’s ten years in power and replace it with a more ‘ honest ’ style .
He says Mr Brown ‘ junked the TB [ Tony Blair ] policy agenda but had nothing to put in its place ’ .
The bombshell disclosure comes as it emerged that Mr Blair has had regular talks with his close friend and political ally , Foreign Secretary David Miliband , who challenged Mr Brown ’s leadership last week .
The memo shows that Mr Blair backs many of Blairite Mr Miliband ’s private views about Mr Brown ’s failings .
And it blows the lid off public assertions that Mr Blair supports his successor , claiming Mr Brown has made ‘ fatal ’ blunders by disowning Mr Blair ’s record ; failing to produce new policies ; distancing himself from the Iraq War ; and leaving the political landscape ‘ wide open ’ for the Tories to take the lead .
The Mail on Sunday has also learned that Mr Brown may be forced to call off his plan to reshuffle the Cabinet in September , which carries his last hopes of reviving the Government .
Ally : Blair has had regular talks with his close friend Foreign Secretary David Miliband
Labour MPs who support Mr Miliband say that if Mr Brown ’s political fortunes do not improve in the next few weeks , Cabinet Ministers , including Mr Miliband , could stage a mass revolt and refuse to accept new jobs .
' Gordon ’s position may be so weak that Ministers say to him collectively that he is the one who will have to be moved , not them , ’ said one MP ally of Mr Miliband .
Mr Blair ’s memo is another major blow to Mr Brown .
Mr Blair sent a watered - down version to Mr Brown himself but it was stripped of the near abusive terms contained in the original draft .
The memo was written in the aftermath of Labour ’s disastrous party conference last year .
Today ’s disclosure of its contents could not come at a worse time for Mr Brown .
The tone is despairing and makes it clear that Mr Blair thinks Mr Brown has little chance of recovering .
In the months since it was written , Labour ’s ratings have got even worse .
‘ There is every indication that the lessons will not be learnt , ’ says Mr Blair .
‘ There has been a lamentable confusion of tactics and strategy . ’
Mr Blair refers to himself in the third person as ‘ TB ’ .
Mr Brown is ‘ GB ’ , David Cameron is ‘ DC ’ and new Labour ‘ NL ’ .
He writes : ‘ Tactically , it was thought clever to define by reference to TB i.e. this was not the era of spin , we are going to be honest , the style would change etc . ’
Mr Blair explains why this was doomed to fail .
‘ The consequence was twofold : we dissed our own record .
Instead of saying we are building on the achievements , confronting new challenges , we joined in the attack on our own ten years – a fatal mistake .
We junked the TB policy agenda but had nothing to put in its place .
‘ We took the benefit of the anti-TB feeling but ... ended up accepting our opponents propaganda and appearing incapable of articulating a forward policy agenda . ’
He is withering about Mr Brown ’s conduct at last year ’s Labour conference , when , with the Tories behind in the opinion polls , he scrapped plans for an autumn election after the Conservatives said they would slash inheritance tax .
‘ The real problem was not the brilliance of the Tory conference but the hubris and vacuity of our own , ’ says the memo .
‘ The Tories ... appeared substantial and to represent the future . ’
Mr Blair proclaims that ‘ DC was in trouble long before TB left . ’
And he argues it was because he had kept Mr Cameron ‘ confused ’ by sticking to New Labour policies whereas the Tory leader had been ‘ empowered ’ by Mr Brown ’s short - term tactics .
Attack : Blair 's memo accuses Gordon Brown of playing into David Cameron 's hands
The Blair memo is scathing about Labour ’s response to Mr Cameron ’s policies – and in particular his decision to raise the inheritance tax threshold to £ 1 million .
And he argues that by mimicking the initiative , Mr Brown simply made Mr Cameron look stronger .
Mr Brown made another error by signalling he wanted to change policy on Iraq and bring British troops home sooner than planned , says Mr Blair .
‘ By trying to be change , he played exactly the same game the media wanted but never the game that gives us the only chance of a 4th term . ’
Mr Miliband is known to share many of Mr Blair ’s opinions on Mr Brown ’s shortcomings .
He was head of the No10 policy unit under Mr Blair .
Mr Blair wanted him to challenge Mr Brown for the leadership when Mr Blair stepped down last year but Mr Miliband decided against .
Now Mr Brown has had a year in office and been judged a disappointment by most , Mr Miliband is convinced he can lead a Blairite - style revival .
His newspaper article last week that effectively marked the launch of his leadership campaign mirrored the frustration expressed in Mr Blair ’s memo .
Mr Miliband ’s allies say it was his exasperation with Mr Brown ’s failure to expose David Cameron ’s shortcomings that prompted him to risk his career by challenging Mr Brown .
A spokesman for Mr Blair said : ‘ Tony Blair continues to be 100 per cent supportive of Gordon Brown ’s Government . ’
The spokesman declined to comment on the memo and said Mr Blair was on holiday and could not be contacted .
Extracts from the secret memo
' I am passing this message on to GB – not in these terms – and will try to help ; but at present , there is every indication that the lessons will not be learnt .
' There has been a lamentable confusion of tactics and strategy .
Tactically , it was thought clever to define by reference to TB i.e. this was not the era of spin , we are going to be honest , the style would change etc .
' Strategically the consequence was twofold : a ) we dissed our own record – instead of saying we are building on the achievements , confronting new challenges , we joined in the attack on our own ten years – a fatal mistake if we do not correct it and b ) because we were disowning ourselves as a government , we junked the TB policy agenda but had nothing to put in its place .
' So tactically we took the benefit of the anti-TB feeling , but strategically , we ended up accepting our opponents ’ propaganda and appearing incapable of articulating a forward policy agenda .
' The real problem was not the brilliance of the Tory conference , but the hubris and vacuity of our own .
This meant the Tories , by having something to say on policy , appeared substantial and to represent the future .
' The truth is that DC was in trouble long before TB left , but that was because he was being forced to choose on NL policy and found as a result that he could n’t differentiate properly .
The Tory policy is still not up to much but they are able to get traction on inheritance tax – unbelievably boosted by our own briefing – because otherwise the policy field is left wide open .
DC is confused by proper strategy but immensely empowered by short - term tactics .
' The choice is and was always between GB running as the change candidate or as continuity NL .
He never needed to worry about distancing on Iraq – it was never going to be seen as his issue ; but he really needed to be seen as continuing NL not ditching it .
By trying to be change , he played exactly the same game the media wanted but never the game that gives us the only chance of a 4th term . '
Carol McCain McCain likes to illustrate his moral fiber by referring to his five years as a prisoner - of - war in Vietnam .
And to demonstrate his commitment to family values , the 71 - year - old former US Navy pilot pays warm tribute to his beautiful blonde wife , Cindy , with whom he has four children .
But there is another Mrs. McCain who casts a ghostly shadow over the Senator ’s presidential campaign .
She is seldom seen and rarely written about , despite being mother to McCain ’s three eldest children .
She was the woman McCain dreamed of during his long incarceration and torture in Vietnam ’s infamous ‘ Hanoi Hilton ’ prison and the woman who faithfully stayed at home looking after the children and waiting anxiously for news .
But when McCain returned to America in 1973 to a fanfare of publicity and a handshake from Richard Nixon , he discovered his wife had been disfigured in a terrible car crash three years earlier .
Her car had skidded on icy roads into a telegraph pole on Christmas Eve , 1969 .
Her pelvis and one arm were shattered by the impact and she suffered massive internal injuries .
When Carol was discharged from hospital after six months of life - saving surgery , the prognosis was bleak .
In order to save her legs , surgeons had been forced to cut away huge sections of shattered bone , taking with it her tall , willowy figure .
She was confined to a wheelchair and was forced to use a catheter .
Today , she stands at just 5 ′ 4 ″ in and still walks awkwardly , with a pronounced limp .
Her body is held together by screws and metal plates and , at 70 , her face is worn by wrinkles that speak of decades of silent suffering .
For nearly 30 years , Carol has maintained a dignified silence about the accident , McCain and their divorce .
But last week at the bungalow where she now lives at Virginia Beach , a faded seaside resort 200 miles south of Washington , she told The Mail on Sunday how McCain divorced her in 1980 and married Cindy , 18 years his junior and the heir to an Arizona brewing fortune , just one month later .
“ My marriage ended because John McCain did n’t want to be 40 , he wanted to be 25 .
You know that happens … it just does . ”
In 1979 — while still married to Carol — he met Cindy at a cocktail party in Hawaii .
Over the next six months he pursued her , flying around the country to see her .
Then he began to push to end his marriage .
Some of McCain ’s acquaintances are less forgiving , however .
They portray the politician as a self - centered womanizer who effectively abandoned his crippled wife to ‘ play the field ’ .
They accuse him of finally settling on Cindy , a former rodeo beauty queen , for financial reasons .
Ted Sampley , who fought with US Special Forces in Vietnam and is now a leading campaigner for veterans ’ rights , said : “ I have been following John McCain ’s career for nearly 20 years .
I know him personally .
There is something wrong with this guy and let me tell you what it is — deceit . ”
“ When he came home and saw that Carol was not the beauty he left behind , he started running around on her almost right away .
Everybody around him knew it .
Eventually he met Cindy and she was young and beautiful and very wealthy .
At that point McCain just dumped Carol for something he thought was better . ”
“ McCain is the classic opportunist .
He ’s always reaching for attention and glory , ” he said .
“ After he came home , Carol walked with a limp .
So he threw her over for a poster girl with big money from Arizona .
And the rest is history . ”
Ross Perot , a billionaire Texas businessman , and a former presidential candidate , who paid her medical bills all those years ago , now believes that both Carol McCain and the American people have been taken in by a man who is unusually slick and cruel — even by the standards of modern politics .
The text reproduced above is a shortened version of a June 2008 Daily Mail article about Carol McCain , Arizona senator John McCain ’s first wife , which was circulated as an e-mail forward at the time .
A similar social media version made the rounds when John McCain passed away in August 2018 :
Shorn of their vitriolic and subjective comments , these article present factually true frameworks regarding the circumstances surrounding the break - up of John McCain ’s first marriage .
On 3 July 1965 , 28 - year - old Naval aviator John Sidney McCain III married 27 - year - old Carol Shepp of Philadelphia , whom he had initially met while attending the U.S. Naval Academy in Annapolis , Maryland , several years earlier .
John McCain adopted Carol ’s two sons ( Douglas and Andrew ) from a previous marriage , and the couple had a daughter ( Sidney ) together in 1966 .
In July 1967 , Lt. Commander John McCain was taken prisoner after his plane was shot down on a bombing mission over North Vietnam and was held as a POW for over five years .
During her husband ’s captivity , Carol McCain was involved in a near - fatal automobile accident that left her with permanent injuries , a circumstance that posed some difficult adjustments for the couple after they were finally reunited in March 1973 :
One fact was especially difficult to deal with [ after McCain ’s return to the U.S. ] : Carol ’s physical condition .
At Christmastime in 1969 , while McCain was imprisoned in Vietnam , Carol was almost killed in a car crash .
“ Carol had taken the kids to her parents ’ house for the holidays , ” McCain later wrote .
“ After dinner on Christmas Eve , she drove to our friends , the Bookbinders , to exchange gifts .
It had begun to snow by the time she started back to her parents , and the roads were icy .
She skidded off the road , smashed into a telephone pole , and was thrown from the car .
The police found her some time later in shock , both legs fractured in several places , her arm and pelvis broken , and bleeding internally .
“ Several days passed before she was out of immediate danger .
It would be six months and several operations before she was released from the hospital .
Over the next two years , she would undergo many more operations to repair her injured legs .
By the time the doctors were finished , she would be four inches shorter than she was before the accident .
After a year of intense physical therapy , she was able to walk with the aid of crutches . ”
Carol ’s new appearance was one of the more shocking details McCain had to deal with during his period of adjustment ; quite simply , Carol was a different person from the one she was when he left .
By the end of the 1970s , the McCains ’ marriage was strained to the breaking point , even if it was not evident to those who knew them :
Even though friends saw a rosy picture when they looked at John and Carol McCain ’s marriage from outside , privately the couple was having difficulty .
After years in captivity , McCain was not totally able to return to the life he had led with Carol before he went to Vietnam .
As the marriage became rocky , McCain was unfaithful to Carol , or perhaps the marriage became rocky because McCain was unfaithful .
Later , there would even be reports that he had , as the Boston Globe put it , “ affairs with subordinate female personnel . ”
The McCains had tried to achieve some semblance of a normal life after McCain ’s return home — and , to a great extent , they had accomplished this — but the problems continued nonetheless .
Years later , Carol would tell a reporter the main trouble was not complicated : McCain may have been 40 , but he was acting like he was 25 .
In 1979 , then 42 - year - old John McCain first met Cindy Lou Hensley , a 25 - year - old school teacher who was also the daughter ( and heir ) of James Hensley , the founder of one of the largest Anheuser - Busch beer distributorships in the United States ; the two began dating and married the following year .
Sources differ as to the timing of McCain ’s separation from his first wife , Carol , and the beginning of his relationship with the woman who would become his second wife , Cindy Hensley ; whatever the circumstances , McCain remarried five weeks after divorcing his first wife :
McCain has made several statements about how he divorced Carol and married Hensley that conflict with the public record .
In his 2002 memoir , “ Worth the Fighting For , ” McCain wrote that he had separated from Carol before he began dating Hensley .
“ I spent as much time with Cindy in Washington and Arizona as our jobs would allow , ” McCain wrote .
“ I was separated from Carol , but our divorce would not become final until February of 1980 . ”
An examination of court documents tells a different story .
McCain did not sue his wife for divorce until Feb. 19 , 1980 , and he wrote in his court petition that he and his wife had “ cohabited ” until Jan.
7 of that year — or for the first nine months of his relationship with Hensley .
Although McCain suggested in his autobiography that months passed between his divorce and remarriage , the divorce was granted April 2 , 1980 , and he wed Hensley in a private ceremony five weeks later .
McCain obtained an Arizona marriage license on March 6 , 1980 , while still legally married to his first wife .
McCain stated in his autobiography that he was solely responsible for the failure of his first marriage : “ My marriage ’s collapse was attributable to my own selfishness and immaturity .
The blame was entirely mine . ”
SAN FRANCISCO  I.B.M. sued one of its top executives on Thursday in an attempt to prevent him from taking a position at Apple .
The company said that the executive , Mark Papermaster , who until last week had been manager in charge of the company ’s blade server business , had signed a noncompete agreement with I.B.M. that would prevent him from accepting a job with a competitor until one year after leaving I.B.M .
The company said that Mr. Papermaster had been one of its top 300 managers and that he had access to a wide range of the company ’s intellectual property and trade secrets .
“ Mr. Papermaster ’s employment by Apple is a violation of his agreement with I.B.M. against working for a competitor should he leave I.B.M. , ” said Fred McNeese , director of I.B.M. ’s corporate media relations group .
“ We will vigorously pursue this case in court . ”
The suit was filed at the United States District Court in Manhattan .
Almost exactly 13 years ago , American leadership brought an end to Bosnia 's three - and - a - half - year war through the Dayton peace agreement .
Today the country is in real danger of collapse .
As in 1995 , resolve and transatlantic unity are needed if we are not to sleepwalk into another crisis .
Bosnian Serb Prime Minister Milorad Dodik , once the darling of the international community ( and especially Washington ) for his opposition to the nationalist Serb Democratic party , has adopted that party 's agenda without being tainted by their genocidal baggage .
His long - term policy seems clear : to place his Serb entity , Republika Srpska , in a position to secede if the opportunity arises .
Exploiting the weaknesses in the country 's constitutional structure , the international community 's weariness and EU inability to stick by its conditionality , he has , in two years , reversed much of the real progress in Bosnia over the past 13 , crucially weakened the institutions of the Bosnian state , and all but stopped the country 's evolution into a functioning ( and EU - compatible ) state .
Dodik 's actions have been fuelled by Russian encouragement and petrodollars .
In addition his rival , the senior president of all of Bosnia - Herzegovina , Haris Silajdzic , has stressed the need to abolish the two entities that make up Bosnia , to create one non-federal country .
Dodik professes to respect Dayton and Silajdzic wishes to revise it , but both men are violating its basic principle : a federal system within a single state .
This toxic interaction is at the heart of today 's Bosnian crisis .
As a result , the suspicion and fear that began the war in 1992 has been reinvigorated .
A destructive dynamic is accelerating , and Bosnian and Croat nationalism is on the rise .
The recent local elections gave a fillip to nationalist parties .
This tipping point is the result of a distracted international community .
While the Bush administration largely turned its back on Bosnia , the EU became deeply engaged ; EU membership has been the critical lever for pressing reforms in Bosnia since it was made policy in 2003 .
But the EU did not develop a coherent strategy , and by proclaiming progress where it has not been achieved , the EU has weakened not only its own influence in the country , but also the Office of the High Representative ( OHR ) and the international military presence ( the European Union Force , Eufor , which succeeded Nato ) the drivers of progress in Bosnia since Dayton .
The degeneration of the OHR's influence coincided with the withdrawal of the US military and the hollowing - out of Eufor , which now has little in the way of operational capacity .
Despite the danger signals , France and Spain apparently want to pull the plug on Eufor altogether before the end of the year , seemingly to prove the purely technical point that EU missions can end .
The EU , fixated on a still undefined " transition " from OHR to an EU - centred mission , seems intent on emptying its toolbox before it knows what tools it will need to enable Bosnia 's transition .
It failed , for example , to back its man on the ground , the able Slovak diplomat Miroslav Lajcak , at a crucial moment , fatally undermining his authority .
Like Dodik , Russia is exploiting weak EU resolve , making trouble for the US and EU where possible .
Yet Moscow 's equities in Bosnia pale in comparison to those of the EU or US .
Their attempts to close the high representative 's office , regardless of whether the job is done , must be rebuffed .
It has to remain open - or a similarly strong organisation set up - until the conditions for the transition to a more normal EU presence are met .
The US , lame duck or not , must re-engage .
Javier Solana , the EU 's foreign policy chief , should initiate an independent study tasked to produce a new transatlantic policy , backed by Washington 's full engagement and strong EU conditionality , which can lead to deeper and broader international involvement in Bosnia .
A collapse of the Dayton peace agreement would be an unnecessary and unwanted additional problem for the new White House administration .
Post - Irish referendum , the EU 's foreign policy will be , above all , a Balkan policy .
Attention has recently focused on Kosovo .
But Bosnia has always been the bigger and more dangerous challenge .
The country 's decline can still be arrested , provided the EU wakes up , the new US administration gets engaged , and both renew their commitment to Bosnia 's survival as a state , by maintaining an effective troop presence and beginning the process of strengthening the international community 's approach long - term , including finding ways to untie Bosnia 's constitutional knot .
It 's time to pay attention to Bosnia again , if we do n't want things to get very nasty quickly .
By now , we should all know the price of that .

Pirate Bay co-founders Peter Sunde and Fredrik Neij gave a keynote speech at the Hack In The Box Security Conference 2008 , entitled " How to dismantle a billion dollar industry - as a hobby . "
The two discuss how The Pirate Bay grew to be the largest BitTorrent site on the Internet , and some of the challenges they face today .
At the Hack in the Box conference , held in Malaysia , Peter and Fredrik gave a talk this morning , where they offered some background information on how the site became the world ’s largest BitTorrent tracker , in a relatively short period of time .
The two , who just turned 30 , have a long history of copyright infringement which started back in the ’ 80 ’s , with Peter cracking Amiga games and Fredrik copying Commodore 64 software .
At the time they had never heard of copyright infringement , they were just doing what everybody else did .
To the amusement of the audience , Peter said he did n’t think piracy was ‘ wrong ’ when he was a kid , but now that he ’s an adult , he knows it ’s not .
Years later , in 2003 , they got involved in founding Piratbyrån ( The Bureau of Piracy ) , a pro-piracy organization that was created in response to anti-Piratbyrån .
The goal of Piratbyrån was to start a debate on copyright issues , and how they affect society .
Until then , most press in Sweden would simply take everything anti-Piratbyrån said for granted .
In the years to come , Piratbyrån started several pro-piracy projects , and the most influential is without a doubt the founding of The Pirate Bay on November 21 , 2003 .
“ We needed to have a filesharing network in Sweden , because there was none , ” Peter said .
“ At this time there was one big torrent site , which was called Suprnova , but they mainly had international content .
We and Piratbyrån wanted more Swedish and Scandinavian content .
So we started a big library , and that is The Pirate Bay . ”
Fredrik , who ran one of the earlier versions of the tracker on his laptop , explained that when The Pirate Bay went live , it was hosted in South America .
“ The Pirate Bay originally started out in Mexico , on a Mexican server where Anakata , the third guy of The Pirate Bay was working at the time , ” he said .
Anakata hosted the site on a server owned by the company he was working for , but it was soon overloaded since the site grew so rapidly .
The Pirate Bay was initially available in Swedish language only .
However , after a year they found out that , although their site was initially targeted at Scandinavians , over 80 % of the users came from other parts of the world .
In fact , one of the most popular torrents was a Swedish language course .
Because of increasing worldwide popularity , The Pirate Bay team completely redesigned the site , which became available in several languages .
The popularity of the site did n’t go unnoticed in Hollywood .
Like many other BitTorrent sites , The Pirate Bay also received several takedown notices .
However , the way they responded to these was quite unique and some have become news stories in themselves .
Threats from the entertainment industry did n’t stop at sending letters .
In true Hollywood style , The Pirate Bay admins soon saw private investigators watching their every move .
“ They ’ve sent private investigators after us , which is really stupid if you do something online , ” Peter said .
“ What are they going to find , that we are sitting behind our computers ? ” Fredrik added : “ I guess the private investigator that went after me in Gothenburg got to see a lot of good bars , a lot of late nights , but probably not a lot of evidence gathering . ”
Peter then noted that someone from the IFPI was actually at the conference , “ still trying to find out what we ’re doing . ”
Eventually The Pirate Bay got raided , following pressure from Hollywood and the USA .
Fredrik recalls the day vividly : “ I got a phone call like 10 am in the morning , it was Anakata . ”
He told Fredrik that there were police officers at their office , and asked him to get down to the colocation facility and get rid of the ‘ incriminating evidence ’ , although none of it , whatever it was , was related to The Pirate Bay .
As Fredrik was leaving , he suddenly realized that the problems might be linked to their tracker , so he initiated a full backup of the site .
At the colocation facility there were 65 police , some in civilian clothing .
Fredrik asked them : “ Who are you ?
What are you doing here ? ”
To which they responded , “ Who are YOU ?
What are you doing here ? ”
After questions back and forth , Fredrik eventually told them his name , and a police officer said , “ Oh , we ’ve been looking for you . ”
During the subsequent questioning , the Pirate Bay trio gave up very little information .
Anakata quickly confessed to his crime – of killing the Swedish prime minister when he was 2 years old , but that was all they got .
It is up to the court to decide whether the Pirate Bay founders are operating illegally or not .
Until then , The Pirate Bay is still up and running , stronger than ever .
As always , there are a lot of plans for the future , and Peter and Fredrik briefly discussed some .
One of the most interesting plans is to encrypt tracker connections , so anti-piracy organizations can’t spy on their users .
We will probably hear more about that in the future .
The keynote speech by Peter and Fredrik was streamed from a mobile phone last night , and we embedded the recording below .
The sound quality is far from optimal , but it ’s watchable .
The talk starts at 13 m 00s
The Atom processor 's architecture is not about being the fastest , but being good enough for the tasks at hand .
A product like ASUS ' EeePC would not have existed 5 years ago , the base level of system performance simply was n't great enough .
These days , there 's still a need for faster systems but there 's also room for systems that are n't pushing the envelope but are fast enough for what they need to do .
The complexity of tasks like composing emails , web browsing and viewing documents is increasing , but not at the rate that CPU performance is .
The fact that our hardware is so greatly outpacing the demands of some of our software leaves room for a new class of " good enough " hardware .
So far we 've seen a few companies , such as ASUS , take advantage of this trend but inevitably Intel would join the race .
One of my favorite movies as a kid was Back to the Future .
I loved the first two movies , and naturally as a kid into video games , cars and technology my favorite was the second movie .
In Back to the Future II our hero , Marty McFly , journeys to the future to stop his future son from getting thrown in jail and ruining the family .
While in the future he foolishly purchases a sports almanac and attempts to take it back in time with him .
The idea being that armed with knowledge from the future , he could make better ( in this case , more profitable ) decisions in the past .
I 'll stop the analogy there because it ends up turning out horribly for Marty , but the last sentence sums up Intel 's approach with the Atom processor .
Imagine if Intel could go back and remake the original Pentium processor , with everything its engineers have learned in the past 15 years and build it on a very small , very cool 45 nm manufacturing process .
We 've spent the past two decades worrying about building the fastest microprocessors , it turns out that now we 're able to build some very impressive fast enough microprocessors .
The chart below tells an important story :
Manufacturing Process Transistor Count Die Size Intel Pentium ( P5 ) 0.80 µm 3.1 M 294 mm ^2 Intel Pentium Pro ( P6 ) 0.50 µm 5.5 M * 306 mm ^2 * Intel Pentium 4 0.18 µm 42 M 217 mm ^2 Intel Core 2 Duo 65 nm ( 0.065 µm ) 291M 143 mm ^2 Intel Core 2 Duo ( Penryn ) 45 nm 410 M 107 mm^2
In 1993 , it took a great deal of work for Intel to cram 3.1 million transistors onto a near 300 mm ^2 die to make the original Pentium processor .
These days , Intel manufacturers millions of Core 2 Duo processors each made up of 410 million transistors ( over 130 times the transistor count of the original Pentium ) in an area around 1/3 the size .
Intel is n't stopping with Core 2 , Nehalem will offer even greater performance and push transistor counts even further .
By the end of the decade we 'll be looking at over a billion transistors in desktop microprocessors .
What 's interesting however is n't just what Intel can do to push the envelope on the high end , but rather what Intel can now do with simpler designs on the low end .
What 's possible today on 45 nm ...
With a 294 mm ^2 die size , Intel could not manufacture the original Pentium for use in low cost devices however , today things are a bit different .
Intel does n't manufacture chips on a gigantic 0.80 µm process , we 're at the beginnings of a transition to 45 nm .
If left unchanged , Intel could make the original Pentium on its latest 45 nm process with a die size of less than 3 mm ^2 .
Things get even more interesting if you consider that Intel has learned quite a bit in the past 15 years since the debut of the original Pentium .
Imagine what it could do with a relatively simple x86 architecture now .
After reading Robin ’s post last week on easy weeknight meals , I was craving that comfort food classic , tomato soup and grilled cheese .
I ’ve been eating it in various incantations since I was tiny , and I wanted a refined , yet simple version of soup .
I looked through several cookbooks for a filling soup that only required ingredients I had on hand , and when I saw Deborah Madison ‘s Summer Tomato Soup , I knew I would try something similar .
I literally made and enjoyed this dish today and wanted to pass it along .
While not quick ( I let this simmer for an hour and a half or so ) , the hands - on cooking time is next to nothing .
The secret is a ton of shallots , one of my favorite underutilized foods .
Anthony Bourdain once said that shallots were the ingredient in restaurant food that made you iunable to duplicate dishes at home , and he recommended using them frequently as a welcome flavor boost .
I took his advice and believe it to be true .
The soup is great either hot or cold .
Easy Tomato Shallot Soup ( makes four servings )
You ’ll need :
four shallots , peeled and chopped
one clove garlic , peeled and chopped
three tbsp butter , unsalted
six large , ripe tomatoes ( approximately five pounds )
1/2 cup water
1 1/2 cup milk ( I used skim and the taste was still creamy , but you can use any milk or cream you have on hand )
1 tbsp sugar
salt and pepper
Melt the butter in a medium - sized saucepan over medium heat .
Add the chopped shallots and garlic .
Saute approximately two minutes .
While the shallots are cooking , chop the tomatoes into 1 ″ - 2 ″ chunks .
Add the tomatoes to the pan along with sugar and water ( NOTE : add more water if your tomatoes are n’t very juicy ) .
Season with salt to taste .
Simmer over low heat for 1 to 1 1/2 hours , stirring occasionally .
Remove from heat .
Add milk .
Either blend with immersion blender , in food processor , or run through food mill .
Serve with grilled cheese , naturally .
Of course , you can veganize this by sauteeing in olive oil and blending with soy or rice milk .

Sample excerpts :
Additionally , the cost of staying in private campgrounds is increasing , going up by a dollar or more per night each year .
We recently read an article in RVBusiness magazine , written by a campground spokesman , that stated the industry envisions campground prices will eventually reach a level of 50 % the cost of a midlevel hotel or more .
Consequently , if you would normally pay $ 100 a night for a hotel room , you would pay $ 50 a night in an RV park .

Retail Stores and Restaurants
Retail and chain stores often have large , well - lit parking lots .
We have camped at Fred Meyer , Kmart , and Wal - Mart stores ( or Camp Wally as they are more commonly called ) .
In fact , Wal - Mart carries an edition of the Rand McNally road atlas with an insert that lists all of the U.S. and Canadian Wal - Marts .
other options might include discount warehouses , such as Sam ’s Club , or restaurants , such as Cracker Barrel and McDonald’s .
*
Casinos are excellent places for convenience camping .
We do n’t know of any casinos that prohibit overnight camping , unless they have a commercial campground .
Of course , they expect you to patronize the facilities , so at least eat in their restaurants , which often have excellent buffets at reasonable prices . …
With the profusion of casinos being built all over the country , they can make great overnight stops with good food and entertainment .
Some casinos have regular RV parks , but still allow boondocking in certain areas of the parking lot .

You can use flexible water tanks to transport water to the RV .

We have two catalytic heaters — a small one ( 1,600 to 2,800 Btu ) , which is mounted on the wall , and a medium - sized one ( 3,200 to 6,000 Btu ) we can move around as needed .
We ’ve kept warm in some below - freezing temperatures with the catalytic heaters as our only heat source .
Our catalytic propane heater with the folding doors that we made to protect the cabinetry near it .

There is a bit of controversy over whether 6 - volt or 12 - volt batteries are better in a battery bank .
Two of the arguments for using 6 - volt batteries are ( 1 ) there are fewer cables involved in series wiring , so there are fewer connection to corrode ; and ( 2 ) in 12 - volt parallel wiring , one of the batteries in a two - battery bank will receive most of the load and most of the charge , and therefore will fail faster than the other .
The first argument has some validity as there are fewer cables in series wiring , so there is less corrosion .
The second argument is not necessarily true , if you wire the bank as shown above .
if a battery goes bad in a 12 - volt bank , you can just disconnect it and use the remaining one .
You ’ll still be getting 12 volts .
With a 6 - volt bank , however , one bad battery means the loss of the whole two - battery bank .

Should you tilt your panels and follow the sun ? …
We have seen rigs with their panels mounted on racks that allow them to swing around to track the sun .
Frankly , this just seems like too much work to us , plus we do n’t really think it ’s necessary .
Also , when panels are tilted up , they can be more easily damaged by the high winds that occur during the winter months , particularly in desert areas .
Three 100 - watt solar panels installed lengthwise on the roof of a friend ’s motorhome .
What you do n’t know just might help you .
Being unaware of presently accepted , communal beliefs can put you a step ahead of the herd .
It ’s like an artist building a masterpiece from a blank canvas .
Sometimes it ’s better to begin from a clean slate , to create your own way without polluting your mind with external inputs .
Here are a couple examples :
The greatest obstacle to discovery is not ignorance ,
it is the illusion of knowledge .
– Daniel Boorstin
The Route Less Traveled
In the late 1990 ’s my father got an itch to start investing .
He had a decent sum of cash sitting in a savings account and decided it was time to put his money to work .
The savings account returned about 1.5 % a year , so any return above that would be a successful investment .
At the time , the dot com boom was at its inception and everyone was pumping money into tech stocks .
My father did n’t fully understand the stock market and its inherent risks , so instead of investing in tech stocks , he purchased 15 acres of land in an upcoming neighborhood near Hilton Head Island , South Carolina .
He never lost a dime when the dot com bubble busted , and even after the recent downturn in the housing market , his property is currently worth 8 times what he paid for it .
She Did n’t Know Any Better
About a year ago a friend of mine wrote an eBook and put it up for sale on her blog .
I jokingly pointed out to her that all of the information in the eBook was readily available on other blogs / websites for free and indexed correctly by Google .
She was disappointed when I mentioned this , but she left her eBook up for sale anyway .
We both assumed it would n’t sell .
We were wrong .
The eBook has sold to the sum of nearly $ 4 K since last summer .
The Lessons
These two stories carry two significant lessons :
The popular way of doing things is not always the best way .
Sometimes taking action based on ignorance beats taking no action at all .
Knowledge is important .
But occasionally what we know ( or what we think we know ) hinders our ability to take action and make sound judgments .
We become consumed with commonly accepted practices and thus fail to innovate .
We follow the herd instead of thinking for ourselves .
Doing things the same way they ’ve always been done is a sure way to never get ahead .
Just because other people have done things a certain way does n’t make it right .
Quite often you will find the exact opposite to be true .
Being ignorant of popular opinion is a good mindset to be in .
It allows you to form your own opinions based on firsthand experience .
It gives you the freedom to think and to innovate .
Oddly enough , the right kind of ignorance can give you the power to succeed .
Auf inzwischen über 12.400 Aufrufe kommt ein Amateurvideo auf Youtube , auf dem zu sehen ist , wie Polizisten auf der Demonstration " Freiheit statt Angst " am 11 .
Oktober in Berlin Kameras halten .
Polizeiwagen mit Kameras und der Aufschrift " TV - Übertragung " sind vor Ort , Polizisten filmen mit einem Stativ , andere Beamte haben ihre Kameras halb unter der Jacke verborgen .
" Wir machen Übersichtsaufnahmen bei Demonstrationen , falls es Übergriffe gibt , das wird dann für oder gegen uns verwendet " , erklärt ein Pressesprecher der Berliner Polizei .
Ob offen oder verdeckt : Alle Aufnahmen durch die Polizei bei einer öffentlichen Demonstration sind nur unter strengen Auflagen gestattet , sagt Kurt Graulich .
Der Richter am Bundesverwaltungsgericht in Leipzig lehrt an der Humboldt - Universität in Berlin Polizeirecht .
" Es gibt zwei Rechtslagen " , sagt Graulich : Das Versammlungsgesetz und das Berliner Polizeigesetz , und eventuell wäre noch das Bundespolizeigesetz zu berücksichtigen , wenn auch Bundespolizei im Einsatz war .
Beim Versammlungsgesetz handele es sich um eine überkommene bundesrechtliche Grundlage – überkommen , weil es eine abweichende Gesetzgebung der Länder vorsehe , Berlin aber noch kein eigenes Gesetz erlassen habe .
Nach § 12a Versammlungsgesetz darf die Polizei Bild - und Tonaufnahmen von Teilnehmern bei oder im Zusammenhang mit öffentlichen Versammlungen nur dann anfertigen , " wenn tatsächliche Anhaltspunkte die Annahme rechtfertigen , dass von ihnen erhebliche Gefahren für die öffentliche Sicherheit oder Ordnung ausgehen " , so der Gesetzestext .
Diese Regelung sei für Versammlungen , bei denen man befürchten muss , dass Sachen oder Menschen zu Schaden kommen , erklärt Graulich , aber " nicht , wenn von einem friedlichen Verlauf ausgegangen wird " .
Das nämlich rechtfertige keine Aufnahmen .
Und hier wird es interessant : " Eigentlich muss eine Versammlung ja nicht erlaubt werden , sondern bloß angemeldet .
Wenn aber mit erheblichen Gefahren zu rechnen wäre , würde die Versammlung ja verboten werden " , erklärt Graulich .
" Und dann kann man rückschließen : Wenn eine Versammlung nicht verboten wird , wird auch nicht mit erheblichen Gefahren gerechnet , sondern mit einem friedlichen Verlauf . "
Das heißt : Die Polizei darf Aufnahmegeräte bereithalten , aber sie darf sie nicht nutzen , so lange es friedlich bleibt .
" Der Aufbau von Kameras ist ok , aber wenn gefilmt wird – das müssten sie erklären " , sagt Graulich .
Über das Versammlungsgesetz hinaus gilt das Berliner Allgemeine Sicherheits - und Ordnungsgesetz ( BerlASOG , kurz : Polizeigesetz ) .
Darin regelt Paragraph 24 die " Datenerhebung bei öffentlichen Veranstaltungen und Ansammlungen " .
Das betreffe eher zufällige Ansammlungen , " zum Beispiel einen Pulk Fans nach einem Fußballspiel " , erklärt der Verwaltungsrichter , " oder wenn sich bei einer Demonstration Gruppen von Gegendemonstranten bilden und etwas tun , was die Polizei als gefährlich ansieht .
Dann darf die Polizei Bild - und Tonaufnahmen machen , muss sie aber nach spätestens zwei Monaten löschen . "
Ausnahme : Sie werden " zur Verfolgung von Straftaten oder Ordnungswidrigkeiten benötigt [...] oder Tatsachen ( rechtfertigen ) die Annahme ... , dass die Person künftig Straftaten von erheblicher Bedeutung begehen wird " , wie es im Gesetzestext heißt .
Auch das Versammlungsgesetz sieht Löschfristen vor , es schreibt sogar vor , eventuelle Aufnahmen " unverzüglich zu vernichten , soweit sie nicht benötigt werden für die Verfolgung von Straftaten von Teilnehmern oder ... zur Gefahrenabwehr " , so der Gesetzestext ; in letzterem Fall hat die Polizei drei Jahre Zeit .
Da " müssen die Betroffenen im politischen Raum nachfragen , ob Fotomaterial vorhanden ist und ob es rechtzeitig gelöscht wurde " , sagt der Verwaltungsrichter .
Heikel seien Aufnahmen bei einer Demonstration noch aus einem ganz anderen Grund : " Das bewirkt einen enormen Einschüchterungseffekt " , sagt Kurt Graulich .
Das Bundesverfassungsgericht habe im Volkszählungsurteil von 1983 erstmals eine Wechselbeziehung festgestellt , dass man sich einerseits frei auf einer Demonstration bewegt und andererseits einer anonymen Datensammlung ausgesetzt ist .
" Der Einschüchterungseffekt muss vermieden werden , damit die demokratische Freiheit gewahrt bleibt . "
Ungeschickt sei das Mitführen von Kameras auch aus einem ganz anderen Grund , gibt Verwaltungsrichter Graulich zu bedenken : " Das ist rechtspolitisch natürlich schwierig , wenn man ausgerechnet eine Gruppe von Leuten damit konfrontiert , die sensibel wegen ihrer Daten sind . "

Phoenix Mission Status Report
October 30 , 2008
Mission controllers judge the most likely situation to be that declining power has triggered a pre-set precautionary behavior of waking up for only about two hours per day to listen for an orbiter 's hailing signal .
If that is the case , the wake - sleep cycling would have begun at an unknown time when batteries became depleted .
" We will be coordinating with the orbiter teams to hail Phoenix as often as feasible to catch the time when it can respond , " said Phoenix Project Manager Barry Goldstein at NASA 's Jet Propulsion Laboratory , Pasadena , Calif .
" If we can reestablish communication , we can begin to get the spacecraft back in condition to resume science .
In the best case , if weather cooperates , that would take the better part of a week . "
The Phoenix lander has operated at a Martian arctic site for more than two months longer than its initially planned , three - month prime mission . �
The sun stayed above the horizon around the clock during the prime mission , but is now below the horizon for about 7 hours each night .
Engineers at JPL and at Lockheed Martin Space Systems , Denver , operate Phoenix and the two NASA orbiters used for relaying communications with the lander , Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter and Mars Odyssey .
The Phoenix mission is led by Peter Smith of the University of Arizona , Tucson , with project management at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory and development partnership at Lockheed Martin , Denver .
International contributions come from the Canadian Space Agency ; the University of Neuchatel , Switzerland ; the universities of Copenhagen and Aarhus in Denmark ; the Max Planck Institute in Germany ; and the Finnish Meteorological Institute .
The California Institute of Technology in Pasadena manages JPL for NASA .
HEY , LIL ’
Wayne – what was in the bag you were carrying Friday night ?
The rapper – whose album “ Tha Carter III ” was one of the biggest hits of 2008 – was supposed to perform at “ Fashion Rocks ” but left when he found out he ’d have to go through security .
“ When Lil ’ Wayne showed up to perform in the show – and he showed up on time – he was carrying a bag and refused , point blank , to go through security , ” one senior production person told us .
“ Everyone else – including Rihanna , Chris Brown , Beyoncé , Justin Timberlake and Kid Rock – went through security , and we could n’t make an exception .
He ’s obviously not a Boy Scout and has a history with drugs and guns .
“ But he would n’t budge and refused to have his bag searched or have a security wand passed over him .
Then he started getting abusive : ‘ I do n’t need your [ bleeping ] show – I ’m leaving if you make me do this . ’
So he had to leave , I mean , who knows what was in that bag ?
“ He got back in the car we ’d paid for and drove off .
Minutes later , we got frantic calls from his management and record label begging us to have him back .
We said , ‘ OK , we have an opening at 7 p.m. ’
The next thing you know , Wayne ’s people are saying , ‘ Can we do a bit later .
He ’s not going to be ready . ’
“ We had a crew of 250 people waiting for him . . .
Then he calls at , like , 9:30 and says , ‘ I ’m five blocks away , ’ which is like 500 blocks away in New York traffic , so we just pulled the plug .
It was just so disrespectful to the crew and to the 5,000 audience members .
Unbelievable . ”
Lil ’
Wayne ’s manager did n’t return calls .
Meanwhile , the rapper attended a Manhattan court hearing yesterday on whether cops violated his rights after a concert with Ja Rule at the Beacon last November .
That ’s when they stopped and boarded his tour bus and found him sitting on a bed in his boxers , allegedly tossing a Louis Vuitton bag containing a 9 mm gun to the floor , The Post ’s Laura Italiano reports .

Mr McCain ( L ) accused Mr Obama of skipping tough immigration votes US presidential hopefuls Barack Obama and John McCain have both sought to win over a Hispanic civil rights group .
Mr McCain , the Republican candidate , used his speech to La Raza to focus on his support for immigration reform .
Mr Obama on Sunday outlined a plan to offer small firms a 50 % tax credit for setting up health insurance programmes .
In a speech on Monday to a black civil rights group , Mr Obama dismissed criticism that he had been " too tough " on black communities while campaigning .
He told the National Association for the Advancement of Coloured People ( NAACP ) that while the federal government should do more to help black Americans , they must also demand more of themselves .
" Now I know some say I 've been too tough on folks about this responsibility stuff , " he said .
" But I 'm not going to stop talking about it . "
He urged black parents to provide the guidance their children needed and to do more for themselves , their families and their communities .
' Tough votes '
Mr Obama 's remarks at the NAACP annual conference followed a row last week after civil rights leader the Rev Jesse Jackson said he thought Mr Obama was " speaking down to black people " , adding " I want to cut his nuts off " .
Mr Jackson , who did not know his comments were being picked up by a live microphone on US network Fox News , later apologised for his remarks .
I do ask for your trust that when I say , I remain committed to fair , practical and comprehensive immigration reform , I mean it
John McCain During his speech at the La Raza conference on Sunday , Mr Obama accused Mr McCain of dropping his support for immigration reform during the Republican primaries , when it was costing him votes among party activists .
Mr McCain , who courted unpopularity with Republican activists for his votes in favour of new " paths to citizenship " for illegal immigrants , told the audience that they could trust him when it comes to immigration policy .
" I took my lumps for [ voting in favour of immigration reform ] without complaint , " he said .
" I do ask for your trust that when I say , I remain committed to fair , practical and comprehensive immigration reform , I mean it . "
And he accused Mr Obama of failing to consistently support congressional efforts to reform the immigration system .
" Senator Obama declined to cast some of those tough votes , " said Mr McCain .
An AP - Yahoo News poll suggests that Mr Obama leads McCain among Hispanics , with 47 % to the Arizona senator 's 22 % , and 26 % undecided .

What are these ?
Republican presidential candidate John McCain has said he would support the use of Yucca Mountain , 90 miles northwest of Las Vegas , as the dump site for the nation ’s high - level nuclear waste .
That is one of many reasons why Nevadans should vote for Democratic opponent Barack Obama , who has said he would kill the repository plan .
At a campaign stop Sunday in Cedar Falls , Iowa , 1,300 miles away from Southern Nevada , McCain continued to show that he does n’t care about Nevada .
He did so by mocking Obama ’s concerns about how to safely store spent nuclear fuel , something McCain brought up during their last debate .
“ We talked about nuclear power , ” McCain said .
“ Well , it has to be safe environment ( ally ) , blah , blah , blah . ”
That dismissive response , which drew cheers and applause from Iowans at this McCain rally , showed just how out of touch McCain is with the majority of Nevadans , who steadfastly oppose the dump .
If the federal government had instead planned for the dump to be in Arizona , McCain ’s home state , do you think he would have taken Obama ’s remarks so lightly ?
McCain ’s nuclear power response is symbolic of a campaign that has never embraced the deep thought and creative ideas Americans demand in this general election .
Instead , McCain has resorted to shallow catchphrases , name - calling and other negative attacks to appeal to an ever dwindling base of support .
There is nothing funny or trite about nuclear waste .
No one in their right mind would want to live anywhere near a radioactive dump or along any of the routes that would be used to transport the deadly material .
Why should Nevadans , who are concerned about the future of this state , support a candidate who cares so little about their well - being ?
has revealed that she intends to return to the role of Mary Jane Watson in “ . ”
Both directorandare “ in ” for the fourth and fifth installments in the “ Spider - Man ” franchise .
So , Kirsten Dunst does , too .
“ I ’m in , ” she confirmed .
“ I ’m not saying anything , I know there ’s rumours … ”
The actress , whose new film “ ” is released on Friday , spoke to MTV about her future in the franchise .
It is no surprise that Sony would want Dunst to return , since all the major players are coming back .
In fact , Sony has previously mentioned that they would do everything they can to make sure she is Mary Jane in the upcoming “ Spider - Man 4 ” and “ Spider - Man 5 . ”
The script for the film was written by , and so far the studio is being tight - lipped about the villain and who might play the character .
“ Spider - Man 4 ” is scheduled for an April 30 , 2011 release .

US Democratic presidential nominee Barack Obama has hit back at claims by his Republican rival that he associated with " terrorists " .
Mrs Palin said Senator Obama had been " palling around " with an ex-member of 1960s US - based militant group .
Mr Obama said the Republicans were out of touch and trying to distract voters from the real issues .
Alaska Governor Palin has defended the remarks , which she made several times , saying it was " fair to talk about " .
At campaign stops in Colorado and California over the weekend , Mrs Palin attacked Senator Obama over his link to Bill Ayers , a founder of the Weather Underground movement .
The radical movement waged a violent campaign against the Vietnam War during the 1960s and 1970s , when Mr Obama was a child .
Mrs Palin described Mr Obama as someone who saw the US " as being so imperfect ... he is palling around with terrorists who would target their own country " .
In the 1990s , Mr Ayers hosted a Democrat campaign event at his home , attended by Mr Obama .
Mr Obama accused the McCain campaign of engaging in " swift boat " politics - a reference to a campaign of attacks on John Kerry 's military record during the 2004 presidential campaign .
' Out of ideas ' Mr Obama once served on a charity board with Mr Ayers but the White House hopeful has denied having any close association with him or his views and has denounced the Weather Underground group .
Mrs Palin said the issue was fair to talk about He has described Ms Palin 's comments as offensive and false .
The Illinois senator told his supporters at a rally in North Carolina that John McCain was " gambling that he can distract you with smears rather than talk to you about substance " .
" They 'd rather tear our campaign down than lift this country up , " he said .
" That 's what you do when you 're out of touch , out of ideas , and running out of time . "
The party has accused the Republicans of gutter politics .
Ohio Senator Sherrod Brown said that the last few weeks had seen Mr McCain " morph into a desperate angry candidate " and that it made him sad that the McCain campaign was " resorting to these tactics " .
Commentators say Mrs Palin 's attack forms part of a broader Republican strategy to attack Mr Obama 's character .
Turnout vital
The Obama campaign responded with a new advertisement , which will air nationally on cable TV stations , claiming Mr McCain has behaved erratically during the Wall Street meltdown .
Weathermen : Home - grown radicals
The commercial says Mr McCain is attacking Mr Obama personally to distract voter attention from the loss of 750,000 American jobs this year and continuing financial turmoil .
" And John McCain ? " the advertisement asks , before answering : " Erratic in a crisis .
Out of touch on the economy . "
Mrs Palin has defended her comments , saying they were " about an association that has been known but has n't been talked about " .
" I think it 's fair to talk about where Barack Obama kicked off his political career , in the guy 's living room . "
Minnesota Governor Tim Pawlenty , a Republican , said the issue was a test of Mr Obama 's character .
" It goes to the issue of what kind of judgment would allow an unrepentant domestic terrorist to host a political event for you in his home , " he told ABC News .
The row has dominated the media over the weekend and came ahead of a Monday deadline for voters to register in more than a dozen states , including Pennsylvania , Michigan , Ohio , Indiana and Florida .
The latest polls put Barack Obama ahead of John McCain but voter turnout could be vital in deciding the outcome of the 4 November presidential election .
The BBC's Rajini Vaidyanathan in Washington says that with a month to go until polling , the politics on both sides are expected to get much more personal .

What are these ?
OBAMA
What would you do ?
BARTLET GET ANGRIER !
Call them liars , because that ’s what they are .
Sarah Palin did n’t say “ thanks but no thanks ” to the Bridge to Nowhere .
She just said “ Thanks . ”
You were raised by a single mother on food stamps  where does a guy with eight houses who was legacied into Annapolis get off calling you an elitist ?
And by the way , if you do nothing else , take that word back .
Elite is a good word , it means well above average .
I ’d ask them what their problem is with excellence .
While you ’re at it , I want the word “ patriot ” back .
McCain can say that the transcendent issue of our time is the spread of Islamic fanaticism or he can choose a running mate who does n’t know the Bush doctrine from the Monroe Doctrine , but he ca n’t do both at the same time and call it patriotic .
They have to lie  the truth is n’t their friend right now .
Get angry .
Mock them mercilessly ; they ’ve earned it .
McCain decried agents of intolerance , then chose a running mate who had to ask if she was allowed to ban books from a public library .
It ’s not bad enough she thinks the planet Earth was created in six days 6,000 years ago complete with a man , a woman and a talking snake , she wants schools to teach the rest of our kids to deny geology , anthropology , archaeology and common sense too ?
It ’s not bad enough she ’s forcing her own daughter into a loveless marriage to a teenage hood , she wants the rest of us to guide our daughters in that direction too ?
It ’s not enough that a woman should n’t have the right to choose , it should be the law of the land that she has to carry and deliver her rapist ’s baby too ?
I do n’t know whether or not Governor Palin has the tenacity of a pit bull , but I know for sure she ’s got the qualifications of one .
And you ’re worried about seeming angry ?
You could eat their lunch , make them cry and tell their mamas about it and God himself would call it restrained .
There are times when you are simply required to be impolite .
There are times when condescension is called for !
OBAMA
Good to get that off your chest ?
BARTLET
Am I keeping you from something ?
OBAMA
Well , it ’s not as if I did n’t know all of that and it took you like 20 minutes to say .
BARTLET
I know , I have a problem , but admitting it is the first step .
OBAMA
What ’s the second step ?
BARTLET
I do n’t care .
OBAMA
So what about hope ?
Chuck it for outrage and put - downs ?
BARTLET No .
You ’re elite , you can do both .
Four weeks ago you had the best week of your campaign , followed  granted , inexplicably  by the worst week of your campaign .
And you ’re still in a statistical dead heat .
You ’re a 47 - year - old black man with a foreign - sounding name who went to Harvard and thinks devotion to your country and lapel pins are n’t the same thing and you ’re in a statistical tie with a war hero and a Cinemax heroine .
To these aged eyes , Senator , that ’s what progress looks like .
You guys got four debates .
Get out of my house and go back to work .
OBAMA
Wait , what is it you always used to say ?
When you hit a bump on the show and your people were down and frustrated ?
You ’d give them a pep talk and then you ’d always end it with something .
What was it ...?
BARTLET
“ Break ’s over . ”
by Ari Rutenberg
The media have a huge problem with false equivalence .
The need to give the same credence to both sides of an obviously lop - sided argument is endemic at this point .
However it has never been so glaring as in the recent spate of Republican pronouncements about how some parts of America are anti-American , and that any liberals " hate real Americans . "
Aside from the fundamental insult of these assertions , the real problem is that they begin a process of dehumanization .
Though it may not be racist , the current climate and attitude of the Republican party is certainly xenophobic .
They are creating fear of the other .
And it is not just Obama , it is anyone on the left .
They are preparing to delegitimize any left - wing government by dehumanizing those who would support it .

Fortunately it seems to be backfiring .
But an isolated , insular , xenophobic minority will be a massive impediment to addressing the problems of this country .
I sincerely hope this can be reversed before permanent damage is done .
David Finnegan has been a taxi driver for 24 years ( pic Northern Echo ) A Darlington taxi driver says he is prepared to go to jail rather than accept a 160 - year - old law banning him from leaving his cab to spend a penny .
David Finnegan was threatened with disciplinary action by council staff after he used a public toilet while parked up at a town centre rank .
He was told he breached an 1847 law introduced for horse - drawn carriages .
Darlington Council said it had since reviewed the situation and decided to handle the matter informally .
Mr Finnegan , 62 , who has been a cabbie for more than 20 years , said he was confronted by a council enforcement officer after he left his cab to walk 9ft to a public toilet in Darlington town centre .
He said : " This is ridiculous .
It all has to do with horses and carts .
" According to this law I can never , ever leave my vehicle .
Enforcement action " I have had a week of mental and physical torture after all this , I 'm not joking .
" I was even told I could be made to sit in my cab if it was left unattended outside my house at any time of day or night . "
The law in question is the Town Police Clauses Act 1847 , which states " If the driver of any hackney carriage leave it in any street or at any place of public resort or entertainment , whether it be hired or not , without some one proper to take care of it , any constable may drive away such hackney carriage and deposit it . "
In a statement , Darlington Council said : " When considering enforcement action , we assess each case on its merits and have regard to the quality of evidence and whether it is in the public interest to pursue the matter .
" In this case , taking this into account , we have decided to deal with this matter informally . "

What are these ?
One of the dominant themes of the post - debate discussion on cable news is McCain ’s odd , angry behavior during the debate .
During our live - blogging , I mentioned the Bush - like sneer that McCain kept exhibiting .
Josh Marshall noticed it , too :
I said above that McCain did n’t have any freak - out moments .
But he did have that sneer and there did seem to be this thing where he was so contemptuous and angry at Obama that he could n’t get himself to make eye contact .
I think we ’ll hear more about that .
Angry , angry , angry .
Part of the key here is that McCain is clearly miffed that he even has to debate or run again Obama .
He thinks it ’s an insult .
And , yeah , it was really weird and immature that McCain never looked at Obama .
Eugene Robinson also picked up on McCain ’s bad attitude :
Here ’s the politically incorrect way of phrasing one of the central questions about tonight ’s presidential debate : Did John McCain come across as too much of a grumpy old man ?
That might not be a nice question , but it ’s an important one .
Americans like to vote for the nice guy , not the grumbling prophet of doom .
Throughout the 90 - minute debate , McCain seemed contemptuous of Obama .
He would n’t look at him .
He tried to belittle him whenever possible — how many times did he work “ Senator Obama just does n’t understand ” into his answers ?
His body language was closed , defensive , tense .
McCain certainly succeeded in proving that he can be aggressive , but the aggression came with a smirk and a sneer .
Throughout the night , McCain seemed angry and showed his contempt for Obama .
That really does n’t play well .
McCain could n’t control that ugly aspect of his personality at one of the most important events in the campaign .
I think that ’s scary .
You know who we will glamorize ?
Supercriminals .
Those flamboyant , creative types who just go above and beyond .
Sure , what they did was despicable .
But we can all learn from their desire to go beyond the call of duty .
Way beyond .
We would never glamorize criminals .
We do n't want any of our young fans to grow up to rob or steal , at least not from us .
5 Captain Killdozer
Some people in the world you just do n't fuck with .
Unfortunately you can't always tell who those people are until it's too late and such was the case with Marvin Heemeyer .
He lived in a little town in Colorado with a population of about 500 .
He was a welder and owned a muffler repair shop and , presumably for a while , he was a totally non-sinister individual who never even considered doing anything crazy like building a massive , nearly indestructible machine of terror .

For a while .
Then , Heemeyer wound up in a dispute over his land with a cement manufacturing plant .
He leased his business to someone else and sold his property while the new owners gave him six months to vacate .
It was during that six months that Heemeyer built a death machine , a Komatsu D335A bulldozer outfitted with armor plating over the cabin and engine .
The armor in some places was over a foot thick and had concrete between sheets of steel , making it pretty much unstoppable .
The tank was also outfitted with onboard cameras and monitors in the cabin so Heemeyer could see where he was going .
The inside was made nearly airtight to resist a potential gas attack and had air conditioning , food , water and life support .
Once he got in Heemeyer had no plans to actually leave the bulldozer .

Outside , the bulldozer had .50 caliber semi-automatic rifle mounted on the back , and three other semi-automatics mounted elsewhere .
Basically , this was a machine designed to make everyone in his town of 500 take one massive , synchronized fear shit the moment it rolled out of his workshop .
Heemeyer took his machine of insanity out for a spin on June 2 , 2004 by crashing it through the wall of his workshop .

The bulldozer , which came to be known as the Killdozer since that really is the only appropriate name for it , was hit with over 200 rounds of ammunition and three small explosions that barely left a scratch on it .
Eventually the Killdozer got stuck in a basement and the engine failed .

BANGKOK  Thailand ’s political crisis worsened Tuesday when antigovernment protesters trapped lawmakers inside the Parliament building and fought running battles with the police that left one person dead and nearly 400 injured .
The army was deployed on the streets of Bangkok after the worst political violence since 1992 as protesters continued a six - week sit - in outside the prime minister ’s office , forcing the government to conduct its business from a former international airport .
Prime Minister Somchai Wongsawat asserted that he would not step down , and the military repeated a promise not to stage a coup , while the protesters said they would continue their actions until they brought down the government .
They accuse the ruling party of being an extension of the rule of former Prime Minister Thaksin Shinawatra , who was elected on a populist program in 2001 and ousted in a coup in September 2006 .
He now lives in London but continues to exert influence among his allies here .
Yves Smith -- responding to PIMCO ’s Gross -- noted that governments , through the increase in their central bank reserves , have been intervening to support the US financial markets for a while now .
She is , of course , right .
With the help of Paul Swartz of the Council ’s Center for Geoeconomic Studies , I recently was able to get the full data set on the Fed ’s custodial holdings .
The data goes back to the early 1980s -- though the Fed ’s custodial holdings of Agencies only appear in 2001 , presumably when the shrinking stock of outstanding Treasury debt induced central banks to consider alternatives .
The resulting charts need little commentary .
A chart showing the stock clearly indicates something changed in 2002 .

A chart showing the 12 m change ( the " flow " ) shows a peak in the mid 1990s , and then another peak over the past few years .
The peak in the mid 1990s corresponds to strong capital inflows to the emerging world .
But there was a key difference : back then , the emerging world ran an aggregate current account deficit , and the reserve buildup provided ( partial , it turned out ) insurance against a change in flows .
The reserve buildup today comes even as the emerging world runs , in aggregate , a substantial current account surplus .
Two other points .
One , I suspect that over time the FRBNY ’s custodial holdings captures a somewhat smaller share of total central bank dollar holdings .
Consequently , the rise in central bank inflows recently is probably even stronger than what shows up in the FRBNY data .
Two , a chart comparing the Fed ’s own assets to its custodial holdings is kind of interesting .
It suggests that something fundamental changed in this decade .
I personally think it supports a point I made earlier this month , and again yesterday : foreign central banks now are in a position where they can influence , through their asset allocation , the allocation of credit inside the US economy .
Remember that the Fed is trying to mitigate financial market distress by changing the composition of its balance sheet -- and right now , the aggregated dollar balance sheet of the world ’s other central banks is much larger than the Fed ’s own dollar balance sheet .
I suspect that one of the reasons why PIMCO ’s McCulley is worried about deleveraging is that central banks still disproportionately buy Treasuries .
That has added to the mismatch between demand and supply in the market .
Big existing balance sheets that until the crisis had a decent appetite for risk need to shrink .
And some of the big balance sheets that are growing most rapidly right now do n’t seem interested in credit market risk .
Not right now .
One result : the Fed has sold lots of Treasuries into the market to lend to financial institutions holdings somewhat riskier assets .
Another is that the Treasury itself is poised to sell Treasuries and buy Agencies , effectively adding another source of balance sheet support for risk assets .
Note : this post was slightly edited , as explained in the comments .
I initially said deficit in one place where I meant surplus .
I ’ve posted my slides from tomorrow morning ’s Haskell tutorial on Slideshare .
( There ’s a downloadable PDF version , too , if you find that an easier format to deal with . )
I ’ve also posted a Mercurial repository of the slide source code , in case anyone would like to cannibalise the slides for their own purposes .

David Talbot writes in Salon today about his interview with Rev. Howard Bess , a Baptist Minister in Palmer , Alaska , and the author of Pastor , I am Gay , one of the books in the book banning controversy surrounding former Mayor Sarah Palin and the Wasilla Library .
Talbot also reveals that Palin has been involved in street protests attempting to prevent women from their legal rights to obtain an abortion in Alaska .
Soon after the book controversy , Bess found himself again at odds
with Palin and her fellow evangelicals .
In 1996 , evangelical churches
mounted a vigorous campaign to take over the local hospital ’s community
board and ban abortion from the valley .
When they succeeded , Bess and
Dr. Susan Lemagie , a Palmer OB - GYN , fought back , filing suit on behalf
of a local woman who had been forced to travel to Seattle for an
abortion .
The case was finally decided by the Alaska Supreme Court ,
which ruled that the hospital must provide valley women with the
abortion option .
At one point during the hospital battle , passions ran so hot that
local antiabortion activists organized a boisterous picket line outside
Dr. Lemagie ’s office , in an unassuming professional building across
from Palmer ’s Little League field .
According to Bess and another
community activist , among the protesters trying to disrupt the
physician ’s practice that day was Sarah Palin .
Another valley activist , Philip Munger , says that Palin also helped
push the evangelical drive to take over the Mat - Su Borough school
board .
" She wanted to get people who believed in creationism on the
board , " said Munger , a music composer and teacher .
" I bumped into her
once after my band played at a graduation ceremony at the Assembly of
God .
I said , ‘ Sarah , how can you believe in creationism — your
father ’s a science teacher . ’
And she said , ‘ We do n’t have to agree on
everything .’

Abortion .

" I pushed her on the earth ’s creation , whether it was really less
than 7,000 years old and whether dinosaurs and humans walked the earth
at the same time .
And she said yes , she ’d seen images somewhere of
dinosaur fossils with human footprints in them . "
Munger also asked Palin if she truly believed in the End of Days ,
the doomsday scenario when the Messiah will return .
" She looked in my
eyes and said , ‘ Yes , I think I will see Jesus come back to earth in my
lifetime . ’ "
Bess is unnerved by the prospect of Palin — a woman whose mind is
given to dogmatic certitude — standing one step away from the Oval
Office .
" It ’s truly frightening that someone like Sarah has risen to
the national level , " Bess said .
" Like all religious fundamentalists —
Christian , Jewish , Muslim — she is a dualist .
They view life as an
ongoing struggle to the finish between good and evil .

While it has n’t yet decided to offer a cloud computing service , Hewlett - Packard today said it will combine its high - performance computing unit with it ’s Web 2.0 and cloud computing infrastructure businesses to create the Scalability Computing Initiative , a name that will refer both to a business unit of HP and a set of hardware , software and services tied to scalable computing .
It also followed its competitors and introduced what HP believes will be the building block for the scalable data center , a new , two - in - one blade server .
Like IBM ’s iDataPlex , Sun ’s Blackbox and Dell ’s cloud computing efforts , HP is viewing the noise around cloud computing as a chance to sell more hardware — specialized , HP - built 10u racks of 32 blade servers containing 128 cores , to be exact .
I do n’t know how important it is to build out scalable computing efforts with IBM ’s iDataPlex or HP ’s offerings rather than an array of commodity x86 boxes , but the merging of high - performance computing and cloud computing infrastructure is a triumph of the grid architecture running specialized software .
It ’s also the same trend that is leading Cray to work with Intel on designing the next generation of supercomputers .
HP ’s blade servers are designed to save space in the data centers , but Paul Miller , a VP of marketing with HP , acknowledged that space was not at the premium that power is .
Blade servers run pretty hot so it ’s counterintuitive to think that cramming two of them in one blade makes much sense from an energy efficiency point of view .
Miller said HP ’s offering can be used with standard HP racks for water cooling or in conjunction with its Dynamic Smart Cooling technology .
Without knowing how many watts are consumed , it ’s hard to judge how energy efficient these blades are .
Update : HP has provided more information with regard to the server ’s efficiency saying it ran in tests at 165 watts per server , and emphasizes that the servers are 60 % more efficient than stand alone boxes in part because they combine two servers into one shell , requiring one fan and power supply for double the compute power .
Fox Interactive Media is one of HP ’s clients , so clearly there ’s a market for HP ’s brand of two - in - one blades , but HP will have to compete with existing hardware vendors such as Rackable and Silicon Metrics , who seem to be doing fine providing energy - efficient scalable hardware for Web 2.0 and cloud computing companies .
Are You Afraid to Laugh ?
Cheap Laughs
Laughter and jokes and play are undervalued in our serious adult world .
We think of all of these as entertainment , just a way to escape the stress and burdens of a threatening world which weighs us down .
Do you ever feel like you ’re carrying more than you can bear ?
Laughter picks up those burdens , and takes them away from us , if only for a moment .
A break from our worries is great .
But laughter is much more than an escape .
Laughter can heal .
Studies show that laughter has a positive effect on our health , while negative moods are not good for us .
Sometimes , laughter is a wonderful expression of joy and happiness .
To me , nothing is more beautiful than a heartfelt smile .
I think that our spirit shines through those moments , clear and bright .
But , there are times and places where laughter and humor are not welcome at all .
Laugh during a funeral , a serious speech , or during a solemn religious service , and see what reaction you get !
You ’ll be called disrespectful or strange ( at best ) .
What is this struggle between laughter and serious events ?
How did laughter become the enemy of solemn , important occasions ?
I think it ’s because laughter and its extreme cousin , cynicism , are often used to attack and destroy .
We often laugh at things that we find ridiculous or foolish , even when other people find those same things important or sacred .
Laughter can shatter an important moment , and turn it to dust .
Tragically , we sometimes use laughter to pretend that something truly important to us is ridiculous or foolish .
It ’s our way of hiding from questions within us that need answers , or hiding from actions that we must do .
The Jester and the Trickster
In medieval times , it was common for kings to have a court jester .
The jester was the one person who could joke about almost anything and get away with it .
He was there to entertain the king .
Sometimes his humor would be cruel and destructive to those who he joked about .
But often , he was there to raise important questions .
His job was to trick people into questioning the things that they otherwise would never question .
In the stories and mythology of many cultures there is the character of the trickster .
Sometimes this character is evil , and he seems to exist to bring out the worst in people , and lead them to harm themselves and others .
At other times , this character is a troublemaker , who does n’t let people continue undisturbed in their everyday lives .
He forces them to see the foolishness and weakness in themselves .
If the victims of his tricks do n’t do anything with that knowledge , then the trickster is just an annoying character .
But if he succeeds in waking them up , he has performed an incredible service to them .
Playing With Fire
Laughter is like fire or any powerful tool .
It can be used to wake us up , to move us along the path of personal growth , to bring us healing and joy , or to destroy .
I ’ve spoken before ( in Caution : Shape Shifters at Play and Why are we afraid to Play ? ) about the power of play that enables us to try out other ways of thinking and acting .
You are the ultimate possibility machine .
Did you ever think about how many different lives might be possible for a single person ?
Even you .
Sure , you pretend that everything must be exactly as it is , but that ’s the voice of fear speaking .
We ’re caught in a whirlwind of fear — fear of change , fear of facing a world where anything can happen .
We all find ourselves stuck , caught in a world made small by our habits and mindless rules .
Fortunately , there are certain forces in our lives that have the power to suspend our habits and our rules , to suspend the certainty that life can only be just as it is .
Laughter and play are two such forces .
They are like a reset button which shuts off all the little programs and voices within us that are running our lives .
Do you feel the lightness and the freedom that comes with play and positive laughter ?
It ’s not that we ’ve escaped responsibility .
We ’ve entered an abundant , open space where possibility is real , free of our limiting beliefs .
So , how will you use the power of laughter and play ?
You can use those forces against others to try to hurt them , to leave them temporarily or permanently without the comfort of their habits and beliefs .
You can use those forces to help others .
Better yet , begin with yourself .
Use laughter , play , and imagination to open up a space of possibility in your life .
Will you get nervous without your habits of thought , feeling , and action to tell you who to be and what to do ?
Yes .
The emptiness and fear may lead you to jump back into the familiar , or fill the moments with a simple game that does n’t question your life .
But you have another choice .
You could play at being someone else for a few moments .
Or , perhaps , you could play at being someone else for the rest of your life .
Irish author Eoin Colfer poses in this undated publicity photograph .
REUTERS / Handout
LONDON ( Reuters ) - Children ’s author Eoin Colfer is to write a sixth novel in the “ Hitchhiker ’s Guide to the Galaxy ” series , seven years after the death of its creator Douglas Adams , publishers Penguin said on Wednesday .
The Irish writer , best known for his Artemis Fowl fairy stories , has the blessing of Adams ’ widow , Jane Belson , to continue the bestselling science fiction saga .
Called “ And Another Thing ... , ” the new novel will be published in October 2009 .
Colfer said he was a big fan of the original books , which started as a BBC radio serial .
“ For years I have been finishing this incredible story in my head and now I have the opportunity to do it in the real world , ” he said in a statement .
“ It is a gift from the gods .
So , thank you Thor and Odin . ”
The satirical books tell the story of a hapless Englishman called Arthur Dent who travels the universe after the Earth is demolished to make way for a hyperspace bypass .
The saga centers on the search for the answer to “ life , the universe and everything , ” which after a long wait turns out to be 42 .
Penguin Managing Director Helen Fraser said she hoped Colfer would attract new readers to the books .
Adams died from a heart attack in California in 2001 at the age of 49 .
He had hoped to finish the series with a sixth novel .
“ Five seems to be a wrong kind of number ; six is a better kind of number , ” he once said .
Take your photos to the next level .
In the last few days , video footage of her describing the Iraq war as " a task from God " and urging trainee pastors to pray for a new gas pipeline as " God 's will " has been unearthed and posted on YouTube .
As a fundamentalist Christian who advocates the teaching of intelligent design ( a form of biblical creationism ) in schools and opposes abortion even when a mother was raped or her life is at risk , her beliefs certainly appeal to the hardline Religious Right but may deter more mainstream swing voters .
Cellular damage due to stress is an important factor in aging processes .
It is therefore strange that starving , which is stressful , decelerates aging processes and extends the lifespan of organisms .
Proteins from the sirtuin family contribute to this mechanism but the exact function of the seven members of the sirtuin family in mammals has not yet been clarified .
Results obtained in studies performed by protein research scientists in Bochum and Dortmund under the auspices of Assistant Professor Dr. Clemens Steegborn ( Institute for Physiological Chemistry at RUB ) have supplied first insights into this phenomenon .
The scientists identified initial functions of the two human sirtuins Sirt3 and Sirt5 that reside in mitochondria , the energy supplying “ cellular power stations . ”
Sirtuin .
The mitochondria within the cell are responsible for the provision of energy by utilizing food molecules .
This fact suggests that sirtuins located at this site should be involved in the life - prolonging effect of nutritional deficiency .
The scientists did , however , discover that Sirt5 is not only located within the mitochondria , but also within the so - called intermembrane space between the exterior and interior membrane of the mitochondria .
At this site , Sirt5 can modify the protein cytochrome c , which plays a major role in both , energy generation and the cellular self - destruction program , i.e. apoptosis , the reaction to extreme cellular stress .
Dr. Steegborn states “ that malfunctioning of apoptosis could be an explanation for the presumed role of Sirt 5 in some forms of cancer , but that the precise function of Sirt5 and the modification of cytochrome c have not yet been finally clarified . ”
The scientists were , however , able to identify a precisely defined function for Sirt3 .
They were able to show that two central metabolic enzymes are altered and thereby activated .
This activation enables the cells , if subject to a lack of food , to make use of other sources of energy and to use these effectively .
More specifically , Sirt3 activates special forms of these enzymes that simultaneously form NADPH , which is required for the regeneration of cellular anti-stress systems .
This explains how increased Sirt3 activity during starvation can contribute to a prolonged lifespan .
Long - term target : healthy aging
Diverse research groups have been able to show that increased sirtuin activity can increase the lifespan of model organisms .
The situation is , however , more complex in human beings because different sirtuins are located at diverse sites in the cell and all have specific functions .
The current research work , performed by the scientists in Bochum and Dortmund , are a first step towards the comprehension of these processes .
Exact understanding of the specific functions is however a prerequisite to enable utilization of the correct sirtuin as target molecule for the desired therapeutic effect .
Dr. Steegborn assumes that this will probably not lead to a life - prolonging elixir .
The scientists do , however , hope to be able to identify agents that enable the treatment of age - related diseases .
This in turn would enable “ healthy aging . ”

This news is , of course , insane , but a new poll indicates that Prop 8 is pulling ahead .
If it wins , then a group of Utah Mormons will have seized control of the California Constitution , giving themselves the power to veto any California marriage they want .
Like we said : it 's insane .
So , what can you do ?
Plenty .
Start by calling everyone you know RIGHT NOW to tell them that this is the big one .
This is the election in which anyone who cares about civil rights absolutely MUST vote .
You have until October 20 to register -- do it now .
And make sure every person you know is registered , too .
And when you tell them about Prop 8 , here 's some talking points :
Namely , that Prop 8 is a bunch of lies .
- They say it 'll protect kids from learning about gay marriage in schools , but it wo n't .
- They say it 'll protect churches from lawsuits , but it wo n't .
( Marriage bans actually restrict free exercise ; California clergy call them " excessive government entanglement . " )
- They say it 'll strengthen marriage , but it wo n't -- you can't " save " marriage by giving control to one religious group so they can arbitrarily withhold it .
Prop 8 means more unmarried couples , and less protection for the 52,000 California families with kids .
- They say that Californians supported a marriage ban in 2000 -- but this is different .
Unlike last time , Prop 8 introduces a brand new limit on marriage .
And this time , the marriage ban had to come from out - of - state because Californians do n't want it .
So .
There you go .
Get to work .
Disclosure : SFist_Matt is hard at work on a website and some videos that explain just how awful Prop 8 is .
So , he 's not exactly neutral on the subject .
Ohio Republicans were just handed a defeat by the Supreme Court for the voter registration controversy :
The Supreme Court is siding with Ohio's top elections official in a dispute with the state Republican Party over voter registrations .
The justices on Friday overruled a federal appeals court that had ordered Ohio's top elections official to do more to help counties verify voter eligibility .
Secretary of State Jennifer Brunner , a Democrat , faced a deadline of Friday to set up a system to provide local officials with names of newly registered voters whose driver 's license numbers or Social Security numbers on voter registration forms do n't match records in other government databases .
Jack Thompson Disbarred Permanently [ Updated , Thompson Responds ]
It was previously reported that Thompson was recommended a ten - year " enhanced disbarment " from the Florida Bar in connection to his 27 guilty counts of misconduct .
It turns out that the recommendation was later upgraded by the Bar to full - blown permanent disbarment and the court presiding over Thompson 's case concurred , according to Kotaku .
Thompson now has thirty days to close out his practice -- in " the interests of existing clients . "
Adding to his problems , " no motion for rehearing will be considered unless signed by a member in good standing of The Florida Bar other than [ Thompson ] . "
That is , if Thompson wants to seek a retrial , he has to have another Bar member vouch for him -- something no one has done in his current trial .
Thompson has responded to the disbarment by filing a motion for rehearing -- despite the legal inefficacy of doing so without another Bar member to do it on his behalf .
In a news release on Kotaku , Thompson has taken to writing Boston Legal fan - fiction :
The timing of this disbarment transparently reveals its motivation :
This past Friday Thompson filed a federal civil rights action against The Bar , the Supreme Court , and all seven of its Justices .
This rush to disbarment is in retribution for the filing of that federal suit .
With enemies this foolish , Thompson needs only the loyal friends he has .
...
Thompson always wanted to own a Bar .
Now , armed with multiple US Supreme Court rulings that no state bar can do what it has done to Thompson , he is set to own that Bar .

Dear Project For Excellence in Journalism : please just stop .
Stop doing these studies or just stop releasing your so - called " empirical " findings to the press .
Because Howard Kurtz " reporting " that the press is so mean to John McCain and so nice to Barack Obama all the time is not " excellent journalism . "
It is more like " the Project for No Context and More Bullshit in Journalism . "
Christ , PEJ , how does it further excellent journalism , learning this factoid :
The most negative element of the Palin coverage involved scrutiny of her record as Alaska governor , with 64 percent of the stories carrying a negative tone and just 7 percent positive .
The coverage of her interview with ABC's Charlie Gibson was a wash , but stories about her subsequent sitdown with CBS 's Katie Couric were 57 percent negative and 14 percent positive .
Are journalists actually supposed to write one nice story about how totally pretty Governor Palin is for every piece they file on how she 's a petty tinpot PTA mom - from - hell who somehow manages to abuse what little power the governor of Alaska actually has ?
What purpose does this study serve , Project for Excellence in Journalism , except to encourage John McCain to think it 's not fair and it's not his fault and everyone was mean to him ?
October 21st , 2008 at 06:38 am Posted by Eli
Hey , remember when Lieberman said that McCain told the campaign not to use Reverend Wright against Obama ?
Well , that was before John Lewis hurt his feelings .
John McCain ’s campaign manager says he is reconsidering using Barack Obama ’s relationship with Reverend Jeremiah Wright as a campaign issue during the election ’s closing weeks .
In an appearance on conservative Hugh Hewitt ’s radio program , Davis said that circumstances had changed since John McCain initially and unilaterally took Obama ’s former pastor off the table .
The Arizona Republican , Davis argued , had been jilted by the remarks of Rep. John Lewis , who compared recent GOP crowds to segregationist George Wallace ’s rallies .
And , as such , the campaign was going to “ rethink ” what was in and out of political bounds .
“ Look , John McCain has told us a long time ago before this campaign ever got started , back in May , I think , that from his perspective , he was not going to have his campaign actively involved in using Jeremiah Wright as a wedge in this campaign , ” he said late last week .
“ Now since then , I must say , when Congressman Lewis calls John McCain and Sarah Palin and his entire group of supporters , fifty million people strong around this country , that we ’re all racists and we should be compared to George Wallace and the kind of horrible segregation and evil and horrible politics that was played at that time , you know , that you ’ve got to rethink all these things .
And so I think we ’re in the process of looking at how we ’re going to close this campaign .
We ’ve got 19 days , and we ’re taking serious all these issues . ”
McCain has reportedly avoided discussion of Wright because of its racial implications .
Apparently , since he already stands accused of stoking crowd anger akin to the South in the 1960s , his campaign just might be willing to walk down that slippery slope and risk justifying Lewis ’ proclamation .
Editor 's Note : This " Sustainable Developments " column will be printed in the December 2008 issue of Scientific American .
The origin of the U.S. financial crisis is that commercial banks and investment banks lent vast sums — trillions of dollars — for housing purchases and consumer loans to borrowers ill - equipped to repay .
The easy lending pushed up housing prices around the U.S. , which then ratcheted still higher when speculators bought houses on the expectation of yet further price increases .
When the easy lending slowed and then stopped during 2006 - 07 , the housing prices peaked and began to fall .
The housing boom began to unravel and now threatens an economy - wide bust .
The U.S. economy faces four cascading threats :
First , the sharp decline in consumer spending on houses , autos and other durables , following the sharp decline in lending to households , will cause a recession as construction of new houses and production of consumer durables nosedive .
Second , many homeowners will default on their mortgage payments and consumer loans , especially as house values fall below the mortgage values .
Third , the banking sector will cut back sharply on its lending in line with the fall in its capital following the write - off of bad mortgage and consumer loans .
Those capital losses will push still more financial institutions into bankruptcy or forced mergers with stronger banks .
Fourth , the retrenchment of lending now threatens even the shortest - term loans , which banks and other institutions lend to each other for working capital .
Interbank loans and other commercial paper are extremely hard to place .
The gravest risks to the economy come back to front .
The fourth threat is by far the worst .
If the short - term commercial paper and money markets were to break down , the economy could go into a severe collapse because solvent and profitable businesses would be unable to attract working capital .
Unemployment , now at 6 percent of the labor force , could soar to more than 10 percent .
That kind of liquidity collapse was the basic reason why Asian national incomes declined by around 10 percent between 1997 and 1998 , and why the U.S. economy fell by around 25 percent during the Great Depression .
The third threat , the serious impairment of bank capital as banks write off their bad loans , could cause a severe recession , but not a depression .
Unemployment might rise , for example , up to 10 percent , which would create enormous social hardships .
The ongoing fall in bank capital as the housing boom turns to bust is already forcing banks to cut back their outstanding loans significantly , because they must keep the lending in proportion to their now - shrunken capital base .
Major investment projects , such as acquisition of new buildings and major machinery , are being scaled back .
Some major nonfinancial companies will likely go bankrupt as well .
The second threat , the financial distress of homeowners , will certainly be painful for millions of households , especially the ones that borrowed heavily in recent years .
Many will lose their homes ; some will be pushed into bankruptcy .
Some may see their credit terms eased in renegotiations with their banks .
Consumers as a group will start to become net savers again after years of heavy net borrowing .
That trend will not be bad in the long term but will be painful in the short run .
The first threat , the cutback in sales of housing and other consumer durables , is the Humpty - Dumpty of the economy that can not be put back together .
The inventory of unsold homes is now large ; housing demand and new construction will be low for many years .
Consumer spending on appliances and autos is also plummeting .
All these consequences are largely unavoidable and will force the U.S. into at least a modest recession , with unemployment likely to rise temporarily to perhaps 8 percent .
The goal of any new policy cannot be to prevent a recession .
It 's too late to stop such a downturn .
The goal can not be to save every bank .
The U.S. economy has built up too many imbalances — consumer debt , overextended construction , impaired capital of banks — to avoid an economic downturn and a major retrenchment of the banking sector .
The goal must be to avoid an outright collapse or deep recession .
Two actions are therefore critical , and two more are subsidiary but still important .
Most important , the government and Federal Reserve Board must prevent the collapse of working capital by supplying short - term loans and taking other measures to sustain the commercial paper market , interbank lending and the smooth functioning of money market funds .
They have the instruments to do so , and should use them aggressively .
The government should also aggressively promote a recapitalization of the banking system so that bank lending is not squeezed for years to come .
It can directly inject some public capital into banks , and can both pressure and entice the banks to raise additional private capital .
Unfortunately , the $ 700 - billion bailout nearing approval in Congress does not focus adequately on those liquidity or recapitalization challenges .
The legislation is better than nothing ( to help forestall panic ) but the real work of stabilizing and recapitalizing the banking system will now await the next administration , and the Federal Reserve will need to stay aggressive in preventing a liquidity collapse . "
Two additional steps will be useful .
The first will be to ease the repayment terms on existing mortgage holders , to reduce the flood of defaults and foreclosures that will otherwise occur .
The second is to encourage expansionary monetary and fiscal policies abroad ( most notably in cash - rich Asia ) , so that the decline in U.S. consumer spending is smoothly offset by a rise in spending in other countries .
This overseas expansion would allow the U.S. to offset the fall in housing construction by a rise in exports , and would allow other countries to offset the fall in their exports to the U.S. by a rise in their internal demand .
All these steps will have to await the next administration .
A schoolboy posed as a female British secret service spy in an internet chatroom to persuade a friend to try to murder him , a court heard yesterday .
The boy , John , now 15 , groomed a 16 - year - old boy , Mark ( both pseudonyms to protect the children ) , with an " elaborate matrix of deceit " involving six fictional characters in the MSN chatroom and correspondence totalling 56,000 lines of text .
The fictions created by John , then 14 , convinced Mark that he was murdering someone who had a terminal brain tumour .
He was told that his reward would be money , a job as a British secret service agent and sex with the spy , whom he believed was a middle - aged woman .
In fact , John was determined to get himself killed , which is why he never used the abort code - 6969 - that he provided .
Manchester Crown Court heard that John , who had fallen in love with Mark , also tricked him into performing sex acts on a webcam before tricking him into stabbing him twice in an alleyway at Altrincham on 29 June last year .
Though John 's life was in the balance for a time , he did not die and was released from hospital after a week .
Over a nine - month period before the attempted murder , John began presenting himself as a 16 - year - old girl in search of a cyber relationship , then " introduced " himself as the girl 's step - brother .
John and Mark then physically met , as did their parents , but in the chatroom John introduced increasingly far - fetched characters , including another boy who " stalked " John and supposedly killed his girlfriend .
Another of the characters was then fictitiously killed off , leaving only Mark , John and the stalker .
Other characters emerged and were killed off , one even came back from the dead .
But by the time of a crucial chatroom conversation on 28 June , John was still convinced by the order - from the " spy " - to kill Mark .
John asked the " spy " : U want me 2 take him 2 trafford centre [ shopping centre , near Manchester ] and kill him in the middle of the trafford centre ??
thats wot ur asking me ?
Mark replied : Yes
John :
And just leave him 2 die in the trafford centre ?
Mark :
No stay with him
John :
And wot do I do then ?
Get help ?
Mark :
Yes I 'll get help for you .
The following day the two boys met and went to the Trafford Centre where they bought a kitchen knife .
They then went to Altrincham town centre where Mark stabbed John twice , once in the chest and once in the stomach .
Mark called the ambulance and told police officers they had been attacked but after CCTV footage disproved his story , he was charged with attempted murder .
Police only became aware of the labyrinthine plot when they examined John 's computer .
After months of analysis , detectives were able to establish that it was John who sent the final messages from his home computer on the night of 28 June 2003 and had planned his own murder .
Mark pleaded guilty to attempted murder , was given a two - year supervision order and banned from any contact with John .
John pleaded guilty to perverting the course of justice and incitement to murder .
He was given a three - year supervision order , banned from any contact with Mark and was told he must only access the internet under adult supervision and must not enter chatrooms .
Passing sentence Judge Maddison said : " Skilled writers of fiction would struggle to conjure up a plot such as that which arises here .
It 's staggering to be dealing with a case that arises out of a 14 - year - old boy 's invention of false personalities , false relationships and events arranged for his own killing . "
He told Mark : " So convincingly were the characters presented to you that you really did believe you had been recruited by the Secret Service to kill your co-accused and face the consequences if you did not do so . "
Detective Chief Inspector Julian Ross said John 's actions remained baffling .
" He says he is unhappy at home , but there is nothing we are aware of . "
THE CHAT - ROOM EVIDENCE
On June 28 , 2003 , the " Spy " and Boy A planned the killing in achatroom :
8.50 pm Boy A : he will die in the middle of alti ??
Spy : please !
Boy A : but thats wot will happen

Spy : shouted over tanoy
Belfast Telegraph
A second front
The Electronic Frontier Foundation Thursday opened what attorney Kevin Bankston called the " second front in our battle to stop the NSA 's illegal surveillance of millions of ordinary Americans , " with a lawsuit targeting top administration officials who approved or implemented the National Security Agency 's program of warrantless surveillance .
At the heart of the suit is a surprising and complex question that legal experts say remains radically unsettled : Can a computer eavesdrop ?
The first front in this fight is EFF 's ongoing lawsuit against telecom firms believed to have participated in the NSA program , which the group once thought would be the quickest way to get at the underlying question of whether the NSA program was itself lawful .
But that litigation spurred Congress to pass the FISA Amendments
Act this summer , granting retroactive immunity to the defendant companies , provided the Attorney General certifies that they received assurances from the government that the surveillance was lawful .
While EFF believes the immunity provision to be unconstitutional , Bankston acknowledged in a press teleconference this afternoon that " litigating that question is going to slow us down . "
They 've therefore decided to cut out the middleman and target the government directly .
The new suit , Jewel v. NSA , seeks both injunctive relief — the cessation of the program and the destruction of records obtained through it — and civil damages from the officials most responsible for the program .
EFF 's complaint alleges that the program violates the Constitution , the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act , the Wiretap Act , and the Stored Communications Act.
Bankston believes the new suit is likely to be shunted to the docket of California judge Vaughn Walker , who has heard both the consolidated telecom lawsuits and a number of other cases implicating the NSA program .
President Bush is a named defendant
In addition to government agencies — the Department of Justice and National Security Agency — the lawsuit names a number of administration officials as defendants , in both their official capacities and as private individuals : President Bush , Vice President Dick Cheney , Cheney 's chief of staff David Addington , as well as the the attorneys general , NSA directors , directors of national intelligence , and an indeterminate number of unknown " John Does " who played some role in authorizing and implementing the warrantless wiretapping .
Bankston said that EFF is asking for civil damages from all of these officials — with the exception of the president , who enjoys immunity from civil liability for actions in office — in order to secure " personal accountability from the architects of the program , and to provide a strong incentive against future lawbreaking by these or other government officials . "
The plaintiffs are the same as those in the telecom case , Hepting v. AT&T , with one more added for good measure .
All are ordinary citizens of a " nationwide class of customers of all AT&T residential phone and internet service providers , " and their standing to bring suit relies not on any contention that they were specific targets of NSA surveillance , but on the claim that the government was indiscriminately vacuuming up vast quantities of data , to be filtered by the government according to algorithms known only to them .
This claim rests in large part on evidence provided by AT&T whistleblower Mark Klein , who has provided documentation attesting to the existence of a secret room in AT&T 's Folsom Street facility in San Francisco , where fiber optic cables were diverted through a sophisticated Narus traffic analysis machine .
As EFF attorney Cindy Cohn notes , this is a hub facility through which both purely domestic and international traffic are routed , whereas a program targeting exclusively international or domestic - to - foreign communications should be situated at the point where " the wire hits the beach . "
The Folsom Street room is believed to be only one of many similar interception stations .
According to a March report in the Wall Street Journal , " current and former intelligence officials confirmed a domestic network of hubs , but did n't know the number . "
This is where things get murky .
The case EFF plans to make — and , indeed , their plaintiffs ' standing to bring suit — rests on the premise that the wholesale diversion of domestic communications to the government 's filtering device in itself constitutes a search or seizure beyond the bounds of both the Fourth Amendment and federal wiretap statutes — including the new FISA Amendments
Act , which gave the Attorney General broad discretion to authorize the collection of communications , including domestic - to - international communications , provided the " target " of the investigation is a foreign person or group .
But the government has never accepted that premise .
During the 2000 controversy over the FBI 's use of ( now superseded ) packet - sniffing software dubbed " Carnivore , " officials argued that the ephemeral copying of data into memory for the purpose of filtering out targeted material did not itself impinge upon privacy interests .
Sifting that took place " inside the box " did not amount to a Fourth Amendment " search " until data was actually recorded in a human - readable form .
Judge Richard Posner applied this argument to still more intrusive data mining practices in a much - discussed 2006 article in The New Republic .
" A computer search does not invade privacy or violate FISA , because a computer program is not a sentient being , " wrote Posner .
" But , if the program picked out a conversation that seemed likely to have intelligence value and an intelligence officer wanted to scrutinize it , he would come up against FISA 's limitations . "

Once again , the brain - dead American public will be fleeced , this time by the Treasury Department .
Now that Russia has decimated the Georgian economy after its ethnic cleaning foray into South Osettia , the U.S. government will make sure the International Monetary Fund , World Bank and European Bank for Reconstruction and Development do n’t lose a penny and Wall Street has its investment returns socialized .
WASHINGTON ( Reuters ) – The United States is exploring ways to assist Georgia ’s economy including how global financial institutions can help limit economic damage caused by the conflict with Russia , a senior U.S. Treasury official said Friday .
Assistant Treasury Secretary Clay Lowery said the situation in Georgia was “ fluid ” and it was hard to know how much harm was done to the economy and investor confidence since the crisis erupted over the breakaway South Ossetia region .
“ We want to be supportive of the Georgia economic situation going forward and that includes bilateral and multilateral needs , ” Lowery said in an interview with Reuters .
While the White House has flexed its political muscle to force Russia to pull troops out of the region , the U.S. Treasury has tried to reassure investors over Georgia ’s young democracy .
“ The most important thing is for the fighting to stop ( but we also ) want to ensure there is confidence so that investor flows continue , ” Lowery said .
He said the U.S. wanted to make sure that the conflict did not take away from the impressive economic progress and reforms in Georgia that produced China - like growth levels of 11 percent in 2007 despite Russian trade and transit barriers .

Not sure how it came to this so fast , but the New York Times ( NYT ) is approaching the point where it will have to manage its business primarily to conserve cash and avoid defaulting on its debt .
This situation will only get worse as advertising revenue continues to fall , and it will be very serious by early next year .
The company has only $ 46 million of cash .
It appears to be burning more than it is taking in -- and plugging the hole with debt .
Specifically , it is funding operations by rolling over short - term loans -- the kind that banks worldwide are cancelling or making prohibitively expensive to save their own skins :
At the end of the quarter , cash and cash equivalents were approximately $ 46 million and total debt was approximately $ 1.1 billion .
The Company ’s current source of short - term funding is its revolving credit agreements under which it had approximately $ 398 million in borrowings outstanding at the end of the quarter .
The company did not publish a balance sheet or cash flow statement when it released its ( awful ) preliminary Q3 results this morning , so we do n't have any cash - flow details .
As best we can tell from the income statement detail , however , this is the situation :
The company 's EBITDA from its news businesses fell to $ 37 million in Q3 from $ 79 million last year ( before corporate overhead ) .
At this rate of revenue shrinkage , it will not take long for EBITDA to turn negative .
About.com now contributes $ 13 million of EBITDA ( pre overhead ) , or almost half as much as the news business [ shocking ] .
Together , after subtracting $ 6 million of overhead , the total company EBITDA was $ 43 million , down from $ 77 million ( - 38 % ) .
From that EBITDA subtract :
CAPEX : $ 27 million
Interest expense : $ 12 million
Income tax : $ 13 million
Severance : $ 18 million
That 's $ 70 million of burn .
Then add back $ 12 million of share of net income from joint ventures , for a total estimated cash burn of $ 58 million ... about $ 15 million more than EBITDA .
We wo n't know the exact figures until the company publishes its balance sheet and cash flow statement , but suffice it to say there 's not a lot of clearance here .
( Actually , operationally , there is almost NO clearance .
This will improve as CAPEX and severance costs decline , but EBITDA is likely decline , too ) .
So that 's why the company raised the possibility this morning that it might default on its debt .
More likely , it will have to start selling assets .*
At some point , it will also likely have to undergo a major restructuring .
* UPDATE : CEO Janet Robinson just said that newspaper asset sales are difficult ( we do n't have exact quote ) .
That leaves the building , the Red Sox stake , etc .

A Kentucky judge has ruled that 141 online gambling domain names will be turned over to the commonwealth on November 17 .
A hearing is scheduled for that date whereby owners of the said domain sites must show up in person to show that their respective websites are blocking access to Kentucky residents .
Website owners would not be permitted to have another party - including legal counsel - represent them on their behalf .
Attorneys for the online gambling industry were on conference call at 4:30 pm EST discussing whether to pursue an appeal .
Judge Wingate has refused to dismiss a lawsuit seeking to block access to online casinos in Kentucky .
In determining his decision , Judge Thomas Wingate cited an older statute that has since been replaced by another statute in regard to " gambling devices " .
Wingate said online casinos that do n't block access to their Web sites in Kentucky could be ordered to forfeit their domain names
Kentucky Governor Steve Beshear brought the suit claiming that these 141 online gambling websites were cutting into the economic well being of his state .
This decision is being seen as a dangerous precedent that could have serious ramifications for the Internet in general .
Summary Breakdown :
* Judge Wingate says he will let owners of domains come to a Nov. 17 forfeiture hearing in Frankfort , Kentucky .
If they show that they are blocking KY traffic , he will dismiss the forfeiture of their site .
Otherwise , they will forfeit .

NVIDIA 's Big Bang 2
After losing their own Battle Of The Midway Islands against the ATI Radeon HD 4870 and Radeon HD 4850 graphics cards and suffering reliability issues with their GPUs , NVIDIA went from being seemingly invincible to virtually fighting for their lives .
With the performance crown and popularity radically shifting to ATI , NVIDIA needs a new gimmick to regain their fortunes , and they think they have it in what they call their Big Bang 2 - the forthcoming Release 180 NVIDIA ForceWare drivers .
Bang !
Bang !
This morning , NVIDIA announced the details of the Release 180 ( R180 ) drivers .
Touted as the next best thing since sliced bread ( or at least the original Big Bang drivers ) , the R180 drivers will do more than just offer faster gaming performance .
NVIDIA outlined four main features of the R180 drivers , namely :
Faster gaming performance , of course !
Hey , we still want faster gaming performance , right ?
Direct support for NVIDIA SLI on the Intel X58 platform !
!
New multi-monitor display options for SLI setups !
Support for dedicating a GPU for PhysX acceleration !
In this article , we will go through the four main features , starting with faster gaming performance .
Faster Gaming Performance
Although the Release 180 drivers are still a work in progress , NVIDIA gave us an early preview of performance boosts we can expect from the new driver .
Here , NVIDIA compared the performance of the GeForce 9800 GTX + using the new R180 driver versus the current R178 driver .
Their results showed that the GeForce 9800 GTX + was able to deliver 5 % - 35 % better frame rates using the new R180 driver .
However , these are early results and NVIDIA claims the final R180 driver would be even faster .
With that said , you should only expect to see these performance improvements in the more recent GeForce GTX and GeForce 9/8 series of graphics cards .
Do n't count on it to help with your GeForce 7 or older graphics card !

In a move designed to offend those Americans who read literature ( and , no , they would not all fit into one small room ) , Nobel Academy secretary Horace Engdahl says American literature does n’t deserve consideration for the Nobel Prize in literature :
“ The U.S. is too isolated , too insular .
They do n’t translate enough and do n’t really participate in the big dialogue of literature , ” Engdahl said .
“ That ignorance is restraining . ”
The response of American literary experts has been to say things like the following ( this comes from Harold Augenbraum , executive director of the foundation that offers American literature ’s most prestigious prize , the National Book Award ) :
“ Such a comment makes me think that Mr. Engdahl has read little of American literature outside the mainstream and has a very narrow view of what constitutes literature in this age , ” he said .
So – who ’s right ?
Engdahl ?
Augenbraum ?
And what constitutes American literature , anyway ?
Maybe a look at the list of American Nobel Prize writers will help – or not .
Here it is :
Sinclair Lewis , Eugene O’Neill , Pearl Buck , William Faulkner , Ernest Hemingway , John Steinbeck , Saul Bellow , Isaac Bashevis Singer , Czeslaw Milosz , and Toni Morrison .
Both Singer and Milosz were born in Poland and their writing deals with their lives in Poland before they came to live in America .
Pearl Buck , born in America , lived nearly half of her life in China – and her major work is set in – China .
So far we may conclude that if you live in America but do n’t write about America you ’re Nobel worthy .
But let ’s look at the rest of our esteemed list .
Lewis wrote his important work about Midwestern American ( really Minnesota ) small town life ; Steinbeck wrote about California ; Faulkner wrote about Mississippi .
So from that we can conclude that the Nobel committee wants American literature that looks deeply at specific areas of our vast nation – the Midwest , the West , the South .
Right ?
Well , there ’s more to consider ….
Bellow , O’Neill , Hemingway , and Morrison explore family and / or self identity issues again and again in their work .
( One could argue that all these writers do that , yes , but the just mentioned group focuses on this beyond other important elements such as place , the element that most characterizes the work of the previously mentioned writers . )
So , the Nobel committee would seem to value exploration of human relationships given that these American writers were honored .
It seems nearly impossible that no American writers can meet these criteria – if indeed , these are the criteria the Nobel committee uses to choose honorees .
But there ’s a line in the above linked Associated Press article on this controversy that casts aspersions on the Nobel committee ’s selection process :
The academy often picks obscure writers and hardly ever selects best - selling authors .
It regularly faces accusations of snobbery , political bias and even poor taste .
And since America has a number of Nobel worthy authors – besides the mentioned Phillip Roth and Joyce Carol Oates , David Foster Wallace , Cormac McCarthy , John Ehle , Elmore Leonard , and William Gibson come to mind immediately – all of whom in their own ways epitomize the qualities the academy seems to have admired in their antecedents – there are no logical reasons for the claims Engdahl advances for the academy ’s reluctance to honor American authors .
So I guess that leaves us to consider those accusations of snobbery , political bias , and poor taste .
WASHINGTON --
The Treasury Department is putting the finishing touches to a plan designed to shore up Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac , according to people familiar with the matter , a move that would essentially result in a government takeover of the mortgage giants .
The plan is expected to involve putting the two companies into the conservatorship of their regulator , the Federal Housing Finance Agency , said several people familiar with the matter .
That would mean the government would take the reins of the companies , at least temporarily .

The Perks of High - End Prostitution Prostitution patrons pay thousands to get more than street - corner service .
March 11 , 2008  --
The rich and ultrarich are used to getting extra service for their extra dollars -- and that holds when it comes to prostitutes .
Allegations that New York Gov. Eliot Spitzer met with a high - priced prostitute have shined a fresh light on the most expensive side of the world 's oldest profession .
Spitzer has been linked to the Emperor 's Club , an alleged prostitution operation that charged up to $ 5,500 an hour for one of its prostitutes .
Spitzer allegedly spent $ 4,300 for the services of a prostitute who met the governor in a Washington D.C. , hotel room the night before he was scheduled to testify before Congress on the state of the bond industry .
What do high - end prostitution operations offer that a street - corner working girl might not ?
Former Hollywood Madam Heidi Fleiss told ABC
News that for rich , busy men , the convenience and predictability of using expensive prostitution rings are worth the price .
" The world 's a lonely place -- it 's hard to meet people , especially someone you like , " said Fleiss , who was convicted in 1995 of tax evasion and money laundering in connection with a prostitution ring she ran .
" It 's so much easier to come home at night , to call an escort service and you know what you 're going to get . "
Fleiss ' now - defunct service charged a flat rate of $ 1,500 per hour for each woman .
Prostitution is legal in some parts of Nevada , and Susan Austin , the madam of two Nevada brothels -- including the " world famous " Mustang Ranch -- said that some women there charge between $ 10,000 and $ 15,000 for a night or two days .
Though Austin said there is a huge distinction between legal brothels and illegal operations , the Emperor 's Club 's alleged rates did n't strike her as unusual .
" I know that ladies will charge that much or more , depending on what the gentleman wants , " she said .
" Everything 's just according to what the gentleman wants . "
Fleiss said that while the prices may seem exhorbitant to some , it 's all relative , especially when a client 's income is taken into account .
Fleiss said that her affluent patrons often paid more than the flat rate , partly because their ultradeep pockets would n't feel the pinch .
If a wealthy man " sees a girl and has a great time and he gives her ten grand , who cares ? "
Fleiss said .
" It does n't change his life , but it is a lot of money , and it makes a big difference in her life . "
Fleiss said that for her customers , she honored requests that men had for different kinds of women .
She once , for instance , found " gigantic , gigantic girls " for a client who preferred heavy - set women .
" It 's just like when you go to a restaurant , " she said .
" You 're paying -- you can order what you want . "
Austin said that at her brothels , it 's often older , more experienced women who command the higher rates .
" A woman with a little age under her belt has a lot more patience , " Austin said .
" She 's more versed in the business .
The young girl a lot of times just starting out does n't have all the necessary tools .
That comes with age , and it comes with practice .
It 's like taking a rookie baseball player versus a seasoned baseball player , if you know what I mean . "
What else are patrons paying for ?
Though Spitzer 's very public outing and other high - profile cases may indicate otherwise , discretion is also considered a key benefit of high - priced prostitution operations .
Fleiss , who served time in jail following her 1995 convictions , refused to release her clients ' names during court proceedings .
Austin said she would go to jail before disclosing her clients ' identities .
At Austin 's businesses and other legal Nevada brothels , customers benefit from a state law requiring prostitutes to undergo weekly health screenings .
Fleiss said that even at illegal operations , high - earning prostitutes tend to be healthy because they can afford to eat right and have regular medical checkups .
For call girls , staying healthy is also important to maintaining their looks and their earning prowess , she said .
" You 're going to do your best to look your best and make the most money , " she said .
But the glamorous side of high - end prostitution operations and escort services -- beautiful women and big bucks -- pale when compared with the risks , said Tracy Quan , a former prostitute and author whose experiences inspired her novel " Diary of a Married Call Girl . "
" Escort agencies are n't that glamorous , " Quan said .
" It 's very dangerous for an escort , and one reason they charge so much is that everyone 's taking a big risk . "
Quan said that when she worked for escort services in 1990 , she lived in constant fear of getting caught .
The businesses , she said , " were always being hassled by the police ; they were always being closed down or shaken down . … I was just so horrified . "
Anti-prostitution activists argue that the distinctions between working for a high - priced ring or on the street are irrevelant .
" To me it 's like saying is it better to be hit or stabbed .
I do n't want to be hit or stabbed , " said Dr. Scott Hampton , the executive director of New Hampshire - based End the Violence Now .
" Prostitution , whether it 's high - end or any other form , is really just an expression of men's beliefs that women are disposable sexual objects or men's property . "
But in Fleiss ' opinion , working for a high - end service still beats the street corner .
" I feel sorry for the poor girl on the corner , " she said .
" A guy picks her up in his car , he gives her $ 75 and he wants every dollar of it .
That 's a lot of work for the girl . "
The relentless slide in home prices has left nearly one in six U.S. homeowners owing more on a mortgage than the home is worth , raising the possibility of a rise in defaults -- the very misfortune that touched off the credit crisis last year .
The result of homeowners being " under water " is more pressure on an economy that is already in a downturn .
No longer having equity in their homes makes people feel less rich and thus less inclined to shop at the mall .
And having more homeowners under water is likely to mean more eventual foreclosures , because it is hard for borrowers in financial trouble to refinance or sell their homes and pay off their mortgage if their debt exceeds the home 's value .
A foreclosed home , in turn , tends to lower the value of other homes in its neighborhood .
About 75.5 million U.S. households own the homes they live in .
After a housing slump that has pushed values down 30 % in some areas , roughly 12 million households , or 16 % , owe more than their homes are worth , according to Moody 's Economy.com .
The comparable figures were roughly 4 % under water in 2006 and 6 % last year , says the firm 's chief economist , Mark Zandi , who adds that " it is very possible that there will ultimately be more homeowners under water in this period than any time in our history . "

The candidates from the two major candidates have sucked up to the power structure to get ahead .
More often than people think , they take their money from the same people .
No one asked neither Obama nor McCain about civil liberties .
Both Nader and Baldwin support civil liberties .
It could also be said that McKinney and Barr , even though they did n't appear on these debates , also object to how Bush is curtailing civil liberties .
However , I disagree with Nader 's appoach to health care .
In some ways , I might agree more with Baldwin on health care .
The " welfare " system has expanded excessively , and government exploits people that it makes dependent .
It uses that very dependence to control people .
Government health care could lead to too many kids on Ritalin , for one thing .

Witnesses allege police brutality in death of tasered man David Edwards and Muriel Kane
Published : Wednesday August 6 , 2008

This A Pennsylvania man has died after being tasered by local police , and the Civil Rights section of the FBI 's Pittsburgh office has now opened a preliminary investigation .
Although the cause of death has not yet been determined , witnesses insist the man was kicked and beaten by police officers after he was forced to the ground and handcuffed .
Residents in Swissvale , PA had called police after they observed 37 year old Andre Thomas knocking on doors in the middle of the night and yelling that someone was trying to shoot him .
According to Allegheny County Police Assistant Supt .
James Morton , when the officers arrived Thomas " was like yelling and screaming and acting really erratically , and they did n't know what the situation was .
So they asked him just to calm down and so forth and he made a movement towards them .
So they had to tase him . "
However , witnesses insist that Thomas was then brutalized by police , with one telling KDKA News that " after he was tased and handcuffed , one officer used a football - type kick and stomped him in the head . "
Another woman recounted to the Pittsburgh Post - Gazette what she saw after four officers forced Thomas to the ground .
" ' They killed that man .
They killed him .
They killed him , ' she added , her hands trembling .
The woman said she saw one officer stomp on Mr. Thomas 's upper back , holding his foot there while the subject lay on the sidewalk with his head hanging over the curb .
Another officer ' reared back and punched him in the head with all his might , ' she said . "
Thomas vomited , then lay motionless .
An ambulance arrived and he was was treated at the scene by emergency medical personnel .
Police allege Thomas was conscious at the time , but he was pronounced dead after being taken to a local hospital .
Andre Thomas 's father , Dennis Thomas , now says , " I want to know what happened , what the particulars of the incident were that caused my son's death . "

We need to learn the issues .
People are unarmed .
That is , people know that they ’re getting shafted , but they do n’t really know exactly how .
The American press corps has finally begun to report on illegal activities of the Bush administration .
However , the subject of election theft remains largely ignored .
In recent years , the Republican Party has used an array of tactics to subtract votes from opposing candidates .
These include sending defective voting machines to strongly Democratic precincts and removing low - income and minority voters from electoral rolls .
Reporter Greg Palast has been covering this issue since 2000 , when he revealed that Florida officials ensured the election of George W. Bush by illegally suppressing the African - American and Democratic vote .
( Learn more about that subject here . )
In this interview , I asked Palast about his reports on the GOP ’s dirty electoral tricks since 2000 and the possibility that the ’08 election will be stolen .
He explained how the Help America Vote Act actually helps crooked
Republicans and he previewed his upcoming broadcasts and publications , which will include a free guide with tips for safeguarding your vote .
– Chris Pepus
Chris :
Your reports on vote suppression led to a congressional inquiry and the resignation of Tim Griffin , one of President Bush ’s U.S. Attorneys .
Could you describe how the Bush administration interfered with voting rights in 2004 ?
Greg :
Item one is something that we discovered called caging .
There were e-mails written by the Republican National Committee ’s chief researcher , a character named Tim Griffin , who was a protégé of Karl Rove .
He was sending out caging lists , which are hit lists of voters to challenge .
The way caging works is they send out registered letters to voters and when the voters are n’t around to receive their letters – the envelopes say , “ Do Not Forward ” – the voters end up being subject to challenge .
The particular hit list that we got was substantially filled with voters from the naval air station in Jacksonville ( Florida ) .
There are reasons why someone at a naval air station would n’t be at their voting address .
That ’s because , unlike Bush during Vietnam , they are off in a foreign war .
Republicans also sent letters to students at black colleges in August knowing that they would n’t be there .
They illegally challenged their votes .
The Republicans challenged three million voters in 2004 , which is absolutely unbelievable and unreported .
That fact was right there in the records of the Election Assistance Commission of the federal government .
Those voters received provisional ballots and a million of those ballots were thrown in the garbage .
That is just one of the tricks .
There are several and they are being sharpened for 2008 .
Chris :
But Griffin claimed that he did n’t know what caging was until he read your report .
“ I had to look it up , ” he said .
Greg :
Well , actually , I determined that he is correct .
He sent out an e-mail saying , “ Here is a caging list . ”
As he said , you have to be an expert in direct - mail marketing to understand what caging is .
Now , that means that someone told him to send out an e-mail with caging lists , someone whose orders were so important that he would n’t question them , even if he did n’t know what ( the list ) was .
Now , who would know direct marketing and who could give orders to Tim Griffin ?
Well , before he worked for George W. Bush , Karl Rove was head of Rove & Company , a direct - mail marketing firm .
Rove is an expert on caging .
Law professor Bobby Kennedy Jr. , my co-investigator , says that this was an illegal act .
So who ordered this illegal act ?
Hm , Mr. Rove ?
Chris :
How did you obtain these e-mails ?
Greg : Griffin is not the sharpest knife in the drawer and he copied these e-mails not to GeorgeWBush.com , which was the campaign ’s internal e-mail system , but rather to GeorgeWBush.org , a parody web site .
The head of that site , John Wooden , knows me .
He immediately passed ( the e-mails ) on to my team .
He did n’t know what they were and , frankly , we did n’t know what they were at first either .
It took a lot of work to decode .
Chris :
Have there been any new developments in the case , other than Karl Rove ’s refusal to testify before the House Judiciary Committee ?
Greg : I have just returned from a meeting with David Iglesias , a fired prosecutor from New Mexico .
Caging and gimmicks like it were behind his firing and the firings of other U.S. prosecutors .
The U.S. press corps , as usual , got it completely wrong .
The firing of U.S. Attorneys is not simply about the politics of the prosecutors or even the operations of their offices .
Rather , it is about an attempt to force prosecutors to be involved in a scheme to arrest voters under voter - fraud laws to create hysteria to justify vote suppression .
I was constantly asking Republicans , “ If there are so many criminal voters , why have n’t you arrested them ?
Why are n’t there prosecutions ? ”
The Republicans said , “ Oh , there will be .
Talk to David Iglesias . ”
I called him and other prosecutors and got all this hemming and hawing .
So , I ’m being told that Iglesias is about to bring prosecutions and he is saying , “ I do n’t think so . ”
It ’s very clear to me that Iglesias was resisting phony prosecutions .
He ran around the bases looking for fraudulent voters and he did n’t find one .
Some were in the military , so they were not at their voting addresses .
I just came back from checking out some of the so - called fraudulent voters that Iglesias refused to prosecute .
Republican leaders gave me their names .
There was one lady , a waitress , who was signed up twice and there were two different signatures of her name .
So I spoke to her – this “ criminal ” – and I said , “ Did you register twice ? ”
She said , “ Yes . ”
She explained that , under the law , if you do n’t receive formal acknowledgment of your registration , you can and should register again .
They do n’t put your name on the roll twice .
I asked why there were two signatures : “ Was there some fraudulent game going on ? ”
She said : “ No .
One time , I signed at a table .
The other time , I signed it on my hand . ”
This woman was supposed to be one of the six most obvious cases of a fraudulent voter in New Mexico .
Governor Bill Richardson signed laws making it harder for people to register because of these so - called frauds .
The laws are so horrible that Richardson , a Hispanic Democrat , is being sued by the Brennan Center for Justice for illegally impeding Hispanic voters .
Chris :
It ’s remarkable how many groups are targeted .
I recall reading about defective voting machines in ( Palast ’s 2006 book ) Armed Madhouse .
You mentioned that , in ’ 04 , the county in New Mexico where the most votes disappeared was a predominantly white , working - class county .
Greg : Yeah , I call vote theft “ class war by other means . ”
Places like Native American precincts , black precincts , and Mexican barrios are often the hardest hit .
But , statistically , we find that it is income more than race that determines whether your vote will count .
I can tell you the probability that your vote will count if you tell me your income .
By the way , the Republican secretary of state in Colorado ( Mike Coffman ) just attacked me .
I reported that he purged all these voters .
He said , “ Palast is just trying to raise money for his operation , ” but he did n’t say I was wrong .
He said he was just following the law .
I ’d heard all this from Katherine Harris before .
I ’d said , “ Guess the color of the voters purged . ”
He said , “ We do n’t keep track of voters ’ race on our voter forms . ”
Yeah , right .
They know .
It ’s by zip code .
That ’s the other thing : if they do n’t know , they should know .
Civil rights law does require election officials to take steps to determine that their actions do n’t have a racial bias .
When he said , “ I do n’t know , ” that ’s not true and , also , that ’s not a legal answer .
He ’s supposed to know , especially when he removes a fifth of the voters in Colorado .
Chris :
Another state with a history of vote suppression is Florida .
In 2000 , you reported that Florida Republicans removed tens of thousands of Democratic voters from the rolls .
Have you found evidence pointing to a similar result this year ?
Greg : Worse than ever .
The whole nation ’s been Floridated .
George Bush signed the Help America Vote Act ( in 2002 ) and , in 2006 , they did a Katherine Harris on the whole nation .
They told secretaries of state , who are partisan officials in every state , to purge away and remove “ suspect voters . ”
A lot of the things that were illegal , like caging , that ’s now in the law .
Basically , we now have federal cover for mischief , instead of federal prohibition .
In one New Mexico county , half the Democrats who showed up to vote in the ( 2008 ) primary / caucus could n’t vote .
You have address purges , I.D. purges .
The Brennan Center said that about 85,000 voters in Florida are losing their right to vote , because they signed up in voter drives and could n’t verify their identity .
Overwhelmingly , those voters are black , because many black voters register in voter drives out of their churches .
So , Florida ’s back in the game .
They ’re just changing the rules .
Chris : How does the Help America Vote Act enable those tactics ?
Greg :
For example , Florida , when imposing special identity requirements on voter drives , they cited the Help America Vote Act .
They said that it was required .
Now , the fact that forty - six states do n’t agree with them on that interpretation did n’t stop them .
Also , HAVA basically required every state in America to change its laws .
Once you open up the howling Pandora ’s Box of election law , every reform becomes grounds for new mischief .
HAVA creates this new shadow world of law .
Florida officials said , “ Well , we did this for HAVA . ”
Then the lawyers at the Brennan Center said , “ Where in HAVA ?
How can you say this is for HAVA ? ”
They said , “ Oh , well , that ’s our own interpretation . ”
Is this federal law ?
Is it state law ?
No , it ’s Bush law ; it ’s Rove law .
The nice thing about elections for vote thieves : there ’s a “ Fuck you ” clause in vote theft .
If you win , you control the review .
You own the police .
Chris :
Which provisions of the act are most often cited as authority for attacks on voting rights ?
Greg : I go back to the 2006 codicils .
Certain things kicked in in ’06 regarding verification of voter identity .
That is the most mischievous thing .
The law demanded that , beginning in ’ 06 , each state must have centralized , computerized rolls of voters .
Again , the first state to go full - on with computerized , centralized purging of voter rolls was Florida .
That ’s how we ended up with the phony felon purge ( in 2000 ) .
With HAVA , they used the Florida fix as an excuse to create a so - called reform and the “ reform ” was to take Florida ’s method and nationalize it .
But people say , “ Well , why should n’t we have verified rolls ? ”
The answer is that this is a new law to prevent a crime that almost never happens .
We have five or fewer convictions for vote fraud a year in America .
We figure that , under the new system , five million voters a year lose their right to vote .
You literally have a million voters losing their right to vote to catch one ne ’er - do - well .
You do n’t arrest a million people to catch one murderer .
Chris :
Now , regarding these centralized lists , you ’ve written about a firm called Accenture that runs computerized voting lists for various state governments .
Could you talk about that ?
Greg : Accenture used to be Arthur Andersen , but after they got caught cooking the books for Enron , they tend not to use that name .
Arthur Andersen was split into two parts : one was liquidated , put into bankruptcy , and one was renamed Accenture .
They have n’t changed their ways .
There ’s Accenture ; there ’s ES&S ( Election Systems & Software ) .
These characters are some of the greasiest operators out there .
They combine bias with incompetence and high fees .
ES&S has been involved in New Mexico .
It ’s a firm founded by Republican Senator Chuck Hagel ( of Nebraska ) .
Every time ES&S gets involved in purging voter rolls , they turn astonishingly Republican .
Everyone knows that if you use certain methods , it knocks out certain types of voters .
That ’s why I ’m doing this investigation with Bobby Kennedy .
We are investigating the theft of the 2008 election before it happens .
We ’re looking at what ’s happening in Colorado , New Mexico , Alabama , Florida .
We ’re going to be putting out a big national magazine article with our findings .
We ca n’t say where .
Chris :
When is that going to come out ?
Greg : In September .
We will then also have a film out starting with a broadcast on BBC Television and a U.S. national network .
For the first time , we ’re going to break through the electronic blockade in America .
Chris : I read that you ’re raising funds for the broadcast .
How are you doing on that ?
Greg :
Well , that ’s the thing .
( The network ) finally opened the door , but they said , “ Of course , we ’re not paying for this . ”
Okay , I ’ll tell my cameramen to eat dog food .
My staff is pretty good at living on very little .
They were here last night ’ til 2 a.m. ( Research associate ) Zach Roberts – I want to give him his due – his last day off was about seven weeks ago .
This is a nonstop operation , but I have to raise money to provide the bare minimum .
We do want to be able to provide outreach and give stuff out to some activist groups .
We ’re going to have a voter guide , Steal Back Your Vote , which I ’m putting together with Kennedy .
A lot of this is going to be in comic - book form , designed by Top Shelf .
I had a complaint from one of my fundraisers that we give away too much stuff – my books , DVDs .
But that ’s our game : to get the word out and build a knowledge base .
Now , I ’ll give a hint of my age .
The protests against the war in Vietnam began with massive teach - ins : “ Here ’s where Vietnam is .
”
We need to learn the issues .
People are unarmed .
That is , people know that they ’re getting shafted , but they do n’t really know exactly how .

Palin claims that McCain would implement the GOP platform .
No abortions for anyone under any circumstances on every state ?
An end to federalism on marriage ?
A total ban on even private embryonic stem cell research ?
This seems like something the press , if we had any , would take up with McCain .

Derivatives are financial weapons of mass destruction
Warren Buffett
The world 's second - richest man made the comments in his famous and plain - spoken " annual letter to shareholders " , excerpts of which have been published by Fortune magazine .
The derivatives market has exploded in recent years , with investment banks selling billions of dollars worth of these investments to clients as a way to off - load or manage market risk .
But Mr Buffett argues that such highly complex financial instruments are time bombs and " financial weapons of mass destruction " that could harm not only their buyers and sellers , but the whole economic system .
Contracts devised by ' madmen '
Derivatives are financial instruments that allow investors to speculate on the future price of , for example , commodities or shares - without buying the underlying investment .
Derivatives generate reported earnings that are often wildly overstated and based on estimates whose inaccuracy may not be exposed for many years
Warren Buffett
Outstanding derivatives contracts - excluding those traded on exchanges such as the International Petroleum Exchange - are worth close to $ 85 trillion , according to the International Swaps and Derivatives Association .
Some derivatives contracts , Mr Buffett says , appear to have been devised by " madmen " .
He warns that derivatives can push companies onto a " spiral that can lead to a corporate meltdown " , like the demise of the notorious hedge fund Long - Term Capital Management in 1998 .
Derivatives are like ' hell '
Large amounts of risk have become concentrated in the hands of relatively few derivatives dealers ... which can trigger serious systemic problems
Warren Buffett
The profits and losses from derivates deals are booked straight away , even though no actual money changes hand .
In many cases the real costs hit companies only many years later .
This can result in nasty accounting errors .
Some of them spring from " honest " optimism .
But others are the result of " huge - scale fraud " , and Mr Buffett points to the US energy market , which relied for most of its deals on derivatives trading and resulted in the collapse of Enron .
Berkshire Hathaway , the investment group led by Mr Buffett , is pulling out of the market , closing down the derivatives trading subsidiary it bought as part of a huge reinsurance company a few years ago .
In his letter Mr Buffett compares the derivatives business to " hell ... easy to enter and almost impossible to exit " , and predicts that it will take years to unwind the complex deals struck by its subsidiary General Re Securities .
Warren Buffett , dubbed " the sage of Omaha " , from where he controls Berkshire Hathaway , is well - known for both his blunt assessments of the markets and the high returns he delivers to shareholders .
This year , he remains cool towards further share investments , despite the sharp correction in stock market values .
Mr Buffett says this " dismal fact is testimony to the insanity of valuations reached during The Great Bubble " .
Berkshire backyard barbecues
A good friend of Bill Gates , he famously refused to invest in technology shares during the boom years that came to a sudden end in March 2000 .
As a result , Berkshire was sitting pretty after the technology bubble burst .
In marked contrast to the hubris of former managers at fallen firms like Enron and WorldCom , Mr Buffett is known for his down - to - earth style , summoning shareholders not to glitzy hotels but " Berkshire backyard barbecues " and baseball games in out - of - the - way Omaha , Nebraska .
But his strategy of identifying undervalued companies with good management in unfashionable retail sectors or the insurance industry and investing in them for the long - term has produced spectacular returns .
During the past 37 years , the company has delivered an average annual return of 22.6 % .
Since 1965 the company 's book value has gone up by 194,936 % .
However in 2001 , the last year for which detailed numbers are available , heavy losses in the insurance industry worldwide resulted in a $ 3.77bn loss at Berkshire Hathaway - the first loss in the firm 's history under Warren Buffett .
A neuroscientist at UQ's Queensland Brain Institute has found a way to combat a debilitating illness that affects an estimated 50,000 people a year in tropical regions .
Ciguatera poisoning - which often results in acute nausea , vomiting and painful gastrointestinal episodes - is caused by eating fish that have fed on a micro algae that are toxic to mammals and often associated with large algal blooms known as red tides .
Cases of ciguatera poisoning have been documented for more than 200 years - and were recorded and described by Captain Cook on his second voyage to the Pacific in 1774 .
Recently , scientists have discovered that the patented compound brevenal could be used to make an effective treatment for neurotoxic shellfish poisoning ( NSP ) , a condition related to ciguatera poisoning .
Acting initially on a hunch , QBI neuroscientist Associate Professor Fred Meunier hypothesised that brevenal could be adapted to combat ciguatera poisoning .
Simultaneously , and unbeknown to Dr Meunier , Dr Dan Baden at the University of North Carolina Wilmington ( USA ) was also considering adapting brevenal to fight ciguatera .
The two scientists soon became aware of each other 's interest and began discussing the possibility that the compound active against NSP could have the same therapeutic effect on ciguatera toxins .
Along with Dr Dan Baden , Dr Jordi Molgo ( National Center For Scientific Research , France ) and Dr Richard Lewis at UQ's Institute for Molecular Bioscience , Dr Meunier pressed on to obtain a small batch of both ciguatera toxin and brevenal to test their hypothesis .
" It now seems that we have found a way of blocking the effect of the ciguatera toxin on sodium channels without affecting their function of propagating the electrical signals in neurons , " Dr Meunier said .
One of the main problems with ciguatera is that there are few , if any , effective treatments for the acute impact it has on the health of humans and marine mammals .
" There is one drug available for ciguatera sufferers but a randomised trial conducted by another research group in 2002 found it to be no better than a placebo , " Dr Meunier said .
Armed with the knowledge of how the ciguatera toxin affects the body , Dr Meunier and his research collaborators are now looking to develop a drug that will short - circuit the ciguatera toxin 's effect in mammals .
The process of synthesising and safely delivering the drug for human patients will require extensive trials .

David Blaine Upside Down Stunt PHOTOS
, in his latest endurance challenge , is hanging upside down over the Wollmann ice rink in New York 's Central Park area .
The illusionist plans to stay that way for 60 hours - nearly three days .
He started his stunt , five stories off the ground , on Monday morning and will continue to dangle by his ankles until late Wednesday night .
Blaine does not plan to eat or sleep for the duration of the ' hangathon ' .
He is taking liquid through a straw and eliminates fluid through a catheter .
His physician cautioned against this particular stunt because it will reportedly put a major stress on his internal organs and adversely affect his blood circulation .
That did n't deter the thrill seeker who has managed to free one leg and use it as leverage to raise his head - which he says feels like it is about to explode .
Blaine considers this his most difficult endeavor so far .
He gets his inspiration from famed escape artist Harry Houdini , who dazzled audiences in the early 1900's .
All of the NYC networks have been reporting on Blaine 's progress and some have even gotten into the act , including Kelly Ripa , who has been known to do just about anything for a laugh .
We 've got some photos of the gorgeous actress hanging upside down with Blaine at the start of his stunt yesterday .
The David Blaine Dive of Death two hour ABC special will air on Wednesday night 9:00 a.m. eastern .

The 2008 Nobel Prize in Physics has been awarded to three men whose work has contributed significantly to our understanding of why we 're here .
Makoto Kobayashi of the High Energy Accelerator Research Organisation , Japan , and Toshihide Maskawa of Kyoto Sangyo University share one half of the prize , with the remaining half going to Yoichiro Nambu of the University of Chicago .
Their combined body of work paves the way towards solving two of the biggest mysteries of physics .

Where are our anti-twins ?
Physicists believe that the Universe erupted into being around 14 billion years ago , when the Big Bang caused its initial extremely hot and dense state to expand and cool .
Within split seconds after the Big Bang the fundamental particles that make up all matter we see in the Universe today and the fundamental forces that govern their interaction had been born .
It turns out , however , that the fundamental particles were not alone : in the early twentieth century the physicist Paul Dirac showed that each fundamental particle comes with a twin called an antiparticle , which has the same mass but opposite electric charge .
When two twins meet , they annihilate each other and their mass is transformed into energy .
The concept of antiparticles originally dropped out of a mathematical equation which had one more solution than was expected , but since their theoretical conception antiparticles have actually been observed in cosmic rays and produced in laboratories .
Now the problem is this : whenever scientists have managed to produce antiparticles , they could n't help but produce the corresponding particles in the process .
The same must have happened during the Big Bang , so how come things did n't just annihilate each other and vanish in a puff of energy ?
Why do we see only matter and no antimatter ?
We 're all familiar with mirror symmetry .
At the heart of this conundrum lies the notion of symmetry .
Physicists traditionally believed that the laws of nature should be perfectly symmetrical : if you were to step into a mirror world unawares , you would never notice the difference , as the laws of physics should behave in just the same way there as they do in the normal world .
In terms of particle physics , this means that whenever a particle or process exhibits " handedness " , then the laws of nature should treat the left - handed version the same as the right - handed one .
This is the concept of mirror symmetry , but there is a similar one , called charge symmetry , regarding matter and antimatter .
It states that particles should behave exactly like their anti-twins .
But if charge symmetry prevails , how come we see no antimatter today ?
Could our antimatter - free world be the result of a violation of symmetry which caused young nature to " favour " particles over antiparticles , leading to the latters ' eventual demise ?
This idea was first postulated in 1967 by Nobel Laureate Andrei Sakharov , who set out three pre-requisites for a world like ours to come into existence : one of them was that the laws of nature should indeed distinguish matter from antimatter .
The first proof that symmetry can in fact be broken had already been furnished in 1956 , when the physicists Tsung Dao Lee and Chen Ning Yang proposed experiments that revealed a violation of mirror symmetry ( and received the 1957 Nobel Prize in Physics as a result ) .
Physicists at the time , however , clung on to the symmetry dream .
They conjectured that while mirror symmetry and charge symmetry could be broken separately , the combination of the two would remain intact : if you were transported into an mirror world made of antimatter rather than matter , everything would behave just as you would expect .
But in 1964 this last bastion of symmetry was shattered too : James Cronin and Val Fitch detected a violation of charge - mirror symmetry in the radioactive decay of strange particles called kaons ( and in turn received the 1980 Nobel Prize in Physics for their work ) .
Charge - mirror symmetry : your anti-self in a mirror world should be just like you .
With the violation of charge - mirror symmetry now established by observation , what was still missing was the theoretical underpinning for this phenomenon — existing theories could n't account for it .
And this is where Kobayashi and Maskawa come in .
They realised that the symmetry violation could be explained if one assumes the existence of three new types of fundamental particle .
Once these are incorporated in the theory , the underlying mathematics obligingly works out to predict symmetry breaking .
The hypothetical particles arising from their theory , known as charm quarks , bottom quarks and top quarks , were later observed in experiments .
Kobayashi and Maskawa also predicted symmetry violation in other particles called B-mesons , and this was verified by experiment in 2001 .
Why mass ?
The second half of the 2008 Nobel Prize goes to Yoichiro Nambu for his work concerning another one of the big questions of particle physics : why do things have mass ?
Theory suggests that particles should have no mass at all , so how did they acquire it ?
What 's more , why are their masses so different , with the heaviest , the top quark , more than 300,000 times heavier than the electron ?
Perhaps surprisingly , Nambu's work towards an answer also involves broken symmetries , but this time they arise in connection with the vacuum .
Technically , a vacuum is defined as a state with the lowest possible energy , not empty space as it is commonly thought of .
As a very rough analogy , imagine yourself at your lowest possible energy state : slumped on the couch in front of the TV .
You 'll be relaxed , but chances are that you wo n't look symmetrical .
To do that , you have to invest some energy in arranging your limbs and keeping them in place .
Once you sit bolt upright with your muscles all tense , a small nudge would knock you out of position .
All matter is made up of a number of fundamental particles .
But how did they acquire mass ?
Similarly , the vacuum is a least energy state , but not a symmetrical state .
Some sort of collapse of symmetry has occurred to get it into a low energy state , and because of its instantaneous nature , this collapse is known as spontaneous symmetry violation .
Based on his previous work in superconductivity , Nambu created the mathematical tools to describe spontaneous symmetry violation in particle physics .
He recognised the potential of studying broken symmetry in the vacuum , and his ideas form the basis for a whole body of work in the area .
Among other things , they are frequently used to work out the effects of the strong nuclear force .
But what does all this have to do with mass ?
In 1964 the physicist Peter Higgs came up with a model for how particles acquired mass .
He postulated that at the Big Bang an invisible force field , now known as the Higgs field existed , and it existed in a perfectly symmetrical state .
But the Higgs field was unstable , and as the Universe cooled down , it slumped into an asymmetrical lowest energy state .
As the zero-mass particles moved through the field , they interacted with it and experienced a drag , which we observe as mass .
The mathematical tools created by Nambu paved the way for this theory of mass acquisition .
The three prize winners ' work contributed significantly to our understanding of the Universe , but physics is by no means finished .
The symmetry violations established by Kobayashi and Maskawa are far too small to account for the large - scale triumph of matter over antimatter , so more work needs to be done in this area .
As for the Higgs field , the theory is still hypothetical .
It is predicted that the field should come with its own messenger particle called the Higgs boson , which scientists will be looking for at the Large Hadron Collider at CERN .
And while they 're busy doing that , the rest of us can sit back and contemplate the curious fact that if it was n't for a flaw in nature 's symmetry , we would n't be here .

DIGG THIS
The ghost of FDR is everywhere , haunting both Washington and New York .
The terrible trouble is that the minds in power have confused an economic wrecker with an angel of mercy .
They are following his confusions and prescriptions day - to - day in an attempted repeat of the longest economic calamity in modern American history .
They have looked at the history of the New Deal and completely misunderstood it , believing the civics - book claptrap about how FDR saved us from the depression , whereas the fact is that FDR ’s theories and policies lengthened and deepened it to the point that the only way out that the Roosevelt administration saw was war .
The great theoretical error of the New Dealers was to confuse the symptom of low prices with the causes of the economic downturn .
The real problem was that prices were massively inflated before the stock market crash of 1929 .
The correction had to occur and would have occurred peacefully , if not wholly painlessly , had the government not intervened .
No government in all of human history that has waged war on prices has won .
The Great Depression is exhibit A .
First there was Hoover with his attack on the “ bitter - end liquidationists , ” whose advice he summarily rejected .
Instead he increased taxes , regulated against short selling , attempted to expand liquidity and the money supply , attempted to maintain existing wage rates , extended loans via government , and bailed out debtors with bankruptcy laws .
For more on Hoover ’s anti-market program , see Rothbard ’s America ’s Great Depression .
Roosevelt took office and extended this program , while rhetorically claiming that it was the free - market policy of the Hoover administration that failed .
Today we see Bush ’s attack on speculators and the media - wide attempt to claim that the meltdown is caused by unregulated markets run amok .
No doubt the next president , whoever he may be , will continue this crusade against markets , pretending as if the Fed and the Bush administration have n’t been trying anti-market means of rescue for fully two years , with each attempt backfiring .
But now let ’s look forward to the next step in the war on falling prices in the 1930s .
FDR took office under the promise that he would curb the big spending of the Hoover administration .
The tune changed once he took office .
Like Hoover before him , he denounced the rich and powerful speculators , bankers , and corporations he blamed for bad economic times .
Even as he was saying these things , he called together the people he regarded as the most powerful and important corporate , banking , and labor interests — together with a gaggle of professors from Columbia — and essentially asked them what they wanted to get the economy going again .
This was the Brain Trust that set the pattern for all of Washington ’s activities from then to the present day .
John T. Flynn , in his masterful book The Roosevelt Myth , described the first round of the New Deal as :
that vast hippodrome , that hectic , whirling , dizzy three - ring circus with the NRA in one ring , the AAA in another , the Relief Act in another , with General Johnson , Henry Wallace and Harry Hopkins popping the whips , while all around under the vast tent a whole drove of clowns and dervishes — the Henry Morgenthaus and Huey Longs and Dr. Townsends and Upton Sinclairs and a host of crackpots of every variety — leaped and danced and tumbled about and shouted in a great harlequinade of government , until the tent came tumbling down upon the heads of the cheering audience and the prancing buffoons .
What did the elites gathered around FDR demand ?
Higher prices ( of course ) , uniform industrial codes on labor and prices , production controls , an end to competition from below , security for labor unions , guaranteed credits , import tariffs — and also the police power they needed to enforce all this .
The model here was Mussolini ’s Italy , which was regarded at the time as an ideal system of industrial management .
Of course , anti-trust laws were shelved as the government itself set out to create as many trusts as possible .
What came out of these meetings was the all - round industrial planning fiasco called the National Industrial Recovery Act , which created the National Recovery Administration .
The head was former draft administrator General Hugh Johnson , who brought to the effort every propaganda trick he had learned from his kidnapping years .
He began with a central plan of wages , working hours , prices , and production quotas .
He went on the air , to the papers , to billboards , movies , and everything else to whip up a frenzy .
There was a symbol of compliance : The Blue Eagle .
FDR said on the radio that “ soldiers wear a bright badge to be sure that comrades do not fire on comrades .
Those who cooperate in this program must know each other at a glance .
That bright badge is the Blue Eagle . ”
And , added Johnson , may “ God have mercy on anyone who attempts to trifle with that bird . ”
And you know what ?
It is a complete disgrace that business supported it all — for a while .
Flynn tells of police raids of factories , as workers were lined up and interrogated to make sure that they were n’t working overtime and were n’t accepting less than the government - approved minimum .
Consumers were arrested for paying less than the approved minimum prices .
A tailor named Jack Magid in New Jersey was arrested and jailed for charging 35 cents instead of 40 cents to press a pair of pants .
In time , the NRA became unenforceable , as black markets sprung up in every industry .
The crackdown became worse , with nighttime raids on factories , and bureaucrats chopping down doors with axes to make sure that no one was sewing clothes .
The NRA staff ballooned from 60 employees to 6,000 at the national level .
The entire thing became a war on production to benefit a handful of elites , all in the name of keeping prices up , all on the profound misunderstanding that boosting prices would boost production , whereas the opposite was true .
Finally the Supreme Court came to the rescue and declared the whole Soviet - like scheme unconstitutional , but , by that time , it was clear that it was unworkable and doomed to failure .
At the very same time , other sectors such as banking and agriculture were being administered by other destructive schemes , all based on economic error .
The result was fantastic waste , disastrous attacks on freedom and productivity , a regimentation of the entire country under a dictator , and a prolongation of the depression , which went on and on .
No matter how many disasters FDR created — and it was nonstop — and no matter how much his ridiculous “ rabbits from the hat ” were exposed as economically harebrained , with every new bureau , every new law , every new initiative , the economy continued to sink .
The New Deal is a paradigmatic case of how to turn a downturn into depression .
That U.S. leaders regard this as a model to follow does not speak very well of their economic literacy , and it does n’t bode well for our future .
On the other hand , if you want to see how to handle a crisis , consider the Panic of 1819 .
Never heard of it ?
That ’s because it came and went , and that ’s because the government did nothing about it .

Boulder , CO , USA–The Apollo Moon missions of 1969 - 1972 all share a dirty secret .
" The major issue the Apollo astronauts pointed out was dust , dust , dust , " says Professor Larry Taylor , Director of the Planetary Geosciences Institute at the University of Tennessee .
Fine as flour and rough as sandpaper , Moon dust caused ' lunar hay fever , ' problems with space suits , and dust storms in the crew cabin upon returning to space .
Taylor and other scientists will present their research on lunar dust at the " Living on a Dusty Moon " session on Thursday , 9 October 2008 , at the Joint Meeting of the Geological Society of America ( GSA ) , Soil Science Society of America ( SSSA ) , American Society of Agronomy ( ASA ) , Crop Science Society of America ( CSSA ) , and Gulf Coast Association of Geological Societies ( GCAGS ) in Houston , Texas , USA .
NASA will use these findings to plan a safer manned mission to the Moon in 2018 .
Taylor will also deliver a Pardee Keynote Session talk on Sunday , 5 October 2008 entitled " Formation and Evolution of Lunar Soil from An Apollo Perspective . "
The trouble with moon dust stems from the strange properties of lunar soil .
The powdery grey dirt is formed by micrometeorite impacts which pulverize local rocks into fine particles .
The energy from these collisions melts the dirt into vapor that cools and condenses on soil particles , coating them in a glassy shell .
Lunar dust melts readily when exposed to microwave energy .
Professor Larry Taylor of the University of Tennessee envisions a lunar paver fitted with microwave generators that could sinter , or melt , lunar soils into landing strips or roads .

These particles can wreak havoc on space suits and other equipment .
During the Apollo 17 mission , for example , crewmembers Harrison " Jack " Schmitt and Gene Cernan had trouble moving their arms during moonwalks because dust had gummed up the joints .
" The dust was so abrasive that it actually wore through three layers of Kevlar - like material on Jack 's boot , " Taylor says .
To make matters worse , lunar dust suffers from a terrible case of static cling .
UV rays drive electrons out of lunar dust by day , while the solar wind bombards it with electrons by night .
Cleaning the resulting charged particles with wet - wipes only makes them cling harder to camera lenses and helmet visors .
Mian Abbas of the National Space Science and Technology Center in Huntsville , Alabama , will discuss electrostatic charging on the moon and how dust circulates in lunar skies .
Luckily , lunar dust is also susceptible to magnets .
Tiny specks of metallic iron ( Fe0 ) are embedded in each dust particle 's glassy shell .
Taylor has designed a magnetic filter to pull dust from the air , as well as a " dust sucker " that uses magnets in place of a vacuum .
He has also discovered that microwaves melt lunar soil in less time than it takes to boil a cup of tea .
He envisions a vehicle that could microwave lunar surfaces into roads and landing pads as it drives , and a device to melt soil over lunar modules to provide insulation against space radiation .
The heating process can also produce oxygen for breathing .
The surface of the Moon is covered in powdery gray dust that caused unforeseen problems for NASA astronauts .

But the same specks of iron that could make moon dust manageable also pose a potential threat to human health , according to Bonnie Cooper at NASA 's Johnson Space Center .
" Those tiny blebs of pure iron we see on the surface of lunar grains are likely to be released from the outside edges of the particle in the lungs and enter the bloodstream , " she says .
Preliminary studies suggest that the inhalation of lunar dust may pose a health hazard , possibly including iron toxicity .
Members of NASA 's Lunar Airborne Dust Toxicity Advisory Group , Cooper , Taylor , and colleagues are studying how moon dust affects the respiratory system .
They plan to set a lunar dust exposure standard by 2010 , in time for NASA engineers to design a safer and cleaner trip to the Moon .

The star of Wednesday night ’s final presidential debate was neither Sen.
John McCain nor his rival , Sen. Barack Obama .
It was “ Joe the Plumber , ” aka Joe Wurzelbacher , a brawny , T - shirt - clad plumber whose shaved head gives him a passing resemblance to Mr. Clean .
His name came up 26 times during the debate -- a stand - in for hard - working , upwardly mobile Americans .
Obama met Wurzelbacher on Sunday during a visit to Holland , Ohio , where a TV crew captured a lively exchange between them .
“ Do you believe in the American dream ? ” Wurzelbacher asked Obama .
“ Yes , sir , ” Obama replied .

In the ensuing conversation , which lasted almost six minutes , Wurzelbacher explained that he is trying to buy a business and worries that he will pay higher taxes under Obama ’s proposal .
“ Your new tax plan is going to tax me more , is n’t it ? ” he asked .
“ It ’s not that I want to punish your success , ” replied Obama .
“ I just want to make sure that everybody who is behind you , that they ’ve got a chance for success too .
My attitude is that if the economy ’s good for folks from the bottom up , it ’s gonna be good for everybody .
. . .
I think when you spread the wealth around , it ’s good for everybody . ”
Obama concluded by telling Wurzelbacher , who looked dubious : “ Even if I do n’t get your vote , I am going to work for you . ”

Early in the debate , McCain accused Obama of promulgating “ class warfare ” and introduced “ Joe the Plumber ” to America .
“ Joe wants to buy the business that he has been in for all of these years , worked 10 , 12 hours a day , ” said McCain . " . . .
But he looked at your tax plan , and he saw that he was going to pay much higher taxes . ”
He continued : “ When Sen . Obama ended up his conversation with Joe the Plumber -- we need to spread the wealth around .
In other words , we ’re going to take Joe ’s money , give it to Sen .
Obama and let him spread the wealth around .
. . .
The whole premise behind Sen. Obama ’s plans are class warfare . ”
Obama replied that his plan will cut taxes for 95 % of Americans .

“ Nobody likes taxes , ” he added .
“ I would prefer that none of us had to pay taxes , including myself .
But , ultimately , we ’ve got to pay for the core investments that make this economy strong , and somebody ’s got to do it . ”
The phrase “ Joe the Plumber ” was mentioned nine times during the debate .
At one point , McCain even referred to him as “ my old buddy , Joe the Plumber . ”
Wurzelbacher told the Associated Press : “ It ’s pretty surreal , man , my name being mentioned in a presidential campaign . ”
It was unclear whether the McCain campaign had been in touch with him .
However , in a post - debate interview with CBS News anchor Katie Couric , Wurzelbacher echoed familiar McCain themes .
He said that Obama is well - spoken but that “ there ’s got to be some action behind it . ”

Wurzelbacher told Couric that he had always wanted to question a presidential candidate “ and really corner them and get them to answer a question of -- for once instead of tap - dancing around it .
And , unfortunately , I asked the question , but I still got a tap dance . . . almost as good as Sammy Davis Jr. ”
Still , he refused to say which candidate he would vote for .
Spinners of all stripes invoked America ’s newly minted folk hero .
“ There are a lot of ‘ Joe the Plumbers ’ out there , but the ‘ Joe the Plumbers ’ are going to get hosed by the McCain economic policies , ” said Obama campaign manager David Axelrod .

McCain ’s economic advisor Douglas Holtz - Eakin countered : “ This is a real American , who actually now understands exactly what Barack Obama is up to , and he ’s appalled . ”

Times staff writers James Rainey and Maeve Reston contributed to this report .
Meet the American daily newspaper of 2008 .
It has fewer pages than three years ago , the paper stock is thinner , and the stories are shorter .
There is less foreign and national news , less space devoted to science , the arts , features and a range of specialized subjects .
Business coverage is either packaged in an increasingly thin stand - alone section or collapsed into another part of the paper .
The crossword puzzle has shrunk , the TV listings and stock tables may have disappeared , but coverage of some local issues has strengthened and investigative reporting remains highly valued .
The newsroom staff producing the paper is also smaller , younger , more tech - savvy , and more oriented to serving the demands of both print and the web .
The staff also is under greater pressure , has less institutional memory , less knowledge of the community , of how to gather news and the history of individual beats .
There are fewer editors to catch mistakes .
Despite an image of decline , more people today in more places read the content produced in the newsrooms of American daily newspapers than at any time in years .
But revenues are tumbling .
The editors expect the financial picture only to worsen , and they have little confidence that they know what their papers will look like in five years .
This description is a composite .
It is based on face - to - face interviews conducted at newspapers across the country and the results of a detailed survey of senior newsroom executives .
In total , more than 250 newspapers participated .
It is , we believe , the most systematic effort yet to examine the changing nature of the resources in American newspaper newsrooms at a critical time .
It is an attempt to document and quantify cutbacks and innovations that have generally been known only anecdotally .
The study , by journalist Tyler Marshall and the Pew Research Center ’s Project for Excellence in Journalism , captures an industry in the grips of two powerful , but contradictory , forces .
On one hand , financial pressures sap its strength and threaten its very survival .
On the other , the rise of the web boosts its competitiveness , opens up innovative new forms of journalism , builds new bridges to readers and offers enormous potential for the future .
Many editors believe the industry ’s future is effectively a race between these two forces .
Their challenge is to find a way to monetize the rapid growth of web readership before newsroom staff cuts so weaken newspapers that their competitive advantage disappears .
In recent weeks — after this survey was completed — a new round of newsroom cutbacks , made against a backdrop of steadily deteriorating advertising revenues and rising production costs , intensifies the difficulty of the challenge .
This report is an attempt to document where newspapers are in that race .
As editors cut back on coverage and staff , while at the same time building up their capacity online and in multi-media , what is being gained and what is being lost ?
What coverage is disappearing and what beats are considered sacrosanct ?
What new expertise has come into the newsroom , and what knowledge has been lost ?
In short , where is the industry headed ?
The Key Findings :
The majority of newspapers are now suffering cutbacks in staffing , and even more in the amount of news , or newshole , they offer the public .
The forces buffeting the industry continue to affect larger metro newspapers to a far greater extent than smaller ones .
In some cases , these differences are so stark it seems that larger and smaller newspapers are living two distinctly different experiences .
Fully 85 % of the dailies surveyed with circulations over 100,000 have cut newsroom staff in the last three years , while only 52 % of smaller papers reported cuts .
Recent announcements of a further round of newsroom staff reductions at large papers , including the Los Angeles Times , the Chicago Tribune and the Washington Post , indicates these differences may be widening further .
Our survey found that more than half of the editors at larger papers and a third at smaller ones expect more cutbacks in the next year .
But a weaker - than - expected economic performance during the first half of 2008 and grimmer forecasts for the rest of the year suggest some of those cutbacks have already been implemented and darken these projections even further .
Papers both large and small have reduced the space , resources and commitment devoted to a range of topics .
At the top of that list , nearly two thirds of papers surveyed have cut back on foreign news , over half have trimmed national news and more than a third have reduced business coverage .
In effect , America ’s newspapers are narrowing their reach and their ambitions and becoming niche reads .
The culture of the daily newspaper newsroom is also changing .
New job demands are drawing a generation of young , versatile , tech - savvy , high - energy staff as financial pressures drive out higher - salaried veteran reporters and editors .
Newsroom executives say the infusion of new blood has brought with it a new competitive energy , but they also cite the departure of veteran journalists , along with the talent , wisdom and institutional memory they hold as their single greatest loss .
Clearly stretched to describe what is unfolding in their newsrooms , editors use words like , “ exciting , ” “ extraordinary , ” “ nerve - wracking ” and “ tumultuous . ”
Newspaper websites are increasingly a source of hope but also of fear .
Editors feel torn between the advantages the web offers and the energy it consumes to produce material often of limited or even questionable value .
A plurality of editors ( 48 % ) , for instance , say they are conflicted by the trade - offs between the speed , depth and interactivity of the web and what those benefits are costing in terms of accuracy and journalistic standards .
Yet a similar plurality ( 43 % ) thinks “ web technology offers the potential for greater - than - ever journalism and will be the savior of what we once thought of as newspaper newsrooms . ”
Amid these concerns — and despite the enormous cutbacks and profound worries — editors still sense that their product is improving , not worsening .
Fully 56 % think their news product is better than it was three years earlier .
“ I believe the journalism itself is discernibly better than it was a year ago , ” said the editor of a large metropolitan daily , whose paper last year lost 70 newsroom employees .
“ There ’s an improvement in enterprise , in investigations and in the coverage of several core beats . ”
How such upbeat assessments stand up in the face of new staff cuts and more pessimistic economic projections is unclear .
Several editors lamented the attendant loss of time to organize a thoughtful attack on a story , to think through precisely why a story is being done or how to make the story more meaningful .
“ There is a huge pressure to rush to publish , ” one editor added in a comment on the survey .
Overall , newsroom executives say they feel broadly unprepared for the changes sweeping over them and seem uncertain where the changes would lead .
Only 5 % of those responding to the survey said they were very confident of their ability to predict what their newsrooms would look like five years from now .
“ I feel I ’m being catapulted into another world , a world I do n’t really understand , ” said Virginian - Pilot Editor Denis Finley .
“ It ’s scary because things are happening at the speed of light .
The sheer speed ( of change ) has outstripped our ability to understand it all . ”
These are some of the findings of the study , which is based on interviews at newspapers in 15 different cities from four distinct regions of the country and a survey of senior news executives from 259 newspapers .
That sample of newspaper executives includes more than half of all newspapers over 100,000 in circulation , and roughly one - third of those with circulations between 50,000 - 100,000 .
In total , more than one in every five of the nation ’s 1,217 daily newspapers participated , making it one of the broadest surveys of its kind in recent years .
The survey was executed online with the help of Princeton Survey Research Associates during the first quarter of 2008 .
In this report we divide the analysis into six main areas :

Black Friday Is No Longer a Day , It 's a Season
When most people think of Black Friday , they think of the day after Thanksgiving .
But the fact is , over the past several years , the idea of " Black Friday " has been expanding .
In previous years , Black Friday had become a two - day event , since many Black Friday sales are available online on Thanksgiving Day .
Last year , however , Wal - Mart upped the ante with its " Secret Sale " promotion ( pictured ) .
That sale started exactly three weeks before Black Friday .
It featured a high - definition DVD player ( HD - DVD ) for $ 99 , Acer laptop for $ 348 , and 50 " plasma TV for $ 999 , prices that are still aggressive a year later .
Not surprisingly , Wal - Mart received millions of dollars worth of free PR for its " Secret Sale " ( a misnomer if ever there was one ) .
Importantly , Best Buy beat Wal - Mart 's price on the HD - DVD player that day , showing a willingness to compete with its own loss leader and getting its own free PR .
Wal - Mart 's goal was to extend the halo from Black Friday into multiple high - buzz sales events throughout November .
You 're likely to see the same game plan this year from Wal - Mart , which enters this holiday season much healthier than its competitors .
And where Wal - Mart goes , Best Buy , Target , and the others must follow .
It 's a live - or - die holiday season for many stores this year .
Retailers can't ignore the power of huge , " Black Friday " - like sales events on the run up to Thanksgiving .
And if a retailer is thinking about not competing , it had better think twice .
Four years ago , Wal - Mart skipped Black Friday entirely , with no major ad push and no " doorbusters . "
The result was the worst after - Thanksgiving sales weekend for Wal - Mart in years .
Retailers who do n't want to compete with Wal - Mart by expanding Black Friday into a month - long event run the risk of having bad sales for an entire month , a death knell for most .
The Credit Crisis
The credit crisis is affecting retailers and will impact Black Friday .
Most retailers have to borrow money to acquire inventory , which they must then sell to pay off their debt ( and keep the rest for themselves ) .
However , banks have tightened their criteria for lending .
As the credit markets have dried up , retailers are finding it harder to borrow from banks , especially since banks know that American consumers are spending less on non-essentials .
For most retailers , costs to borrow are rising , costs that could destabilize a staggering retailer .
Bankruptcy is no solution , since bankrupt retailers are starved of financing while they attempt to reorganize .
For the first time ever , there 's a real possibility that some retailers will have to renege on Black Friday sales because they 'll be insolvent by the time Black Friday rolls around .

Quinn Insurance has been fined € 3.25 million by the Financial Regulator after it found “ reasonable cause to suspect ” that regulatory requirements had been breached .
Sean Quinn was also fined € 200,000 and is to step down as chairman and director of Quinn Insurance .
In a statement this afternoon , the Regulator said “ breaches related to contraventions by Quinn Insurance Ltd of obligations under the Insurance Acts and Regulations , including failure to notify the Financial Regulator prior to providing loans to related companies . ”
The statement added that no consequences had arisen for any of Quinn ’s policyholders as a result of the suspected breaches .
In a separate statement , Mr Quinn said : “ Quinn Insurance made loans to a related company which amounted to € 288 million in May 2008 when the accounts were finalised . ”
“ These loans breached insurance regulations and as a result of this the Financial Regulator has sanctioned Quinn Insurance and myself . "
“ I accept complete responsibility for this breach of regulation .
While I accept that I made mistakes , I feel that the levels of fines ... do not reflect the fact that there was no risk to policyholders or the taxpayer but are a result of the pressures existing in the current environment .
However we will pay the fines and move on .
“ Because of the above issues I informed the board on June 27th this year of my intention to retire from the board of Quinn Insurance , ” he said , adding that he will continue as chairman of Quinn Group .
James Quigley will replace him as the chairman of Quinn Insurance .
Mr Quinn revealed that he has made large investments in foreign and domestic stock markets over the last few years , targeting Eastern Europe , Russia and India .
He said significant share deals were signed using complicated Contracts For Differences which allow investors to buy into a company without owning shares or declaring the stake .
In these deals buyers and sellers open a contract at a certain price and when it closes the difference is paid , with either side settling the bill depending on whether the value rises or falls .
It is understood that Mr Quinn used this system to invest heavily in Anglo - Irish Bank , which has seen its share price fall from a high of € 12.20 to around € 1.80 in the last year .
Mr Quinn is believed to have bought into the bank at the € 6 mark , spending more than €500 million before moving to convert them to ordinary shares .
Meanwhile , pre-tax profits at Quinn Insurance fell from €323 million to € 245 million in 2007 despite a 40 per cent increase in premium income to € 1.09 billion , according to figures released today by the company .
Operating profit was € 161 million , down € 7 million on the same period in 2006 .
The insurer said today underwriting profits remained strong but investment gains were lower as exceptional equity gains in 2006 were not repeated last year .
The investment gains of € 84 million were almost half the € 155 million reported in 2006 .
The wider Quinn Group today also reported results today which included an € 829 million exceptional charge for 2007 due to provisions against funds advanced to “ related party investment companies ” .
The charge means a €403 million pretax profit before exceptional items has resulted in a loss of loss of €425 million for the year , the company said .
The company said gross sales increased by increased by 29 per cent to € 2.115 billion with operating profit before exceptional items rising 22 per cent to €315 million .

Treasury Secretary Paulson , President Bush and the Federal Reserve are hell bent in giving away at least $ 1.3 Trillion dollars of American tax payer money away to billion dollar corporations under the guise that it is good for America .
American should feel sick to their stomach about this bailout .
I do .
Why is it that big banks and corporations can create this mess and still get bailed out and to add insult to injury , expect the people they used as pawns for years to make their billions to pay the bill .
This is incredible .
Americans should be furious .
You see , no matter what anyone tells you , this latest batch of money , $ 700 BILLION dollars , that we would be giving these corporations , we will never be seen again .
Do you think this money will be paid back ?
Of course not , this is just a away to confiscate money from the American people again under the guise of an emergency .
All we are doing is paying for more golden parachutes and yachts for these banks and corporations .
I understand that this country is truly run by the elite bankers and corporations for the benefit of the elite bankers and corporations .
So , aside from creating a revolution to take back our country , in the meantime I felt the following plan would satisfy their goal of bailing out their buddies but also benefits the American people .
Facts :
1.1 million homes are in foreclosure
800,000 are 3 months past due on their mortgage
My plan :
Take the current number Paulson and Bush are pushing around , $ 700 billion , and bail out the banks and the American people .
Let see $ 700 billion / 1.9 million American households in trouble = $ 368,421 per household .
So here it goes .
Government calls all the banks that these 1.9 million mortgages are held and negotiates to pay them 60 cents on the dollar to buy the mortgages .
The $ 368,421 budget for each home is more than enough .
In reality at 60 cents on the dollar , which these banks would gladly accept , my plan would probably cost half as much as Paulson ’s plan .
Now the government would own these mortgages at a discount and would let the people stay in the homes .
When the home is sold , the government ( we the taxpayer ) would get 100 % of the amount paid for the mortgage plus a percentage or all of the profit from the sale .
Done .
My Plan :
1- Their bank buddies get bailed out nicely at 60 cents on the dollar
2- The American people in trouble get bailed out .
3- The financial system is stabilized .
4- housing prices are stabilized
5- The American taxpayer gets paid back 100 % for helping their fellow Americans in need .
6- The American taxpayer will actually make money on the investment because every house sold will be sold at a profit because the government came in at 60 cents on the dollar or less .
7- America becomes about the American people again .
Compare my plan to the Bush and Paulson confiscation :
1- The banks , corporations , billionaire CEOs and investors get bailed out for defrauding people
2- The American people in trouble get NOTHING
3 - The American Taxpayer gets the bill that will NEVER be paid back
4- The financial system is not stabilized because the root of the problem still exists .
5- The housing market continues to plummet .
6- This plan sparks another crisis– a Credit Card Default Crisis–
Are we going to bail out the credit card companies also ?
7- America continues to be ruled by the banks and corporations at the expense of the American people .
8- The billionaire and millionaire CEOs and their buddies get their bonuses just in time for Christmas
You decide .
What plan would you prefer ?
My plan , that helps your fellow Americans get back on their feet and get your money back plus interest ?
or the Bush / Paulson plan that basically flushes your money down the toilet and ends up as part of some billionaire CEO golden parachute ?
Let me know ..

I 've been using Flog to measure the complexity of my Ruby code and I was wondering how others interpret Flog numbers .
I 'll go first with my opinions : Score of Means0 - 10 Awesome11 - 20 Good enough21 - 40 Might need refactoring 41 - 60 Possible to justify61 - 100 Danger100 - 200 Whoop , whoop , whoop200 +
Someone please think of the children ( note : these are scores for an individual method ) The 20 - 60 range is interesting to me .
Sometimes the complexity of what you 're doing will justify the score and other times the method is in desperate need of refactoring .
The highest Flog score I 've seen in the wild was in the 300's .
What 's you 're personal high and what do you think of my rankings ?
In other news , I 've redesigned the look of my blog so if you only see my post through a reader you might want to stop on by , take a look , and tell me what you think .
Revealed : Jesus was eating EEL in the Last Supper painting , not bread or lamb , according to art historian
The menu portrayed in Leonardo da Vinci's Last Supper painting has finally been revealed .
The painter actually showed Jesus and his disciples eating eel with orange slices , not bread or lamb as previously thought .
That is the opinion of art historian John Varriano , who says the eel was revealed in a 1997 restoration of the world famous painting .
Last Supper : Jesus and his disciples are eating eel with orange slices , a fashionable dish in the 1400s when Leonardo da Vinci painted his masterpiece
Varriano tells Gastronomica magazine that pairing eels and oranges was very fashionable in the 1400s .
The historian also bases his research on Leonardo himself being a fan of eating eels .
The Last Supper was completed in 1498 , and was commissioned by Duke Ludovico , who was Leonardo 's patron .
Unlike the male - dominated societies of their chimpanzee relatives , bonobo society — in which females enjoy a higher social status than males — has a " make - love - not - war " kind of image .
While chimpanzee males frequently band together to hunt and kill monkeys , the more peaceful bonobos were believed to restrict what meat they do eat to forest antelopes , squirrels , and rodents .
Not so , according to a study , reported in the October 14th issue of Current Biology , a Cell Press publication , that offers the first direct evidence of wild bonobos hunting and eating the young of other primate species .
" These findings are particularly relevant for the discussion about male dominance and bonding , aggression and hunting — a domain that was thought to separate chimpanzees and bonobos , " said Gottfried Hohmann of the Max - Planck - Institute for Evolutionary Anthropology .
" In chimpanzees , male - dominance is associated with physical violence , hunting , and meat consumption .
By inference , the lack of male dominance and physical violence is often used to explain the relative absence of hunting and meat eating in bonobos .
Our observations suggest that , in contrast to previous assumptions , these behaviors may persist in societies with different social relations . "
Bonobos live only in the lowland forest south of the river Congo , and , along with chimpanzees , they are humans ' closest relatives .
Bonobos are perhaps best known for their promiscuity : sexual acts both within and between the sexes are a common means of greeting , resolving conflicts , or reconciling after conflicts .
The researchers made the discovery that these free - loving primates also hunt and kill other primates while they were studying a bonobo population living in LuiKotale , Salonga National Park , in the Democratic Republic of Congo .
They had been observing the bonobos there for the last five years , which is what made the new observations possible .
Although Hohmann 's team did have prior evidence for monkey hunting by bonobos , it came exclusively from indirect studies of fresh fecal samples — one of which contained the digit of a black mangabey .
Yet , in the absence of direct behavioral observations , it was not entirely clear whether the bonobos had hunted the mangabey themselves or had taken it from another predator .
The researchers have now seen three instances of successful hunts in which bonobos captured and ate their primate prey .
In two other cases , the bonobo hunting attempts failed .
The data from LuiKotale showed that both bonobo sexes play active roles in pursuing and hunting monkeys .
The involvement of adult females in the hunts ( which is not seen in chimps ) may reflect social patterns such as alliance formation and cooperation among adult females , they said .
Overall , the discovery challenges the theory that male dominance and aggression must be causally linked to hunting behavior , an idea held by earlier models of the evolution of aggression in human and non-human primates .
Future work on the bonobos of LuiKotale may shed light on the social and ecological conditions that encourage their monkey - hunting expeditions , yielding insight into the evolutionary significance and causes of aggression , hunting , and meat eating in bonobos , chimpanzees , and ourselves .
The researchers include Martin Surbeck and Gottfried Hohmann , of Department of Primatology , Max - Planck Institute for Evolutionary Anthropology , Leipzig , Germany .
A team of Swiss researchers have discovered a security vulnerability in many modern keyboards that allow keystrokes to be captured remotely by tracking electromagnetic emissions .
The discovery raises concerns about entering sensitive data like banking passwords using a computer keyboard or even an ATM keypad .
The duo , Martin Vuagnoux and Sylvain Pasini , wrote a paper on the security flaw for the Lausanne Security and Cryptography Laboratory ( LASEC ) and documented their experiments in two videos ( below ) .
The team found 4 different modes of attack that could be used to capture keystrokes from up to 20 meters away , even through walls .
They tested 11 different keyboard models including laptop , USB and PS2 types that were purchased between 2001 and 2008 .
All were found to be vulnerable to at least one of the four attacks .
They used basic , inexpensive equipment yet in one demonstration managed to capture keystrokes inconspicuously from an adjacent room .
To ensure the success of the experiments , they did remove all other sources of interference such as the display and computer ’s power supply which would n’t be possible in a real - world setting .
They are confident , however , that the system could be improved with more sophisticated equipment .
I wonder how those picture - based passwords are coming along ?

Undergrads identify Pearl murder suspects after FBI gave up David Edwards and Muriel Kane
Published : Friday August 15 , 2008
Print This Email This MSNBC 's Rachel Maddow reported on Thursday that a group of college students may have succeeded where the FBI failed in identifying the killers of journalist Daniel Pearl .
Although four men were convicted of Pearl 's murder in Pakistan in 2002 , there were thought to be as many as 19 more suspects .
A year after the murder , CBS reported , " Authorities are reluctant to discuss the murder .
Suspects disappear or are found dead .
Crucial dates are confused .
Confessions are offered and then recanted .
There is agreement on one point : Nobody who physically carried out the killing has been convicted .
None of the four men sentenced is even believed to have ever been at the shed where Pearl was held .
Three of the convicted men never met Pearl at all . "
But now , says Maddow , " A group of undergrads at Georgetown University , led by a professor who was a colleague of Pearl 's at the Wall Street Journal , have themselves figured out the real identities of 15 of those 19 at - large suspects .
The professor , Asra Nomani , says , ' The FBI says this is an open investigation , but in talking to officials it 's clear there 's no work being done on the ground . ' "
" This is what you call a war on terror ? " asked Maddow .
According to the Georgetown website , Nomani and Associate Dean Barbara Feinman Todd " assembled a team of 32 graduate and undergraduate students over the course of two semesters to pursue the unanswered questions surrounding the slain journalist 's kidnapping and murder .
They are continuing the project through the fall semester 2008 , and they plan to publish the results of the investigation in spring 2009 . "
Nomani , who was a close friend of Pearl 's , recently told an interviewer , " We were both children of immigrants .
His parents moved here from Israel ; mine came from India .
He was Jewish , and I'm Muslim , so our stories are different , but still , he helped me find my identity .
He helped me understand that I could be an American and a Muslim .
When I told him I 'd never been to a prom because I was a good Muslim girl , he threw me a prom and invited all our friends . "
The interviewer also found that " Nomani has an unusual résumé : A former travel reporter for the Journal , she has also written a book about tantric sex , in addition to a memoir about her pilgrimage to Mecca , Islam 's most sacred city , as an unmarried Muslim mom .
The New York Times has compared her to Rosa Parks for her gutsy brand of feminism .
For inspiration , she carries around Nancy Drew 's Guide to Life in her backpack . "

Whither Al - Qaeda in Iraq ?
By Colin Kahl
Hello there .
I want to thank Phil Carter for inviting me to be part of the team pinch - hitting for him while he 's away .
For my first post , I wanted to say a few words about al - Qaeda in Iraq ( AQI ) .
Bob Woodward claims in his new book " The War Within " that " groundbreaking " covert techniques , rather than the surge of conventional forces , have devastated AQI over the past year .
This oversells the case , but there is no doubt that American special operations forces and intelligence agencies have become much more proficient at targeting AQI leadership and cadre .
This fact was also noted by a piece in the Post on Saturday .
Stories like this tend to emphasize " gee-whiz " technological advancements ( such as the ability to track individuals with unmanned aerial vehicles and rapidly exploit data found on cell phones and computers for follow - on raids ) , as well as the improved coordination between various U.S. agencies involved in the hunt for terrorists .
At least as important , however , has been the flood of intelligence on al - Qaeda in Iraq from human sources , and here the Sunni community 's turn against AQI has been decisive in increasing the amount of " actionable " intelligence available to U.S. forces .
That said , I do n't want to linger on the source of al - Qaeda in Iraq 's troubles -- I want to talk about its magnitude .
When I was in Iraq last month , I had the chance to speak with numerous military and intelligence analysts .
Although they are reluctant to say so in public , there was near unanimity in private that al - Qaeda in Iraq has been " strategically defeated . "
What does this mean ?
It means that AQI remains capable of assassination , intimidation , and the occasional spectacular bombing , but the organization no longer poses a threat to the viability of the Iraqi government .
Saturday 's story in the Post noted these sentiments as well : " While AQI remains capable of staging deadly suicide bombings , its leaders are becoming reviled throughout the country and are hard - pressed to find sanctuary anywhere in Iraq , according to U.S. defense and intelligence officials . "
This is big news .
The administration 's claim that Iraq is the central front in the war on terrorism has always been dubious , but now it is simply unsustainable .
Of course , this did n't stop President Bush from reiterating the claim during his speech today at National Defense University , where he reminded us , " Al Qaida leaders have repeatedly declared that Iraq is the central front of their war with America . "
Yet , as Saturday 's Post story notes :
" The shift also is tacitly acknowledged inside al - Qaeda 's base on the Afghan - Pakistan border , as Osama bin Laden has begun retooling his propaganda campaign to emphasize the conflict in Afghanistan instead of the failing effort in Iraq , the officials said .
While there is little evidence that al - Qaeda is attempting to move fighters and resources from Iraq to Afghanistan , the Iraq conflict is no longer driving recruitment and donations for al - Qaeda as it did as recently as nine months ago , they said .
Attacks inside Iraq by AQI , meanwhile , have dropped sharply , with 28 incidents and 125 civilian deaths reported in the first six months of this year , compared with 300 bombings and more than 1,500 deaths in 2007 .
" Iraq will always be a target that resonates for al - Qaeda , but we believe it will never again be the central front , " said a U.S. counterterrorism analyst who was not authorized to speak on the record .
" Their ability to affect what is going on in Iraq has been greatly diminished . " "
Iraq 's Shia and Kurdish communities revile AQI , and the Sunni turn against AQI is unlikely to be reversed .
" We do n't see the Sunni community going back to al - Qaeda under any circumstances , " a senior defense official told the Post .
In this environment , the United States should be able to gather sufficient intelligence to effectively target AQI and prevent a safe haven from emerging in Iraq even as our troops draw down .
We need to seize this opportunity to shift more resources to confront the challenge posed by Al Qaeda in Afghanistan and Pakistan .
Bush has announced the withdrawal of 8,000 U.S. forces ( including one combat brigade ) from Iraq by next March , and the deployment to Afghanistan of one additional Marine battalion in November and an Army brigade in January .
Given the deteriorating situation in Afghanistan , it is clear that more is needed .
And the sooner the better .

Being an environmentalist on Earth Day is kind of like being Irish on St. Patrick ’s Day ( since I am both , I feel I can speak with some authority ) .
I look at my environmentalism much as I do my national heritage – foundational elements of who I am .
So , on Earth Day , I am happy to see others celebrate what is an important part of my identity .
That said , I think I may also harbor a tiny bit of resentment and even a tinge of animosity toward those individuals , the media , and corporate interests that co-opt the environmental issue for the sake of increasing ad revenue or pawning their newest eco-friendly wares .
Is it fair for me to do so ?
Mostly because I ’m not one for ethics , I will not build an ethical argument as to why it is fair for me to be skeptical and even cynical about Earth Day as we currently know it .
In stead , I will argue that this skepticism has been a part of Earth Day since its inception in 1970 .
And until some substantive change is produced by the actions on Earth Day , there will be those who remain skeptical .
Earth Day 1970
Earth Day started out as an idea for a teach - in , a tactic used effectively by the New Left and the anti-Vietnam War movement .
Senator Gaylord Nelson ( D - WI ) was the first to develop the idea for the event , which would be a “ National Teach - in on the Crisis of the Environment ” designed to help crystallize this new environmental constituency while also distancing it from the counterculture and New Left activists ( 1 ) .
Senator Gaylord Nelson later wrote , “ I was satisfied that if we could tap into the environmental concerns of the general public and infuse the student anti-war energy into the environmental cause , we could generate a demonstration that would force this issue onto the political agenda . ”
Nelson was proved correct .
As the word got out , “ It took off like gangbusters … Telegrams , letters , and telephone inquiries poured in from all across the country …
That was the remarkable thing about Earth Day .
It organized itself . ”
But traditional conservationists were not comfortable with the mainstream tone the event was promoting , nor the intense media coverage the teach - in was attracting .
Both of these , they argued , were attracting the powerful moneyed interests of industrial manufacturers and utilities .
According to environmental scholar Robert Gottlieb , “ In the weeks leading up to and following April 22 , the media embraced environmentalism as the all - inclusive cause of the day . ”
On the other hand , some industry groups were not comfortable associating with the first Earth Day event , thanks to the paranoid fears of right - wing politicians who suggested a conspiratorial connection between the date selected for Earth Day and the centennial of Vladimir Lenin ’s birthday ( 2 ) .

Barack Obama reminded an audience yesterday that American consumers can save money and improve fuel efficiency by keeping their tires inflated and getting regular tune - ups .
I thought this was just common sense , and one of those simple steps that everyone already knew about .
Apparently , Republicans have decided that it ’s worthy of mockery .
“ [ Obama ] suggested we put air in our tires to save on gas , ” McCain told a group of voters .
“ My friends , let ’s do that , but do you think that ’s enough to break our dependence on Middle Eastern oil ?
I do n’t think so . ”
Well , Obama did n’t say we could break our dependence if we inflated our tires ; he said we could save money and improve fuel efficiency .
It wo n’t “ break our dependence on Middle Eastern oil ” if we open up more of America ’s coastlines to oil drilling , either , but it ’s suddenly become the basis for McCain ’s entire energy policy .
But it seems
Republicans really are worked up about this tire thing .
Here ’s Newt Gingrich on Fox News .
While Gingrich ranted , you could hear one of the Fox News personalities laughing a bit , as if the notion of routine auto maintenance , as a method of improving energy efficiency , was necessarily hilarious .
I feel like I ’m missing something here .
Fortunately , Ben at TP set the record straight .
Longtime users of the micro-messaging service Twitter may have noticed something around the start of the political primary season : A lot of tweets ( Twitter messages ) about politics .
To some this is annoying , to others , it ’s addicting .
Tonight , Twitter will acknowledge how big the interest is around the topic of politics by launching a new sub-site to Twitter called Election2008 , according to The New York Times ’ political blog , The Caucus .
Starting at midnight , election.twitter.com will go live and will feature an interface that regular Twitter users will instantly recognize .
There will be one major difference however .
Gone is the famously outdated question “ What are you doing ? ” ( Twitter was initially just about people saying what they were doing ) ; it ’s been replaced with “ What do you think ? ”
The idea of course , is to get people ’s opinions on political topics , the candidates and larger issues like the economy .
It ’s no coincidence that the site is launching on the eve of the first debate between Democratic Presidential candidate Barack Obama and Republican candidate John McCain .
Twitter has made note of the surges it ’s seen during the primary debates and more recently the DNC and RNC national convention key speeches .
Of course , if McCain has his way , there wo n’t be a debate tomorrow night — so you can expect a lot of tweets about that on Twitter ’s election site if nothing else .
The new site will let users easily filter for messages related to certain candidates .
It will also highlight tweets from the candidates themselves ( or at least their representatives ) .
I asked Twitter how exactly the new election site will tie in to Twitter proper , and Twitter chief executive Jack Dorsey confirmed that any tweets made on election .
twitter.com will tie into the regular Twitter site , so those who do n’t make the jump to the new site wo n’t be totally left out of the action .
Twitter ’s election site seems like a logical extension of something that was done earlier this summer to get answers for people ’s political questions .
Representatives from both sides took questions from Twitter and answered them — all within the service ’s signature 140 characters .
This new site also seems influenced by ones that came before it .
Politweets for example , has been tracking and sorting political discussion on Twitter for several months .
This year ’s Presidential race is becoming increasingly about the web .
Social network Facebook just launched a way to register to vote online , social voting site Digg has been heavily involved in political discussions with the major parties , and Google has been doing various things with its properties including YouTube to spark interest in voting .
Twitter itself has another deal in place with CurrentTV to have tweets integrated into television coverage of the debates .
Plenty of other sites out there are doing their part as well .
Surprisingly enough , after months of domination on the Internet , Obama seems to have yielded a bit of ground to McCain as of late .
But the trend still seems clear that the web is a home turf of sorts for the Democratic Presidential candidate .
You can find me on Twitter here along with fellow VentureBeat writers Eric Eldon , Dean Takahashi , Anthony Ha , Chris Morrison and Dan Kaplan .
Oh , and we have a VentureBeat account ( for our posts ) as well .
Car with teen behind wheel runs red light , kills cabbie in San Mateo
An intoxicated teenage driver ran a red light in San Mateo this morning and broadsided a taxicab , killing the driver , then fled as flames engulfed his car where two other teenagers were trapped , police said .
Police were able to pull the badly injured youths from the burning Volkswagen Jetta on El Camino Real near Hillsdale Shopping Center , but there was nothing they could do for the cabdriver , 48 - year - old Michael Earl Prescott of Redwood City .
He was pronounced dead at the scene .
The incident happened at 6:15 a.m. when the 16 - year - old driver of the Volkswagen , speeding north on El Camino , ran a red light at 31st Avenue and hit the Yellow Cab , which was carrying no passengers , police Capt .
Kevin Raffaelli said .
The Jetta driver ran , leaving behind two passengers - a 15 - year - old girl and 17 - year - old boy - who were trapped in the car , police said .
The Jetta then burst into flames .
Police who arrived on the scene managed to pull the youths through the fire and out of the car .
The driver was found hiding behind a building a short distance away and " fought violently " with officers before they were able to arrest him , police said .
He suffered minor injuries in the crash .
The passengers he abandoned suffered serious injuries , police said .
The boy is in serious condition at Stanford Hospital with severe burns and fractures , and the girl is in serious condition with numerous fractures .
The Jetta driver was booked on suspicion of gross vehicular manslaughter while intoxicated , felony hit and run , felony assault on an officer and resisting an officer , police said .
His name was not released because he is a juvenile .

If your television declares John McCain the president elect on the evening of November 4th , your television will be lying .
You should immediately pick up your pre-packed bags and head straight to the White House in Washington , D.C. , which we will surround and shut down until this attempt at a third illegitimate presidency is reversed .
A McCain “ win ” will not be illegitimate because I disagree with his policies , but because he himself has rendered it illegitimate .
He and his campaign and allied supporters have sought to illegally remove hundreds of thousands of voters from the rolls , fraudulently registered people as Republicans without their knowledge and against their will , obstructed voter registration drives , falsely warned students against voting where they attend school , falsely accused community groups of voter registration fraud , falsely alleged the widespread existence of voter fraud , and encouraged supporters to falsely believe McCain ’s opponent is a foreign terrorist through speeches , recorded phone messages , and flyers .
Already in early voting in a number of states there have been cases of votes on electronic machines visibly flipping to McCain or McKinney when intended for Obama .
We will see McCain supporters on November 4th challenging people ’s right to vote , seeking to force people to vote on provisional ballots , and seeking to have provisional ballots discarded .
And we will see electronic vote counts wildly out of step with the most recent polls , although not with exit polls — which we will be denied any access to unless they have been “ adjusted ” to match the official counts .
Inciting your supporters to violence with racist and religious lies about your opponent , effectively alleging treason on absolutely no basis , should be enough , alone , to disqualify a campaign for the presidency of the United States .
Working to block voters from registering should be enough on its own .
Any of the dozens of creative forms of vote suppression currently being used by the Republicans should be enough .
And allowing votes to be counted on completely unverifiable machines owned and controlled by corporations allied with your party should make the results illegitimate even if plausible .
If McCain is declared the “ winner , ” it will not be plausible , but at this point he has so disgraced himself and our electoral system that he is no longer a legitimate candidate for president regardless of what the polls ( themselves fallible , but all we ’ve got ) say just before election day .
Too many people have already been denied the opportunity to even push the buttons and have their votes miscounted .
Too much incendiary slander has been let loose .
Too much visible vote flipping has already been documented .
If Obama officially wins , McCain is likely to challenge it , charging the Obama campaign with some of the very crimes engaged in by McCain himself .
Our reaction should be exactly the same in the event of a McCain challenge as in the event of a McCain “ victory . ”
We should not sit back for even a split second and wonder how it will work out .
We should not try to organize a plan on the spur of the moment to travel to keybattleground states .
We should be prepared already to immediately travel to Washington , D.C. , head straight for the White House , occupyLafayette Square Park , the Ellipse , and surrounding streets , block entrances , and shut the place down until Obama is recognized as the president elect or we are guaranteed a credible election with universal registration and hand - counted paper ballots .
We may be there for days or weeks or months .
But we must be there .
We must be there by the millions .
We must show each other , and the nation , and the world that we have had enough , that we will not stand for one more stolen election , that we will not give in to fear , lies , theft , and intimidation .
If they choose to attack our nonviolent gathering of citizens , let them do it right in front of George W. Bush ’s White House with the world ’s media watching .
We will not back down .
When the human body kicks into high gear , the brain can run on recycled , alternative energy to make the whole system more efficient , scientists have discovered .
The body breaks carbohydrates from food into glucose , the primary fuel of muscles and the mind .
When muscles work hard , they produce lactate as a byproduct .
Though recent studies have shown that muscles can re-use the lactate as fuel , conventional wisdom holds that it can also build up in the form of lactic acid , reducing performance and causing pain .
The new research shows that the brain can switch to lactate during strenuous exercise , using the muscles ' byproduct as backup fuel .
The researchers , in Denmark and The Netherlands , looked at existing studies that had compared the blood running to and from the heads of volunteers engaged in strenuous exercise .
The blood on its way to the brain was found to contain considerably more lactate than blood flowing from the brain .
Further investigation showed that the brain was not storing the lactate which had come from the muscles during exercise , but rather using it as fuel .
In fact , the brain helped to clear lactate from the circulation , thereby leaving glucose to the muscles that need it for the hard work they were performing .
The finding helps explain why the brain is able to work properly when the body 's demands for fuel and oxygen are highest , and it shows that the brain actually shifts into a higher gear in terms of activity .
This opens doors to entirely new areas of brain research related to understanding lactate 's specific neurological effects that could lead to new treatments for common brain ailments , the researchers said in a statement today .
The findings are detailed in the October issue of the FASEB Journal .
" From an evolutionary perspective , the result of this study is a no- brainer , " said Dr. Gerald Weissmann , editor - in - chief of the journal .
" Imagine what could have or did happen to all of the organisms that lost their wits along with their glucose when running from predators .
They were obviously a light snack for the animals able to use lactate . "

For children with Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder ( ADHD ) tasks that require concentration such as doing homework or taking a test can be very difficult .
A simple , inexpensive remedy may be a " dose of nature . "
A study conducted at the University of Illinois shows that children with ADHD demonstrate greater attention after a 20 - minute walk in a park than after a similar walk in a downtown area or a residential neighborhood .
The study , conducted by child environment and behavior researchers Andrea Faber Taylor and Frances E. Kuo was published in a recent issue of the Journal of Attention Disorders .
" From our previous research , we knew there might be a link between spending time in nature and reduced ADHD symptoms , " said Faber Taylor .
" So to confirm that link we conducted a study in which we took children on walks in three different settings - one especially " green " and two less " green " - and kept everything about the walks as similar as possible . "
Some children took the " green " walk first ; others took it second or last .
After each walk , an experimenter who did n't know which walk the child had been on tested their attention using a standard neurocognitive test called Digit Span Backwards , in which a series of numbers are said aloud and the child recites them backwards .
It 's a test in which practice does n't improve your score .
" We compared each child 's performance to their own performance on different walks , " said Faber Taylor .
" And when we compared the scores for the walks in different environments , we found that after the walk in the park children generally concentrated better than they did after a walk in the downtown area or the neighborhood area .
The greenest space was best at improving attention after exposure . "
" What this particular study tells us is that the physical environment matters , " said Kuo .
" We do n't know what it is about the park , exactly - the greenness or lack of buildings - that seems to improve attention , but the study tells us that even though everything else was the same - who the child was with , the levels of noise , the length of time , the time of day , whether the child was on medication - if we kept everything else the same , we just changed the environment , we still saw a measurable difference in children 's symptoms .
And that 's completely new .
No one has done a study looking at a child in different environments , in a controlled comparison where everything else is the same . "
The sample size was relatively small children - mostly because the logistics were a nightmare to coordinate .
" Because we kept everything the same , the children all went to the same park and walked through the same neighborhood and downtown area .
The testing location had to be close by so that there was n't a lot of lag time between going for the walk and taking the post - test , " said Faber Taylor .
" And each child was always paired with the same adult guide for their walks , and all the children were tested by the same tester . "
Kuo said that the variables of the study were very hard to control .
" We started with a much larger sample size .
But when we threw out all of the things that could go wrong - the weather was n't good one day , the child came late , or came medicated -- when we threw out all of those , it left us with this relatively pure , clean sample to work with . "
Faber Taylor added that their confidence in the findings from this study is bolstered by findings from other studies .
" Because we have results from a national study which looked at over 450 children , we can have more confidence that this relationship between natural settings and improved attention is true not just for the children in this study . "
She said that the larger study included children from all over the United States , representing a wide range of ages , different community sizes , and both with and without hyperactivity .
" The findings from the national study give us some confidence that this relationship applies to all children with ADHD . "
Kuo emphasized that this study involved an objective test of attention , not just on children 's or parents ' impressions .
During the walks , all of the children were unmedicated -- those of the participants who normally took medications to control their ADHD symptoms stayed off their medications on the days of the walks .
Interestingly , Faber Taylor and Kuo found that a " dose of nature " may be as helpful -- at least for a while -- as a dose of stimulants .
" We calculated the size of the effect in our study and compared it to the size of effects in a recent medication study , " said Faber Taylor , " and we were surprised to see that the dose of nature had effects the same size or even larger than the dose of medication . "
What remains to be seen is how long the effects of a dose of nature last .
" Some of the previous survey research suggests a relationship between children who regularly play in green spaces and how severe their symptoms are .
Children who have regular exposure to green spaces have milder symptoms overall .
So that 's hinting that there may be a persistent effect , " said Kuo .
She said that while there are hints that the regular doses of nature work long term - that you can expose a child to the same green outdoor settings day after day and still get a benefit - the science is n't advanced enough to give parents a strict formula .
" We can't say for sure , ' two hours of outdoor play will get you this many days of good behavior , ' but we can say it 's worth trying , and we can say that as little as 20 minutes of outdoor exposure could potentially buy you an afternoon or a couple of hours to get homework done , " said Kuo .
" One reason we believe this is that if the effect were short - lived , we do n't think that parents would have so consistently observed it .
But they do .
They report it over and over .
And they report it independently .
So , in the larger study with over 450 kids , we asked ' what 's your kid like after watching TV or after playing outside ' and none of the parents know what any of the other parents are telling us , but they overwhelmingly agree . "
Faber Taylor believes it would be easy to add a dose of nature to a child 's routine .
" I could imagine parents hearing about this research and immediately applying it - just trying it out - taking their child to the park either when their child 's symptoms are exacerbated or as a regular routine .
It 's not that hard to incorporate , especially if they have a green backyard or if they can get to a neighborhood park .
Again , we can't say for sure that it would work for any given child - but there 's probably very little risk involved in encouraging your child to play outdoors and seeing if their symptoms improve . "
She also says that the benefits of a dose of nature do n't apply just to children with ADHD .
" We 're all on a continuum of attention so this study has implications for all of us , " said Taylor .
" ADHD is just at the far end of attention functioning , but there 're plenty of us who fall somewhere close to that end of the continuum , and we all experience times when we 're mentally fatigued - times when we 're less able to focus and do tasks and get easily distracted .
The evidence suggests that natural settings can benefit everyone , even children ( and adults ) who have not been diagnosed with ADHD . "

It ’s an honor for me to be able to present this interview I did with Lifehacker editor Gina Trapani , one of my personal blogging heroes .
Gina was one of the bloggers who inspired me to start Zen Habits , and she continues to set a standard of excellence to which I aspire to meet with each post .
Gina recently published the second edition of her Lifehacker - in - print book , Upgrade Your Life : The Lifehacker Guide to Working Smarter , Faster , Better , a book I highly recommend to anyone who has n’t been following Lifehacker religiously for the last few years ( as I have ) .
Even if you ’re a regular Lifehacker reader , Upgrade Your Life is a great collection of the site ’s best tips in an easy - to - read format .
In this interview , Gina reveals her top three productivity tips , what it was like at Lifehacker in the early days , how she wrote her book while writing and editing a massive blog , and her plans for the future .
I hope you enjoy it as much as I have !
Leo :
Your book is kind of a lo- fi version of Lifehacker , and I ’m sure it ’s helping a lot of people who never read your blog before .
What are you most proud of about the book , and what have people seemed to like most about it ?
Gina :
The book is a good introduction to Lifehacker for people who do n’t read blogs , and people who are less technically savvy that our daily online readers .
It highlights our best material in a structured way .
The reverse chronological format of a weblog is great for news , but not good for articulating a hierarchy of ideas , even with categories and tags .
Each chapter of the book is dedicated to a digital productivity issue–email overload , document organization , attention management , portable work–and contains a specific solution to a problem ( like keeping your inbox empty , or synchronizing files between work and home ) .
The book encapsulates the spirit of the web site–which is this daily , ongoing conversation –in a handheld volume .
Since web sites are this ephemeral thing that are hard to capture , I think readers really like having something they can throw in their backpack , flip through , reference , and show to their friends and family .
Leo :
Writing a book while blogging and editing a top - ranked blog must have been a great challenge even for a productive person like yourself … tell us how you were able to firewall time for book writing .
Gina :
It was a difficult challenge , probably the hardest I ’ve ever worked in my professional career .
During the heat of the process I wrote through nights and weekends , without much free time at all .
I got the book - writing done by breaking it down into hour - long sprints .
I used a kitchen timer and would set it for 60 minutes and write like mad , without getting up or stopping the whole time .
My timer beeps once when there are 10 minutes left and twice when there are 5 minutes left , so I was able to wrap up whatever I was working on in that session .
On good days I ’d do 3 - 5 sessions like this throughout the day , on bad ones none .
Over time I had a good read of how many hour - long sessions would produce a single hack , and a single chapter , so I was able to plot out my schedule in time for my editor ’s deadlines .
I actually enjoyed blogging more during the book writing process because I can get a few posts published AND get feedback in an hour !
Leo :
What was the “ ah - ha ! ” moment for you , when you started to become more productive , to use lifehacks , to use technology as a productivity tool ?
Gina :
It was n’t a singular ah - ha moment for me–it happens whenever I fall off the wagon , regroup , and then see results .
When I ’m thinking about these things and applying them to my daily life and they work , I go , “ Ah ha !
See ?
If I always did the right thing … ”
Problem is , I do n’t follow my own advice as much as I could . :)
But , whenever I get an email reminder from myself to do something I would ’ve forgotten about had I not set it up , whenever someone says “ thanks for getting back to me so quickly , ” whenever I see progress on my personal projects … these are the times when I realize ( again ) that better habits and overall mindfulness works .
Leo :
By the time I started reading Lifehacker , it was already huge .
Tell us about the early days , when you had only a few hundred readers and you built it into the powerhouse it is today .
How did you accomplish that feat ?
Gina :
The first few months of Lifehacker were a lot of fun but a lot of work .
Today I ’ve got a staff of 4 writers , a copy editor , and an intern all working together .
Back then it was just me writing a dozen posts a day and reading and responding to all the email we received .
It was great because I got to form personal connections with a smaller reader community .
Since Lifehacker was my almost full time job from the beginning , I had most of the day to read , think , and write .
The concept of life hacks was still very new , still something people were exploring in interesting ways .
( Today it ’s become a way overused and hackneyed , and I take some blame for that ! )
Since Lifehacker is published under the Gawker umbrella , the power of the network really helped me grow the site ’s audience .
That backing freed me up from worries about design , ads , traffic , or technical problems .
I just got to write , and I focused my energy on producing the best content I could .
That ’s the best thing any new blogger can do .
Leo :
How do you not get into a rut ?
You write about the same topics every day , for at least a few years , and you manage to keep things fresh and interesting .
Gina :
I try to always think about and experiment with new ideas , post spins , publishing formats , and coverage areas to stay out of a rut .
Since we cover software and webapp releases and upgrades , we always have something new to write about as it relates to the “ same old ” productivity topics .
Over the years we ’ve expanded our coverage to DIY projects , various operating systems , and interesting platforms ( like Firefox and the iPhone ) .
Leo :
What do you see yourself doing in five years ?
What are your biggest dreams , now that you ’ve achieved such success ?
Gina :
In five years I see myself doing the same things I am now–reading , writing , teaching in some form , and making things online .
I ’m not sure where or in what context exactly ; I ’ve got to leave some things to chance .
My biggest dream ?
To be doing it smarter and better than I am now .
Leo :
You ’ve written about hundreds of productivity tips … but if you had to share the top 3 tips from your book , that you use every day and that do the most for your productivity , what would they be ?
Gina :
When I ’m fully committed to using them , my three - folder system for managing email , my online calendar “ tickler file ” for reminders about stuff I need to do later , and my “ doable to - do list ” all save me from inevitable productivity meltdown on a daily basis .

Vicky Jones says she is Westlife 's biggest fan and has been to 300 concerts
An ' obsessed ' Westlife fan has celebrated her 40th birthday by having a tattoo of the band across her shoulders .
Vicky Jones from Abercwmboi in the Cynon Valley underwent 16 hours under the needle having their four faces etched on .
Vicky , a mother of four , has seen 300 Westlife concerts and counts herself as their greatest fan .
She said : " My children reckon I 'm crazy but the tattoos are fabulous .
" All my money goes on Westlife - about £ 4,000 a year .
I must be their biggest fan . "
Singers Shane Filan , Nicky Byrne , Mark Feehily and Kian Egan added their autographs two months ago .
She then had them inked over onto her back , underneath their portraits .
Her daughter Stacey , 18 , said : " I 'm not that keen on Westlife at all .
Mum 's too obsessed if you ask me . "
Vicky 's husband Colin , 42 , was also not a big fan .
She admitted : " He ca n't abide Westlife but he does n't say a lot . "
There ’s one booming sector of the economy that escapes taxes the rest of us pay .
It ’s the political campaign business .
Politicians and political parties pay no taxes on the money they raise to chase jobs and power .
True charities , like the Salvation Army and Save the Children , pay no taxes on income , and donors may deduct their gifts from federal taxes .
Tax exemption acts as a subsidy of their operations .
They get to use 100 percent of everything they bring in , unlike a private business that can use only what is leftover after paying taxes .
Contributions to a political campaign are not tax deductible .
Under state and federal law , though , money earned by a politician ’s campaign committee is not taxed .
Though no politicians will ever be confused with Mother Teresa , their operations are treated the same as charities that clothe the poor and feed the hungry .
Even without its tax - free advantages , the money raised in this election cycle would make a Fortune 500 company envious .
So far , a combined $ 1.35 billion has been raised by all presidential candidates running this election season .
Candidates for the House of Representatives have reported raising $ 694 million .
Senate candidates have reported collecting $ 293 million .
Those sums do not include what has been pulled in by the moneymaking apparatus housed in the Democratic and Republican parties .
Between the two organizations , the GOP and DNC have raised $ 1.88 billion .
These figures , compiled by opensecrets.org , are incomplete .
They do not include the final months before Election Day , nor the considerable sums candidates will raise after the election , win or lose .
Hillary Clinton , for instance , continues to raise money to pay down a $ 20 million debt .
Bill Richardson is still doing cocktail parties to find cash for his failed race .
Somebody will raise tens of millions of dollars for a grand inauguration party .
Incumbency offers the kind of employment security few Americans will ever know .
The figures reported to date come to more than $ 4.2 billion , none of which has been taxed , and none of which has fed or clothed anyone except for consultants , ad execs , broadcast media millionaires , campaign staff , private pilots and limo drivers .
Sure , campaign workers pay taxes on their salaries .
But by escaping taxes on his or her committee ’s income , a politician enjoys an enormous advantage private businesses never experience .
Society gives true charities tax - free status because they provide necessary services government and the market ca n’t or wo n’t provide .
Traditional charities were established as selfless institutions , though scandals , abuses and fat salaries are not uncommon in the nonprofit sector .
Generally speaking , society wants to encourage these charitable endeavors and gives a helping hand by foregoing taxing their income .
The tax - free status of political campaigns , on the other hand , encourages more Karl Roves and James Carvilles .
Every politician assures us he ’s running because he longs to serve the public interest .
But , particularly if he ’s running for federal office , the job he wants will place him in one of the highest income brackets .
With that job comes glamour , power , junkets , pensions , great health care and a good shot at a paycheck for life .
Incumbency offers the kind of employment security few Americans will ever know .
It ’s time to re-examine the tax - free status of politicians ’ money .
Political campaigns are not charities .
$ 10 million for dried milk and rice to fight famine is an unquestionable benefit for mankind .
Who would argue that $ 10 million ’s worth of attack ads makes the world a better place ?
Though we are seeing more and more money collected by politicians , there does n’t seem to be a commensurate increase in their job performances .
“ Are you better off than you were eight years ago ? ” Bill Clinton asked in 1992 .
We ’re still being asked that rhetorical question , and we ’ll be asked again four years from now , regardless of who takes the White House .
Like the income tax , a tax on politicians should be progressive .
That would let them share an experience enjoyed by many Americans who own businesses or are self - employed .
While we ’re leveling the playing field , let ’s also hit politicians with a death tax .
Many politicians keep scads of money after their campaigns have died .
Six months after being re-elected in 2006 , Bill Richardson still had $ 738,000 in his kitty .
There is no justification for taxpayers subsidizing walking - around money for politicians , or slush funds they can use to help finance other politicians ’ quests for power .
Politicians always tell us they feel our pain .
Let ’s make it easier for them and stop treating them like charity cases .
[ Perl 6 page ]
eqv , === , =:= , etc .
General
Perl 5 and previous have different operators for eq and == , and that is easy to understand .
With no types on the variables , you need different operators to specify string or numeric comparisons .
Perl 5 has objects and classes , and there is no real typed comparison that works between objects of arbitrary type , so something is lacking .
But Perl 6 offers no less than eq , == , eqv , === , =:= , and ~~ .
Most of them are straightforward , and are presented in the following summary .
But === vs eqv is not explained well in S03 version 135 , and needs explaining .
Summary
operator inverse related Description eq ne !eq leg lt le gt ge String Value Comparisons == != !== <=> < <= > >= Numeric Value Comparisons ~~ !~~ Smart Match === !=== Object Identity eqv !eqv cmp after ! after before !
before Canonical Equivalence =:= !=:= Container Identity
operators eq and ==
If you know Perl 5 , you already know that string and numeric tests have different operators .
If you are new to Perl , here is the issue :
my $x = 123 ; my $y = " 123.0 " ; if $ x == $y { say " Numbers match . " } if $x eq $y { say " Strings match . " }
With untyped variables , especially when you are playing fast and lose with the difference between formatting and computational values in the first place ( Perl was made for parsing and printing reports ) , it is important to get the right kind of comparison .
In this example , the comparison is true for numbers but false for strings .
In Perl 6 , these are still with us .
That ’s why we ca n’t use == for a more general form .
operator ~~
The ~~ operator is for smart matching .
Here are some examples of what you can do with it :
$x ~~ 1..10 # $x within range $ x ~~ %hash # $x is a key in the hash $ x ~~ /\d+/ # regular expression
The smart match can be used for many things , and is defined between a great variety of different argument types .
operator =:=
The last one that is simple to explain is =:= which tests for container identity .
It tells you whether two names are aliased to the same symbol .
That ’s all it is for , and since aliasing is done with := or ::= it is easy to keep straight .
operator eqv
The eqv operator is for testing canonical equivalence .
This is what you think of as “ equal ” in C ++.
If you want to test two Dog objects to see if they hold the same value , this is the operator to use .
When writing a Dog class , define infix : < eqv > to indicate equivalence , in the same manner as operator== in C ++.
If you do n’t define such an operator for your class , the default is to compare all the attributes .
Again , this is like the case with C++ ’s operator== .
If you compare things of two different types using eqv , you get whatever the multi dispatch figures out needs to be called , assuming it is not ambiguous .
Again , this is just like C++ does with overloading , only Perl does it at run time rather than compile time .
The old - style Perl ≤ 5 operators == and eq can be described in terms of eqv and forcing the right type .
Since + forces numeric context and ~ forces string context , we have $ a == $ b to be the same as +$ a eqv +$b , and $ a eq $ b to be the same as ~ $a eqv ~$b .
If you were using typed variables or indicating context on the items , you could just use eqv for numbers and strings too .
It is a different philosophy to keep track of the proper types of things rather than to treat them in different ways based on context with no clear idea of which type it actually is at the moment .
my Num $x = get_input ( ) ; my Num $y = 2 * $ z ; if $ x eqv $y { ... }
Even though get_input in this example returns a string , I ’m clear that I wanted a Num and make sure it becomes one before continuing .
So the test is not ambiguous , but clearly a test between two numbers .
In short , eqv is the Perl 6 equivalence operator , and is most similar to operator== in C++ which compares values , but not like == in Java or C# for reference types .
my Dog $ d1 .= new ( " Fido " , : breed < Aussie > ) ; my Dog $ d2 .= new ( " Rex " , : breed < Aussie > ) ; fail if $ d1 eqv $ d2 ; $ d2.name = " Fido " ; if $ d1 eqv $ d2 { say " Dogs test as equivalent " }
Within the Dog class , the eqv operator tests that all the attributes are the same , so it becomes
True as soon as the attributes are changed so that they do in fact match .
But $ d1 and $ d2 are indeed different instances of Dog .
The eqv operator tests if the values ( or contents ) are equivalent .
operator ===
The === operator checks to see if the two arguments are the same object .
This is like comparing pointers in C++ , or comparing reference types in Java and C# .
Given the Dog example above , $ d1 === $ d2 will always be False , because they are different instances , created by different calls to new , regardless of whether they happen to have the same values for their attributes .
Clearly , an implementation of eqv can call === first and not bother comparing all the attributes if it discovers that both parameters are the same object .
If you are not confused , stop now because the confusing part is coming up .
The complication here is that the concept of object identity is more complicated than just comparing addresses like with C++ class instances .
This is actually meant to improve matters over the case of Java and C# which has stark differences in semantics between reference types and value types .
In Perl 6 , the concept of a value type or immutable type is to tie the object ’s identity with its value .
This is the case with numbers and strings , and is a pragmatic matter with the design of Java .
But in Perl 6 , everything is an object , and it is important to generalize the concept and improve upon the situation and still allow the compiler to optimize values in a particular way .
By default , the object id is the address , or whatever implementation detail holds that kind of concept .
But , a class can define things so that representations at different memory locations return the same id .
For numbers that tend to live in registers or get a more streamlined representation than a full object record , the concept of an address does not always exist .
For a type that is made to behave this way , two different instances will compare as the same object if they have the same value .
If the object is not constant , this can be very confusing if you change “ it ” and it does n’t change everywhere .
So do n’t do that .
Value types are for numbers and strings and constant singletons .

Cindy McCain – who was among the first people in the country to question Michelle Obama ’s patriotism after Michelle ’s poorly phrased comments in Wisconsin early this year – is now incredibly offended by Barack Obama ’s suggestion that it is her husband ’s fabulous wealth and opulent lifestyle that has made him less sensitive to the vast majority of Americans with only one home whose incomes have fallen despite the economy ’s growth under the Bush administration .
No – she apparently wants Obama to come up with another reason to explain away her husband ’s doubling down on the economic policies of the Bush administration and calling for massive tax cuts for the biggest companies and the richest individuals while cutting taxes far less than Barack Obama would for 90 % of Americans .
To counter the suggestions that her fortune left her and John McCain out of touch , she defended her family ’s fortune :
My father had nothing .
He and my mother sold everything they had to raise $ 10,000 .
I ’m proud of what my dad and my mother did and what they built and left me .
And I intend to carry their legacy as long as I can .
( Added after watching the complete interview ) :
My father is the American dream !
She really makes it sound like there must be an inspiring story behind how James Hensley ’s net worth went from $ 10,000.00 to over $ 200,000,000.00 .
It brings to mind Richard O’Connor , who , in writing how the oil barons created their vast fortunes , paraphrased the great storyteller Balzac :
Behind every great fortune , there is a great crime .
The corollary would be that behind a large fortune is a decent amount of crime .
The story of Cindy McCain ’s father , James Hensley , begins when he ditched his first wife for a younger woman after returning from World War II a hero ( Sound familiar ? ) .
He got involved with a character named Kemper Marley who is variously described as a rancher , a businessman , a murder suspect , and a top figure in organized crime in Arizona .
While working for Marley , James Hensley and his brother were convicted of the felony offenses of concealing black market liquor sales and conspiracy .
Later Cindy ’s father was charged with falsifying records to evade taxes – although these charges were dismissed , no doubt due to the diligent work of one of Arizona ’s top defense lawyers , William Rehnquist .
After getting through these legal difficulties in the early 1950s , the brothers Hensley bought a horse track – with several mobsters as silent partners .
Cindy ’s father , though , was yearning for a measure of respectability , and sold his stake in the track in the mid-1950s .
Luckily for James Hensley , he got out just a few months before a statewide scandal focused on the track , making life difficult for his brother and all of the other owners .
Hensley ’s brother continued at the track and eventually was sent to prison in the late 1960s after he sold his portion of the track to Marley and a mob-connected front .
Meanwhile , Cindy ’s father had decided to start a beer distributorship :
According to the official founding myth , Jim launched his own beer distributorship , Hensley & Company , in 1955 , with the help of a $ 10,000 loan .
( Unaccounted for is how a cash - strapped ex-convict would have secured the exclusive right to distribute Budweiser in Phoenix . )
The distributorship became Hensley ’s first step in a long march to respectability .
By most accounts , Cindy ’s father worked hard to make his distributorship a success .
And as Arizona began to grow in the sixties boom with millions of people moving to the southwest , Hensley ’s beer distributorship grew with it – leading to the fortune now estimated in the hundreds of millions which financed John McCain ’s start in politics and the McCain ’s opulent lifestyle .
To wrap up this story , Cindy McCain says her father had nothing ; and through hard work , his fortune is now worth hundreds of millions .
But untold is that this fortune is based on gambling and liquor , mobsters and political connections , working hard and cutting corners , and always staying one step ahead of scandal and conviction .
Because of his crimes , his connections and his hard work , he was able to provide Cindy McCain with a life of luxury .
When the young Cindy wrecked her Porsche , her father bought her a Mercedes Benz .
When she became a teacher and was criticized for driving a car that was too flashy , her father bought her a second car to drive to school .
And of course , Cindy can’t imagine , even now , how anyone can get around Arizona without a private plane .
It ’s easy to see how someone who has led the life that Cindy McCain has can believe that a little bit of hard work will get you a few hundred million – and how someone who ’s father bought her a second car to keep the other teachers from making fun of her luxury car could fail to sympathize with the average American having trouble paying all of their bills .
It ’s not impossible for someone living such an opulent lifestyle to understand and advocate for the middle class and the poor – look at Franklin Delano Roosevelt – but if you are instead are insisting on economic policies that benefit the richest individuals and the biggest corporations – it ’s hard not to see a connection .
It ’s a bit rich of Cindy McCain to defend herself and her husband by invoking how hard her father worked for his fortune .
And it ’s yet another demonstration of how “ in touch ” she is with the concerns of most Americans .
N.B . This post was written in the midst of an obviously contentious election campaign – one in which I had strongly considered supporting Senator John McCain – as I ’ve detailed elsewhere – but after careful evaluation , had come to the conclusion that Barack Obama was the only candidate suited to our current challenges .
While I stand by the content of the post , in retrospect , the tone is a bit overheated .
I do n’t especially care where her fortune came from .
The Kennedy fortune is widely rumored to have come from similarly shady sources – and I do n’t hold it against them .
But in the context of a campaign in which Obama ’s every contact with a questionable individual was the subject of advertisements and smears by the McCain campaign , I found it astounding that this rather close contact with unsavory characters was mentioned in passing but not explored .

Josh Villa was not expected to recover A US patient left in a coma - like state after a road accident recovered the ability to speak after repeated exposure to a magnetic field .
Josh Villa had not been expected to recover from massive head injuries .
When " transcranial magnetic stimulation " was aimed at his brain , he could speak simple words , and respond to commands , New Scientist reports .
The Chicago - based scientists now plan further research to see if therapy works in other patients .
I believe that electromagnetic treatments such as deep brain stimulation , direct current transcranial stimulation , and TMS may all have therapeutic promise
Dr John Whyte
Moss Rehabilitation Research Institute
Philadelphia
It is hard for doctors to predict the extent to which brain - damaged patients will recover after falling into a coma , or a " persistent vegetative state " .
Josh Villa was 26 when he was thrown through the windscreen of his car , and , almost a year later , he was able to open his eyes , but was unresponsive to any kind of external stimulus .
Dr Theresa Pape , from the US Department of Veterans Affairs , enrolled him in a six - week study in which an electromagnetic coil was held over the front of his head .
The idea is to stimulate activity in brain cells , in this case , the cells of the " dorsolateral cortex " , a part of the brain which sends stimulating messages to other parts of the brain .
After approximately 15 sessions , he would turn his head and look at the person talking to him .
Then he started obeying simple commands , such as following the movement of a thumb and finger when asked , and could produce single words , such as " help " or " erm " .
After 30 sessions there was no further improvement , and he was sent home to be cared for by his mother .
She says that the treatment has made it far easier to look after him .
Dr Pape is now hoping to begin a similar treatment programme in a second patient in a coma - like state .
Natural recovery
However , another scientist warned that it is possible the magnetic stimulation was not entirely responsible .
Dr John
Whyte , from the Moss Rehabilitation Research Institute in Philadelphia , said that even eight months after a brain injury , spontaneous improvement of this type was " not uncommon " .
He added : " I believe that electromagnetic treatments such as deep brain stimulation , direct current transcranial stimulation , and TMS may all have therapeutic promise .
" However , proving their efficacy is very challenging because of the confounding and highly variable effects of natural recovery .
" So single cases provide very weak evidence except when treatment occurs very late ( so spontaneous recovery should be minimal ) and the patient is studied for a considerable interval both before and after the treatment . "
TMS has produced promising results when used to treat stroke patients , and those with spinal cord injuries .

In all of gold 's fancy footwork , copper 's been much ignored , but the metal may offer a hint that there 's hope for the global economy yet .
Copper futures reached a record intraday level of $ 4.27 on May 5 on the Comex division of the New York Mercantile Exchange .
Then , as the financial crisis deepened and concerns over the global economy worsened , copper prices lost half their value .
Of the base metals , " copper is the interesting one -- it stayed high longer than the other base metals , but seems to have cracked now , " said Brent Cook , independent exploration analyst .
" Copper has lost its PhD and is now running with the frat boys . "
Still , the metal might be a handy tool for forecasters trying to pry open their latest economic predictions .
“ ' Copper has lost its PhD and is now running with the frat boys . ' ” — Brent Cook , independent exploration analyst
" Copper is usually a good gauge of economic health because it is broadly used , but more specifically because it is important to construction and equipment manufacturing that tend to precede other areas of economic activity , and that makes copper a leading indicator , " said David Coffin , co-editor of HardRockAnalyst.com .
He believes that copper prices are " testing bottoms . "
Copper futures prices fell as low as $ 2.06 on Thursday .
Even if copper prices have reached a bottom , that " does not mean a quick recovery to that mystical $ 4 level right away , " said Coffin .
" The red metal took a steep dive after having held up fairly well due to the thin margin in its supply system , " he said .
" It had been one of the few metals to hold well above its cost of production through most of this debt drama aided , we think , by its relatively limited Chinese output where local and world prices for some other metals have diverged sharply this century . "
And " it is still the metal to watch for trend as the world finds out whether it is indeed time to replenish China 's stockpiles , " Coffin said .
Emerging support
Indeed , there was a time not long ago when metals demand from China took over the headlines .
Actually , that factor still holds true and will likely be copper 's support as volatile trading in the commodities sector continues , analysts said .
" The present copper price factors in a severe downturn worldwide , stemming from a slowdown in the U.S. , " said Lawrence Roulston , editor of Resource Opportunities .
" In reality , other parts of the world are still growing strongly and will continue to grow in spite of a slowdown in the U.S. economy . "
He points out that emerging economies , as a whole , are seeing growth , and " have a greater intensity of use of metals than the mature economies . "
China , the world 's most populous nation , is the world largest consumer of metals , and is expected to continue to grow at more than 10 % , Roulston said .
At the same time , growth there is driven largely by infrastructure development .
Look at it this way : the copper market has seen slowing import demand from China and translating that as a fall in demand , said Martin Hayes , an analyst at BaseMetals.com .
But that has been more likely due to " destocking ahead of the summer and because of the Olympic - induced industrial slowdown , " he said .
" As such , we feel this may have left the physical market in China short , and may lead to a pickup in imports that might support prices for a while during [ the fourth quarter of 2008 ] , " he said .
China could build up strategic reserves of copper , said William Adams , an analyst at BaseMetals.com .
" They have massive foreign reserves , they may well want to diversify some of their dollar reserves and they are resource hungry , " he said .
" They may well decide to buy copper now that it has fallen so much . "
Balancing act
Right now , the copper market is " in supply - demand balance , more or less , " said Coffin .
Looking ahead , however , some analysts expect to see continued weakness in demand and a surplus in copper supplies along with continued disruptions to mining -- and no one can tell which will be worse off .
" The base metals saw bubble demand that we knew would evaporate as the ' boom ' faltered , " said Ed Bugos , editor of Gold & Options Trader , published by Agora Financial .
" The demand was real enough , but it was fueled by money growth , which was not sustainable , but which fueled expectations that ultimately led to a worldwide overestimating of demand -- not just for copper , but oil ... etc . "
" It was irrational exuberance , " he said .
" Now you 're seeing the results . "
The slackening of western demand may help ease the strain caused by the mining service sector 's inability to " keep up with new demands on it -- and that goes from assay labs and drilling contractors for exploration projects to tires for production companies , " said Coffin .
Sean Brodrick , a natural - resources analyst at MoneyandMarkets.com , said the market could even end up with a small copper surplus in the next year and that could weigh on prices in 2009 .
Analysts at Natixis Commodities Markets expect to see a market surplus of 100,000 tonnes in 2008 and 200,000 tonnes in 2009 , according to a research note released this week .
But " getting the service side of mining up to the new peak demand for it is still years away , " said Coffin .
Labor strikes and other supply disruptions have helped copper production fall significantly short of projections for each of the past several years , said Roulston .
" The financial crisis has further deferred some expansion and mine development projects , and that will exacerbate the tight supply situation going into the medium and longer terms . "
Coffin said " mining had been in a long - term bear market until earlier in this decade , " and few people were willing to get the training to do the specialized work of the sector .
That , combined with the long time frames needed to bring new deposits into production , is " why we continue to view the mining sector as still being in a long - term bull market , " he said .
Investment alternative
So an alternative to trading the metal , especially in the face of near - term volatility , is " to look at the copper companies , both producers and developers , " said Roulston .
" The share prices across the board have been beaten down to levels that do n't come close to recognizing the cash flow from production and the long - term value of the metal deposits held by those companies , " he said .
As for stocks with " pop up " potential , Coffin singled out First Quantum Minerals ( FM ) ( FQM ) , which has mining operations in Africa , and Canada - based Sherwood Copper ( SWC ) .
Both companies have been producing the red metal for less than $ 1 per pound and both have had some relief from declines in the oil price and in the currencies -- the Canadian dollar and the Mexican peso , he said .
He also said that mining company Teck Cominco ( TCKB ) has been " pushed well below its real earnings potential and rounds out the larger players we deal with . "
Coffin owns shares in Sherwood and Teck and said he may buy back some shares of First Quantum .
" These are fundamentally sound companies that will recover along with the perceptions about the markets for their products , since they were simply oversold during a panic , " he said .
This is in an official Republican Party flier :
The October newsletter by the Chaffey Community Republican Women , Federated says if Obama is elected his image will appear on food stamps -- instead of dollar bills like other presidents .
The statement is followed by an illustration of " Obama Bucks " -- a phony $ 10 bill featuring Obama 's face on a donkey 's body , labeled " United States Food Stamps . "

Consumer electronics retailer Newegg announced Friday that it would no longer comply with a New York state law requiring the collection of online sales tax .
Consumer electronics retailer Newegg announced Friday that it would no longer comply with a New York state law requiring the collection of online sales tax .
" After careful review and consideration , we are pleased to inform you that we have stopped collecting New York sales tax , effective August 21 , 2008 , " Newegg spokesman Bernard Luthi wrote in a Friday e-mail to customers .
" This decision was driven by your direct and candid feedback and our continued commitment to you as our valued customers . "
New York lawmakers approved a budget package in April that includes a bill requiring online stores like Amazon.com and Newegg to collect sales tax .
The state , which has been struggling to with budget issues , stands to take in up to $ 50 million in unpaid taxes .
Consumers who purchase items online are largely exempt from state taxes they might incur with in - store purchases .
Technically , customers are supposed to report online purchases and pay taxes on them , but most people fail to do that .
Newegg complied with the law when it went into effect on June 1 .
" While Newegg no longer charges sales tax to its New York customers you may still have an obligation to pay New York State use tax on your purchases , " Luthi warned .
In May , Amazon sued the New York State Department of Taxation and Finance ( DTF ) , claiming the bill is unconstitutional .
Though Amazon 's headquarters are in Seattle , New York officials argued that the company 's affiliate program gives it a presence in New York .
The program allows customers with Web sites to put an Amazon icon on their sites that advertise a particular product .
If someone clicks through and makes a purchase , the webmaster gets a small cut .
Amazon said in its suit that affiliates " do not solicit or consummate sales on behalf of Amazon and are not authorized to act as Amazon 's agents . "
They operate independently from Amazon , and should not be considered a brick and mortar extension of the site .
The case is still ongoing .

Energy independence seems to be each country ’s topmost agenda in today ’s challenging economic climate .
While many companies are looking to take advantage of the new tax credits extended to renewable energy industries , others are looking to solve the problem by finding ways to convert emissions into high value , sustainable technology .
Carbon Sciences is developing a breakthrough technology to transform carbon dioxide ( CO2 ) emissions into useful carbonate products that can be used by the paper , pharmaceuticals and FMCG industries .
Carbon Sciences has recently developed CO2 - to - Carbonate technology , an industrial platform for transforming CO2 emissions into high value carbonate products such as precipitated calcium carbonate ( PCC ) , a carbon captured product that replaces wood and clay in the paper industry .
Carbon Sciences ’ clean technology process combines CO2 with industrial waste minerals and transforms them into PCC .
The multi-billion dollar global market for PCC is projected to grow to 10 million tons by 2010 .
Carbon Sciences attributes this growth to increased worldwide paper consumption and construction .
The company has been in discussion with various paper manufacturers to test the use of PCC .
An in - house plant will test and optimize the development of this highly valued carbonate product
Says Derek McLeish , CEO of the company , “ It will be a while until the reality of carbon offsets kicks in .
So instead of waiting until then , we wanted to look at the demand side to see how we could provide high valued product that efficiently use CO2 emissions to feed industry . ”
The paper industry is a major consumer of energy .
Carbon Sciences ’ primary focus right now is to help the paper industry go carbon neutral .
According to McLeish , other product that could also benefit from the use of PCC include toothpaste , yogurt , and gypsum .
McLeish has a first hand knowledge of FMCG products have previously managed factories for companies like Gillette and Proctor & Gamble .
He set up Carbon Sciences in April 2007 because wanted to focus his time on developing a technology that would positively impact his grandchildren .

RELEASE : 08-223
" Naked - Eye " Gamma - Ray Burst Was Aimed Squarely At Earth
WASHINGTON -- Data from satellites and observatories around the globe show a jet from a powerful stellar explosion witnessed March 19 was aimed almost directly at Earth .
NASA 's Swift satellite detected the explosion - formally named GRB 080319B - at 2:13 a.m. EDT that morning and pinpointed its position in the constellation Bootes .
The event , called a gamma-ray burst , became bright enough for human eyes to see .
Observations of the event are giving astronomers the most detailed portrait of a burst ever recorded .
" Swift was designed to find unusual bursts , " said Swift principal investigator Neil Gehrels at NASA 's Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt , Md. " We really hit the jackpot with this one .
"
In a paper to appear in Thursday 's issue of Nature , Judith Racusin of Penn State University and a team of 92 coauthors report on observations across the spectrum that began 30 minutes before the explosion and followed its afterglow for months .
The team concludes the burst 's extraordinary brightness arose from a jet that shot material directly toward Earth at 99.99995 percent the speed of light .
At the same moment Swift saw the burst , the Russian KONUS instrument on NASA 's Wind satellite also sensed the gamma rays and provided a wide view of their spectral structure .
A robotic wide - field optical camera called " Pi of the Sky " in Chile simultaneously captured the burst 's first visible light .
The system is operated by institutions from Poland .
Within the next 15 seconds , the burst brightened enough to be visible in a dark sky to human eyes .
It briefly crested at a magnitude of 5.3 on the astronomical brightness scale .
Incredibly , the dying star was 7.5 billion light - years away .
Telescopes around the world already were studying the afterglow of another burst when GRB 080319B exploded just 10 degrees away .
TORTORA , a robotic wide - field optical camera operated in Chile with Russian - Italian collaboration , also caught the early light .
TORTORA 's rapid imaging provided the most detailed look yet at visible light associated with a burst 's initial gamma-ray blast .
Immediately after the blast , Swift 's UltraViolet and Optical Telescope and X - Ray Telescope indicated they were effectively blinded .
Racusin initially thought something was wrong .
Within minutes , however , as reports from other observers arrived , it was clear this was a special event .
Gamma-ray bursts are the universe 's most luminous explosions .
Most occur when massive stars run out of nuclear fuel .
As a star 's core collapses , it creates a black hole or neutron star that , through processes not fully understood , drive powerful gas jets outward .
These jets punch through the collapsing star .
As the jets shoot into space , they strike gas previously shed by the star and heat it .
That generates bright afterglows .
The team believes the jet directed toward Earth contained an ultra - fast component just 0.4 of a degree across .
This core resided within a slightly less energetic jet about 20 times wider .
"
It 's this wide jet that Swift usually sees from other bursts , " Racusin explained .
" Maybe every gamma - ray burst contains a narrow jet , too , but astronomers miss them because we do n't see them head - on .
" Such an alignment occurs by chance only about once a decade , so a GRB 080319B is a rare catch .
Swift is managed by Goddard .
It was built and is being operated in collaboration with Penn State , the Los Alamos National Laboratory , and General Dynamics in the U.S. ; the University of Leicester and Mullard Space Sciences Laboratory in the United Kingdom ; Brera Observatory and the Italian Space Agency in Italy ; plus additional partners in Germany and Japan .

The Smithsonian Channel has begun offering video content on Apple 's iTunes Store , as pointed out by the Associated Press .
Currently , the time frame for the launch is unknown , but according to the article , the shows will go for the usual price of $ 1.99 .
The channel currently carries carries offerings on History , Natural Wonders , America 's Stories , and Smithsonian Kids .
As of June of this year , Apple offers over 20,000 TV programs from almost 80 networks including HBO , CNN , Comedy Central , Cartoon Network , ESPN , and countless others .
Thus far , Apple has helped sell over 125 million episodes since the inception of television show sales in October of 2005 .
The Smithsonian looks to be capitalizing on the momentum of the iTunes Store by adding its own content to the mix , and while it 's no NBC ( * cough * ) , it 's always nice to have additional shows to choose from .
Remember those 1100 + e-mails that Slick Sally Palin is trying to hide from investigators ?
Turns out she 's cribbed more off the Bush / Cheney / Rove axis than we previously knew .
Not only is she claiming executive privilege for e-mails she copied to her husband Todd ( whose personal vendettas she was often carrying out on the state dime ) , but those messages supposedly about official state business were being sent on her personal Yahoo !
account , and the intent to evade official record keeping could n't be more clear :
Palin also routinely does government business from a Yahoo address , gov.sarah@yahoo.com , rather than from her secure official state e-mail address , according to documents already made public .
" Whoops ! " Palin aide Frank Bailey wrote , after addressing an e-mail to the governor 's official state address .
" Frank ,
This is not the Governor 's personal account , " a secretary reminded him .
" Whoops ! "
Well , what do you know ?
The use of outside e-mail address to conduct supposedly official business ?
Business they claimed was official , but knew in their hearts was dirty , backstabbing , deeply personal , and illegal at its core .
No one could have foreseen this .
Can America afford to install Slick Sally in the House that Cheney Built ?
Consider that Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington ( CREW ) has sue just to ensure that Cheney does n't use his b.s. " Fourth Branch " theory to claim he 's exempt from the Presidential Records Act .
Can you imagine electing this total cipher to national office , only to find out she uses the position to go even deeper into hiding ?
DIGG THIS
Great Britain has a Labour government at present .
The Chancellor of the Exchequer is Alistair Darling .
He is responsible for economic and financial affairs of the government .
Labour is " left . "
We expect Keynesianism from the left .
So it is no surprise that Darling has just proposed that Great Britain spend its way out of its recession .
He wants the government to spend on housing , energy , small businesses , schools and hospitals .
He will increase borrowing to finance the spending .
I do n’t know about you , but I for one am simply tired of hearing the same old tired and worn out nostrums that do not work .
I felt exactly the same when Bush provided a one - time $ 160 billion tax cut financed by borrowing and upon hearing recently that the Congress was getting ready another " stimulus " package .
I am surprised that these counter - productive measures have any political mileage left in them at all .
I have the impression , which is purely intuitive , that this generation of politicians believes even less in these measures than any of their predecessors .
They act like zombies who are going through the motions .
Among the public , if there is any support at all , it shows up in tiresome columns written by partisans who ca n’t find anything else original to say .
Keynes is dead .
Keynesianism is dead .
And yet it lives on like some kind of engine that wo n’t stop clacking even after the key is removed from the ignition .
President Nixon told us " We are all Keynesians now . "
By " we " I guess he meant we politicians , because he could not have meant Austrian economists .
Nixon spoke truth on that one , with that qualification .
This is proven by every Republican administration and especially by the current Bush administration .
This is proven by the response of George Osborne , who is the " shadow " chancellor from the Conservative side that is out of power .
The Conservatives are " right . "
Osborne threw a tidbit of a supply - side policy , which was that small businesses be allowed to postpone paying their value - added tax bills for six months .
But this is Keynesian deficit spending too .
If the government does not cut spending , it has to borrow the funds .
Sounds awfully like Darling , who at least had the courage to say that the government would borrow .
Osborne should have proposed getting rid of the taxes altogether , or lowering their rate , and cutting government spending by the same amount or more .
This Austrian remedy would spur the private sector and actually work !
All the politicians and columnists can now have a public discussion of what to spend the government ’s taxes and borrowings on .
No one will question the wisdom of spending more and borrowing more , a policy that cannot possibly end a recession and can only lower social welfare by streaming society ’s scarce resources to the lowest return projects that anyone can devise .
They ought to invite the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers in .
They are experts at this .
I have seen them build million - dollar jetties into the Atlantic and dredge sandbars in a small inlet to produce a harbor for a few pleasure boats .
The jetties proceeded to alter the currents so as to destroy a pristine neighboring sandy beach which is now covered with rocks .
The harbor silts up and has to be dredged every so often .
This is a constant drain on the town ’s resources .
Lord Jones , who seems a politician whose affiliation is cloudy or in the middle , applauded Osborne ’s plan and then reverted to undisguised Keynesianism .
He suggested that Darling should invest in " infrastructure projects which facilitate the productivity of the country … airports , railways , and roads . "
He left out harbors , canals , and river passages .
Yvette Cooper who works in the Treasury assured everyone that the Government would keep spending although its tax revenues were declining .
She referred to this spending as " investment . "
Government has stolen the language of business and now pretends to be some sort of business .
If this is investment , I ’d like to sell my stock , please .
Do I have a stock certificate in government ?
The attendant borrowing went unmentioned , although this diversion of resources undermines private investment .
The representative of a lobby group for London called London First , one Lady Valentine , plugged for the 2012 Olympics and Crossrail .
Her stunning logic : " When we were in boom time they were absolutely vital for expansion .
And actually now that things have turned down they remain even more vital , if anything , for building our way out of the situation we are now in . "
Go float a couple of bond issues yourself , Lady Valentine .
Send me a prospectus so I can look at the prospective risks and cash flows .
Fruit attracts fruit flies but at least we do not have to listen to their flimflam .
The public trough is a source of hokum , hypocrisy , and hype .
Government stimulates sophism and snow jobs .
Imagine that in a recession the government were to deregulate the economy and cut its own spending in half while cutting taxes by the same amount .
It is completely obvious that the economy would before long embark on a boom with a solid foundation .
Is n’t this part of the story behind the booms in Russia and China when the Communists disappeared or altered their policies ?
Do n’t politicians the world over know this ?
Of course they do .
They are pulling the wool over the public ’s eyes by insisting that they do not cause recessions and that the best remedy for recession is even more government spending .
We ’d all be far better off dissolving the government , and if that is too radical , then limit them to marching in parades , unveiling monuments , and greeting foreign dignitaries .
The Best of Michael S. Rozeff
VANCOUVER , B.C. – The U.S. financial crisis has cut so deep – and the government has taken on so much debt in misguided attempts to bail out such companies as Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac – that even larger financial shocks are still to come , global investing guru Jim Rogers said in an exclusive interview with Money Morning .
Indeed , the U.S. financial debacle is now so ingrained – and a so - called " Super Crash " so likely – that most Americans alive today wo n't be around by the time the last of this credit - market mess is finally cleared away – if it ever is , Rogers said .
The end of this crisis " is a long way away , " Rogers said .
" In fact , it may not be in our lifetimes . "
During a 40 - minute interview during a wealth - management conference in this West Coast Canadian city last month , Rogers also said :
Why U.S. Federal Reserve Chairman Ben S. Bernanke should " resign " .
How the U.S. national debt – the roughly $ 5 trillion held by the public – essentially doubled in the course of a single weekend .
That U.S. consumers and investors can expect much - higher interest rates – noting that if the Fed does n't raise borrowing costs , market forces will make that happen .
Which stocks he 's holding onto for the rest of the year
Rogers first made a name for himself with The Quantum Fund , a hedge fund that 's often described as the first real global investment fund , which he and partner George Soros founded in 1970 .
Over the next decade , Quantum gained 4,200 % , while the Standard & Poor 's 500 Index climbed about 50 % .
It was after Rogers " retired " in 1980 that the investing masses got to see him in action .
Among his historic market calls , Rogers predicted China 's meteoric growth a good decade before it became apparent and he subsequently foretold of the powerful updraft in global commodities prices that 's fueled a year - long bull market in the agriculture , energy and mining sectors .
[ Editor 's note : Rogers recently released a new book , " A Bull in China , " a page - turner that reveals what China stocks to buy … when to buy .
To learn how you can get " A Bull in China " for free , please click here . ]
Rogers ' candor has made him a popular figure with individual investors , meaning his pronouncements are always closely watched .
Here are some of the highlights from the exclusive interview we had with the author and investor , who now makes his home in Singapore :
Keith Fitz - Gerald ( Q ) : Looks like the financial train wreck we talked about earlier this year is happening .
Jim Rogers : There was a train wreck , yes .
Two or three – more than one , as you know .
[ U.S. Federal Reserve Chairman Ben S. ]
Bernanke and his boys both came to the rescue .
Which is going to cover things up for a while .
And then I do n't know how long the rally will last and then we 'll be off to the races again .
Whether the rally lasts six days or six weeks , I do n't know .
I wish I did know that sort of thing , but I never do .
( Q) : What would Chairman Bernanke have to do to " get it right ? "
Rogers : Resign .
(Q ) : Is there anything else that you think he could do that would be correct other than let these things fail ?
Rogers : Well , at this stage , it does n't seem like he can do it .
He could raise interest rates – which he should do , anyway .
Somebody should .
The market 's going to do it whether he does it or not , eventually .
The problem is that he 's got all that garbage on his balance sheet now .
He has $ 400 billion of questionable assets owing to the feds on his balance sheet .
I mean , he could try to reverse that .
He could raise interest rates .
Yeah , that 's what he could do .
That would help .
It would cause a shock to the system , but if we do n't have the shock now , the shock 's going to be much worse later on .
Every shock , so far , has been worse than the last shock .
Bear - Stearns [ now part of JP Morgan Chase & Co. ( JPM ) ] was one thing and then it 's Fannie Mae ( FNM ) , you know , and now Freddie Mac ( FRE ) .
The next shock 's going to be even bigger still .
So the shocks keep getting bigger because we kept propping things up and this has been going on at least since Long - Term Capital Management .
They 've been bailing everyone out and [ former Fed Chairman Alan ]
Greenspan took interest rates down and then he took them down again after the " dot - com bubble " shock , so I guess Bernanke could try to start reversing some of this stuff .
But he has to not just reverse it – he'd have to increase interest rates a lot to make up for it and that 's not going to solve the problem either , because the basic problems are that America 's got a horrible tax system , it 's got litigation right , left , and center , it 's got horrible education system , you know , and it 's got many , many , many [ other ] problems that are going to take a while to resolve .
If he did at least turn things around – turn some of these policies around – we would have a sharp drop , but at least it would clean out some of the excesses and the system could turn around and start doing better .
But this is academic – he 's not going to do it .
But again the best thing for him would be to abolish the Federal Reserve and resign .
That 'll be the best solution .
Is he going to do that ?
No , of course not .
He still thinks he knows what he 's doing .
( Q ) : Earlier this year , when we talked in Singapore , you made the observation that the average American still does n't know anything 's wrong – that anything 's happening .
Is that still the case ?
Rogers : Yes .
( Q) : What would you tell the " Average Joe " in no -nonsense terms ?
Rogers : I would say that for the last 200 years , America 's elected politicians and scoundrels have built up $ 5 trillion in debt .
In the last few weekends , some un-elected officials added another $ 5 trillion to America 's national debt .
Suddenly we 're on the hook for another $ 5 trillion .
There have been attempts to explain this to the public , about what 's happening with the debt , and with the fact that America 's situation is deteriorating in the world .
I do n't know why it does n't sink in .
People have other things on their minds , or do n't want to be bothered .
Too complicated , or whatever .
I 'm sure when the [ British Empire ] declined there were many people who rang the bell and said : " Guys , we 're making too many mistakes here in the U.K . "
And nobody listened until it was too late .
When Spain was in decline , when Rome was in decline , I 'm sure there were people who noticed that things were going wrong .
( Q ) : Many experts do n't agree with – at the very least do n't understand – the Fed 's current strategies .
How can our leaders think they 're making the right choices ?
What do you think ?
Rogers : Bernanke is a very - narrow - gauged guy .
He 's spent his whole intellectual career studying the printing of money and we have now given him the keys to the printing presses .
All he knows how to do is run them .
Bernanke was [ on the record as saying ] that there is no problem with housing in America .
There 's no problem in housing finance .
I mean this was like in 2006 or 2005 .
( Q ) : Right .
Rogers :
He is the Federal Reserve and the Federal Reserve more than anybody is supposed to be regulating these [ financial institutions ] , so they should have the inside scoop , if nothing else .
( Q) : That 's problematic .
Rogers :
It 's mind - boggling .
Here 's a man who does n't understand the market , who does n't understand economics – basic economics .
His intellectual career 's been spent on the narrow - gauge study of printing money .
That 's all he knows .
Yes , he 's got a PhD , which says economics on it , but economics can be one of 200 different narrow fields .
And his is printing money , which he 's good at , we know .
We 've learned that he 's ready , willing and able to step in and bail out everybody .
There 's this worry [ whenever you have a major financial institution that looks ready to fail ] that , " Oh my God , we 're going to go down , and if we go down , the whole system goes down . "
This is nothing new .
Whole systems have been taken down before .
We 've had it happen plenty of times .
( Q ) : History is littered with failed financial institutions .
Rogers : I know .
It 's not as though this is the first time it 's ever happened .
But since [ Chairman Bernanke 's ] whole career is about printing money and studying the Depression , he says : " Okay , got to print some more money .
Got to save the day . "
And , of course , that 's when he gets himself in deeper , because the first time you print it , you prop up Institution X , [ but ] then you got to worry about institution Y and Z .
( Q) : And now we 've got a dangerous precedent .
Rogers : That 's exactly right .
And when the next guy calls him up , he 's going to bail him out , too .
( Q) : What do you think [ former Fed Chairman ]
Paul Volcker thinks about all this ?
Rogers : Well , Volcker has said it 's certainly beyond the scope of central banking , as he understands central banking .
( Q) : That 's pretty darn clear .
Rogers : Volcker 's been very clear – very clear to me , anyway – about what he thinks of it , and Volcker was the last decent American central banker .
We 've had couple in our history : Volcker and William McChesney Martin were two .
You know , McChesney Martin was the guy who said the job of a good central banker was to take away the punchbowl when the party starts getting good .
Now [ the Fed ] – when the party starts getting out of control – pours more moonshine in .
McChesney Martin would always pull the bowl away when people started getting a little giggly .
Now the party 's out of control .
( Q) : This could be the end of the Federal Reserve , which we talked about in Singapore .
This would be the third failure – correct ?
Rogers : Yes .
We had two central banks that disappeared for whatever reason .
This one 's going to disappear , too , I say .
( Q ) : Throughout your career you 've had a much - fabled ability to spot unique points in history – inflection points , if you will .
Points when , as you put it , somebody puts money in the corner at which you then simply pick up .
Rogers : That 's the way to invest , as far as I 'm concerned .
(Q) : So conceivably , history would show that the highest returns go to those who invest when there 's blood in the streets , even if it 's their own .
Rogers : Right .
(Q) : Is there a point in time or something you 're looking for that will signal that the U.S. economy has reached the inflection point in this crisis ?
Rogers : Well , yeah , but it 's a long way away .
In fact , it may not be in our lifetimes .
Of course I covered my shorts – my financial shorts .
Not all of them , but most of them last week .
So , if you 're talking about a temporary inflection point , we may have hit it .
If you look back at previous countries that have declined , you almost always see exchange controls – all sorts of controls – before failure .
America is already doing some of that .
America , for example , would n't let the Chinese buy the oil company , would n't let the [ Dubai firm ] buy the ports , et cetera .
But I 'm really talking about full - fledged , all - out exchange controls .
That would certainly be a sign , but usually exchange controls are not the end of the story .
Historically , they 're somewhere during the decline .
Then the politicians bring in exchange controls and then things get worse from there before they bottom .
Before World War II , Japan 's yen was two to the dollar .
After they lost the war , the yen was 500 to the dollar .
That 's a collapse .
That was also a bottom .
These are not predictions for the U.S. , but I 'm just saying that things have to usually get pretty , pretty , pretty , pretty bad .
It was similar in the United Kingdom .
In 1918 , the U.K. was the richest , most powerful country in the world .
It had just won the First World War , et cetera .
By 1939 , it had exchange controls and this is in just one generation .
And strict exchange controls .
They in fact made it an act of treason for people to use anything except the pound sterling in settling debts .
( Q ) : Treason ?
Wow , I did n't know that .
Rogers : Yes …an act of treason .
It used to be that people could use anything they wanted as money .
Gold or other metals .
Banks would issue their own currencies .
Anything .
You could even use other people 's currencies .
Things were so bad in the U.K. in the 1930s they made it an act of treason to use anything except sterling and then by ' 39 they had full - exchange controls .
And then , of course , they had the war and that disaster .
It was a disaster before the war .
The war just exacerbated the problems .
And by the mid-70s , the U.K. was bankrupt .
They could not sell long - term government bonds .
Remember , this is a country that two generations or three generations before had been the richest most powerful country in the world .
Now the only thing that saved the U.K. was the North Sea oil fields , even though Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher likes to take credit , but Margaret Thatcher has good PR .
Margaret Thatcher came into office in 1979 and North Sea oil started flowing .
And the U.K. suddenly had a huge balance - of - payment surplus .
You know , even if Mother Teresa had come in [ as prime minister ] in ' 79 , or Joseph Stalin , or whomever had come in 1979 – you know , Jimmy Carter , George Bush , whomever – it still would 've been great .
You give me the largest oil field in the world and I 'll show you a good time , too .
That 's what happened .
( Q) : What if Thatcher had never come to power ?
Rogers : Who knows , because the U.K. was in such disastrous straits when she came in .
And that 's why she came to power … because it was such a disaster .
I 'm sure she would 've made things better , but short of all that oil , the situation would 've continued to decline .
So it may not be in our lifetimes that we 'll see the bottom , just given the U.K.'s history , for instance .
( Q) : That 's going to be terrifying for individual investors to think about .
Rogers : Yeah .
But remember that America had such a magnificent and gigantic position of dominance that deterioration will take time .
You know , you do n't just change that in a decade or two .
It takes a lot of hard work by a lot of incompetent people to change the situation .
The U.K. situation I just explained … that decline was over 40 or 50 years , but they had so much money they could have continued to spiral downward for a long time .
Even Zimbabwe , you know , took 10 or 15 years to really get going into it 's collapse , but Robert Mugabe came into power in 1980 and , as recently as 1995 , things still looked good for Zimbabwe .
But now , of course , it 's a major disaster .
That 's one of the advantages of Singapore .
The place has an astonishing amount of wealth and only 4 million people .
So even if it started squandering it in 2008 , which they may be , it 's going to take them forever to do so .
(Q) : Is there a specific signal that this is " over ? "
Rogers : Sure … when our entire U.S. cabinet has Swiss bank accounts .
Linked inside bank accounts .
When that happens , we 'll know we 're getting close because they 'll do it even after it 's illegal – after America 's put in the exchange controls .
(Q ) : They 'll move their own money .
Rogers : Yeah , because you look at people like the Israelis and the Argentineans and people who have had exchange controls – the politicians usually figured it out and have taken care of themselves on the side .
( Q) : We saw that in South Africa and other countries , for example , as people tried to get their money out .
Rogers : Everybody figures it out , eventually , including the politicians .
They say : " You know , others can't do this , but it 's alright for us . "
Those days will come .
I guess when all the congressmen have foreign bank accounts , we 'll be at the bottom .
But we 've got a long way to go , yet .
(Q ) : There 's a lot of talk that the Chinese will use the Olympics to launch a new wave of nationalism and to move ahead .
Are the Olympic Games as relevant as some people think ?
Rogers : They 've already got tremendous nationalism .
But the international reactions about Tibet and the Olympic torchbearers re-awakened it .
And the politicians , of course , need it because they 've got their own problems with inflation and overheating and [ pollution and ] the rest of it .
So , like politicians throughout history , they fan it – do their best to say :
Hell , it 's not our problem .
It 's the evil farmers .
It 's the French .
See that store over there :
It 's their fault .
It 's the Americans . "
So that is happening , anyway .
As far as the Olympics themselves , they 're irrelevant .
America had the Olympics in ‘ 96 and it had no effect on the American economy – before or after .
Some people in Atlanta were affected before and after .
And some people who were involved with the Olympics were affected before and after .
America at that time had 270 million people .
China 's got five times as many people , and it's a much bigger country geographically .
Sydney , Australia had the 2000 Olympics .
It had virtually no effect on the Sydney , or on the Australian economy – even though Australia had 18 million people .
It 's tiny … nothing .
Yes , it had an effect on some people .
Greece , in 2004 , had the Olympics .
You have n't heard stories of a major collapse or a major revival of Greece in 2005 , because the fact is that the Games did n't have much of an effect – not a noticeable effect , anyway .
It had spot effects only , so I ignore the Olympics as far as the Chinese economy – and its stock market – is concerned .
(Q ) : Are you still bullish on China ?
Rogers :
Oh , yeah .
I never sold anything in China .
In fact , I bought more .
I bought Chinese Airlines ( CHAWF ) last week .
I flew one coming here .
Maybe I made a mistake [ with the investment ] , because it was emptier than I thought it would be .
(Q ) : Any thoughts why ?
Rogers :
One thing , you know , is that China 's made it extremely difficult to get a visa right now .
In the past , it 's been hard to get a seat because Chinese airlines were so full .
On this flight there were empty seats .
That brought home to me that they are cutting back enormously on visas right now .
Discouraging travel , trying to clean the air , trying to protect against somebody blowing up the Forbidden City , et cetera .
So the fact that planes are empty right now may be smarter than I thought .
Maybe I did get the bottom on the airlines , because if they are going to reissue the visas again , after all this , after September [ after the Olympic Games have concluded ] , then the planes are going to fill up pretty quickly again .
I would have picked the stock up at a bottom .
( Q ) : Yes .
Rogers : Anyway , I 'm still around China .
I have never sold any of my Chinese companies .
You know , selling China in 2008 is like selling America in 1908 .
Sure , let 's say the market goes down another 40 % – so what !
You look back over 100 years , you look back from the beauty of 1928 , or even 1938 [ in the depths of the Great Depression ] , and there is somebody who bought shares in 1908 .
He was still a lot better off having not sold in 1908 .
[ Editor 's note : The Olympics were only a small window into China 's economic potential .
In fact , the Red Dragon is on the verge of handing investors the biggest profit opportunity in its 30 - year growth explosion – one that 's about to make the commodity boom look like an ant hill .

PORT WASHINGTON , N.Y. ( MarketWatch ) --
Before it gets a chance to embrace another round of irrational exuberance , the U.S. financial system will undergo a complete makeover .
Besides the cost to U.S. taxpayers , banks will find that the cost of the moral hazard provided by the past week 's massive government bailout will be more and tighter regulations .
This will occur regardless of who is elected president or which party controls the Congress .
Coming down the pike is nothing less than a modification of our capitalist system .
You remember capitalism ; it says that you are free to enter -- and free to exit -- any business you may want to .
It also says that with reward comes risk .
It will first be noticed on Wall Street .
Now that the chasm between commercial and investment banking is all but closed , look for much more of the Street to be subject to tighter controls .
Commercial banks have a conservative business model and are closely regulated , in order to safeguard people 's deposits .
When I entered this business back in the prehistoric 1970s , commercial bankers followed the 3 - 6 - 3 rule : they paid 3 % for deposits , lent them out at 6 % and were on the golf course by 3 in the afternoon .
Banks were boring , but they were safe .
You did n't have to worry about your money because they made loans only to those who were creditworthy and kept them on their books , so that if a loan did go sour , it would have a direct effect on the bank that made it .
This was an outgrowth of the freewheeling 1920s and the crash of 1929 .
It led to the Glass - Steagall Act , which separated commercial from investment banking .
Investment banks were only loosely supervised by the Securities and Exchange Commission .
They could , and did , take big risks .
They magnified their profits -- and their losses --- by borrowing lots of money from the financial markets .
Some made big bucks , while others lost money and had to fold their tents .
Now that the financial markets are wary of lending to these folks , they will need the deep pockets of commercial banks , thus subjecting them to the regulations I referred to above .
Besides the existing regulations , look for a slew of new rules to hit the Street , starting with more transparent accounting .
The regulators will want to see how much leverage these firms employ and their sources of funding , to name two items at the top of their list .
Off - balance - sheet activities will come under the regulators ' magnifying glasses as well .
Bank regulators may also seek to limit the use of such exotic instruments as credit default swaps , collateralized debt obligations , structured investment vehicles , mortgage - backed securities and other products dreamed up by the Street 's financial engineers .
And speaking of mortgage - backed securities , do n't be surprised if the government puts limits on how many mortgages a bank can sell .
Forcing the banks to keep more of their mortgage loans on their books is a great way to ensure that they lend more carefully , going forward .
Do n't be surprised if investment banks return to being agents ( executing trades ) , as opposed to owners .
This , of course , will require less capital .
Most commercial banks will have little trouble funding themselves .
But the rewards will come down from the stratosphere .
The " Masters of the Universe " will have to be content with two cars , one home and no private jet .
Do n't blame me for this .
I do n't make the rules , I just play the game .
INTEGRAL detects signature of critical cosmic accelerator
29 August 2008
The observation of high - energy particles and photons confronts scientists with the obvious but difficult question of where and how charged particles can be accelerated up to the energies required for them to radiate in the high - energy regime .
Environments where particles can be accelerated are also environments where particles can easily radiate their energy away , and models must account for a system where the potentially large amount of energy available through shocks , gravitation , or rotation can be transferred to charged particles in an efficient and orderly fashion .
The observation of TeV gamma-rays from the Crab nebula is the almost prototypical example of this class of problem .
These gamma-rays are thought to originate by inverse Compton scattering of high - energy ( up to a few 1015 eV ) electrons with ambient synchrotron photons ( observed in great detail at radio frequencies ) .
But do these high energy electrons actually exist in the nebula ?
Low energy electrons clearly do , as demonstrated by the detection of polarized radiation from the radio to the few hundred of keV energy range .
By analyzing about 600 observations of the Crab nebula and pulsar taken with the SPI instrument on INTEGRAL during the three years up to April 2006 , Dean and colleagues were able to show that the emission in the 0.1 to 1 MeV energy range is linearly polarized to a high degree ( about 50 % ) .
The angle of polarization coincides with the pulsar 's rotation axis .
Although INTEGRAL cannot pinpoint where the photons are produced , the orientation of the polarization can be directly correlated with the orientation of the magnetic field where the photons are radiated .
With this information , and by leveraging information from observations at other energies , Dean at al. were able to estimate that the radiating electrons must have an energy of the order of 1015 eV .
This observation , which can be seen as almost a direct measurement of the energy of the electrons involved , indicates that the Crab pulsar , and similar objects , can accelerate electrons to the energies required to explain a wide range of astronomical observations .
With the detection of polarized emission from the Crab pulsar another piece of the cosmic accelerators puzzle has been revealed .

Swiss daredevil Yves Rossy becomes first person to cross English Channel using jet - propelled wing strapped to his back
Swiss daredevil Yves Rossy today became the first person to cross the English Channel using only a jet - propelled wing trapped to his back .
After two previous attempts were postponed because of bad weather everything went to plan for Rossy 's 9 minutes and 32 second flight .
He was helped on his way by a tailwind that cut his flight time by around two and a half minutes compared with his calculations before the attempt .
As he crossed the White Cliffs of Dover just after 1.05 pm
Rossy even had enough fuel left in the four kerosene - burning turbines powering his self - designed , homemade device for some celebratory aerobatics to entertain the crowds gathered below .
He then deployed his parachute and drifted gently downwards , waving his legs excitedly .
Rossy 's ungainly face - in - the - dirt landing contrasted with the elegance of his high - altitude flight through the crystal blue autumn sky .
The self - styled FusionMan declared that he felt " great , really great " shortly after touching down from the historic flight .
He said he dedicated the achievement to his support team who had made it all possible .
" Because I am the only one who did cross under this wing , but so many people crossed with me I want to say ' thank you ' , " he said .
The 49 - year - old former fighter pilot who now flies for Swiss International airlines , was taken to a height of 2,500 metres by a Pilatus support plane which , once he jumped out , guided him on his route .
There was also a search and rescue helicopter on hand in case he landed in the sea , and another helicopter to film him in the air .
Another plane flew above him to relay the pictures .
Rossy said he wanted others to have the same experience .
" Next is to continue this project .
I am so happy , " he said when he reached the ground .
" With that crossing I showed it is possible to fly a little bit like a bird .
I am full of hope there will be many in the near future . "
The FBI ’s investigation of the deadly 2001 anthrax attacks was the most complex and important in the bureau ’s history .
Immense resources were invested in the search for the perpetrator , whose actions killed five people , sickened 17 others , sowed panic in the immediate aftermath of 9/11 and caused taxpayers to spend extraordinary sums on a crash program to protect the nation against the danger of biological terrorism .
Yet for all that , the “ Amerithrax ” investigation , as the FBI dubbed the case , dragged on for seven years and , until quite recently , got nowhere .
If Bruce E. Ivins , the Ft. Detrick , Md. , microbiologist who died in an apparent suicide last week , was indeed the perpetrator , the prime suspect was directly under the FBI ’s nose for years , practically sporting a scarlet “ A ” on his forehead .
If he was not the perpetrator , as many of his fellow scientists at Ft. Detrick are insisting , we ’re back at square one .
The investigation is sure to be scrutinized in depth by Congress , but its difficulties cannot be understood without a sense of the institutional context in which it began .
The anthrax attacks came before the bureau at a moment when it was still quivering from a string of breathtaking debacles .
On its website , the FBI celebrates its “ top 10 moments . ”
These are not among them .
First , in September 2000 , came the culmination of the Wen Ho Lee espionage case .
All the charges against the Taiwan - born scientist , who had been accused of stealing the crown jewels of American nuclear secrets and passing them to China , were dropped that month , except one minor charge .
An official Justice Department postmortem of the FBI ’s investigation called it “ deeply and fundamentally flawed ” in “ virtually every material respect . ”
It “ suffered from neglect , faulty judgment , bad personnel choices , inept investigation and the inadequate supervision of that inept investigation , ” among other things .

That grave embarrassment was followed only months later by the stunning revelation , in February 2001 , that Robert P. Hanssen , the FBI agent in charge of Soviet / Russian counterintelligence , was a Russian mole .
As far back as 1990 , Hanssen ’s brother - in - law , himself an FBI agent , had informed his superiors that Hanssen had a lot of unexplained extra cash on hand and of his belief that his in - law was spying for Moscow .
At that juncture , the FBI could easily have apprehended Hanssen with some basic sleuthing .
Instead , it did nothing except continue to promote him .
The internal shock over the Hanssen case had not worn off by 9/11 .
And only weeks later came news of the botched investigation of Zacarias Moussaoui , the Al Qaeda operative detained by the FBI in August 2001 while trying to learn how to fly a Boeing 747 .
After Moussaoui ’s detention , FBI field agents tried frantically to obtain a warrant to look at the contents of his laptop .
But supervisors in Washington found groundless reason after reason to balk , until the crashing of planes into New York ’s World Trade Center and the Pentagon interrupted their reveries .
The Amerithrax investigation , vitally important for reasons obvious to all , was thus , from the FBI ’s point of view , an opportunity to rehabilitate the bureau ’s standing .
With a great deal of publicity , it threw itself into the fray .
Hundreds of thousands of hours were devoted to the investigation , and more than 9,100 people were interviewed , 6,000 subpoenas issued and 67 searches undertaken by “ dedicated investigators who ... worked tirelessly on this case , day - in and day - out ... to go the extra mile , ” according to the FBI .
But all to no avail .
Drawing in part on a psychological - behavioral profile of the likely perpetrator , the FBI focused initially on Steven J. Hatfill , a biowarfare expert also at Ft. Detrick , named as a “ person of interest ” by former Atty .
Gen. John Ashcroft back in 2002 .
But after hounding Hatfill for years , this probe proved to be a dead end .
In June , Hatfill was effectively exonerated when he collected $ 5.8 million from the government to settle a suit contending that his privacy had been violated .

Only over the last year and a half did the bureau begin to focus on Ivins .
Why it took the agency years to look in his direction is a central mystery .
In late 2001 , Ivins had been involved in an “ accident ” involving a spill of anthrax spores in his lab .
He neither reported the breach nor reported his unauthorized cleanup .
In 2003 , Ivins showed up as a Red Cross volunteer to offer refreshments to investigators draining a Maryland pond in search of clues to implicate Hatfill ; if he was indeed the perpetrator of the attacks , that ’s like an arsonist watching firefighters extinguish a blaze that he himself set .
Most damning , according to the recent court testimony of his psychotherapist , Ivins had a decades - long history of making homicidal “ threats , actions , plans . ”
With every Ft. Detrick researcher on the list of suspects merely by virtue of their ready access to anthrax , it is baffling that the FBI missed any or all of this .
The Justice Department has said it would release more information about the case later this week .
Whether Ivins is conclusively shown to be the perpetrator , or whether he was an innocent man hounded by intrusive surveillance and public humiliation into suicide , questions about the FBI ’s performance are piling up .
The bureau ’s horrific track record before 9/11 , and its single - minded focus on Hatfill after the anthrax attacks , raises the suspicion that , in the dramatic events of last week , we are glimpsing yet another monumental screw - up , one fully worthy of the FBI ’s inglorious recent past .

NEW YORK ( Reuters ) - Troubled insurer American International Group
Inc will freeze payments to a former CEO and officers of the unit that was the main source of its financial problems , New York Attorney General Andrew Cuomo said on Wednesday .
“ This is to confirm that AIG has agreed to freeze any payments pursuant to the employment package of its former Chief Executive Officer Martin Sullivan in light of the attorney general ’s ongoing review , ” according to the letter from Andrew Cuomo to CEO Edward Liddy , which was reviewed by Reuters .
The agreement affects $ 19 million that was due to Sullivan , Cuomo told reporters on a media call .
In July , AIG said Sullivan ’s severance package totaled $ 47 million .
Cuomo said it was possible the company could recoup some of the funds already paid out to Sullivan , a Briton who joined AIG in London as a teenager .
AIG has said it will try to claw back some executive payments , including to Sullivan , and cut spending by icing plans for several events , after an extravagant week - long California retreat it held came to light , drawing the ire of lawmakers .
The company will also freeze any distribution of funds from a $ 600 million deferred compensation and bonus pool for its AIG Financial Products subsidiary , which underwrote credit default swaps that triggered more than $ 25 billion in write - downs .
The former head of that unit , Joseph Cassano , had a share totaling about $ 69 million of those funds , according to the letter .
AIG nearly collapsed after troubles at the unit led to a severe cash crunch .
AIG spokesman Nicholas Ashooh said he was not able to comment on Cuomo ’s letter .
Sullivan and Cassano , who is based in London , could not be immediately reached for comment .
The insurer will also not pay roughly $ 10 million to former Chief Financial Officer Steven Bensinger , it was earlier reported .
3 CEOs IN 3 MONTHS
Cuomo said compensation to Sullivan , who was CEO from 2005 until June 15 , was under scrutiny because his tenure coincided with the period when the losses occurred .
“ If the company is required to take the bailout , it is ipso facto that management failed , ” he said .
However , he added that even the new management at any company that accepts tax dollars -- including Liddy , who was named AIG CEO as part of the federal bailout last month -- should not receive “ extraordinary ” packages .
Robert Willumstad , who was AIG CEO from mid-June to September , turned down the severance package he was offered after about two months in the role .
AIG has been loaned in excess of $ 120 billion in recent weeks as it has sought emergency cash to keep it out of bankruptcy .
“ Once a company accepts tax dollars there are different rules ...
These are taxpayers who did not invest voluntarily , ” said Cuomo .
Cuomo said a case pending against former AIG CEO Maurice “ Hank ” Greenberg , who stepped down from AIG in 2005 after 38 years at its helm , was an entirely separate matter .
Some of the thorny credit default swaps that caused such problems for AIG were entered into during Greenberg ’s tenure .
He quit the company amid an accounting scandal stemming from an investigation launched by Cuomo ’s predecessor , Eliot Spitzer .
Greenberg told Reuters in an earlier interview that not enough was done by his successor to hedge the risk of losses from the credit default swaps , which were linked to toxic mortgage debt .
Cuomo on Wednesday said his office is also probing fat pay packages to executives at other companies , but declined to name names .
“ It is not just compensation , but incentives -- perverse incentives for executives to produce ( short - term ) profit rather than long - term growth , ” said Cuomo , of the practices that are now under the microscope .
The new Star Trek movie wo n't sail into theaters till May , but writers Roberto Orci and Alex Kurtzman are already bracing for impact .
The tag - team scripters , who previously worked with producer / director J.J. Abrams on Fringe and Alias , have good reason to be wary as they reboot one of sci- fi's most beloved franchises :
They are going boldly where only those with a solid respect for Trek should dare to go .
Abrams ' Star Trek already has sparked a snark attack from William Shatner , who complained about not being offered a lead role .
And earlier comments by Abrams drew a barrage of skeptical blowback from concerned fans .
Despite the pressure to stay within the bounds of the existing Trek universe , Orci and Kurtzman ( pictured above , left to right , in their Universal Studios production bungalow ) insist that their screenplay sticks to the rules in a way that should satisfy even nit-picking defenders of the faith .
They are , after all , fans first .
Orci , a bred - in - the - bone Trekkie , grew up using a telephone in the shape of the starship Enterprise .
Kurtzman became a convert after seeing Star Trek : The Wrath of Khan in 1982 .
Speaking with Wired.com , Orci and Kurtzman swap thoughts about their personal obsession with the Trek canon , the premise that put Abrams in the director 's chair and the brainstorm sessions with * Lost * co - creator Damon Lindelof that brought some * Star Wars * mojo to the * Star Trek * mythology .
( Do n't miss Part 1 of this two - part interview , in which the writers discuss working with Abrams on Fringe . )

Roberto Orci :
This was not something you go into lightly , unless you feel you really have something serious to contribute because we really grew up on Star Trek .
We could n't turn it down out of ignorance or because we did n't have strong opinions about what we loved about Star Trek .
It became more about :
Are we worthy ?
And we came to the conclusion , well , this is our chosen profession !
We might as well go for it .
Alex Kurtzman : And with Damon involved — Damon Lindelof , co-creator of * Lost * who is also a massive Star Trek fan — we sat down with him for one minute and realized how much fun it would be for the three of us to work together .
The idea of having the safety net of Damon 's brain made it like , there was no excuse to say no .
We could not give in to the fear .
Wired.com :
There 's a huge amount of Star Trek material to work with .
How did you guys zero in on the particular story you wanted to tell ?
Kurtzman :
We agreed it was going to be the original crew , and the minute we did that , it limited the scope of where we'd be looking for story .
Wired.com :
What is the story about ?
( Warning : Slight spoilers ahead . )
Orci :
It 's about how the original crew came together , which was never covered in its entirety by either the show or any of the movies .
No one has ever told the story of how the Enterprise set sail .
__Kurtzman : __There are details in canon where the characters refer to their past but there are wide areas of interpretations and sort of blank spots where you go , " Wait , I understand this , but how did they get from here to there before they got to that point ? "
And that 's where you have some room .
__Wired.com : __While staying consistent ....
Kurtzman :
You have to remain consistent .
You cannot break one rule of anything 's that 's gone before .
__Wired.com : __When was your first exposure to Star Trek ?
Right : Orci at his desk in front of a poster for General Dynamics , inspiration for Fringe 's fictional corporation , Massive Dynamic .
Kurtzman : I was a little too young for the original motion picture .
Trek hit me at * Wrath of Khan* .
The experience of being in a theater and seeing that movie was certainly the first time anything paralleled Star Wars for me in terms of emotional intensity and sci- fi lore .
That alone — that feeling , wanting to create that feeling — was reason enough to do the movie , but not without being aware of the rules .
Wired.com :
So when you got hired to write a new * Star Trek * movie , did you get DVDs and go over all the movies and TV series again .
Kurtzman : Bob did n't have to .
Right : Kurtzman , backed by the sign from the coffee shop where he used to write screenplays before moving into Steven Spielberg 's DreamWorks enclave .
Wired.com :
It 's all in your head ?
Kurtzman :
When I first met Bob in high school , he had an Enterprise phone that rang with the " Bridge " alarm .
Orci : ( hums anthem )
Kurtzman : So Bob was covered .
__Orci : __You 'd answer in the saucer section : " Hello . "
__Wired.com : __J.J. Abrams makes no secret that he 's more of a Star Wars guy and not so much into Star Trek , but you two were full - tilt fans .
Orci :
In terms of fandom , yeah , and Damon too is a fanatic — we 're not going to drop the ball out of ignorance .
Nobody can say that we do n't know Star Trek .
There might be some things we do that people could question , where they go , " I hate them for some other reasons , " but they can't say , " They did n't know their stuff . "
Orci :
And it 's controversial to even mention Star Wars and Star Trek in the same sentence , but Alex said , " We have to bring more Star Wars into Star Trek . "
__Kurtzman : __ ( joke - coughing ) Original Star Wars .
Above : A poster for sci- fi classic Metropolis * hangs on the wall of the writers ' production office . *
__Orci : __Original Star Wars .
I want to feel the space , I want to feel speed and I want to feel all the things that can become a little bit lost when * Star Trek * becomes very stately – which I love about it , but ....
* Right : The writers ' fondness for genre films of all kinds is reflected in this poster from the 1960 B movie * Peeping Tom .
Kurtzman : Star
Trek is often the space equivalent of sub battles , which is what makes it unique and different from Star Wars , so you can't blow that away , either .
__Orci : __It 's somewhere between that the truth lies .
__Wired.com : __ J.J. Abrams was originally just going to produce Star Trek .
I guess your script convinced him he needed to direct ?
__Orci : __J.J.'s not a Star Trek fanatic by any means .
We figured if we came up with a story that interested him as a casual fan ....
__Kurtzman : __
It was secretly our agenda to hook in J.J. so that he could n't say no .
Wired.com : Besides sharing by now a creative shorthand with Abrams , why was it so important to get him to direct Star Trek ?
Kurtzman :
What we get from J.J. directing
Trek is 100 percent translation from script to scene .
An epic space adventure is something not a lot of directors can handle .
You need someone who understands genre and the spirit of Trek to accomplish a movie of this scope , which is bigger than anything Trek 's ever been before .
Yet hopefully it 's also intimate .
Wired.com : Your Star Trek story won over J.J. Abrams .
It sounds like you 're pretty confident the fans will like it , too .
__Orci : __There 's going to be a debate when this movie comes out whether or not it 's consistent with canon .
We argue that it is .
But there 's literally nothing we can say about this movie .
Even if we think it 's not controversial , people will say , " Oh , that 's convenient , they 're covering a story that 's never been covered before instead of dealing with canon . "
Wired.com :
It 's a pretty intense legacy .
__Kurtzman : __The questions we 're most attracted to are , " What are the rules of these characters and the rules of that universe and the rules of what makes Star Trek works ? "
If we do n't tap into that , no matter how consistent the movie is with anything that came before , who cares ?
If you tap into that and come up with something that embodies the spirit of what we felt when we first saw it , then hopefully we have Star Trek .

The Recording Industry Association of America on Monday urged a federal judge to leave intact a $ 222,000 jury verdict against Jammie Thomas , the Minnesota mother of two who has become a public symbol of the RIAA 's litigation campaign of more than 20,000 copyright lawsuits against peer - to - peer file sharers .
The RIAA echoed its sister lobbying group , the Motion Picture Association of America , by telling the Thomas judge that solely making available copyrighted works on a peer - to - peer network is enough to prove unauthorized distribution with fines of up to $ 150,000 per violation .
Any higher standard of actual proof , the RIAA said , would " cripple " copyright enforcement in the digital age .
" Requiring proof of actual transfers would cripple efforts to enforce copyright owners ' rights online – and would solely benefit those who seek to freeload off plaintiff 's investment , " RIAA attorney Timothy Reynolds wrote ( .pdf ) U.S. District Judge Michael Davis on Monday .
Reynolds said " the statutory text and decades of precedent compel the conclusion that making copyrighted works available for distribution violates a copyright owner 's exclusive right of distribution even if has not been proven that specific unauthorized copies have changed hands . "
In May , Judge Davis suggested he may have erred when he told Duluth , Minnesota jurors that they could find Thomas liable for infringement absent proof that members of the public had downloaded music from her Kazaa share folder .
In October , the jury concluded Thomas ' liability in five minutes and spent a few more hours deciding on financial punishment for 24 violations .
Judge Davis called for briefs from Thomas , the RIAA and the public at large over whether a new trial should be granted .
Reynolds pointed out " Millions of people use services like Kazaa to make copyrighted works available for illegal downloading .
Copyright owners typically have no way to monitor – much less prove – the actual transfer of those files . "
Most of the 20,000 - plus RIAA lawsuits have settled out of court for a few thousand dollars without the legal question at issue here ever being broached .
When it is litigated , most of the decisions have sided with the RIAA , although at least two have gone the other way .
Thomas ' case is the only one to go to trial .
Digital rights groups have weighed in ( .pdf ) on the case , saying the " making available " argument amounts to " attempted " copyright infringement that is not covered under the Copyright Act of 1976 .
The MPAA also weighed in on the case last week backing the RIAA 's position .
The RIAA , meanwhile , said regardless of whether the " making available " jury instruction , No. 15 , (.pdf ) that Judge Davis read to panelists " correctly states the law , " Thomas is liable for infringement because of " unimpeachable findings of willful infringement " during the trial .
Among those findings , Reynolds said , was the act of Thomas having copies of copyrighted music in her share folder , which was a violation of the Copyright Act , he said .
" The jury 's findings that Thomas engaged in the unauthorized reproduction of plaintiff 's sound recordings suffices to sustain the verdict , " Reynolds said .
The jury verdict form , ( .pdf ) however , makes no reference to " unauthorized reproduction " and instead repeatedly refers to " act of infringement " and not reproduction .
And although Reynolds said it was impossible to prove the transfer of music on Kazaa , he wrote Judge Davis that the 1,702 audio files on Thomas ' hard drive were downloaded from Kazaa .
" Defendant had copied the bulk of these sound recordings from other Kazaa users , " he wrote .
Still , jury instruction No. 9 says Thomas can be liable for infringement if she " used an online media distribution system known as Kazaa to download the plaintiffs ’ copyrighted recordings and / or to distribute the copyrighted recordings to the public . "
Thomas lawyer , Brian Toder , told the judge Monday in a court filing .( pdf ) that a new trial was warranted because it was unclear whether jurors found Thomas liable under the making available concept or whether she possessed unauthorized downloads .
" The special verdict form provides no incite [ sic ] as to what specific acts the jurors considered in reaching their verdict , " Toder wrote .
The RIAA also noted that MediaSentry , the group 's private investigators , indeed made downloads of the 24 songs in which Thomas was found liable of violating .
" Thus , unlawful distribution is proven here even if an actual transfer of an infringing copyright is required ( and it is not ) , " Reynolds wrote .
" It does not matter that a representative of the copyright owners downloaded the copies . "
The RIAA cites a host of cases it says backs up such an assertion , but none in the peer - to - peer context .
Reynolds also noted court decisions in which libraries or video stores have been found liable for unauthorized distribution of copyrighted works for merely making those works available to the public – absent somebody checking them out or renting them .
" Any other conclusion would contravene sound policy and common sense , because it would preclude proving infringement where the defendant 's intent to infringe and the certainly of infringements are clear but evidence of the actual act of transfer is nearly impossible to detect , " Reynolds wrote .
And in the criminal context , Reynolds wrote , sharing child pornography on Kazaa is unlawful distribution of illegal obscenity .
A public hearing is set for Aug. 4 in Duluth federal court .

Nissan 's
Nuvu is making its debut this week at the Paris motor show , and while it is n't the all - electric vehicle that the company has promised for 2010 , it 's a step in the right direction .
Resembling something from a Pixar movie , the Nuvu has that special mix of " vaguely futuristic " and " somewhat impractical " that we look for in a concept car : it 's less than ten feet long , seats three ( un ) comfortably and the space behind the driver is claimed by what looks like an end table with a conduit extending to the ceiling .
Many of the cabin materials are either recycled or made from organic materials and since the vehicle is electric , it should be whisper quiet -- offering maximum clarity for your Medeski , Martin and Wood CDs .

The 3G iPhone has had a rough start since its inception .
Signal issues , system crashes , and other glitches have plagued users .
Most recently , a glaring security flaw allowed people to bypass the password lock code and gain access to the iPhone ’s contact list .
Firmware update 2.1 , believed to be announced at tomorrow ’s Apple event , might fix everything .
Today in San Francisco , Apple is holding an event .
The bulk of analysts , bloggers , and media believe the event will center on the company ’s line of iPods and music - playing devices .
Part of the potential news could be iTunes 8 , a new version of Apple ’s desktop jukebox software .
No one knows for sure what iTunes 8 may bring , though Digg ’s Kevin Rose has predicted that it will include a Grid View , Genius Sidebar , and another feature that resembles the Pandora Internet radio service .
Apple also will announce a fix to the iPhone ’s bugs .
Apple CEO
Steve Jobs himself said in an e-mail that Apple would have a fix for the iPhone ’s problems in September .
The “ Let ’s Rock ” event scheduled for Sept. 9 is the perfect opportunity for Apple to publicly own up to the iPhone ’s problems and offer users some relief .
Aside from fixing the security hole and 3G reception issues , firmware 2.1 is said to bring some other new features .
They include better GPS functionality , which could power true turn - by - turn directions ; and the push notification service .
NASHVILLE : These were my thoughts on the second McCain - Obama debate , jotted down as it unfolded :
2132 : On verbiage - as S Palin would put it - Obama leads for sure ; he repeated less and had some good lines .
McCain seems angry and repeats lines from previous debates .
So no disasters for either candidate but Obama edges it - I can not see how the McCain performance enthuses the middle ground .
2129 : A couple of general points about body - language : I thought McCain looked pretty good once he stopped prowling .
He is lean and responsive .
Obama is cool and tall but not so quickly responsive .
Neither really engaged with the audience , partly because the rules did not allow it .
McCain is back on whatever drugs lead you to say " my friend " every two minutes .
They will be confiscated before next week .
Obama cannot seem to begin an answer with a snappy yes or no or maybe - he has to change gears .
2119 : Obama is getting McCain cross now - with another jab at his bomb bomb bomb Iran song .
McCain tries a defence - it was a joke with a friend .
He knows how to get Osama Bin Laden but he wo n't tell us how .
2116 : Brilliant question from the audience on Pakistan - to pursue or not to pursue .
Obama says he would .
McCain , oddly , is making a different case .
He may well be right ( Obama seems not to realise what would happen in Pakistan ) but it is dangerous for him .
He sounds soft on terrorists , frankly .
God knows what will happen if Sarah Palin finds out .
2111 : Obama ignores a question about the effects of the economic downturn on US military power and hits McCain on Iraq .
Brokaw asks a good question on the use of force when there are no national security issues at stake .
Obama makes the case for intervention .
But then unmakes it - the allies must do it as well .
McCain agrees , pretty much .
2100 : Interesting debate now on health with the fundamental issue of government intrusion .
McCain is still in the anti-government mold , but Obama points out where he believes regulation works - in respect of insurance companies , for instance .
I wonder whether recent events will affect the balance of view on this among viewers and voters ...
2059 : McCain does not answer either .
The answer is that healthcare in America is a mess .
Obama now says health is a right - McCain says it 's a responsibility .
2054 : To the question " Do you believe health care should be treated as a commodity " Obama fails miserably to connect .
He does not say yes or no .
He merely wanders into a stump speech take on his proposals .
He is no Bill Clinton .
He is no George Bush , frankly .
YES OR NO !!
2053 : Bush and Cheney !
McCain mentions them with contempt .
Contempt he must truly feel .
2047 : The reply to the question about how to create new energy technology gives Obama a good line - that for 30 years Washington has done nothing .
For 26 McCain has been there .
Not really fair - he has tried , but quite a good line .
2046 : McCain does repeat himself - he is on about Reagan and Tip O'Neil for the second time .
He manages to avoid the appalling " Miss Congeniality " joke .
But his basic message on tax is tough - he looks like a cutter but Obama not so much .
2043 : Obama is on the attack on tax now - defending his tax proposals .
Clinton ( Bill ) would have done a touchy - feely job here - who among you earns over 250 grand ?
etc. Obama prefers to lecture .
2040 : McCain sounds angry - as some thought he had to .
He talks of Senator Obama 's tax secret that you do n't know !
But the tax issue is important and I suspect he is convincing to some - Obama also senses it and tries to come back but is steamrollered by Brokaw .
2038 : Obama has a good line with McCain 's tax cuts benefiting CEOs - who have gone from heroes to zeros in modern US iconography .
2033 : Obama knows how much petrol ( gas ) is in Nashville .
Interesting that he puts energy above health as a priority - he would not have done that before gas got so pricey .
2032 : To the question : " What will you sacrifice ? " McCain talks about cutting government programmes and Obama talks about cutting energy use .
This is a clear difference and comes to the fore because the question was sharply focused .
2029 : McCain is on the attack again - does this work ?
He is listing Obama 's faults .
Including millions of dollars for an overhead projector for an Illinois project !
Convincing to those who do n't think much of Obama , but I am not sure this gets to floating voters ....
2026 : I think McCain may be getting too close .
He has a tendency to go up to the audience and prowl like a lion .
2021 : McCain is on a Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac attack - suggesting Obama and the Democrats let the two institutions go on a spending spree .
This is a reasonable line , I think - it points out that much of the deregulation objected to by the Democrats ( now ) was actually supported by them at the time .
Obama hits back with the deregulation on Wall St - and McCain 's backing for it .
And a good line - you 're not interested in politicians pointing fingers .
2010 : Obama gets it - he has no answer ( it would be odd to name someone right now for either candidate ) but he talks of the qualities the person will need .
2009 : Oh gosh a weird answer from McCain to the question - who will your treasury secretary be ?
Not you , he shoots back .
It sounds odd .
2008 : Obama is up and running with a smooth riff on the economy - a populist swipe at some executives who have already misbehaved with taxpayer money .
2005 : My great hope as the questions begin is that ordinary people are slightly better questioners than the first two utterly hopeless overpaid " moderators " .
TPM Reader CR :
Please please be against this bailout .
I cannot begin to think of all the
myriad reasons why this bailout as it is being floated is a bad idea of the most colossal of proportions , but I will try .
Why are there no [ details ] , because it will be a pig in a poke .
There will be a bums rush just like when Bush tried to pressure Congress into passing the Protect America Act .
They will wait until right before the election and try and jam the Democratic party up and say that if they do nothing then we are all going to Hell in a hand basket .
There will be nothing good about this plan unless you are a big banking and insurance CEO .
What a surprise !
While the Resolution Trust Corporation was a moderately well regarded solution to the 80’s S&L scandal , this proposed idea does not , and almost certainly will not be similar , though its proponents will claim it is .
The RTC took over failed banks and sold off the banks ’ assets .
Very simple .
It was simply an enormous bankruptcy trustee .
The crucial difference here is that this bailout will not be taking over failed banks , just taking over the bad debts of the failed banks .
So the banks will be able to live on and be free to do the exact same thing all over again .
I cannot think of a worse philosophical , policy , or practical solution than this .
You have banks and investment houses that lobbied Congress to remove restrictions on their activities and now their own activities have loaded them down with the crushing weight of bad debt from which they all profited handsomely before they got stuck holding the pile of s**t . …
If we are going to subsidize taking over these bad debts , then we should be taking over the entire banks and liquidating them .
Period .
10 Questions For Seth Godin
My friend and mentor , Seth Godin has a new book out , “ Tribes ” .
As has become a regular gapingvoid tradition , to celebrate the launch I e-mailed Seth 10 questions , which he kindly answered below .
Rock on .
1 . For the benefit of gapingvoid readers not yet familiar with your work [ all 14 of them ] , let ’s get the main schpiel over and done with :
From your perspective , what is “ Tribes ” about ?
It explains why top - down , buzz - driven media is the past , not the future .
The world has always been organized into tribes , groups of people who want to ( need to ) connect with each other , with a leader and with a movement .
The products , services and ideas that are gaining currency faster than ever are ones that are built on a tribe .
Barack Obama has one , John McCain tried to co-opt one .
Arianna Huffington has built the most popular blog in the world around one .
Harley Davidson and Apple are titanic brands for the very same reason .
They sell a chance to join a group that matters .
The punchline is that the only way to lead a tribe is to lead it .
And that means that marketing is now about leadership , about challenging the status quo and about connecting people who can actually make a difference .
If you ca n’t do that , do n’t launch your site , your product , your non -profit or your career .
I ’d argue that you understand how to tap into this need , Hugh .
Lots of people do n’t like your work–screw them , we do n’t like them anyway .
The people who do like , who find that it resonates … it ’s likely that we ’ll like each other .
You lead us to a place we want to go .
2 . Your seminal bestseller from a few years ago , “ Purple Cow ” , made the assertion that “ Everyone is a Marketer ” .
Though this would now be considered pretty standard doctrine for marketing geeks Everywhere , at the time I remember it seeming a pretty radical , new , challenging thought .
In Tribes , it seems to me you ’ve upped the ante by asserting that “ Everyone is a Leader ” .
Care to elaborate ?
Sure .
The idea that everyone is a marketer is still hard for a surprisingly large number of organizations .
Non profits ( most of them ) do n’t see the world that way .
Neither do traditional factories or many other businesses .
But it ’s so clearly true , I do n’t even have to outline here how the product is the marketing , how the service is the marketing , how every human being who touches something is doing marketing .
Well , if we go a giant step forward and realize that it is for and about the tribe , that tribes –connected , motivated groups of people–are the engines of growth , then it seems clear to me that what marketing means today is leadership .
If you ’re boring or staid , no one will follow you .
Why would they ?
3 . Anyone who knows you would consider you a leader , in your own unique way .
And the same could be said for a lot of the people you personally hang out with .
But it seems to me that this book was not written for those type of folk , but for people who have yet to really consider themselves as leadership material .
It seems to me that the main thrust of the book is about trying to get them to make the leap from “ Follower ” to “ Leader ” .
Is there any truth in that ?
Everyone is n’t going to be a leader .
But everyone is n’t going to be successful , either .
Success is now the domain of people who lead .
That does n’t mean they ’re in charge , it does n’t mean they are the CEO , it merely means that for a group , even a small group , they show the way , they spread ideas , they make change .
Those people are the only successful people we ’ve got .
So the challenge is : your choice .
4 . As you well know , I ’m fascinated with marketing , both for myself and for my clients .
Looking over my work from the last couple of years , I increasingly see marketing [ by that I mean , GOOD marketing ] as a function of LANGUAGE and NARRATIVE .
In other words , the art of marketing is figuring out a way to talk to people in the market in a manner they SIMPLY HAVE NOT been talked to before .
And then when I ’m reading your book , I keep thinking that , SO MUCH of being a leader is simply providing people with a good narrative to explain their actions .
In other words , it ’s far easier to lead if [ A ]
You ’ve got a great story that ’s easy for you to share and [ B ] , more importantly , you have a good story that is EASY for other people to share .
So much traditional marketing is built around the idea of “ Merit ” i.e. good quality , good prices etc .
But the older I get , I keep asking myself , “ What ’s the story here ?
What ’s the REAL story that people are GENUINELY going to want to tell other people ? ”
Do you see Storytelling as a form of Leadership ?
How about vice versa ?
In All Marketers Are Liars , my point was that people buy stories , not stuff , and it ’s stories that spread , not stuff .
An iPod made by Garmin would n’t be an iPod , would it ?
It ’s the story and the affect and the whole aura that makes it worth $ 200 .
I think you ’ve hit the issue on the head .
Leaders tell stories .
Gandhi or King or Che or yes , Rush Limbaugh .
They tell stories .
The stories matter and the words matter .
Of course OF COURSE the product has to live up to the story , the service has to be there , the story has to be true .
But no story , not idea , no marketing .
5 . We all have different things that motivate us , that gets us out of bed in the morning .
Some people want money , some people want power , some people want fame and applause .
You seem very driven “ To Affect Change ” , both on an individual level , and collectively within companies .
Where does that drive come from ?
Were you born with it , or has it just grown with you over the years ?
Is it something that is still constantly evolving ?
If so , how ?
It used to be a curse , but now I ’m getting used to it .
I ’m pretty impatient with things that are as they are instead of as they could be .
I ’m impatient with people who grumble and settle and then get old and die .
I ’m energized by people who see things differently and make changes happen .
We ’re all so lucky , what a sin to waste it .
6 . When I finished reading “ Tribes ” I was both stunned and delighted in equal measure to see my name cited in the Acknowledgements section as an influence in the creation of the book [ Thanks ! ] :
“ Years ago , Hugh MacLeod , the world ’s most popular inspirational business cartoonist ( who knew you could do that for a living ? ) , drew a cartoon ( his most popular one ever ) with the caption , ‘ The market for something to believe in is infinite ’- as soon as I read it , I knew I wanted to write a book about that idea . ”
Well , I certainly have some ideas about what that cartoon means to me , though I ’d be curious to hear your individual take on it .
What it says to you , personally .
Thoughts ?
That was the second title I had in mind for the book .
And I was going to include the image itself , but then it showed up all over the web and so …
The point imho is this :
You ca n’t drink any more bottled water than you already do .
Or buy more wine .
Or more tea .
You ca n’t wear more than one pair of shoes at a time .
You ca n’t get two massages at once …
So , what grows ?
What do marketers sell that scales ?
I ’ll tell you what : Belief .
Belonging .
Mattering .
Making a difference .
Tribes .
We have an unlimited need for this .
7 . Your books and blog posts seem to have one thing in common , they seem to be getting shorter and shorter with every passing year .
I have no problem with that ; I think people genuinely prefer short reads , over long ones .
For people aspiring to publish their own books one day , what advice would you give them re .
deciding on a book ’s length ?
Try to write a book or a blog post that ca n’t possibly be any shorter than it is .
8 . I think aspiring writers have a lot of romantic illusions about “ The life of an author ” , which have little to do with the actual hard - nose reality of the publishing business .
What do you think are the hardest lessons for a first - time author to learn ?
Books are souvenirs that hold ideas .
Ideas are free .
If no one knows about your idea , you fail .
If your idea does n’t spread , you fail .
If your idea spreads but no one wants to own the souvenir edition , you fail .
Book publishers do n’t make authors successful ( clarification : 175,000 new authors a year , 300 become successful because of publishers ) .
Authors make themselves successful by earning the privilege of having a platform , by creating ideas that spread , and yes , by building a tribe .
( Harry Potter anyone ? )
9 . You ’re a busy guy .
Besides writing books , you have paid speaking gigs , your blog to keep up , and your various start - ups and businesses to manage .
When do you find time to write the actual books ?
Do you have a regular set time for working on it [ first thing in the morning , say ] , or do you just somehow find the time whenever ?
I do n’t set out to write books .
I do n’t make time for them .
They just force themselves on me .
If I resist , the idea makes me miserable until I write it down .
I can go three or six months or longer with nothing , and then an entire book just sort of appears .
If I have to grind it out , I ’m not going to write it .
That ’s not true for everyone , but that ’s what works for me .
10 .
You ’ve been publishing your books for about a decade now .
Obviously , in that time period there ’s been a lot of changes in the world .
But for the sake of simplicity , let ’s narrow the field down a bit , to the “ Purple Cow ” , new - marketing world you ’ve been happily residing in .
What ’s the biggest change you ’ve seen in this brave new world , since Purple Cow and IdeaVirus first hit the bookstores ?
There ’s no doubt that the biggest change is that most smart people now realize that the world has changed .
When I started , I was working in a status quo , static world , where the future was expected to be just like the past , but a little sleeker .
Now , chaos is the new normal .
That makes it easier to sell an idea but a lot harder to sound like a crackpot .

THERE has been a nasty outbreak of R - worditis .
Newspapers are full of stories about which of the big economies will be first to dip into recession as a result of the credit crunch .
The answer depends largely on what you mean by “ recession ” .
Most economists assume that it implies a fall in real GDP .
But this has created a lot of confusion : the standard definition of recession needs rethinking .
In the second quarter of this year , America 's GDP rose at a surprisingly robust annualised rate of 3.3 % , while output in the euro area and Japan fell , and Britain 's was flat .
Many economists reckon that both Japan and the euro area could see a second quarter of decline in the three months to September .
This , according to a widely used rule of thumb , would put them in recession , a fate which America has so far avoided .
But on measures other than GDP , America has been the economic laggard over the past year .
The chart looks at several different ways to judge the severity of the economic slowdown since the start of the credit crunch in August 2007 .
On GDP growth , America has outperformed Europe and Japan .
Unemployment , however , tells a very different tale .
America 's jobless rate hit 6.1 % in August , up from 4.7 % a year earlier , and within spitting distance of its peak of 6.3 % during the previous recession after the dotcom bust .
Other countries have so far published figures only for July , but their jobless rates have barely moved over the past year : Japan 's has risen by only 0.2 % , the euro area's has fallen slightly ( though in absolute terms it is still a bit higher than America's ) .
Another yardstick , GDP per head , takes account of the fact that America 's population is rising rapidly , whereas Japan 's has started to shrink .
Since the third quarter of 2007 America 's average income per person has barely increased ; Japan 's has enjoyed the biggest gain .
To the average person , a large rise in unemployment means a recession .
By contrast , the economists ' rule that a recession is defined by two consecutive quarters of falling GDP is silly .
If an economy grows by 2 % in one quarter and then contracts by 0.5 % in each of the next two quarters , it is deemed to be in recession .
But if GDP contracts by 2 % in one quarter , rises by 0.5 % in the next , then falls by 2 % in the third , it escapes , even though the economy is obviously weaker .
In fact , America 's GDP did not decline for two consecutive quarters during the 2001 recession .
However , it is not just the “ two - quarter ” rule that is flawed ; GDP figures themselves can be misleading .
The first problem is that they are subject to large revisions .
An analysis by Kevin Daly , an economist at Goldman Sachs , finds that since 1999 , America 's quarterly GDP growth has on average been revised down by an annualised 0.4 percentage points between the first and final estimates .
In contrast , figures in the euro area and Britain have been revised up by an average of 0.5 percentage points .
Indeed , there is good reason to believe that America 's recent growth will be revised down .
An alternative measure , gross domestic income ( GDI ) , should , in theory , be identical to GDP .
Yet real GDI has risen by a mere 0.1 % since the third quarter of 2007 , well below the 1 % gain in GDP .
A study by economists at the Federal Reserve found that GDI is often more reliable than GDP in spotting the start of a recession .
Tapping the slumpometer
These are good reasons not to place too much weight on GDP in trying to spot recessions or when comparing slowdowns across economies .
The Business Cycle Dating Committee of the National Bureau of Economic Research ( NBER ) , America 's official arbiter of recessions , instead makes its judgments based on monthly data for industrial production , employment , real income , and wholesale and retail trade .
It has not yet decided whether a recession has begun .
But even the NBER 's more sophisticated approach is too simplistic in that it defines a recession as an absolute decline in economic activity .
This can cause problems when trying to compare the depth of downturns in different cycles or across different countries .
Suppose country A has a long - term potential ( trend ) growth rate of 3 % and country B one of only 1.5 % , due to slower labour - force growth .
Annual GDP growth of 2 % will cause unemployment to rise in country A ( making it feel like a recession ) , but to fall in country B. Likewise , if faster productivity growth pushes up a country 's trend rate of growth , as it has in America since the mid-1990s , an economic downturn is less likely to cause an absolute drop in output .
This suggests that it makes more sense to define a recession as a period when growth falls significantly below its potential rate .
The IMF estimates that America and Britain have faster trend growth rates than Japan or the euro area .
The bottom - right chart shows that since the third quarter of last year , growth has been below trend in all four economies , but Britain , closely followed by America , has seen the biggest drop relative to potential .
But even if this is a better definition of recession , potential growth rates are devilishly hard to measure and revisions to GDP statistics are still a problem .
One solution is to pay much more attention to unemployment numbers , which , though not perfect , are generally not subject to revision and are more timely .
A rise in unemployment is a good signal that growth has fallen below potential .
Better still , it matches the definition of recession that ordinary people use .
During the past half - century , whenever America 's unemployment rate has risen by half a percentage point or more the NBER has later ( often much later ) declared it a recession .
European firms are slower at shedding jobs , so unemployment may be a lagging indicator .
Even so , the jobless rate has usually started to rise a few months after the start of a recession .
As the old joke goes : when your neighbour loses his job , it is called an economic slowdown .
When you lose your job , it is a recession .
But when an economist loses his job , it becomes a depression .
Economists who ignore the recent rise in unemployment deserve to lose their jobs .

Did the announcement that T - Mobile sold 1.5 million G1 pre-orders sound a little too fantastic to be true ?
Information
Week thought so and talked to the guy behind the astronomical number — a mathematician at The Motley Fool .
Turns out that some iffy multiplication may have been involved and the number of pre-orders sold is probably closer to 200,000 to 300,000 .
Big , but not crazy big .
I contacted Anders Bylund , the author of the original Motley Fool article that hundreds of stories are citing .
I was curious as to how he got these figures and he gave me his rationale .
He cited a Cens.com article that said , " according to industry insiders , T - Mobile is planning to order a total of between 1.5 million and 2 million units of G1 with HTC in the near future , including 400,000 to 500,000 to be sold in the fourth quarter of this year . "
Then , Bylund cited T - Mobile selling out of pre-order units , and tripling the number of phones initially available .
He then tripled the 500,000 number to get 1.5 million .
Advertisement
Considering the iPhone , which launched in 20 different countries , only hit a million during its first weekend , we all probably should have been a little more suspicious of one phone in one country on one carrier surpassing that .
The G1 looks to be a spectacular competitor , but we ought not to lose our heads rooting for its success .
[ Infoweek ]
For months , Barack Obama ’s presidential campaign said it would capture traditionally Republican states this fall by registering more African Americans , younger Americans and other voters , in essence reshaping the electorate .
Now , the results of that ambitious effort are coming into view .
Today is the deadline for new voters to register in many of the battleground states that will probably decide the election , including Ohio , Pennsylvania , Virginia , Florida , Indiana and Colorado .
In some of these states , Obama and his allies have added substantial numbers of Democrats to the voting rolls .
As the balloting approaches , voter interest has reached a level that is leaving some state elections offices strained .
Nancy Rodrigues , chief elections officer for Virginia , said she had recruited scores of volunteers just to answer phones .
One day last week , her office was inundated with 8,000 calls .
“ We ’re feeling a little overwhelmed .
Thirty people divided into 8,000 calls -- do the math , ” she said .

Leading up to today ’s deadlines , Obama and Republican John McCain have been using celebrity supporters to entice people to register .
Two former members of the Cincinnati Bengals , Coach Sam Wyche and offensive lineman Anthony Munoz , stumped for McCain last week in Ohio .
Not to be outdone , Obama trotted out the Boss .
Bruce Springsteen gave concerts over the weekend in the electoral - vote - rich states of Pennsylvania and Ohio .
“ We need somebody to lead us in an American reclamation project , ” Springsteen told the tens of thousands of people who came out for the concert Saturday in Philadelphia , amid renditions of “ Thunder Road ” and “ The Rising . ”
Some states allow new voters to register until late October ; California ’s deadline is Oct. 20 .
Advertisement
A look at the voter registration numbers in some battleground states suggests trends that appear to favor Obama .
Virginia , for example , has logged more than 300,000 new voters since the year began .
The state does not record party affiliation , but it says that 41 % of the new registrants are under the age of 25 , and an additional 20 % are between the ages of 25 and 34 .
The influx of young voters , a core part of Obama ’s voting coalition , is an encouraging sign for the Democratic nominee in a state that has not picked a Democrat for president in more than 40 years .
“ This is exactly what we needed to do to change the electorate in Virginia in order to put Sen .
Obama in a position where he could win the state , ” said Steve Hildebrand , Obama ’s deputy campaign manager .

In Nevada , another Republican state that Obama is trying to move into the Democratic column , Democrats outnumber Republicans by more than 80,000 , according to figures posted by the state in September , before the voter registration deadline last Saturday .
Four years ago , Republicans held a registration edge of 4,431 .
Democratic registration has ballooned in Pennsylvania , presenting a challenge to Republicans who hoped to swing the state to their column .
Obama ’s party now outnumbers Republicans by nearly 1.15 million registered voters .
In the 2004 election , the margin was about 580,000 ; in 2000 , it was 486,000 .
Registration numbers may help guide campaign strategy in the sprint to election day .
For example , Obama ’s camp has said that if it does not meet registration targets in certain states , it may not compete there as aggressively .
Georgia may be one of those cases .
Obama aides say the campaign has 53 paid staff in Georgia , down from at least 75 last month and more than 100 at an earlier stage .
Advertisement
“ If we ’re not achieving the kind of numbers we ’re trying to achieve , and we do n’t think it ’s winnable at that point , it ’s definitely going to affect our advertising , staffing and everything else , ” Hildebrand said .
McCain campaign aides caution that too much can be made of raw voter registration numbers .
Consider Florida :
In 2004 , President Bush won the state by more than 381,000 votes , even though Republicans trailed in the voter registration count that year by nearly 368,000 .
Obama is working the state hard .
Wednesday , as students lined up by the hundreds to see former President Clinton speak at the University of Central Florida , Obama volunteers scanned them one by one , making sure they were registered .
Advertisement
Obama has made gains ; the Democrats ’ lead in voter registration has grown by 130,000 since 2004 .
Still , that may not be enough .
The share of Florida voters aligning with each party is about the same .
About 41 % of Florida voters are registered as Democrats , the same as four years ago , while the portion who are Republicans has dropped 1 percentage point , to 37 % .
In the end , Republican officials point out , victory hinges not on how many voters each campaign registers but on which campaign gets more of its voters to the polls .
“ Florida Republicans have traditionally been more effective than Democrats at getting voters to the polls , and this year will be no different , ” said Erin VanSickle , a spokeswoman for the state Republican Party .
Advertisement
Each campaign is targeting different kinds of voters , tailoring its message accordingly .
Republican aides talk of setting up voter registration tables outside mega-churches .
“ We do it at NASCAR races , [ World Wrestling Entertainment ] events , ” said Rich Beeson , political director for the Republican National Committee .
Beeson ’s office at RNC headquarters is plastered with maps of every battleground state , with targeted counties highlighted in burnt orange .
College campuses are dicier .
McCain ’s daughter Meghan was dispatched to Ohio State University and other parts of Ohio and Pennsylvania to help sway younger voters .
But with Obama scoring well among younger voters , McCain supporters on college campuses say they have to work harder to find like - minded students than do the Democrats -- and they risk registering students who will vote for Obama instead .
Advertisement
At Bowling Green State University in Ohio , college Republicans have set up tables for students to register .
But they are “ not pushing it real hard , ” said Quinten Wise , 21 , chairman of the group and a senior .
“ It can hurt your cause if you ’re not careful . ”
By contrast , the Obama campaign is helping the Bowling Green college Democrats to register everyone the group can find .
The Obama campaign “ provides all the stuff we give away at tables , which attracts people in , ” said senior Steve Currie , 22 , president of the school ’s Democratic club .
“ They help us organize events .
They pay for most of everything . ”
Obama is making a strong play to register young voters , running ads in school newspapers and airing commercials on MTV and VH1 .
Advertisement
An Obama radio ad that began running in Pennsylvania last month features a young woman offering an abortion - rights message : “ I ’m voting because it ’s my body , not theirs . ”
Obama then says the deadline to register in Pennsylvania is today .
The hip - hop artist Nas led a voter registration rally on Obama ’s behalf at Hampton University in Virginia on Sunday .
Over the weekend , two other Obama supporters -- Seth MacFarlane , creator of the animated TV series “ Family Guy , ” and Adrianne Palicki , a star of the TV show “ Friday Night Lights ” -- appeared at several Ohio colleges to encourage students to register and vote .
Before Springsteen ’s concert Sunday in Columbus , Obama aides handed out tickets not just in campaign offices , but at a park near a board of elections site .
Then , they urged people to go register , a campaign aide said .--

A film that graphically shows how Robert Mugabe 's supporters rigged Zimbabwe 's election has been smuggled out of the country by a prison officer .
It is believed to be the first footage of actual ballot - rigging and comes as Zimbabwe 's president faces growing international pressure .
Shepherd Yuda , 36 , fled the country this week with his wife and children .
He said that he hoped the film , which was made for the Guardian , would help draw further attention to the violence and corruption in Zimbabwe .
Much of the footage was shot inside the country 's notorious jail system .
Yuda , who has worked in the prison service for 13 years , was motivated by the intensifying violence directed towards the opposition Movement for Democratic Change ( MDC ) and the murder , two months ago , of his uncle , a MDC activist .
Initially he intended to chronicle secretly what life was like inside Zimbabwe 's jails but he found himself present when a war veteran and Mugabe supporter organised the vote - rigging by getting prison officers to fill in their postal ballots in his presence .
Using a hidden camera , Yuda filmed for six days prior to last Friday 's run-off election in which Mugabe claimed victory with 90 % of the vote .
Morgan Tsvangirai , the MDC leader , had earlier said his party would not be participating in the run-off because of intimidation .
" I had never seen that kind of violence before , " said Yuda , of the run-up to the election .
" How can a government that claimed to be democratically elected kill its people , murder its people , torture its people ? "
The film , made for Guardian Films , shows how Yuda and his colleagues at Harare central jail had to fill in their ballots in front of Zanu - PF activists .
Yuda also obtained footage of Zanu - PF rallies where voters were told they should pretend to be illiterate so that an official could fill in their ballot for them on behalf of Mugabe .
He was able to film the MDC 's general secretary , Tendai Biti , in leg irons in jail .
Biti , now on bail , faces treason charges which carry the death penalty .
Having completed filming , Yuda left Zimbabwe with his family for a new life and is now at a secret destination .
" I do n't regret doing this , although it is a painful decision I have taken , " he said .
" We can live without the memories of seeing dead bodies in the prison , dead bodies in the street , dead bodies in my family .
" I 've lost my uncle .
My father was also beaten by Zanu - PF .
I am praying to God : please God deal with Zanu - PF ruthlessly . "
Mugabe has now been sworn in for a sixth term as Zimbabwe 's president , a process which Tsvangirai described as " a complete joke " .
More than 130,000 voters spoiled their ballot papers in the election .
International pressure is mounting against Mugabe .
It emerged yesterday that a US draft resolution to the UN will call for sanctions against Mugabe and demand that his government immediately begin talks with the MDC .
If adopted by the Security Council , the resolution would freeze the financial assets of Mugabe and 11 other Zimbabwean officials and ban them from travelling .

Every time I write about Barack Obama I get a lot of letters , and the most typical goes something like this :
Dear Justin ,
I read your column regularly , and generally agree with what you have to say , but I think you ’ve got Barack Obama all wrong .
Yes , I know , he went before AIPAC and kowtowed ; he pledged to do " anything  and I mean anything " to stop Iran ’s nuclear program .
He acts " tough " and says he ’s going to invade Pakistan ; he gets in Russia ’s face .
But that ’s all a show : you see , he has to do this stuff or else he wo n’t get elected .
Once he ’s safely in office , he ’ll do the right thing .
Sincerely ,
John Q. Reader
This is an amalgam , but true to the spirit of the many pro-Obama missives I ’ve received .
They express a sentiment that is very widespread , so much so that it does n’t seem to matter , much , what Obama says he ’s going to do , because , in any case , his fans and supporters will simply insist on projecting their own hopes , desires , and views onto him .
This , by the way , is a feature of most all successful populist insurgent candidates : they are blank slates merely waiting to be written on by anxious voters , who know only that they are sick of what is , and pine for what ought to be .
As much as I hate to be the bearer of bad news , in this instance  because we ’ve certainly been through the mill these past eight years , and deserve some relief 
I have to say that this attitude is profoundly irrational .
After all , why should n’t we take Obama at his word ?
If he says he ’s going to " curb Russian aggression "  you know , like one might curb one ’s rather - too - aggressive dog  and get up in Putin ’s face , is he lying ?
When he solemnly pledges to go after the Iranians if they insist on deterring Israel ’s nukes with an arsenal of their own , is he speaking in Pig - Latin ?
The common assumption of these letter - writers is that Obama is just trying to " pass , " so to speak , as a warmonger .
Once he ’s in office , peace will break out all over .
What evidence do we have for this ?
None whatsoever .
Now , it ’s true that the Obama campaign did n’t really take off until he made known his antiwar views on the Iraq question , and a lot of his street cred is due to this early stance .
He was against the war from the beginning  and made sure the voters of Iowa knew it .
His chief rival , Hillary Clinton , took a rather more equivocal stance , and he beat her over the head with this relentlessly .
This was encouraging , but hardly definitive .
At the time , I warned that Obama ’s refusal to take war with Iran " off the table "  as the Important People invariably put it  did not bode well , and , given his development over the course of the campaign it turned out I was  unfortunately  right .
It is n’t just a pedantic intellectual desire for consistency , or just to give me something to write about , that motivates me to criticize the inconsistencies of ostensibly " antiwar " politicians .
Ideas have consequences , as the conservatives used to say , and if Obama makes it to the White House we ’re sure to experience some conceptual " blowback . "
Obama lied  people died !
How long before we see that slogan emblazoned on a placard at a rather sparsely - attended antiwar rally ?
But of course he did n’t lie , and is n’t lying now .
He ’s telling us he wants to confront Russia and Iran .
He ’s telling us he wants to increase a military budget already larger than the total military expenditures of all other nations combined .
He says he wo n’t hesitate to invade Pakistan  and , presumably , any nation anywhere  if we have some reason to believe Osama bin Laden and his cohorts are in the vicinity .
I think he ’s telling the truth  and I challenge the Obamaoids , especially the ones who claim to be sick of eight years of constant warfare , to prove otherwise .
If Obama is indeed giving us the real story , and if he actually implements his foreign policy proposals , we are in a world of trouble .
Joe Biden rightly said that , within six months of his election , Obama would be " tested . "
This was generally taken to mean tested by America ’s enemies  al - Qaeda , the Iranians , possibly the Russkies  but I took it in quite a different way .
Yes , he will be tested , and has been repeatedly tested  by the War Party .
So far , he ’s passed with flying colors .
For evidence of this , just look at all that money he ’s raised from some of the biggest players in the game of Empire .
The high - rollers are n’t placing their bets on Obama for nothing .
You do n’t spend $ 45 million on a single infomercial if you ’re financing your campaign with small contributions .
I ’ve written about Obama ’s bigtime Wall Street backers at length , here .
In any case , I hardly think Obama is going to abolish the very Empire that polices the world on behalf of his Wall Street backers .
Nor did I ever expect him to , even when I was more favorably inclined to his candidacy .
Back in those halcyon days , afflicted as I was by an irrational exuberance due to rising antiwar sentiment , I did expect he would n’t get us into any fresh wars , even if he did n’t quite wind up the ones we ’re already fighting .
I ’m afraid , however , I was quite wrong ,
In this regard , an interesting bit of reporting appeared in last week ’s [ Oct. 22 ] New York Times , where we learn :
" Mr. Obama , the candidate who has expressed far more willingness to sit down and negotiate with the Iranians , said in an e-mail message passed on by an aide that in any final deal he would not allow Iran to produce uranium on Iranian soil , the same hard - line view enunciated by the Bush administration . "
The writer , David Sanger , goes on to point out that the stereotypes of warmonger and peacenik in this race are not only off , they are way off :
" Consider the delicate issue of Pakistan , where it is Mr. Obama who has been far more willing than Mr. McCain to threaten sending in American troops on ground raids .
Mr. McCain , by contrast , argues that Pakistan must control its territory .
 I do n’t think the American people today are ready to commit troops to Waziristan , ’ he said , months before Mr. Bush signed secret orders this summer authorizing ground raids in Pakistan , including the violent sanctuaries of North and South Waziristan . "
Interesting  not that it means McCain is the real peacenik , just that Obama is , potentially , even more reckless than Mad John .
Do n’t let that calm demeanor fool you .
President Obama is no hyperventilating arm - waving interventionist , for sure , but that ’s just a question of style .
He ’ll no doubt cultivate his own signature brand : Zen interventionism , if you will .
What ’s unnerving , however , is that Obama ’s foreign policy views have gone largely unarticulated , except in the most general terms .
He ’s a man of mystery , a characteristic that lets his supporters project their own views onto him , and yet this failure to be more forthcoming is what I find particularly ominous .
As Sanger reports :
" Mr. McCain , now the Republican nominee , agreed to an interview during the primary campaign .
Obama aides answered questions at length , but Mr. Obama , the Democratic nominee , citing the pressures of time in the campaign , declined requests dating to June to be interviewed in detail on how he would handle potential confrontations beyond Iraq that could face the next president . "
During that interminable infomercial , a total of less than two minutes was devoted to the issue of war and peace .
And those two minutes were filled with renewed vows to increase the military budget  with the added fillip of " curbing Russian aggression . "
This should comfort all those " Obama - cons , " alleged conservatives who are jumping on the bandwagon now that his election seems imminent  because we seem to be going back in time , back to the " good old days " of the cold war .
In Obama World , the Russians are coming — again !
Soon we ’ll be hearing dire warnings that if we do n’t stop them in South Ossetia , before you know it they ’ll be in South Carolina .
Hollywood  a bastion of Obama - mania  will do a remake of Red Dawn .
Schoolchildren will be subjected to " duck and cover " sessions , and Fox News will do an updated revival of " I Led Three Lives . "
Okay , enough with Obama , because it ’s not really about him , personally , or even politically .
People need hope : they need to know that they are n’t , ultimately , powerless , that they can make an impact on what we do as a nation — that is , what the government does in our name .
They not only like to believe it , they have to believe it , because to not believe it is to fall victim to despair .
It is the democratic faith , which one devoutly hopes is not a pretty fiction .
Yet the electoral process is rigged , in this country : the system permits only two political parties .
All others must overcome enormous obstacles to achieve ballot status .
This give the War Party maximum elbow room to manipulate the political process behind the scenes , and allows them to exercise their dictatorship in a " democratic " fashion .
The two–party monopoly gives the War Party a strategic advantage : it merely has to split itself in two , amoeba - like , so that both officially - recognized " major " parties " simply become the " right " and " left " wings of a single party  the War Party .
This limits the political options of the peace movement , and makes it harder to have an impact even at the primary level : the gigantism of the system , with its two monolithic party organizations , is biased against insurgents .
It is also more amenable to the advantages of money , large sums of it , which Obama has had access to throughout this campaign .
Political action is fine , and necessary , but there are other , more important tasks for those who want to bring about a real change in American foreign policy  by which I mean a complete turnaround .
Such ambition requires a longer view .
America has been an emerging empire for the past half century or so , and now that we ’re the semi-official world ’s policeman  the " hyperpower , " as the French put it  a good many Americans are beginning to question the value and the morality of playing such a role .
The Iraq war , however popular it appeared to be at first , is today as unpopular than the President who started it , he whose polls have hit historic lows .
The next President will have to contend with a war - weary public , with very little patience for new interventions .
But  and I hate to tell you this , but somebody has to — the politics of fear and deception have not been patented by the Republicans .
Look for the Democrats to add their own ingredient to this bipartisan recipe for overseas disasters : the politics of guilt .
White liberal guilt , to be sure .
We ’ll be smack dab in the middle of Africa ’s feuding tribes faster than you can say " Samantha Power . "
And that ’s the best case scenario .
In the worst case , the Dennis Ross faction of Obama ’s emerging foreign policy movers and shakers will maneuver us into a confrontation with Iran , and relations with Russia will deteriorate to a new low as NATO escalates its eastward expansion .
In any case , those who are working to effect a fundamental change in American foreign policy have a duty to take Obama at his word — hoping for the best , but preparing for the worst .
NOTES IN THE MARGIN
Okay , you ask , so who are you voting for ?
That ’s another letter I ’ll get , due to this column , and so I ’ll answer it preemptively , so to speak , here .
I ’m , like , man , I really do n’t know if I ’m ready for a vice president who goes : “ My son ’s , like : ‘ Mom , I ’m in the army now , ’ and I ’m , like : ‘ I ’m so proud . ’ ”
And who ’s , like , “ And [ my son ] goes , ‘ O.K. , well I ’ll be praying . ’
I ’m like — total role reversal here , that ’s what I ’ve been telling him for 19 years . ’”
Or who goes , “ This is a time when , man , politics have got to be put aside . ”
( As Alaska governor Sarah Palin told Sean Hannity , William Kristol , and Katie Couric . )
I know , it ’s elitist to expect a candidate for president or vice president to speak like an adult .
Sure , there are parents out there battling the “ like ” epidemic who might not appreciate having someone in the White House validating their 15 - year - olds ’ speech habits .
But , hey : “ Total role reversal here . ” ( Palin , of course , can sound adolescent even when she uses the right verbs , as when she disingenuously denied her snarky put - down of Joe Biden ’s age while lauding herself as “ you know , . . . the new energy , the new face , the new ideas . ” )
It ’s even more elitist to expect a vice president to put together sentences that cohere into a minimally logical progression of thought .
There was a time , however , when conservatives upheld adult standards — such as clarity of speech and thought — without apology , even in the face of the relentless downward pull of adolescent culture .
But now , when a vice - presidential candidate talks like a teenager , mugs like an American Idol contestant , and traffics in syntactical dead - ends and non sequiturs , we are supposed to find her charming and authentic .
Palin ’s defenders only indirectly acknowledge her awkward linguistic skills when they denounce “ gotcha journalism . ”
They dismiss a by - now classic Palin paragraph as the product of Katie Couric ’s unfair questioning .
Couric had asked Palin whether , instead of buying up bad debt on Wall Street , government should help Americans pay their mortgages .
To a Palinite , here was a true “ gotcha ” moment .
The candidate responded :
That ’s why I say I , like every American I ’m speaking with , we ’re ill about this position that we have been put in where it is the taxpayers looking to bail out .
But ultimately , what the bailout does is help those who are concerned about the health - care reform that is needed to help shore up our economy , helping the — it ’s got to be all about job creation , too , shoring up our economy and putting it back on the right track .
So health - care reform and reducing taxes and reining in spending has got to accompany tax reductions and tax relief for Americans .
And trade , we 've got to see trade as opportunity , not as a competitive , scary thing .
But one in five jobs being created in the trade sector today , we ’ve got to look at that as more opportunity .
All those things under the umbrella of job creation .
This bailout is a part of that .
Let ’s grant , for the sake of argument , that this free - association spree is simply the effect of a predatory liberal reporter and does not reflect Palin ’s financial ignorance or muddled thinking .
But many of Palin ’s utterances in her softball debate with Senator Joe Biden were also disjointed and strange .
That many on the right ( and even some in the media ) greeted her debate performance as a triumph had more to do with her bravura self - confidence — telegraphed by her cringe - making winks and grins — than with the quality of her arguments .
Following Biden ’s claim that Bush ’s policies have favored the wealthy , Palin seized the occasion to ladle out some canned and non-responsive Reaganesque folksiness :
Say it ai n’t so , Joe , there you go again pointing backwards again .
You preferenced your whole comment with the Bush administration .
Now doggone it , let 's look ahead and tell Americans what we have to plan to do for them in the future .
You mentioned education and I ’m glad you did .
I know education you are passionate about with your wife being a teacher for 30 years , and God bless her .
Her reward is in heaven , right ?
I say , too , with education , America needs to be putting a lot more focus on that and our schools have got to be really ramped up in terms of the funding that they are deserving .
. . .
Education credit in American has been in some sense in some of our states just accepted to be a little bit lax and we have got to increase the standards .
. . .
We need to make sure that education in either one of our agendas , I think , absolute top of the line .
To be sure , most of us would take vows of silence if forced to read transcriptions of our speech .
And Biden also let forth impenetrable utterances during the debate .
But Palin ’s elisions and U - turns take ordinary inarticulateness to a new level .
Asked who was at fault in the subprime meltdown , for example , Palin answered :
One thing that Americans do at this time , also , though , is let ’s commit ourselves just everyday American people , Joe Six Pack , hockey moms across the nation , I think we need to band together and say “ Never Again . ”
Never will we be exploited and taken advantage of again by those managing our money and loaning us these dollars .
At another point , she noted that “ 96 percent of [ Obama ’s ] votes have been solely along party line , not having that proof for the American people to know that his commitment , too , is , you know , put the partisanship , put the special interests aside , and get down to getting business done for the people of America . ”
Palin favors relative clauses that hang precariously at the end of sentences : “ I am [ interested in defending McCain ’s health care plan ] because he ’s got a good health care plan that is detailed . ”
Or : “ I do take issue with some of the principle there with that redistribution of wealth principle that seems to be espoused by you . ”
Her speech differs somewhat from the verbal knots into which George W. Bush so often tied himself .
She is less given to malapropisms ; apart from her teen mannerisms , her linguistic oddness is more subtle , and seems more often driven by a failure to grasp subject matter .
Nevertheless , Palin ’s verbal hodgepodge may say nothing about her qualifications for the vice presidency .
Judgment and political acumen could well rest on different mental capacities than the ability to order thoughts into smooth sentences .
But the inability to answer a straightforward question about economic policy without becoming tangled in words suggests either ignorance about the subject matter or a difficulty connecting between ideas .
Neither explanation is reassuring .
The Palin nomination has unleashed among Republican pundits and voters a great roar of pent - up rage against liberal elites , much of it warranted .
But the conservative embrace of Palin comes at considerable cost to conservative principles .
The populist identity politics that Republicans are now playing with such gusto may come back to haunt them in the future .
Palin gave a typically incoherent summation of that populist conceit during the vice - presidential debate :
But it was n’t just that experience tapped into , it was my connection to the heartland of America .
Being a mom , one very concerned about a son in the war , about a special needs child , about kids heading off to college , how are we going to pay those tuition bills ?
About times and Todd and our marriage in our past where we did n’t have health insurance and we know what other Americans are going through as they sit around the kitchen table and try to figure out how are they going to pay out - of - pocket for health care ?
We ’ve been there also so that connection was important .
Having trouble paying for health insurance has no bearing on whether one understands how to lower its costs , however .
Someone who has never had to worry about his credit card bill may nevertheless possess unmatched ability to manage and explain economic policy .
Yet such a potential candidate will be forced into the usual embarrassing protestations of his own economic insecurity , if he is allowed onto the final political stage at all .
Enough .
Conservatives should stand for excellence and merit , period .
Middle - class status is neither a qualification nor a disqualification ; the same goes for economic success .
Conservatives will also have a hard time backpedaling from the hypocrisy they displayed regarding Palin ’s family situation .
Pundits and talk radio hosts rushed to explain why the pregnancy of Governor Palin ’s 17 - year - old daughter , Bristol , was a wonderful thing .
Answer : because the baby would not be aborted .
But every born baby of a teen parent has not been aborted , by definition .
While from a pro-life perspective , the decision to carry any child to term is laudable , the celebration of Bristol 's decision became difficult to distinguish from a celebration of teen motherhood itself .
In the past , conservatives have not flinched from pointing out the social and economic costs of teen pregnancy ; taking up that theme again , after the happy family - values face put on Bristol ’s imminent motherhood , is going to be awkward , to say the least .
Conservatives once insisted that women can’t always have it all : raising a child requires certain unavoidable trade - offs between family and career .
A mother , a father , and day care are not fungible , particularly for very young children .
Yet now comes Sarah Palin , with a disabled baby who will be barely a year old when the next president and vice president take their oaths of office , and conservative pundits suggest that only the fear of strong women could lead someone to question whether a mother with such a young , needy child can serve both her oath of office and her family as each deserve .
Liberal hypocrisy on Palin ’s family dilemmas has matched the conservative turnaround with perfect symmetry , of course .
And perhaps both sides will blithely and unapologetically switch places yet again as soon as circumstances allow .
Still , the conservative position on the family happens to be the right one .
So , too , was the erstwhile conservative defense of articulateness , knowledge , and uncommon achievement .
It ’s a shame to have sacrificed these ideas , even temporarily , in the quest for political advantage .
She fibbed about Darfur too .
She supported divestment about as much as she killed the Bridge to Nowhere .
NEW YORK ( CNNMoney.com ) --
Experts are cautiously optimistic that the massive federal bailout of the nation 's financial sector will solve the credit crisis that hit Wall Street this week .
But questions remain about whether it will prevent more failures of banks and Wall Street firms and many doubt this will lead to a quick turnaround for the battered housing market .
The plan , sent to Congress by the Bush administration late Friday , calls for the federal government to buy as much as $ 700 billion worth of mortgage assets held by banks , Wall Street firms and other financial institutions .
Those securities were backed by home loans , many made to buyers with bad credit or without proof of income .
As housing values fell and foreclosures shot to record levels in the past two years , the value of those securities plunged .
That in turn caused massive losses in the financial sector .
This past week it reached a crisis situation .
Banks and investment firms stopped making the loans to each other as they hoarded cash to protect against any sudden liquidity crunch as well from unknown problems on their partners ' balance sheets .
Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson and Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke won support for the bailout plan from Congressional leaders in a meeting Thursday night .
Congress began working on the legislation Saturday , and there could be a vote as soon as the coming week .
" I am convinced that this bold approach will cost American families far less than the alternative -- a continuing series of financial institution failures and frozen credit markets unable to fund economic expansion , " Paulson said Friday .
" I believe many members of Congress share my conviction . "
Word of the plan first leaked Thursday afternoon , causing a massive rally in stocks at the end of the day that carried over into Friday .
Several economists also praised the move .
" I 'm confident this will work , " said Mark Zandi , chief economist with Moody's Economy.com .
" The federal government is committed to backstopping the nation 's financial system and will do whatever is necessary to make sure the system does not unravel .
The details are important but secondary . "
The plan also won support from presidential candidates John McCain and Barack Obama .
Zandi is an informal economic advisor to the McCain campaign .
Other experts said that while there are obviously big risks to taxpayers , the federal government has little choice but to provide the assurance to financial markets .
" If this does n't work , we 're in trouble , because there 's not much more the government can do , " said Jaret Seiberg , a financial services analyst at the Stanford Group .
" They 've left very few arrows in the quiver . "
More losses , failures expected
But Seiberg added that the bailout wo n't completely end the recent turmoil on Wall Street , a crisis that began with the Treasury 's seizure of mortgage finance giants Fannie Mae ( FNM , Fortune 500 ) and Freddie Mac ( FRE , Fortune 500 ) earlier this month and escalated this week with the bankruptcy of Lehman Brothers ( LEH , Fortune 500 ) and the $ 85 billion loan to American International Group ( AIG , Fortune 500 ) , the world 's largest insurer , by the Federal Reserve .
" What the government is doing now is not suddenly going to make institutions profitable , " he said .
" What we 're talking about is trying to make them stable .
That means removing the risk from their balance sheet and putting it on the taxpayer .
The government has a much better ability to hold onto that risk for an extended period of time . "
Still , Seiberg is optimistic that the bailout will help home prices finally start to recover since it should lead to lower mortgage rates and improve consumer confidence .
But others say that there are still enough fundamental problems in housing , including a huge glut of homes for sale and the likelihood of more foreclosures in the pipeline .
" It should help housing prices find a bottom but I still think it will be about a year from now -- and after prices decline another 10 % , " said Stuart Hoffman , chief economist for PNC Financial Services Group .
Nonetheless , even if home prices do n't stabilize soon , one expert said the bailout could be a success if it allows bank to stop hoarding cash and once again begin lending to each other , consumers and businesses .
" The one thing you do n't want is to have the economy grind to a halt because people can't get credit , " said Dean Baker , co-director of the Center for Economic and Policy Research .
Baker predicts home prices will fall another 20 % even with the bailout but said the decline could become even more severe without passage of the rescue plan .
" Housing prices were a bubble and you can't stop them from deflating , " Baker said .
" But [ the bailout ] might stop an uncontrolled plunge . "
Will Congress pass the bailout ?
Despite the support being voiced by Democrats and Republicans for the plan on Friday , Seiberg said its chance of passage is by no means certain .
" The odds of this passing are probably around 80 % - and those are pretty good odds for Washington , " he said .
" But it 's not a slam dunk . "
Sen .
Richard Shelby , the ranking Republican on the Senate Banking Committee , questioned the plan Friday morning , telling CNNMoney.com that he doubts it will be the last federal bailout in the sector that will be needed .
" Secretary Paulson and Chairman Bernanke have not said ... this is going to contain everything , " he said .
" They 're hoping it is .
What they 're doing is jumping from crisis to crisis .
I have n't seen a comprehensive plan yet . "
He would n't commit to supporting the measure .
" This is too big to just accept without knowing what it does , who pays for it and is this the end of it , " he said .
" It 's true that there 's stress in the financial markets .
But should we bail out everybody ?
We know it 's important to the financial system , but at what price ? "
NEW YORK ( Reuters Health ) - Microwave ovens pose a serious safety hazard to young children , a new study of scald burn injuries demonstrates .
Hot foods or liquids from microwave ovens were the fourth leading cause of scald injuries in children under 5 years old , a review of records from the University of Chicago Burn Center shows .
“ Parents do need to teach their toddlers and their older children that the microwave is a potential source of danger as much as the stove is , ” Dr. Gina Lowell of Rush University Medical Center in Chicago , one of the researchers on the study , told Reuters Health .
She and her colleagues call for manufacturers to install mechanisms to prevent children from opening a microwave after something has been heated to prevent these injuries .
To date , Lowell and her team report in the journal Pediatrics , scald injury prevention efforts have focused on having parents turn down their water heaters so water temperature never exceeds 120 degrees .
But tap - water scalds represent just a fraction of scald injuries overall , which remain the leading cause of burn - related ER visits and hospitalizations in young children .
To look for patterns of other types of scald injuries in young children and identify ways to prevent them , Lowell and her colleagues reviewed the records of 140 children younger than 5 years old who were admitted to the University of Chicago Burn Center .
Among the 104 scald injuries that were not from tap water , 90.4 percent were from hot foods or liquids .
Seventeen injuries , or 16.3 percent , occurred when an older child was cooking , carrying the hot substance or supervising the injured child .
Nine injuries , or 8.7 percent , were to children who had opened the microwave themselves and removed the substance inside ; the youngest child injured in this way was 18 months old .
It can be difficult to keep young children away from kitchen hazards , especially if an adult is alone at home and trying to cook dinner , Lowell said .
Parents should keep a child well away from the stove if the child must be in the kitchen while food preparation is underway , she added , for example by putting younger children in a high chair or setting up a safe play area .
“ Most parents feel like they ’ve got it covered ... and yet we see all of these scald burns that happen to children , ” Lowell noted .

Presidential endorsements are flooding in from all over the country and the sheer number of them for Barack Obama dwarf the number of publications disconnected or silly enough to endorse John McCain at such a serious time in our country 's history .
According to Editor & Publisher , the Obama - Biden ticket leads McCain - Palin in daily newspaper endorsements , by 112 to 39 and , in terms of the number of readers reached based on the endorsing papers ' circulation , Obama leads 4 to 1 , or 13.4 million to 3.7 million .
And of the myriad mistakes made by McCain since he secured the Republican nomination from their confused field of empty GOP suits , the majority of newspapers urging readers to vote for Obama in two weeks cite the faux maverick 's choice of Alaska Governor Sarah Palin as his running mate as a major executive decision that made them question his fitness for the presidency .
To be sure , the endorsements offer enthusiastic supportObama and his platform for change but it's hard to miss how many of them use phrases like " clearly unqualified " to describe Palin and call McCain 's choice " reckless , " " appalling , " a " disaster " and " … an insult to the American people .
" Here 's some examples from around the country : " Then , out of nowhere , and without proper vetting , the impetuous McCain picked Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin as his running mate .
She quickly proved grievously underequipped to step into the presidency should McCain , at 72 and with a history of health problems , die in office .
More than any single factor , McCain 's bad judgment in choosing the inarticulate , insular and ethically challenged Palin disqualifies him for the presidency . "
" If elected , at 72 , he would be the oldest incoming president in U.S. history .
He 's in good health now , we 're told , although he has withheld most of his medical records .
That means Gov. Sarah Palin could very well become president .
" And that brings us to McCain 's most troubling trait : his judgment .
" While praiseworthy for putting the first woman on a major - party presidential ticket since Geraldine Ferraro in 1984 , his selection of Palin as a running mate was appalling .
The first - term governor is clearly not experienced enough to serve as vice president or president if required .
Her lack of knowledge is being covered up by keeping her away from questioning reporters and doing interviews only with those considered friendly to her views . " " McCain 's running mate , Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin , has been largely sequestered from the news media since her selection in late August .
She has yet to have anything resembling a traditional news conference , where the full range of her knowledge and views can be explored .
Her avoidance of questions and reliance on cue - card talking points in the one vice presidential debate did nothing to allay doubts about whether the 44 - year - old governor of two years is capable of assuming the reins of the presidency .
Her selection was but an act of political calculation by McCain . "
" A turning point came during the Republican convention , when he chose a long - shot for a running mate , Gov. Sarah Palin of Alaska , out of an apparent need to appease the right wing of the party .
For all of her rhetorical skills on the campaign trail -- particularly in the attack mode -- Gov. Palin appears to know little about the issues and simply is not qualified to be commander in chief . " " Columnist William Kristol , a longtime McCain backer , calls the McCain campaign ' close to being out–and –out dysfunctional , ' concluding that 'its combination of strategic incoherence and operational incompetence has become toxic .
'" And of course , the most unfortunate evidence of that ' strategic incoherence and operational incompetence ' was McCain ’s selection of Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin as his running mate , a person utterly unprepared for the high post in question . " " McCain failed in his most important executive decision .
Give him credit for choosing a female running mate -- but he passed up any number of supremely qualified Republican women who could have served .
Having called Obama not ready to lead , McCain chose Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin .
His campaign has tried to stage - manage Palin 's exposure to the public .
But it 's clear she is not prepared to step in at a moment 's notice and serve as president .
McCain put his campaign before his country .
" " And then there 's Sarah Palin .
The Alaska governor is great at firing up conservative crowds and gave McCain 's campaign a shot in the arm .
But , for all her charms , she is starkly unqualified to be president .
Her mastery of the challenges go no deeper than reciting talking points . " " McCain , 72 , says he will better protect America from foreign threats .
But his first major decision , choosing Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin for vice president , was reckless and put ambition ahead of national security .
Palin is unqualified for the office ; her folksy but not embarrassing showing in the vice - presidential debate does n't change that fact . "
" Sen. McCain , who has a long record of distinguished service to his country , has compromised his principles to get elected .
His reckless choice of Sarah Palin , the folksy but untested and incurious governor of the country ’s most government - dependent state , as his running mate is a prime example . " " But since late summer , the campaign has been marked by stunts and gimmicks , gaffes and shifts that call into question McCain 's temperament and , most of all , his judgment .
" One of his greatest miscalculations was the selection of Sarah Palin as his running mate , a pick McCain made after just two meetings and a phone call with the Alaska governor , not yet two years into her first term … in the weeks since her selection , she has been revealed as not much more than a sideshow , someone with very limited range on issues and almost none of the depth expected in a cabinet secretary , let alone vice president , or president . "
" Despite his age and previous health problems , McCain chose a vice presidential candidate who is so clearly unqualified for high office that the thought of her stepping into the presidency is frightening .
That irresponsible decision casts serious doubt on McCain ’s judgment at this point in his political career .
And over the past eight years , Americans have come to know , all too well , the high price of carelessness and ineptitude in the White House . " " McCain ’s selection of Palin is now viewed as a disaster .
For starters , it ’s an understatement to say she embellished her reputation as a reformer .
" Initially she claimed she helped kill the infamous piece of pork in Alaska known as the Bridge to Nowhere .
But she supported it wholeheartedly until a furor in Congress erupted over federal funding to build the bridge .
Only after it was clear Congress was going to cut funding for the bridge did she oppose it .
Some reformer .
" In what few interviews the McCain campaign has risked letting Palin give to the media , she has demonstrated how little she knows and understands about complex domestic and international issues …
Palin should never have been considered for the vice presidency , the proverbial heartbeat away from the presidency .
McCain ’s selection of Palin demonstrated a profound lack of judgment and is an insult to the American people . " " We once considered McCain , when he was an independent thinker focused on issues , as a very serious contender for American leadership ; his selection of the unqualified Palin for a post a heartbeat away from the presidency rules that out . "
" In their first debate , McCain haughtily said that Obama did not understand the difference between strategy and tactics .
His campaign suggests that he does n't , either .
" Take his selection of Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin .
McCain seemed too caught up in the game - changing possibilities of teaming with a woman reformer to scratch the smiling surface .
Had he , McCain might have realized that Palin is utterly unprepared for the job he offered -- let alone the one that might fall to her .
His trust in her undermines our trust in him . "
" In the first major choice made by any nominee , Obama showed considerably better judgment .
His pick for running mate , Joe Biden , has an extensive background , especially in foreign policy , and the clear capacity to be a significant asset to an Obama administration , much as Al Gore was to Bill Clinton . "
McCain 's choice , in stunning contrast , has a background of a year and a half as governor of Alaska , and has claimed , with a straight face , that she has national security credentials because from Alaska you can see Russia .
Supporting her , McCain has offered the equally jaw - dropping claim that Sarah Palin knows more about energy than anyone else in the United States .
" Having Palin a heartbeat from the presidency makes our own heart miss a beat . "
" The aging McCain chose an obscure running - mate from the extreme fundamentalist fringe of his party .
But Obama wisely picked Sen. Joe Biden , D - Del. , who has in - depth foreign policy experience . " " Perhaps the worst mistake McCain made in his campaign for the White House was the choice of the inexperienced and inflammatory Palin as his vice - presidential running mate .
Had he selected a moderate , experienced Republican lawmaker such as Texas Sen .
Kay Bailey Hutchison with a strong appeal to independents , the Chronicle 's choice for an endorsement would have been far more difficult . "
After all the kerfuffle the last few weeks over the financial crisis , with congressmen being told that there would be panic in the streets and martial law if they did n’t pass the bailout bill , it now turns out that it was a tempest in a teapot .
The Guardian is reporting that many Wall Street banks have decided that the situation is n’t that bad , and they will — in the words of Thomas Caldwell , chairman and CEO of Caldwell Financial , a billion dollar fund manager — “ tough it out ” .
What ’s really ironic is that the reason cited for many of the companies deciding to forego the bailout is the bill ’s limitations on stock - related pay and its ban on ‘ golden parachutes ’ for executives .
I guess those CEOs are more concerned about their own bottom line than their company ’s or even our country ’s bottom line .
Well , our government sure did turn the page on rampant Wall Street greed .
Not .

Coal production at a mine in Monongalia County came to a halt today when every union miner stayed home , as part of a political protest .
It was an idle day Monday at the Blacksville # 2 Mine .
More than 440 workers who are members of the United Mine Workers of America took what 's called a Memorial Day instead of going to work .
Union officials say they took the day to protest after a film crew from the National Rifle Association showed up at the Consol mine last week to interview union workers .
They say the crew tried to get union coal miners to speak out against Barack Obama .

You probably wo n't get one .
According to Automotive News Europe ( page is behind a free subscription wall ) , BMW 's planning to build just 500 Mini EVs .
They 're all destined for California to help meet the zero-emissions vehicle mandate that requires automakers to build 7,500 non-polluting cars by 2014 .
Automotive News quotes unnamed BMW sources saying 490 of the cars will be leased " to selected customers " and the remaining rides will be used as show cars .
" This step will allow the BMW Group to gain an initial knowledge of how mobility can be achieved efficiently using purely electrically powered vehicles , " Dr. Norbert Reithofer , chairman of BMW 's board of management , says .
" Our task here is to combine the ultimate driving experience with an efficient electrified drive with practically no emissions . "
The Mini EV is the work of BMW 's Project i , a program launched earlier this year to develop low - emission city cars .
There 's no word on when BMW will bring the cars to California , but most of the automakers working on EVs plan to have them on the road by 2010 .

Check out what these experts say :
A Dutch demolition expert ( Danny Jowenko ) stated that WTC 7 was imploded
A prominent physicist with 33 years of service for the Naval Research Laboratory in Washington , DC ( Dr. David L. Griscom ) said that the official theory for why the Twin Towers and world trade center building 7 collapsed " does not match the available facts " and supports the theory that the buildings were brought down by controlled demolition
Two professors of structural engineering at a prestigious Swiss university ( Dr. Joerg Schneider and Dr. Hugo Bachmann ) said that , on 9/11 , World Trade Center 7 was brought down by controlled demolition ( translation here ) .
Kamal S. Obeid , structural engineer , with a masters degree in Engineering from UC Berkeley , of Fremont , California , says :
" Photos of the steel , evidence about how the buildings collapsed , the unexplainable collapse of WTC 7 , evidence of thermite in the debris as well as several other red flags , are quite troubling indications of well planned and controlled demolition "
Ronald H. Brookman , structural engineer , with a masters degree in Engineering from UC Davis , of Novato California , writes :
" Why would all 47 stories of WTC 7 fall straight down to the ground in about seven seconds ... ?
It was not struck by any aircraft or engulfed in any fire .
An independent investigation is justified for all three collapses including the surviving steel samples and the composition of the dust . "
Graham John Inman , structural engineer , of London , England , points out :
" WTC 7 Building could not have collapsed as a result of internal fire and external debris .
NO plane hit this building .
This is the only case of a steel frame building collapsing through fire in the world .
The fire on this building was small & localized therefore what is the cause ? "

Some are in despair about this economic reckoning .
I do n't want to belittle in any way the stress it will inflict on many people who deserve nothing of the kind .
But the truth is : there is always something of a relief about hitting reality .
That 's where we are now in Iraq and Afghanistan and it's where we are now on the economy and energy .
The silver lining is that denial is no longer an option , and denial was the chief problem of the Bush administration for seven long years .
And so Obama emerges as the manager of this new realism at home and abroad .
McCain might have done so but his refusal to acknowledge the extent of the mistake in Iraq , the suicidal cynicism of his veep pick and his utter incoherence on economics has handed the role of leader to the Democrat at a critical moment in history .
Here 's the money quote from the Obama speech yesterday .
It is a small - c conservative message :
" Part of the reason this crisis occurred is that everyone was living beyond their means  from Wall Street to Washington to even some on Main Street .
CEOs got greedy .
Politicians spent money they did n't have .
Lenders tricked people into buying home they could n't afford and some folks knew they could n't afford them and bought them anyway .
We 've lived through an era of easy money , in which we were allowed and even encouraged to spend without limits ; to borrow instead of save .
We 've lived through an era of easy money , in which we were allowed and even encouraged to spend without limits ; to borrow instead of save .
Now , I know that in an age of declining wages and skyrocketing costs , for many folks this was not a choice but a necessity .
People have been forced to turn to credit cards and home equity loans to keep up , just like our government has borrowed from China and other creditors to help pay its bills .
But we now know how dangerous that can be .
Once we get past the present emergency , which requires immediate new investments , we have to break that cycle of debt .
Our long - term future requires that we do what 's necessary to scale down our deficits , grow wages and encourage personal savings again . "
Amen .
Would n't it be great to have a president who tells us the truth again ?
However hard it sometimes is to swallow ?

By By Stephen Dohnberg Oct 10 , 2008 in Politics Members and supporters of Iraqi Vets Against the War ( IVAW ) plan to crash the final Presidential debate on Oct. 15 at Hofstra University if the IVAW representatives are not permitted to address a question to both Sen. John McCain and Sen. Barack Obama .
Debate moderator , Bob Schieffer ( CBS ) , has been sent a letter from event coordinator and IVAW member Matthias Chiroux .
“ I 'm writing you today as a member of Iraq Veterans Against the War to make clear the details of a demonstration we will be leading Oct. 15th at Hofstra University prior to the final presidential debate and what our demands are and will be . ”
The demands are simple .
Chiroux continues , “ We in IVAW demand that two of our members , myself and Kristofer Goldsmith , be permitted entry to the debate and be allowed to ask each candidate one question ”
If the requests are not granted , and the IVAW fail to hear from campaign and debate coordinators by 7 pm EDT , IVAW members say that they are “ are willing to risk arrest by entering the debate to have their voices heard by the candidates ” Long Island IVAW member Kris Goldsmith expressed dissatisfaction with the candidates failure to address the current conflicts substantially in an official press release , stating " I watched the first debate the other night , the topic was supposed to be ' foreign policy ' , yet it took 34 minutes before the words ' Iraq ' or ' Veteran ' left either candidates ' mouths , " and Goldsmith went on to stress , " I 'm not convinced that either Obama or McCain care about what is most important to today 's military and veterans .
IVAW is committed to changing that . "
In a press release , available on Chiroux , in his letter to Schieffer , asks “ What yourself and the candidates must decide now , Mr. Schieffer , is what the legacy of this debate will be .
Will this be remembered as an event where both sides of the isle and the media came together to hear from our nation 's heroes , even if only for five minutes , or will the words and promises of both candidates be forever shrouded in the image of a host of uniformed veterans and their supporters going to jail because these campaigns cared too little to hear from them ? ”
The IVAW does stress that their intention is the event will remain peaceful and nonviolent , but it does go on to stress “ we will NOT , I repeat , we will NOT back down , be intimidated or moved in any way shape or form until our demands are met or we are arrested . ”
As of this writing , no known response has been received from either the Democratic of Republican Party , Bob Schiefer , or any representatives of the Commission on Presidential Debates ( CPD ) .
IVAW met with success during a similar demonstration during the Democratic National Convention in Denver Colorado , where they converged on the Pepsi Center with a letter stating that presumptive nominee Barack Obama consider and endorse their platform of “ Immediate withdrawal , full veterans benefits , and reparations for the Iraqi people . ”
Marching 4.5 miles from a concert hosted by Rage Against the Machine , ‘ Operation First Casualty ’ saw approximately 50 uniformed members ( veterans and active duty ) of the IVAW lead a group of protesters , numbering approximately 8,000 , to the security perimeter of the Pepsi Center .
Matthis Chiroux was among their numbers .
Official estimates of the number of protesters range from 4,000 to 10,000 , however this reporter was a witness to the start of the event and confirms that a number closer to 7,000 is accurate .
Two IVAW representatives , former Marine Lance Cpl. Jeff Key and Liam Madden , a former marine were allowed into the Convention grounds after a brief , tense , but peaceful standoff and was met by Obama campaign 's veterans liaison , Phil Carter .
Cpl Key reported to the assembled group that he had been allowed to deliver the IVAW ’s letter .
“ IVAW was founded by Iraq war veterans in July 2004 to allow servicemen and women from all branches of the military a chance to come together and speak out against an unjust , unwinnable and illegal occupation .
Today , IVAW has over 1,300 members in 49 states , Washington , D.C. and Canada , and on military bases in the U.S. and overseas , including Iraq . ”
This reporter attended their inaugural capacity public meeting at Faneuil Hall , Boston MA in June of 2004 , during the weekend prior Democratic National Convention .

HYPERPOLITICS ( AMERICAN STYLE )
Part One : Hyperconnected
We have been human beings for perhaps sixty thousand years .
In all that time , our genome , the twenty - five thousand genes and three billion base pairs which comprise the source code for Homo Sapiens Sapiens has hardly changed .
For at least three thousand generations , we 've had big brains to think with , a descended larynx to speak with , and opposable thumbs to grasp with .
Yet , for almost ninety percent of that enormous span of time , humanity remained a static presence .
Our ancestors entered the world and passed on from it , but the patterns of culture remained remarkably stable , persistent and conservative .
This posed a conundrum for paleoanthropologists , long known as ' the sapient paradox ' : if we had the " kit " for it , why did civilization take so long to arise ?
Cambridge archeologist Colin Renfrew ( more formally , Baron Renfrew of Kamisthorn ) recently proposed an answer .
We may have had great hardware , but it took a long , long time for humans to develop software which made full use of it .
We had to pass through symbolization , investing the outer world with inner meaning ( in the process , creating some great art ) , before we could begin to develop the highly symbolic processes of cities , culture , law , and government .
About ten thousand years ago , the hidden interiority of humanity , passed down through myths and teachings and dreamings , built up a cultural reservoir of social capacity which overtopped the dam of the conservative patterns of humanity .
We booted up ( as it were ) into a culture now so familiar we rarely take notice of it .
In Guns , Germs and Steel , evolutionary biologist and geographer Jared Diamond presented a model which elegantly explains how various peoples crossed the gap into civilization .
Cultures located along similar climatic regions on the planet 's surface could and did share innovations , most significantly along the broad swath of land from the Yangtze to the Rhine .
This sharing accelerated the development of each of the populations connected together through the material flow of plants and animals and the immaterial flow of ideas and symbols .
Where sharing had been a local and generational project for fifty thousand years , it suddenly became a geographical project across nearly half the diameter of the planet .
Cities emerged in Anatolia , Palestine and the Fertile Crescent , and civilization spread out , over the next five hundred generations , to cover all of Eurasia .
Civilization proved another conservative force in human culture ; despite the huge increases in population , the social order of Jericho looks little different from those of Imperial Rome or the Qin Dynasty or Medieval France .
But when Gutenberg ( borrowing from the Chinese ) perfected moveable type , he led the way to another and even broader form of cultural sharing ; literacy became widespread in the aftermath of the printing press , and savants throughout the Europe published their insights , sharing their own expertise , producing the Enlightenment and igniting the Scientific Revolution .
Peer - review , although portrayed today as a conservative force , initially acted as a radical intellectual accelerant , a mental hormone which again amplified the engines of human culture , leading directly to the Industrial Age .
The conservative empires fell , replaced by demos , the people : the cogs and wheels of a new system of the world which allowed for massive cities , massive markets , mass media , massive growth in human knowledge , and a new type of radicalism , known as Liberalism , which asserted the freedom of capital , labor , and people .
That Liberalism , after two hundred and fifty years of ascendancy , has become the conservative order of culture , and faces its own existential threat , the result of another innovation in sharing .
Last month , The Economist , that fountainhead of Ur- Liberalism , proclaimed humanity " halfway there . "
Somewhere in the last few months , half the population of the planet became mobile telephone subscribers .
In a decade 's time we 've gone from half the world having never made a telephone call to half the world owning their own mobile .
It took nearly a decade to get to the first billion , four years to the second , eighteen months to the third , and — sometime during 2011 — over five billion of us will be connected .
Mobile handsets will soon be in the hands of everyone except the billion and a half extremely poor ; microfinance organizations like Bangladesh 's Grameen Bank work hard to ensure that even this destitute minority have access to mobiles .
Why ?
Mobiles may be the most potent tool yet invented for the elimination of poverty .
To those of us in the developed word this seems a questionable assertion .
For us , mobiles are mainly social accelerants : no one is ever late anymore , just delayed .
But , for entire populations who have never had access to instantaneous global communication , the mobile unleashes the innate , inherent and inalienable capabilities of sociability .
Sociability has always been the cornerstone to human effectiveness .
Being social has always been the best way to get ahead .
Until recently , we 'd seen little to correlate mobiles with human economic development .
But , here again , we see the gap between raw hardware capabilities and their expression in cultural software .
Handing someone a mobile is not the end of the story , but the beginning .
Nor is this purely a phenomenon of the developing world , or of the poor .
We had the Web for almost a decade before we really started to work it toward its potential .
Wikis were invented in 1995 , marking it as an early web technology ; the idea of Wikipedia took another six years .
Even SMS , the true carrier of the Human Network , had been dismissed by the telecommunications giants as uninteresting , a sideshow .
Last year we sent forty three billion text messages .
We have a drive to connect and socialize : this drive has now been accelerated and amplified as comprehensively as the steam engine amplified human strength two hundred and fifty years ago .
Just as the steam engine initiated the transformation of the natural landscape into man-made artifice , the ' hyperconnectivity ' engendered by these new toys is transforming the human landscape of social relations .
This time around , fifty thousand years of cultural development will collapse into about twenty .
This is coming as a bit of a shock .
Part Two : Hypermimesis
I have two nephews , Alexander and Andrew , born in 2001 , and 2002 .
Alexander watched his mother mousing around on her laptop , and — from about 18 months — reached out to play with the mouse , imitating her actions .
By age three Alex had a fair degree of control over the mouse ; his younger brother watched him at play , and copied his actions .
Soon , both wrestled for control of a mouse that both had mastered .
Children are experts in mimesis — learning by imitation .
It 's been shown that young chimpanzees regularly outscore human toddlers on cognitive tasks , while the children far surpass the chimps in their ability to " ape " behavior .
We are built to observe and reproduce the behaviors of our parents , our mentors and our peers .
Our peers now number three and a half billion .
Whenever any one of us displays a new behavior in a hyperconnected context , that behavior is inherently transparent , visible and observed .
If that behavior is successful , it is immediately copied by those who witnessed the behavior , then copied by those who witness that behavior , and those who witnessed that behavior , and so on .
Very quickly , that behavior becomes part of the global behavioral kit .
As its first - order emergent quality , hyperconnectivity produces hypermimesis , the unprecedented acceleration of the natural processes of observational learning , where each behavioral innovation is distributed globally and instantaneously .
Only a decade ago the network was all hardware and raw potential , but we are learning fast , and this learning is pervasive .
Behaviors , once slowly copied from generation to generation , then , still slowly , from location to location , now ' hyperdistribute ' themselves via the Human Network .
We all learn from each other with every text we send , and each new insight becomes part of the new software of a new civilization .
We still do not know much about this nascent cultural form , even as its pieces pop out of the ether all around us .
We know that it is fluid , flexible , mobile , pervasive and inexorable .
We know that it does not allow for the neat proprieties of privacy and secrecy and ownership which define the fundamental ground of Liberal civilization .
We know that , even as it grows , it encounters conservative forces intent on moderating its impact .
Yet every assault , every tariff , every law designed to constrain this Human Network has failed .
The Chinese , who gave it fair go , have conceded the failure of their " Great Firewall , " relying now on self - censorship , situating the policeman within the mind of the dissident netizen .
Record companies and movie studios try to block distribution channels they can not control and can not tariff ; every attempt to control distribution only results in an ever - more - pervasive and ever - more - difficult to detect " Darknet . "
A band of reporters and bloggers ( some of whom are in this room today ) took down the Attorney General of the United States , despite the best attempts of Washington 's political machinery to obfuscate then overload the processes of transparency and oversight .
Each of these singular examples would have been literally unthinkable a decade ago , but today they are the facts on the ground , unmistakable signs of the potency of this new cultural order .
It is as though we have all been shoved into the same room , a post - modern Panopticon , where everyone watches everyone else , can speak with everyone else , can work with everyone else .
We can send out a call to " find the others , " for any cause , and watch in wonder as millions raise their hands .
Any fringe ( noble or diabolical ) multiplied across three and a half billion adds up to substantial numbers .
Amplified by the Human Network , the bonds of affinity have delivered us over to a new kind of mob rule .
This shows up , at its most complete , in Wikipedia , which ( warts and all ) represents the first attempt to survey and capture the knowledge of the entire human race , rather than only its scientific and academic elites .
A project of the mob , for the mob , and by the mob , Wikipedia is the mob rule of factual knowledge .
Its phenomenal success demonstrates beyond all doubt how the calculus of civilization has shifted away from its Liberal basis .
In Liberalism , knowledge is a scarce resource , managed by elites : the more scarce knowledge is , the more highly valued that knowledge , and the elites which conserve it .
Wikipedia turns that assertion inside out : the more something is shared the more valuable it becomes .
These newly disproportionate returns on the investment in altruism now trump the ' virtue of selfishness . '
Paradoxically , Wikipedia is not at all democratic , nor is it actually transparent , though it gives the appearance of both .
Investigations conducted by The Register in the UK and other media outlets have shown that the " encyclopedia anyone can edit " is , in fact , tightly regulated by a close network of hyperconnected peers , the " Wikipedians . "
This premise is borne out by the unpleasant fact that article submissions to Wikipedia are being rejected at an ever - increasing rate .
Wikipedia 's growth has slowed , and may someday grind to a halt , not because it has somehow encompassed the totality of human knowledge , but because it is the front line of a new kind of warfare , a battle both semantic and civilizational .
In this battle , we can see the tracings of hyperpolitics , the politics of era of hyperconnectivity .
To outsiders like myself , who critique their increasingly draconian behavior , Wikipedians have a simple response : " We are holding the line against chaos . "
Wikipedians honestly believe that , in keeping Wikipedia from such effluvia as endless articles on anime characters , or biographies of living persons deemed " insufficiently notable , " they keep their resource " pure . "
This is an essentially conservative impulse , as befits the temperament of a community of individuals who are , at heart , librarians and archivists .
The mechanisms through which this purity is maintained , however , are hardly conservative .
Hyperconnected , the Wikipedians create " sock puppet " personae to argue their points on discussion pages , using back - channel , non-transparent communications with other Wikipedians to amass the support ( both numerically and rhetorically ) to enforce their dictates .
Those who attempt to counter the fixed opinion of any network of Wikipedians encounter a buzz - saw of defiance , and , almost invariably , withdraw in defeat .
Now that this ' Great Game ' has been exposed , hypermimesis comes into play .
The next time an individual or community gets knocked back , they have an option : they can choose to " go nuclear " on Wikipedia , using the tools of hyperconnectivity to generate such a storm of protest , from so many angles of attack , that the Wikipedians find themselves overwhelmed , backed into the buzz - saw of their own creation .
This will probably engender even more conservative reaction from the Wikipedians , until , in fairly short order , the most vital center of human knowledge creation in the history of our species becomes entirely fossilized .
Or , just possibly , Wikipedians will bow to the inevitable , embrace the chaos , and find a way to make it work .
That choice , writ large , is the same that confronts us in every aspect of our lives .
The entire human social sphere faces the increasing pressures of hyperconnectivity , which arrive hand - in - hand with an increasing empowerment ( ' hyperempowerment ' ) by means of hypermimesis .
All of our mass social institutions , developed at the start of the Liberal era , are backed up against the same buzz saw .
Politics , as the most encompassing of our mass institutions , now balances on a knife edge between a past which no longer works and a future of chaos .
Part Three : No Governor Last Monday , as I waited at San Francisco International for a flight to Logan , I used my mobile to snap some photos of the status board ( cheerfully informing me of my delayed departure ) , which I immediately uploaded to Flickr .
As I waited at the gate , I engaged in a playful banter with two women d'un certain age , that clever sort of casual conversation one has with fellow travelers .
After we boarded the flight , one of the women approached me .
" I just wanted you to know , that other woman , she works for the Treasury Department .
And you were making her nervous when you took those photos . "
Now here 's the thing : I wanted to share the frustrations of my journey with my many friends , both in Australia and America , who track my comings and goings on Twitter , Flickr and Facebook .
Sharing makes the unpleasant endurable .
In that moment of confrontation , I found myself thrust into a realization that had been building over the last four years : Sharing is the threat .
Not just a threat .
It is the whole of the thing .
A photo snapped on my mobile becomes instantaneously and pervasively visible .
No wonder she 's nervous : in my simple , honest and entirely human act of sharing , it becomes immediately apparent that any pretensions to control , or limitation , or the exercise of power have already collapsed into shell - shocked impotence .
We are asked to believe that hyperconnectivity can be embraced by political campaigns , and by politicians in power .
We are asked to believe that everything we already know to be true about the accelerating disintegration of hierarchies of all kinds — economic , academic , cultural — will somehow magically suspend itself for the political process .
That , somehow , politics will be different .
Bullshit .
Ladies and gentlemen , do n't believe a word of it .
It 's whistling past the graveyard .
It 's clapping for Tinkerbelle .
Obama may be the best thing since sliced bread , but this is n't a crisis of leadership .
This is not an emergency .
And my amateur photography did not bring down the curtain on the Republic .
For the first time , we have a political campaign embracing hyperconnectivity .
As is always the case with political campaigns , it is a means to an end .
The Obama campaign has built a nationwide social network ( using lovely , old - fashioned , human techniques ) , then activated it to compete in the primaries , dominate in the caucuses , and secure the Democratic nomination .
That network is being activated again to win the general election .
Then what ?
Three months ago , I put this question directly to an Obama field organizer .
He paused , as if he'd never given the question any thought , before answering , " I do n't know .
I do n't believe anyone 's thought that far ahead . "
There are now some statements from candidate Obama about what he'd like to see this network become .
They are , of course , noble sentiments .
They matter not at all .
The mob , now mobilized , will do as it pleases .
Obama can lead by example , can encourage or scold as occasion warrants , but he can not control .
Not with all the King 's horses and all the King 's men .
And yes , that 's scary .
Fasten your seatbelts and prepare for a rapid descent into the Bellum omnia contra omnes , Thomas Hobbes ' " war of all against all . "
A hyperconnected polity — whether composed of a hundred individuals or a hundred thousand — has resources at its disposal which exponentially amplify its capabilities .
Hyperconnectivity begets hypermimesis begets hyperempowerment .
After the arms race comes the war .
Conserved across nearly four thousand generations , the social fabric will warp and convulse as various polities actualize their hyperempowerment in the cultural equivalent of nuclear exchanges .
Eventually ( one hopes , with hypermimesis , rather quickly ) we will learn to contain these most explosive forces .
We will learn that even though we can push the button , we 're far better off refraining .
At that point , as in the era of superpower Realpolitik , the action will shift to a few tens of thousands of ' little ' conflicts , the hyperconnected equivalents of the endless civil wars which plagued Asia , Africa and Latin America during the Cold War .
Naturally , governments will seek to control and mediate these emerging conflicts .
This will only result in the guns being trained upon them .
The power redistributions of the 21st century have dealt representative democracies out .
Representative democracies are a poor fit to the challenges ahead , and ' rebooting ' them is not enough .
The future looks nothing like democracy , because democracy , which sought to empower the individual , is being obsolesced by a social order which hyperempowers him .
Anthropologist Margaret Mead famously pronounced that we should " Never underestimate the ability of a small group of committed individuals to change the world . "
Mead spoke truthfully , and prophetically .
We are all committed , we are all passionate .
We merely lacked the lever to effectively translate the force of our commitment and passion into power .
That lever has arrived , in my hand and yours .
And now , the world 's going to move — for all of us .
Details of what I 'm wasting my time on at the moment , in particular what homebrew game or console project I 'm working on .
The world ’s economy is suffering more from the loss of forests than from the current crisis on Wall Street , according to a new EU - commissioned study .
The study says that the cost of deforestation annually is between $ 2 and $ 5 trillion dollars .
These numbers were arrived at after researchers put value on , and then added together , the many ways in which forests “ work ” for us , including absorbing CO2 from the air , and providing potable water .
The idea behind the study is that as forests disappear , the natural world no longer provides services which it used to provide for free .
So , the human economic system must step in and find a way to provide these same services , for example through building reservoirs or building infrastructure to catch carbon dioxide .
“ Whereas Wall Street by various calculations has to date lost , within the financial sector , $ 1 - $ 1.5 trillion , the reality is that at today ’s rate we are losing natural capital at least between $ 2 - $ 5 trillion every year , ” Pavan Sukhdev , who led the study , told the BBC .
The review is called The Economics of Ecosystems and Biodiversity ( Teeb ) , and was initiated by Germany , although the European Commission provided the funding .
The study has been a major topic of discussion at the International Union for Conservation of Nature ( IUCN ) conference currently being held in Barcelona .
There are conservationists who hope that data presented in this way will persuade lawmakers to put effort and funds towards the conservation of nature .

For a generation now , disruptive young Americans who rebel against authority figures have been increasingly diagnosed with mental illnesses and medicated with psychiatric ( psychotropic ) drugs .
Disruptive young people who are medicated with Ritalin , Adderall and other amphetamines routinely report that these drugs make them " care less " about their boredom , resentments and other negative emotions , thus making them more compliant and manageable .
And so - called atypical antipsychotics such as Risperdal and Zyprexa -- powerful tranquilizing drugs -- are increasingly prescribed to disruptive young Americans , even though in most cases they are not displaying any psychotic symptoms .
Many talk show hosts think I 'm kidding when I mention oppositional defiant disorder ( ODD ) .
After I assure them that ODD is in fact an official mental illness -- an increasingly popular diagnosis for children and teenagers -- they often guess that ODD is simply a new term for juvenile delinquency .
But that is not the case .
Young people diagnosed with ODD , by definition , are doing nothing illegal ( illegal behaviors are a symptom of another mental illness called conduct disorder ) .
In 1980 , the American Psychiatric Association ( APA ) created oppositional defiant disorder , defining it as " a pattern of negativistic , hostile and defiant behavior . "
The official symptoms of ODD include " often actively defies or refuses to comply with adult requests or rules " and " often argues with adults . "
While ODD - diagnosed young people are obnoxious with adults they do n't respect , these kids can be a delight with adults they do respect ; yet many of them are medicated with psychotropic drugs .
An even more common reaction to oppressive authorities than overt defiance is some type of passive defiance .
John
Holt , the late school critic , described passive - aggressive strategies employed by prisoners in concentration camps and slaves on plantations , as well as some children in classrooms .
Holt pointed out that subjects may attempt to appease their rulers while still satisfying some part of their own desire for dignity " by putting on a mask , by acting much more stupid and incompetent than they really are , by denying their rulers the full use of their intelligence and ability , by declaring their minds and spirits free of their enslaved bodies . "
Holt observed that by " going stupid " in a classroom , children frustrate authorities through withdrawing the most intelligent and creative parts of their minds from the scene , thus achieving some sense of potency .
Going stupid -- or passive aggression -- is one of many nondisease explanations for attention deficit hyperactivity disorder ( ADHD ) .
Studies show that virtually all ADHD - diagnosed children will pay attention to activities that they enjoy or that they have chosen .
In other words , when ADHD - labeled kids are having a good time and in control , the " disease " goes away .
There are other passive rebellions against authority that have been medicalized by mental health authorities .
I have talked to many people who earlier in their lives had been diagnosed with substance abuse , depression and even schizophrenia but believe that their " symptoms " had in fact been a kind of resistance to the demands of an oppressive environment .
Some of these people now call themselves psychiatric survivors .
While there are several reasons for behavioral disruptiveness and emotional difficulties , rebellion against an oppressive environment is one common reason that is routinely not even considered by many mental health professionals .
Why ?
It is my experience that many mental health professionals are unaware of how extremely obedient they are to authorities .
Acceptance into medical school and graduate school and achieving a Ph.D. or M.D. means jumping through many meaningless hoops , all of which require much behavioral , attentional and emotional compliance to authorities -- even disrespected ones .
When compliant M.D.s and Ph.D.s begin seeing noncompliant patients , many of these doctors become anxious , sometimes even ashamed of their own excessive compliance , and this anxiety and shame can be fuel for diseasing normal human reactions .
Two ways of subduing defiance are to criminalize it and to pathologize it , and U.S. history is replete with examples of both .
In the same era that John Adams ' Sedition Act criminalized criticism of U.S. governmental policy , Dr. Benjamin Rush , the father of American psychiatry ( his image adorns the APA seal ) , pathologized anti-authoritarianism .
Rush diagnosed those rebelling against a centralized federal authority as having an " excess of the passion for liberty " that " constituted a form of insanity . "
He labeled this illness " anarchia . "
Throughout American history , both direct and indirect resistance to authority has been diseased .
In an 1851 article in the New Orleans Medical and Surgical Journal , Louisiana physician Samuel Cartwright reported his discovery of " drapetomania , " the disease that caused slaves to flee captivity .
Cartwright also reported his discovery of " dysaesthesia aethiopis , " the disease that caused slaves to pay insufficient attention to the master 's needs .
Early versions of ODD and ADHD ?
In Rush 's lifetime , few Americans took anarchia seriously , nor was drapetomania or dysaesthesia aethiopis taken seriously in Cartwright 's lifetime .
But these were eras before the diseasing of defiance had a powerful financial ally in Big Pharma .
In every generation there will be authoritarians .
There will also be the " bohemian bourgeois " who may enjoy anti-authoritarian books , music , and movies but do n't act on them .
And there will be genuine anti-authoritarians , who are so pained by exploitive hierarchies that they take action .
Only occasionally in American history do these genuine anti-authoritarians actually take effective direct action that inspires others to successfully revolt , but every once in a while a Tom Paine comes along .
So authoritarians take no chances , and the state - corporate partnership criminalizes anti-authoritarianism , pathologizes it , markets drugs to " cure " it and financially intimidates those who might buck the system .
It would certainly be a dream of Big Pharma and those who favor an authoritarian society if every would - be Tom Paine -- or Crazy Horse , Tecumseh , Emma Goldman or Malcolm X -- were diagnosed as a youngster with mental illness and quieted with a lifelong regimen of chill pills .
The question is : Has this dream become reality ?
Check if you have been scammed
If you find yourself in any of the following situations .
You can be reasonably suspicious that you are at risk of or may already be a victim of fraud :
You see entries that you do n't recognise or can explain on Your credit report .
There are unusual transactions on your bank or credit card statement .
You apply to claim benefits but you are told you are already claiming .
You receive bills and invoices for purchases you do not recognise .
You are refused credit despite having a good credit history .
Post you have been expecting has not been arriving .
However , there may be an explanation behind suspicious transactions and events .
For example , a £ 50 payment to your local supermarket when you know you spent £ 20 .
You then remember you asked for £ 30 cashback .
What to do about it
Here are some steps you can take to protect yourself :
Tell your bank
They can :
Replace your cards :
If they have been compromised e.g. your card details have been stolen and there is a risk that fraudsters can spend your money .
Step up security on your account :
To stop future unauthorised transactions .
Refund any money that has been taken :
They are obliged to do this by the Payment Service Regulations 2009 and The Lending Code .
Provide useful information
On how to spot fraud and scams .
Pay by credit card
To get protection through Section 75 which could get you a refund if you fall for a scam .
You can find a credit card and check your eligibility here .
Check your credit report
For anything suspicious and get it rectified before it causes issues .
Speak to the company directly or submit a query with one of the three credit reference agencies .
They are :
Register with Cifas
This will put a flag against your name on the National Fraud Database so companies will carry out extra checks before they approve applications for financial products in your name .
Cifas membership costs £ 20 for two years .
Speak to Action Fraud
To report fraud and scams .

Be aware of scams
There are a many types of fraud .
The most of the common are :
Vishing
Vishing occurs by telephone .
For example :
Fraudsters phone you and pretend to be from your broadband provider
They tell you that they need to fix issues with your internet connection
They ask you to give them remote access to your computer by downloading software
They ask you to log into your online banking to give you a refund as a good will gesture
They then start moving money out of your account .
Phishing
Phishing usually starts from receiving an online message .
For example :
Fraudsters contacts you by email , text or social media
They pose as a reputable company or someone you know They ask you to click a link and enter your personal details into a form
They later use this information for their own gain
Malware

George Bush has been the target of fresh jibes by Venezuelan leader Hugo Chavez for doing exactly what he was criticising the socialist leader for – overriding market laws to protect the economy .
Critics say the U.S. bailout plan is an example of a double standard by the Bush administration , reports America ’s McClatchy newspaper .
A d v e r t i s e m e n t
“ If the Venezuelan government , for example , approves a law to protect consumers , they say , ‘ Take notice , Chavez is a tyrant ! ' ” said Chavez , speaking in one of his recent weekly television shows .
“ Or they say , ‘ Chavez is regulating prices .
He is violating the laws of the marketplace . ’
How many times have they criticised me for nationalising the phone company ?
They say , ‘ The state should n’t get involved in that . ’
But now they do n’t criticize Bush for having to nationalise ( the biggest banks in the world . )
Comrade Bush , how are you ? ”
Warming to his theme , he added : “ Comrade Bush is heading toward socialism . ”
Nicaragua Congressman Edwin Castro agreed : “ We think the Bush administration should follow the same policies that they and the International Monetary Fund have always told us to follow when we have economic problems — a structural adjustment that requires cutting government spending and reducing the role of government . ”
Meanwhile , Bush said the bailout plan , that will see $ 700 billion of government money used to buy toxic mortgages , was necessary , although he said it stood against his personal philosophy .

Scotland Plans World 's First Tidal Turbine Farms
September 29th , 2008 by Alex Felsinger
The two projects , which each include 20 underwater turbines , will be finished within three years and will provide power to 40,000 homes .
ScottishPower Renewables will apply for planning permission next year to build the two farms in Northern Ireland ’s seabed .
The turbines will be manufactured in Scotland in an intentional boost to the country ’s green - collar job market.[ social_buttons ]
The 98 - foot structures have been tested to operate in water as deep as 328 feet , and they spin slow enough to allow marine life to avoid the 66 - foot blades .
Most boats and ships would not be affected by the farms since the turbines wo n’t even reach 30 - feet below the surface , but net - towing trawlers will be forbidden from the area .
“ Tidal power is completely renewable , being driven by the gravity of the sun and moon , with no carbon dioxide emissions , plus the added benefit of being entirely predictable , ” said Keith Anderson , the director of ScottishPower Renewables .
The farms would help Scotland attain its goal to reduce its carbon footprint by 80 % by 2050 .
New York City installed its first turbine for their tidal power farm earlier this month , but the Scottish plan differs in that the farms will be located in the open sea , not a river or straight .

Latest Cleantech Talk Episode
IN the narrative that has governed American commercial life for the last quarter - century , saving companies from their own mistakes was not supposed to be part of the government ’s job description .
Economic policy makers in the United States took swaggering pride in the cutthroat but lucrative form of capitalism that was supposedly indigenous to their frontier nation .
Through this uniquely American lens , saving businesses from collapse was the sort of thing that happened on other shores , where sentimental commitments to social welfare trumped sharp - edged competition .
Weak - kneed European and Asian leaders were too frightened to endure the animal instincts of a real market , the story went .
So they intervened time and again , using government largess to lift inefficient firms to safety , sparing jobs and limiting pain but keeping their economies from reaching full potential .
There have been recent interventions in America , of course  the taxpayer - backed bailout of Chrysler in 1979 , and the savings and loan rescue of 1989 .
But the first happened under Jimmy Carter , a year before Americans embraced Ronald Reagan and his passion for unfettered markets .
And the second was under George H. W. Bush , who did not share that passion .
So it made for a strange spectacle last weekend as the current Bush administration , which does cast itself in the Reagan mold , hastily prepared a bailout package to offer the government - sponsored mortgage companies , Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac .
The reasoning behind this rescue effort  like the reasoning behind the government - induced takeover of Bear Stearns by J. P. Morgan Chase just a month before  sounded no different from that offered in defense of many a bailout in Japan and Europe :
The mortgage giants were too big to be allowed to fail .
Big indeed .
Together , Fannie and Freddie own or guarantee nearly half of the nation ’s $ 12 trillion worth of home mortgages .
If they collapse , so may the whole system of finance for American housing , threatening a most unfortunate string of events : First , an already plummeting real estate market might crater .
Then the banks that have sunk capital into American homes would slip deeper into trouble .
And the virus might spread globally .

Question : who ’s the better actor ?
McCain strategist Steve Schmidt or all those soccer players who flop to the ground and pretend to be near death whenever a defender comes anywhere within a yard of their shins ?
You make the call :
In an extraordinary and emotional interview , Steve Schmidt said his campaign feels “ under siege ” by wave after wave of news inquiries that have questioned whether Palin is really the mother of a 4 - month - old baby , whether her amniotic fluid had been tested and whether she would submit to a DNA test to establish the child ’s parentage .
Arguing that the media queries are being fueled by “ every rumor and smear ” posted on left - wing Web sites , Schmidt said mainstream journalists are giving “ closer scrutiny ” to McCain ’s little - known running mate than to Democratic presidential nominee Barack Obama .
I ca n’t speak for the National Enquirer , but I ’ve seen virtually no questions about Trig Palin ’s parentage in the mainstream press — and for that matter , almost nothing in the blogosphere either .
There was a shouted - down diary on the subject at Kos , and a weekend of insanity from ( non-liberal ) Andrew Sullivan , but that was about it .
On the other hand , the mainstream press has been full of legitimate questions about Palin ’s experience , her lies about earmarks , how she ran Wasilla as mayor , whether she sympathizes with the Alaska Independence Party , her role in Troopergate , her daughter ’s unwed pregnancy ( announced by Palin herself ) , her social conservatism , her fondness for raising taxes , and plenty of other perfectly legitimate questions about a vice presidential candidate who until a few days ago was a complete unknown to virtually the entire country .
So please .
Spare us the tears .
The McCain campaign , after months of counting on the media to report the most egregious BS with a straight face , has finally pushed them beyond the limits of their endurance .
Steve Schmidt has been the driving force behind this strategy , and he has nothing to complain about now .
It turns out there are limits to what Saint John can get away with after all .
DHS satellite spy program going forward despite objections Nick Juliano
Published : Thursday October 2 , 2008
Print This Email This ' Ridiculous ' to think program does n't violate Posse Comitatus , ACLU lobbyist tells Raw The Department of Homeland Security has been given the money it needs to begin turning international spy satellites within the country 's borders , despite lingering fears about the program 's lack of focus and the potential for it to infringe upon Americans ' civil liberties .
After more than a year of delay , Congress quietly authorized DHS to begin sharing data gathered by military satellites with civilian and law enforcement agencies .
A $ 634 billion spending bill signed into law earlier this week provides funds for DHS to establish the satellite surveillance program , known as the National Applications Office , without addressing the myriad concerns about NAO privacy and civil liberties protections that had been delaying its implementation .
Supporters of the program claim , according to the Wall Street Journal , that its scope will be limited to " emergency response and scientific needs , " but civil liberties advocates and some members of Congress fear the door has been open for the highly classified satellite surveillance program to shift into high gear .
" I 'm kinda shocked it got through , " Tim Sparapani , an American Civil Liberties Union lobbyist , told Raw Story , saying the spending bill language authorizing the NAO is not " strong enough to forbid what we would want to see forbidden . "
Essentially , the bill only requires the Homeland Security Secretary to assure lawmakers that NAO programs comply with exisiting laws .
Congress also has required the DHS Inspector General to provide quarterly classified reports on how much information has been collected by the domestic satellite surveillance , although the bill required those reports be made to the House and Senate Appropriations Committees , not the Homeland Security Committees that are traditionally in charge of DHS oversight .
House Homeland Security Committee members recommended the program be put on hold a year ago , when they requested documents outlining its legal framework and privacy protections .
Those reports still have not been handed over , and committee members are not happy at the apparent subversion they suffered by Appropriations Committee members .
" It would appear they have not been satisfied in their demands , " Sparapani said of the Homeland Security Committee members who have objected to the satellite surveillance .
Rep. Jane Harman , who has compared the Bush administration 's efforts to expand the use of spy satellites to its warrantless wiretapping program , has been one of the key members attempting to block implementation of the program until all these questions are answered .
" Having learned my lesson , " she told the Journal , " I do n't want to go there again unless and until the legal framework for the entire program is entirely spelled out . "
Lawmakers also have seen a 60 - page report from the Government Accountability Office , on the condition they not release the report publicly .
Sources described its contents for the Journal 's Siobhan Gorman , who reports that GAO found that DHS " lacks assurance that NAO operations will comply with applicable laws and privacy and civil liberties standards . "
The report cites gaps in privacy safeguards .
The department , it found , lacks controls to prevent improper use of domestic - intelligence data by other agencies and provided insufficient assurance that requests for classified information will be fully reviewed to ensure it can be legally provided .
A DHS official told Gorman the department worked hard to include privacy protection and a spokeswoman justified the satellite surveillance 's legality because GAO did not specifically say it violates any current laws .
That justification misses the point , Sparapani says , because GAO simply answers questions posed by Congress , and since its latest report has not been made public , no one outside of the government knows what those questions are .
Besides , he says , it 's not GAO 's job to determine whether programs are legal or not .
" That 's like asking the FDA to talk about Internet communications , " he says .
Raw Story has left a message with DHS seeking further comment .
There are further concerns about whether the surveillance program would violate Posse Comitatus , which prohibits the military from participating in domestic law enforcement activities .
It 's " ridiculous " to think that 's not what would be happening under this program , Sparapani says .
The ACLU is examining all its options in trying to prevent implementation of this program , which has dramatic potential to violate citizens rights , he says , but filing a lawsuit against DHS may be untenable because of the classified nature of the activities and the difficulty in being able to demonstrate any particular defendant was directly harmed .
Mostly , the ACLU will continue to push Congress and encouraging efforts of lawmakers like Harman and Homeland Security Chairman Bennie Thompson to stop the program .
" The Homeland Security Committee has the right instinct , " Sparapani says .
" It smells a rotten fish , and the only thing you can do with a rotten fish is throw it out in the trash . "

Mr. Speaker :
For the last two years I 've struggled with the issue of whether the House should impeach a sitting President .
Next to declaring war , impeachment is the gravest matter the House of Representatives must consider .
I fully understand the gut - wrenching consequences such a national debate could precipitate .
Yet , there is one fact we cannot overlook or escape : American cannot regain its moral leadership in the world if America cannot hold its leaders accountable for their actions at home .
The allegations that would warrant impeachment keep growing .
They have been illuminated in recent books including The Way of the World by Ron Suskind , the book by Vincent Bugliosi , and the new book by Bob Woodward , The War Within .
Over five years ago , I tried to place asterisks in the Congressional Record next to the statements about Iraq the President made to Congress .
I was attacked for saying the President would mislead us into the war , but the American people ultimately learned the truth .
There seems to be no end to the allegations and we have a responsibility to investigate their authenticity .
That 's why I 'm signing onto a resolution to consider impeachment of the President .
Without accountability , a democracy will fail .
I yield back .

The Robo - Flex , as he calls the device , is attracting attention because it solves the classic problem for ball joints — they swivel easily , but holding one in a set position requires constant force , the way your muscles must stay flexed to extend your arm .
Doing so for robotic arms usually requires lots of energy and several bulky joints to hold weight at different angles .
Merlo 's solution was to cover a small titanium ball with nubs .
The ball rolls smoothly in a socket lined with stainless - steel pins .
Extend the pins , and they interlock with the nubs to prevent the ball from moving .
Built into a prosthetic wrist , the joint requires no energy to stay locked and can support a 500 - pound load .
Not bad for an afternoon in the backyard .
New findings indicate HIV / AIDS pandemic began around 1900 , earlier than previously thought
New research indicates that the most pervasive global strain of HIV began spreading among humans between 1884 and 1924 , not during the 1930s , as previously reported .
The earlier period of origin coincides with the establishment of urban centers in the west - central African region where the epidemic of this particular HIV strain — HIV - 1 group M—emerged .
This suggests that urbanization and associated high - risk behaviors set the stage for the HIV / AIDS pandemic .
The research , led by Michael Worobey , D. Phil. , of the University of Arizona in Tucson , was co-sponsored by the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases ( NIAID ) , part of the National Institutes of Health .
To reach this earlier estimation of the origin of HIV , a team of scientists from four continents screened multiple tissue samples and uncovered the world 's second - oldest genetic sequence of HIV - 1 group M , which dates from 1960 .
The scientists then used it along with dozens of other previously known HIV - 1 genetic sequences to construct a range of plausible family trees for this viral strain .
The lengths of the tree branches represent the periods of time when the virus genetically diverged from its ancestors .
The timing and number of these genetic mutations enabled the scientists to calibrate the probable range of rates at which the trees have grown — that is , the probable rates of evolution of HIV - 1 group M. Based on this range of rates , the scientists projected back in time to the period when the trees most likely took root : around the turn of the 20th century .
This marks the probable time of origin of HIV - 1 group M , according to the researchers .
Using newly developed techniques , the scientists recovered the 48 - year - old HIV gene fragments from a wax - embedded lymph - node tissue biopsy from a woman in Kinshasa in the Democratic Republic of the Congo .
The oldest known HIV - 1 group M genetic sequence comes from a 1959 blood sample from a man also from Kinshasa .
A comparison of the same genetic region in the 1959 virus and the 1960 virus provided additional evidence that their common ancestor existed around 1900 .
The comparison revealed that the amount of genetic divergence between these two HIV sequences took more than 40 years to evolve .
Pittsburgh law enforcement sources tell TMZ they have serious questions about the authenticity of the alleged victim who says she had her face cut by a politically - motivated attacker .
We 're told there are several things about the alleged attack that do n't add up .
A Pittsburgh PD official says they are conducting a " thorough investigation " and have not determined if the alleged attack is real or a hoax .
But we 're told there is definitely a level of skepticism .
As we reported , the alleged victim claims she went to an ATM and when she turned around , a large dark - skinned man took the money she withdrew .
She says when he noticed she had a McCain / Palin bumper sticker on her car , he became enraged , knocked her down and cut a " B " in her face .
We 're told the woman refused medical assistance at the scene and said she would go to the hospital the next day .
Firefox with the Greasemonkey extension : Not since Gmail saw its interface overhaul last October has a scripter embedded Google Calendar and Reader into Gmail easily — until now .
Two new user scripts integrate both Google Calendar and Google Reader onto the same screen as your email inbox .
Here 's what it looks like .
Click on the thumbnail to see a full screen of both GCal and GReader below my list of draft email messages .

There are two drawbacks to these scripts : first , if you 've got a full inbox ( which most of us do ) , you have to scroll down to see your calendar and feeds .
( This is unlike the Gmail 1.0 versions for Calendar and Reader , which included a folder list link which loaded the cal and reader into the area where the inbox lives ) .
Second , they do n't work with Google Apps accounts — just vanilla Gmail .
While your inbox does n't collapse , the embedded Reader and Cal modules do .
Here 's a a shot of Reader collapsed so you can see the calendar .

You can also install the accompanying GCal / GReader - Header Removal in IFrames user script , which hides Cal and Reader top frames to save real estate .
If you want to embed webapps other than Reader and Gcal , there 's also the Gmail Addons script , which can put any web page into Gmail with a little know - how .
However , for just Reader and Gcal , these do a nicer - looking job .
All three user scripts are free downloads and work with Firefox and the Greasemonkey extension .

A New ( Fighter ) Jet for Google ’s Founders ? from the New York Times reports Google has added a new jet to their fleet of Boeings .
The new Jet is actually a fighter jet , commonly known as an Alpha Jet .
This jet has rights to land at Moffett Field , like the others .
NASA told the NY Times that this jet will be outfitted with “ scientific instruments for NASA missions , including instruments that the other planes could not carry . ”
Matt Furman , a Google spokesman , told the NY Times , “ because of the type of aircraft we are talking about , NASA now has the ability to do even more than they could before . ”

Apple 's ( AAPL ) Sept. quarter iPhone sales -- 6.9 million -- were very impressive .
But if Steve Jobs wants to catch the likes of no .
2 Samsung -- 51.8 million phones last quarter -- he 's going to have to start selling iPhones for less than $ 199 .
What pricing strategy makes the most sense ?
An iPod - like family of iPhones , starting at , say , $ 99 , and going up to $ 299 .
How will Apple get there ?
We think the company will lower the price of the current iPhones by $ 100 each by the middle of next year .
We also think they 'll introduce a new premium model at $ 299 with more color choices -- pink , blue , purple , green , etc. ; at least 32 gigabytes of storage ; and potentially more features .
This idea is n't new , of course .
Piper Jaffray analyst Gene Munster has been talking about a family of iPhones for months -- it 's baked into his forecast of 45 million iPhones shipped in 2009 -- and he reiterated his thoughts this week : " Apple could lower the price by removing features like 3G and GPS , and alternatively could make a premium [ phone ] with a sleeker design or higher - end materials . "
This makes sense , but we do not think Apple will accomplish this by removing features like 3G or GPS .
Why not ?
Because they 're not very expensive components , especially relative to their utility .
When Munster asked Jobs about his " big picture " roadmap for the iPhone on the Apple earnings call , Jobs said : " Well , I think we have to be the best and I think we have to not leave a price umbrella underneath us ... "
An iPhone without 3G or GPS would not be " the best . "
It would be a two - year - old phone , like Apple 's first iPhone .
The iPhone 's 3G network access , for example , provides more than just a faster Internet connection -- it lets you get a phone call when you 're using the Internet , which the old iPhone did n't .
Just as important , it allows AT&T to charge an extra $ 10 a month for Internet access , which is key to their willingness to subsidize phones by several hundred dollars up front .
More generally , we do n't think Apple would ever sell a less sophisticated phone than today 's iPhone , eliminating features like the big , multi - touch screen , large - capacity hard drive , mobile Internet access , or access to Apple 's App Store for an " iPhone nano . "
Those just would n't be iPhones -- they 'd be disappointments .
So the only option would be to cut prices on the current iPhone and keep it as a base model .
The good news :
That might not hurt Apple 's financial performance as much as previously thought .
Citi's Richard Gardner estimates that Q3 iPhone average sales prices were $ 50 - $ 75 higher than he previously expected , and margins " several percentage points above our previous estimate . "
This suggests that , with greater scale , Apple could afford to cut its current iPhone prices by $ 100 , sell a lot more phones , and still make impressive profit margins ( volume will help , as will software sales from the increased number of units ) .
One caveat : Cutting the price of the iPhone wo n't reduce the iPhone 's high monthly service bill -- $ 70 / month mininum in the U.S. , which is about 40 % more than what people spend , on average , for cellphone service .
Note that T - Mobile is charging $ 25 / month -- $ 5 less -- for Internet service on its Google - powered G1 phone .
This difference is probably not enough to stop someone from buying an iPhone , but it 's still worth keeping an eye on as iPhone competitors improve .
( Watch what Verizon Wireless charges per month for RIM ( RIMM ) BlackBerry Storm service , for example ) .
Meanwhile , we do n't see carriers budging on smartphone subscription fees much , especially the ones with exclusive deals to distribute the iPhone .
So service cost will continue to limit iPhone sales no matter how much the devices cost .

Just make sure that your device can run it so there wo n’t be any hassle in the future .
It would be nice to consider that before downloading it as it might slow down your device or worst , it might corrupt your device to the point that it ca n’t be use anymore .
GogoAnime Vs KissAnime on SimilarWeb
These two are some of the best in the industry and honestly , I have been using both .
While most of the anime are available in both sites , there are some anime that are n’t available in one site .
This holds true on other sites similar to the two .
According to SimilarWeb , GogoAnime has a better audience reach in the last six months than its rival .
The total visits for GogoAnime is 71.28 million while the other one only has 29.35 million .
Visits for GogoAnime has a duration of 13:04 minutes while the other has 15:48 minutes .
Most of the users are coming from countries such as United States , United Kingdom , India , Malaysia , Philippines and 249 other countries .
Based on Google Trends
According to this site , it is the other way around as KissAnime has a better reach than its rival .
Then again , we should know that it was based on the last 1 year reached while the other stats was based on the last 6 months .
Both sites are have been trusted and used by some of the sites ’ owner to know about the audience reach of their sites .

Osmium tetroxide ( OsO 4 )
Molecule of the Month - May 2004
Also available : Chime Enhanced , VRML and JMol versions .
Osmium tetroxide ( right ) is probably the best - known compound of Osmium , which can easily be found , as it is just two places below Iron in the Periodic Table .
Osmium tetroxide is inextricably linked to the discovery and subsequent purification of Osmium .
Osmium
Osmium is a scarce metal found in only 0.005 ppm of the Earth 's crust .
Tennant discovered Osmium in 1803 in the residues left behind when crude Platinum and other precious metals had been dissolved in aqua regia ( c.HNO 3 / c.HCl ) .
It is named from the Greek word for odour ( osme ) .
Osmium is also found , often with Ru and Ir , in the anode sludges produced during the electrolysis of Nickel ( II ) solutions .
Osmium has an exceptional density of 22.57 g cm - 3 and a very high m.p. of 3045°C .
Flow diagram showing the extraction of osmium via OsO 4
Osmium tetroxide
Osmium tetroxide , also known as osmium ( VIII ) oxide , formula OsO 4 , is an example of the highest oxidation achieved by a transition element .
Like methane ( CH 4 ) , osmium tetroxide has a tetrahedral geometry with the O - Os - O bond angle (s ) approximating 109.5° .
It is an extremely toxic crystalline solid with a low m.p = 40 °C and bp = 130°C .
The powerful combination of high toxicity and high volatility ( easily evaporates ) makes osmium tetroxide dangerous if not stored or handled correctly .
Recent media exposure suggested its use as a ' billionaires ' chemical weapon .
This Molecule of the Month article is written to show how important this reagent is , to the chemical community , and how it was party to the awarding the Nobel Prize in Chemistry in 2001 to K. Barry Sharpless .
Osmium tetroxide is probably colourless ( Butler and Harrod , Inorganic Chemistry : Principles and Applications , p.343 ) but is sometimes described as yellow ( see photo above ) .
I suggest this discrepancy lies with the presence of the impurity OsO 2 , which is yellow - brown in colour ( Cotton and Wilkinson , Advanced Inorganic Chemistry , p.1002 ) .
It is very soluble in CCl 4 ( carbon tetrachloride = tetrachloromethane ) and moderately soluble in water .
OsO 4 has a characteristic ozone - like odour .
The smell is recognisable as the ' fresh ' smell you get by old photocopiers , near someone welding , or to be sniffed at on a sunny summers day in a heavily congested city .
Should you be close to a lightning strike you will smell ozone , and this is far more likely than being close to a terrorist atrocity .
Osmium tetroxide is particularly hazardous to the eyes as it is readily reduced by living tissue to give a black oxide and or the metal .
For this reason it finds itself an important use as a Biological Stain when in dilute aqueous solutions .
Specialized use in Organic Chemistry
OsO 4 is a convenient reagent for the same side ( syn ) addition of two OH groups across a carbon - carbon double bond .
Osmium tetroxide was first given this use back in 1936 by Criegee and a good source of information on this powerful oxidizing agent is to be found in Schroder , Chem . Rev. 80 , 187-213 ( 1980 ) .
This is a rather slow addition but has the distinct advantage of being almost quantitative , an important consideration when performing multi-step syntheses of natural products .
A more familiar reagent that also adds two OH groups across a double bond is alkaline KMnO 4 .
This is a reaction , which used to be taught at A - level and perhaps more interesting than the often - quoted ' decolourises bromine water ' test for unsaturation .
The high cost of osmium tetroxide does not preclude its use by perennially under funded chemical research groups .
Fortunately , the same reaction can be achieved catalytically .
Either H 2 O 2 with OsO 4 ( Milas & Sussman , J. Am. Chem. Soc. , 58 , 1302 ( 1936 ) or N- methylmorpholine - N-oxide with OsO 4 ( VanRheenan , Kelly and Cha , Tet. Lett , 1973 ( 1976 ) .
I also made use of this reagent during my own research with Professor Pettit , J. Chem .
Soc. Chem. Commun .
1994 , 2725 - 6 .
Preparation of Osmium Tetroxide
Addition of oxygen ( oxidation ) is possible by burning the metal at 800°C .
Os + 2 O 2 OsO 4
An alternative preparation is the oxidation of osmium salts with c.HNO 3 .
This is a widely used method to recover osmium via the volatile osmium tetroxide .
Reactions
OsO 4 is a more powerful oxidizing agent than the halogens .
It oxidizes the halides ( Cl - ( aq ) , Br -( aq ) , I - ( aq ) ) to their respective halogens .
One easy way to recognise oxidations is an increase in oxidation number ( from 1 - of the halides to 0 for the elemental halogens ) .
2 Cl- ( aq ) Cl 2
OsO 4 + 2 OH - ( aq ) [ OsO 4 ( OH ) 2]2- [ deep red ]
The above reaction is interesting for a number of reasons , i.e. surprising colour change , osmium expands its coordination sphere to six , the product is diamagnetic and the OH groups are trans ( opposite each other ) .
Conclusion
Osmium tetroxide is a valuable tool in the research of both biologists and chemists , and needs to remain so .
Chemists need to protect their interests , perhaps more overtly in future , and ensure that they continue with their important work against the tide of negative publicity concerning the misuse of chemicals by non-chemists .

I also think there are two distinct media problems .
One is the media that does n't really dig into what they 're being told by the status quo .
The other is the media that actually propagandizes for the status quo .
I think these two problems should be examined separately .
It 's too convenient for members of the non-digging , complacent media to think they 're fine , because they 're not lying , like Fox " news " is .
Take reporting of McCain , for example .
There 's a huge difference between the reporting of his campaign that overlooks his gaffes , his misstatements , as not being newsworthy .
They 're trying to be " nice " to the guy , because they apparently like him .
And then there 's the outright lying about his positions that we can frequently see on Fox .
The media in the first camp believe they 're OK , because they 're not doing what the second camp is doing .
The first group is just not doing their job , while the second is engaging in propaganda .
Anyway , I agree with you here .
And it 's too ingrained , with incompetents judging themselves according to their own poor standards .
Informing our citizens about events that are important to us and to the world is too closely linked to maintaining an audience , which is in turn too linked to entertainment instead of informing .
And of course the money stream that 's supporting the whole sorry mess is coming from the status quo .

It 's time for a rating system for the news --- like the sanitation ratings for restaurants --- if the news is clean , factual , fact - checked , reported by a reporter & agency that have no conflict of interest with the report , if the advertisers have no conflict of interest , then it should be referred to as " A " Rated News .
It seems that all of the networks these days would be hovering in the " F " Rated category .

... they'll say thing condescendingly like , well of course we could have done things better , we always want to strive for perfection , but on the whole I think we did a good job .
So without that recognition that there 's a problem even , which is non-existent , that what explains their lack of self - reflection .
Sounds like some corporate media people ( are they no longer journalists ? ) need an intervention .
I can picture it now on A&E , and boy I 'd watch that reality show !
Now , just where would we send them for corporate detox and treatment ?
Ideas anyone ?
I guess we 'd call them recovering corporate journalists after completing treatment .

To me a drive for oligarchy is the best fit as a description of the situation and the actions of the msm .
Excuse the obvious , but the Constitution is clear :
it was written as a document to guide our national processb ... to form a more perfect Union , establish Justice , insure domestic tranquility , provide for the common defense , promote the general Welfare , and secure the benefits of Liberty to ourselves and our Posterity ...
The regressives in office have tried to divide us on racial and class lines , have made a mockery of justice jailing more of us , proportionally , than any other nation , left one of our greatest cities to die by the inches in a storm , nearly destroyed our defense and given aid and comfort to an armed opposition , allowed polluters to overwhelm our air , water and food systems --- all aimed at recreating us as a subservient population dependent on the whim of a power class for health care , education ... no longer a free people caring for one another working together .
The current establishment has violated every provision put in place in the Constitution at the founding - initiation of an illegal and immoral war , abrogation of habeas corpus [ so important that the founders wrote it into the Constitution BEFORE the Bill of Rights Amendments were passed ] , violation of treaties , failure to bring impeachment ...
For brevity I 'll forbear going through the list of their tramplings on the Bill of Rights - though I think we should underline the absolute failure of the press with respect to the First Amendment .
The ' lords ' of msm failed utterly to exercise their rights , their responsibilities to bring to the citizens a valid account of these matters .
In my book this borders on treason .

I think that if Obama is elected president , then the MSM reporters will awaken from their collective coma and report that they have been remiss in not doing their job well enough .
They will start investigating again in a big way .
Everything that Obama does or says will be analyzed four ways from Sunday .
That does n't mean that they as a group will really look at the rethugs , they will just focus on Obama .
If mccain steals the election , the MSM will simply roll over and continue eating the b-b-q .

You took the words right out of my mouth , Michael .
The corrupt and seemingly incompetent mainstream news media are all owned by large corporations whose heads and major shareholders undoubtedly have major investments in our country 's military industrial complex as well .
They all have a decided right - wing and corporate - interest bias and have subtle and sometimes not so subtle ways of communicating that to the subordinate journalists who work for them and are dependent on their big bosses to pay the rent or mortgage and put food on the table .
They can't rock the boat and be independent and truthful in their reportage or they risk becoming suddenly homeless and begging on the streets .
A major daily newspaper in Honolulu has already demonstrated its willingness to be ruthless by laying off a large number of staff recently after failing to come to terms on a new labor contract .
It is a common pattern everywhere .
I hope that one of the first things that a presumed Obama presidency will do is set about taking apart these big media monopolies in selected markets of our country and open up the competition for smaller and more locally owned and controlled companies .
Howard Dean explicitly talked about doing that four years ago - a big shake - up to the " powers that be . "
We citizens need to agitate aggressively to take back both our government and the media from the hands of the few privileged and powerful people in this country , presently the Big Oil and defense corporate interests .

I agree watchdog media has ceased .
But here 's a possible reason .
Yesterday on the internet was a report about Hershey chocolate .
It seems that lesser ingredients now make up Hershey products .
I think such a story is national news , yet the mainstream media never utter a word about degraded hershey products .
Why ?
Because if the national news reported the truth , Hershey chocolate would stop selling and the company would suffer .
I guess the media today prefers our companies over the bare truth .
And i guess our vaunted companies are slowly strangling their products until nobody much perfers the crap .

lso , one John McCain , who had a sick wife and the ethics of a Gingrich , took a mistress who was really cute - and also the daughter of an important mob figure , who was given the Budweiser distributorship by Kemper Marley , the CAPO of Phoenix , as a reward for taking the fall for him in some crooked dealings .
Later on , he divorced the sick wife , and Ronald Reagan was so disgusted that he broke off a long - term friendsip , but McCain married a hundred million dollars anyway .
So , one of the candidates for President is definitely influenced by the Syndicate - but who is to say BOTH of them are not ?
Obama 's kowtowing to AIPAC made me wonder - I do n't KNOW that AIPAC and ADL are mob-controlled , but Lansky had a lot of influence in Israel .
HOWEVER ; the influence of organized crime on American Politics is a lot bigger than anyone knows or is willing to say .
Remember Frank Fitzsimmons in the Nixon circle ?
The case of Don Bolles indicates just why investigative reporting is dead and rotting in this Nation ; frankly , the reporters who could expose what 's happening like to stay alive .
So the FACT that we are in danger of turning the Country over to Organized Crime in January is not even mentioned !
There is some light at the end of the tunnel - if you Google " McCain + Organized Crime " you 'll get a lot of interesting reading - but it's not investigative journalism - it 's jus History !
( And no - one pays much attention - if they did , McCain could not even be a candidate !

Instead of cover things fairly , the last 7 1/ 2 years have been an effort to make

No regard for the soldiers fighting the war .
No regard for anyting but their blind hatred for a sitting president .

OMFG , it always amazes me when I see such blind ignorance as " Smithy " here .
First off I could absolutely not care less about what affair Edwards had , only a complete idiot would put something so trivial and totally meaningless above what is happening to this country right now .
So what , he lied about something that is none of my damn business and is something he actually SHOULD be lying about .
Meanwhile we have a TREASONOUS WAR CRIMINAL that blatantly stole 2 elections and has lied continuously to take the country into a occupation of aggression against a country that did nothing to us what so ever costing us all trillions of taxpayer $ $ .
Bush has lied to take the country into a WAR killing over 1 MILLION innocent Iraqi's , well over 4000 US soldiers , wounding 10's of 1000 's many for life , and infecting many 10's of 1000s with Depleted Uranium that is going to slowly kill them the next 5 - 10 years .
Attacked this country in a false flag attack murdering over 3000 American citizens in order to use it for political advantage against the many simple minded that sadly inhabit this country .
and that is just the tip of the Bushberg .

MSM is suffering from cost - effective , obsessive - compulsive disorder - a medical excuse for not hiring more reporters , or sensationalizing more interesting , or earth - shaking news .
Like all other corporations , their business is making money first , delivering " product " second .
The truth is , tired , boring people wearing rose - colored - glasses watch MSM news anymore .
Intelligent people forced to watch MSM 's monotony : OJ , Anna Marie , Stacey , and power - driven talking TV heads : over and over and over and over and over .... would be banging their heads against the wall in a day .
For every O.J. Simpson and Stacey Peterson , there were hundreds of similar incidents that nobody heard about , because reporting some of those stories would have jeopardized the high salaries for execs .
And they left everybody hanging with the Chandra Levy case and the answer 's still " out there , " but it will be " just another one of those mysteries " ( a famous Porter Goss line ) thirty years from now , like JFK .
The blogosphere is where committed , honest , daring people do things for love and not corporate greed .
Besides uncovering atrocities the MSM refuses to recognize , can't repair or keep hidden , these bloggers have earned the right to be paranoid .
So what 's wrong with that ?
Would n't it be interesting to do a " blogger study " on MSM , and their structuring , to understand how much manpower it employs to report inferior news and how much advertisers pay for it ?

... Phil said on 8/11/2008 @ 12:52 am PT ...
( Another wonderful super rant by Phil )
I got a slightly different take .
There 's Republicans and Democrats and many folks have said they are the same .
I agree with em .
It 's ONE party .
The FASCIST party .
Republican 's might be oath breaking by not following the US Constitution , yet the Democrats oath break by not holding them accountable , and enabling them .
Why would this be any different in the media ?
It 's CORPORATE media , both push fascist agenda .
Now the only way your going to fix this is by going through the FCC and getting their license renewal denied .
That 's going to take citizens hitting their public file and whining ( cough I mean complaining ) all the time .
But citizens rarely do that except to ask stupid ass questions like , " hey where can I get a copy of Reverend Bla Bla 's show on the date and time of bla bla bla . "
These networks are so powerful with so much money and resources , and yet they refuse to put their public file online .
They do n't want that shit , cause it ain't in their profit interest .
Remember : Fascism , wants to make a profit , not help people .
Corporate media is fascist media , there 's no right - wing or left - wing .
For how it got like this , I 'd look at what controls the FCC .
So we 're back to square one , in turning this situation around .
We must have journalistic reporting on election fraud , so we can get people in office that will fix the integrity of elections , the US Constitution , and all the other crap , and we can't do that cause the elections are rigged and no journalist is allowed to report it on corporate ( re : fascist ) media .
All I know about bills is that they start from Congress , since the Congress ain't taking our calls , I do n't see how that 's going to happen .
The web alone wo n't fix this .
Why the hell do you think the telcos are incrementally screwing everything up , spying , reading our shit , data basing everything , and attacking everything from data caps ( some people like to call this bandwidth , though data is the proper term . ) to packet manipulation ( p2 p snafu , anybody watch p2 p tv ?
there goes that ..) to service port removal , to TOS / AUP that is pure bullshit .
Every once in awhile the fascists slip us a sugar pill , we think , " oh great that is so cool that you finally get it . "
Then when our backs are turned they trip over their fucking shoelaces and pass Patriot Act , Fisa and other fucked up shit .
There 's more tripping and excuses for fucking up their oath of office when it 's most important .
So we really need someone well connected to the Congress , that can get a fucking bill in that forces the fcc and the corporate fascists to change .
An online publicly accessible public file would be a good start , in my opinion .
Then somehow we must make it so the fcc holds the lil fascists accountable when their public file looks like dogshit .
I am going out on a limb here , and this may be shocking to you but , I am telling you right now ...
The corporate fascist media is a " dangerous cult . "
You probably wonder how the fuck does idiot Phil come up with that fucking horseshit -- Jesus tits ?
I 'll tell you how , it 's something I learned way back in the 80's there was a document I came across called the " cult evaluation chart " by Bonewits .
It 's now become the The Advanced Bonewits ' Cult Danger Evaluation Frame and you can go read the whole fucking thing right there , and stick your favorite fascist network channel into each of the fucking fields and give it a score , then add it all up .
But I will save you the trouble and repeat , echo and reiterate , " The Corporate Media is a Dangerous Fucking Cult . "
Okay , have a nice day now ...

Fighters in black uniforms with American Flags on their arms were spotted in S. Osettia attacking civilians along side the Georgian forces .
Two bodies discovered at the scene were of black soldiers , assumed to be American .
Russia is kicking Georgia ’s ass in response to this unprovoked attack .
This Georgia fiasco is reminiscent of the Lebanon fiasco that Israel blundered into .
This was all staged and planned by the USA and their Israeli partners in crime , timed precisely to coincide with the opening of the Olympic Games .
This may have been an attempt to test the will of Russia to respond to another planned US / Israeli aggression , that of the pending attack against Iran .
Putin said in Tehran months ago : " Any attack on Iran will be considered by Russia to be an attack on the national interests of Russia . "

They 've peddled BS too many times and their credibility is shot .

Celebrity journalists want to remain celebrities , and none of them want the fate of Helen Thomas .
If they ask hard questions or dig into the dark underbelly , they will be blacklisted .
Can anyone imagine David Gregory jeopardizing his ability to dance with Karl Rove by asking hard questions ?

Electricity grids must cope with rising demand and complexity in a changing world .
Emma Marris explores the intricacies involved in controlling the power supply .

On a hilltop in the small city of Vancouver , Washington , just across the Columbia river from Portland , Oregon , sits a concrete building owned by the the Bonneville Power Administration ( BPA ) , the federal agency that runs the electricity grid in the Pacific Northwest .
In that building 's basement one can find Albert Orona enthroned behind a bank of monitors , facing a wall - sized map of the region 's power grid .
Orona is a dispatcher , one of the unseen men and women who keep power moving smoothly through the grid .
It is not a job that would even occur to most users .
Electricity is taken for granted : just flip a switch and the light goes on .
But to Orona , contending with a network of almost unfathomable complexity , electricity is anything but a given .
From his basement command post he oversees more than 24,000 kilometres of high - voltage wires channelling power from one nuclear power plant , several coal plants , 31 dams scattered throughout Washington , Oregon , Idaho and Montana , and an ever - increasing number of wind farms .
And that is just the ' bulk transmission grid ' ; the local distribution from substation to customer is handled separately by the utility companies , the people you send your money to each month .
In Orona 's domain , something always needs adjusting .
When a generator goes down for scheduled maintenance , or fails , he and his team will call for other generators to increase their output .
If a disturbance in the grid is imminent , Orona will ' island ' parts of the system to isolate them from power fluctuations that could otherwise cause a blackout .
And if a blackout threatens to spread — well , it is hard to imagine the calmly competent Orona discombobulated .
“ If I was a kid , ” he says , “ I would love to do this for free .
It is a fun job . ”
But in a crisis , he admits , “ there is a certain adrenaline flow ” .
“ If I lose another element , that might lead to cascades that would take out that part of the world . ”
Albert Orona
That adrenaline is flowing through the whole electric - power industry these days .
Demand for electricity is soaring worldwide .
And yet , at least in developed countries such as the United States , a combination of high costs , environmental concerns , and uncertainty over post - Kyoto carbon regulation is making it harder and harder to build new power plants or run new transmission lines .
So the grid is increasingly run on the ragged edge of failure , flirting dangerously with ' unstudied states ' — situations in which , as Orona puts it , “ if I lose another element , that might lead to cascades that would take out that part of the world ” .
The challenges that Orona faces at Bonneville are all too typical of these global issues .
Fortunately for him and for others in his position , research is now being conducted on ways to hold those unstudied states at bay .
New tools include sensors and other ' smart - grid ' technologies that will make the grid better able to manage itself .
They include energy - smart appliances , local wind - and solar - power generators , as well as ' demand - side ' technologies that will help consumers control how much power they draw from the grid .
And , of course , they include measures to get both approaches — smart grids and demand management — working together .
After all , the more that sources of power generation diversify , and the more information that clever appliances send back up the wires , the smarter the grid will have to be to cope with the complexity .
The result could be something completely new .
If today 's grid is Hollywood in the 1930s — with a few big studios piping content for viewers to watch passively in a theatre — tomorrow 's grid will be YouTube , with thousands of smaller players and the line between consumer and supplier considerably blurred .
Mapping the system
One of Orona 's colleagues is on a ladder updating the aqua - tiled wall display with paper status tags .
The board shows the grid like a subway map .
A lit bulb indicates that a plant or substation is offline .
And black dots indicate power plants that can ' black start ' , or begin generating power from scratch without any power flowing in .
Meanwhile , Orona is sipping his soft drink and flipping through different screens on his seven monitors .
Alarms are going off at the rate of about two a minute .
One sounds like a van backing up , another like the wrong answer on a game show .
Some Orona seems to ignore , others cause his head to flick momentarily to one monitor or another .
There are three fundamental facts that ensure Orona 's job is never dull .
First , electricity moves at nearly light speed , so that transmission is essentially instantaneous ; the electric field illuminating your light bulb this second was born in a dam or some other generator this same second .
Second , electricity cannot be stored , except on a very limited scale .
Taken together , these two facts mean that Orona and his counterparts elsewhere have to keep generation almost exactly balanced with demand on a second - to - second basis .
When a baseball stadium flips on the lights in Seattle , the Grand Coulee Dam in eastern Washington has to route a bit more water to its turbines .
Wind power is now an important electricity source .
K. R. SVENSSON / SPL
Except that it is n't that simple — which is the third fundamental fact : the grid is extraordinarily complex .
The power flowing through the stadium lights cannot actually be traced back to a single generator ; it comes from the common flow of energy fed by all the generators .
( Think of dipping a bucket into a reservoir fed by many rivers : it pulls up water from all of them . )
So the grid has to be managed as an integrated whole .
Yet the grid is also a hotchpotch : in much of the world it has been ' integrated ' over the decades by patching together small , local grids as the opportunities arose .
And the energy pulsing through that hotchpotch can be downright willful .
If a transmission line goes dead , the electricity will spontaneously reroute itself along any other path it can find .
So if there are n't a lot of redundancies in the system — as often happens these days — and if the extra power moves to other lines that are already near capacity , those lines might also overload and shut down .
This can lead to still more shutdowns , in an ever - increasing chain reaction that becomes a region - wide blackout .
Or maybe not .
Anticipating every conceivable sequence of failures is all but impossible in a system this complex .
That 's why Orona talks about unstudied states .
Even the grid 's normal operation is difficult to predict .
All the current computer simulations are lousy , says Bonneville modeller Scott Simons , despite ongoing efforts to improve them .
“ We are getting pretty good for one hour from now , not so good for two hours , ” he says .
“ Three hours is pretty bad . ”
In short , humanity has come close to building a machine that is so intricate that it can't be comprehended .
But Orona and his fellow power dispatchers have to manage that machine anyway ; modern society depends on it .
Given the increasing complexity of the grid , the most immediate priority is to give the dispatchers an upgrade in the ' situational awareness ' department .
Situational awareness , a favourite phrase of grid managers , means ' knowing what is happening ' .
Bonneville is already working to modernize all those displays and alarms .
For example , since May , when the visit described in this article took place , the aqua - tiled wall display has been replaced with an electronically updatable digital version .
Efforts are also under way to improve the user interface so that Orona can get the same data about the grid on fewer monitors .
Web of information
Out in the field , next - generation sensors will soon be feeding Orona better data .
New ' syncrophasor ' units , for example , use the precision of the clocks on Global Positioning System satellites to compare two frequency measurements taken in different parts of the grid at the exact same time .
This allows them to hunt for sudden changes that hint that the grid is under a lot of stress , or that something major has gone out and the rest of the grid is shifting accordingly .
Compared with the grid 's older mix of analogue and digital sensors , says Carl Imhoff , an engineer at the Pacific Northwest National Laboratory in Richland , Washington , “ phasor networks sample the grid 30 times a second instead of once every 6 seconds ” .
Meanwhile , improvements in real - time simulations of the grid are helping dispatchers to make better use of that information .
Simons is working on one such computer model that will provide operators with the most economical mix of generation to meet demand at any given moment .
The cheapest power on the grid is n't always the best deal , because power leaks out of the lines at a rate that depends on distance and wire type .
According to Simons , the model even takes into account whether certain efficiency gains are too puny to be worth a dispatcher 's time to make the requisite phone call .
“ If we called Grand Coulee Dam and said ' tell you what , move your generation up two megawatts ' [ about 0.03 % of the dam 's total capacity of 6.8 gigawatts ] the laughter would deafen you , ” says Simons .

Still , despite the computer programs , and the efforts to reduce the cognitive load , Orona 's chief tool in managing the grid continues to be a red telephone of the direct - line - to - the - Kremlin variety .
When there is a problem , or even the hint of a potential problem , Orona gets on the red phone and , for example , asks another utility to make an adjustment .
In the not - too - distant future , however , his part of the grid may very well be able to talk to that part of the grid without human aid .
Indeed , there has been a global resurgence of efforts to move most or all of the management of the grid into the grid itself .
Under its E2.3 - billion ( US$ 3.6 - billion )
Seventh Framework Programme , for example , the European Commission is planning to fund a number of projects in smart energy networks .
And the recent US Energy bill , signed into law on 19 December 2007 , calls for a ' Smart Grid Task Force ' to run up to five demonstration projects focused on smart grids and energy reliability , and calls on the National Institute of Standards and Technology to develop a set of standards that will allow all such smart grids to be interoperable .
The self - managing grid
In some ways the grid is already intelligent .
No human needs to trigger a circuit breaker on an overheated transmission line ; that happens automatically .
“ The grid is always changing , and the way it is designed it is almost self - correcting , ” says Jon Ludwigson , a grid expert at the federal government 's General Accountability Office in Washington DC .
“ If a power line goes out , the grid still flows . ”

To add to this , the controllers are aided by programmed remedial action schemes , also called special protection schemes .
These are rules that will automatically trigger an action when a particular threshold is reached .
Imagine , for example , that a significant transmission line is lost on a congested route over a mountain pass .
To avoid a cascading outage , the reprogrammed routine might automatically cut back on power generation and , to keep things in balance , reduce the load on the grid by shutting off a few power lines downstream of a substation .
A few blocks of one town might go black , but the rest of the towns wo n't even know what a close call they had .
“ We stretch the power lines to the limits , and the remedial action scheme allows us to run it at the limits , ” says Orona .
“ Electricity travels almost at the speed of light , so we have a few milliseconds to take action . ”
Massoud Amin
But in a truly smart grid , the analogous programs would run in processors attached to the various key components of the grid , and would be fed by a rich stream of real - time data flowing in from sensors all over the grid .
In principle , says Massoud Amin , an electrical engineer at the University of Minnesota in Minneapolis , such a smart grid could be not only self - managing , but “ self - healing ” ( see graphic ) .
In his vision , he says , the processors in the future grid will be able to “ localize and anticipate the consequences of disturbances , whether they are natural disturbances , such as lightning or hurricanes , or intentional disturbances ” .
By the time the wind - snapped or sabotaged line hits the ground , the whole grid will have shimmered into a new configuration to stymie disastrous cascades .
“ Electricity travels almost at the speed of light , ” says Amin , “ so we have a few milliseconds to take this action before it becomes widespread . ”
He estimates that such a grid in the United States would take ten years to roll out and cost between $ 10 billion and $ 30 billion a year to install , shouldered by a public–private partnership .
That 's no budget operation but , according to Amin , it would cost just a seventh or an eighth of the current annual cost to society of power interruptions .
Many grids outside the United States are further ahead in the intelligence - raising process , with particularly advanced projects in Italy , Sweden , and in the state of Victoria in Australia .
Enel , Italy 's largest utility company , replaced 30 million old power meters with smart , microprocessor - equipped meters that have made possible new pricing structures that encourage customers to shift their power usage to off - peak hours .
“ The grid is always changing , and it is almost self - correcting . ”
Jon Ludwigson
However , no matter how smart the grid becomes , it will eventually be overwhelmed if demand keeps rising .
So industry planners are also moving to embrace micro-generation and to reduce demand .
“ In the old days we kept the whole thing balanced with one wrench : the supply side , ” says Imhoff .
Being able to tweak the system from the demand side will be a huge improvement ; it will also make the grid that much more complex .
Currently , most consumers suck up electricity in a predictable and mostly unconscious pattern .
In the morning , people turn on lights and radios , use kettles and toasters , adjust thermostats and check e-mails .
Spike number one .
Then people head to work or school , and the electricity dispatchers can have a cup of coffee .
After the midday lull , the pattern reverses .
People drive home , turn on the heat or air conditioning , cook dinner , do the laundry , surf the Internet and watch television .
Spike number two .

But if electricity were to cost a lot more during peak hours , and if people 's appliances could tell them so , perhaps that unconscious pattern would change .
Then again , maybe it would n't be enough .
Until it is tried , all anyone can say for sure is that the usage peaks would be less predictable .
Price fluctuations would ripple because of people 's behaviour and then price signals would race backwards towards buyers and sellers in a highly nonlinear set of feedback loops .
Small home generators might simply cut off the top of peaks of demand — or they might turn the peaks into troughs , by sending extra electricity into the grid .
Suddenly , the game would have a lot more players .
Supply and demand
The first steps towards this future may look familiar and reassuring to consumers .
At the Pacific Northwest National Laboratory ( PNNL ) in Richland , Washington , a decidely normal - looking demonstration kitchen sits in the corner of a lab .
But if the stolid white refrigerator detects a disturbance in the grid — as evidenced by frequency fluctuation — it will shut off for a few seconds to shed load .
Crucially , however , it will not shut off power to the circuit for the little light bulb inside the fridge ; the customer will never notice that the appliance is off .
Likewise , the clothes in the dryer will keep tumbling even though the heat has been momentarily shut off .
Recently , the PNNL tested 150 such dryers in homes in the area .
Consumers did n't notice a thing and said they'd be happy to buy them .
The researchers think that if the whole country has such appliances , 20 % of national demand could be put on hold at any moment .
But that is just the beginning .
The PNNL is also working on dynamic pricing and distributed generation .
Many commercial customers in California already have the option of saving money by running their machinery at night , but PNNL is examining how real - time price fluctuations could be extended to every end user .
In a pilot project on the Olympic Peninsula of Washington state that ran from March 2006 to March 2007 , residential , commercial and municipal customers in this mountainous region could track prices on their computers , with updates every five minutes .
Residential users could set their thermostats , dryers and heaters to respond to certain price points .
Small generators — for example , backup diesel generators for a municipal water - pumping plant — were programmed to kick in when grid power got too expensive .
“ The entire grid and how we interact with it will change . ” Gil Bindewald
In the end , the experiment smoothed out grid congestion and customers saved , on average , 10 % on their electricity bills .
One enthusiastic participant , Jerry Brous , wrote a memo for the project 's final report about paying attention for the first time to how he and his wife Pat use electricity , and discovering just how cold or hot they could tolerate their house and water .
“ It is also great fun , ” Brous wrote , “ to sit at a picnic table at an RV park and jump online through a Wi -Fi connection and tell the water heater and heat pump in our house to wake up and get to work , we are coming home early . ”
Similar projects around the world have generally been received favourably by participants .
If such technology is deployed widely , then in 20 years the average residential consumer might well be much more strategic and conscious about their use of energy .
That prospect becomes even more likely if small household generation with solar panels or other renewables becomes commonplace ; coupled with smart - grid technology in the distribution network as a whole , this would enable neighbourhoods inside a city to ' island ' themselves from the wider grid when there is a disturbance .
Another piece of the puzzle is provided by energy storage .
In Japan , to take just one example , the Tokyo Electrical Power Company has co-sponsored the development of large commercial sodium–sulphur batteries that can hold electricity made in off - peak hours for deployment during peak demand times .
Denmark , which produces more wind power per inhabitant than any other county , is likewise looking into storing off - peak energy in vanadium - based fuel cells .
Of course , none of these developments is going to put Orona and his team out of work anytime soon ; some cognitive leaps are still beyond computers .
“ Sometimes you can have a problem that occurs because you have bad data , ” says Orona .
“ Only the human can say , ' Hey — those are bad data ' . ”

When Bonneville engineer Lawrence Carter was asked how long it would take for a major blackout to develop if all the dispatchers at Ditmer and other operations centres suddenly disappeared , he took a while to answer .
“ Eventually , the system would fault , ” he said at last .
“ It ca n't run itself . ” A high - speed computer , Carter says , would take three years to compute every single fault path in the system .
But a human is smarter .
“ People learn about their paths , ” he says .
“ You may not have to do those 30 million simulations ; you might be able to just say , ' This is going to go next ' . ”
Still , there is no doubt that the future of the grid will involve an ever - expanding cornucopia of new technologies : smart appliances , dynamic pricing , micro-generation , energy storage , built - in protective responses — on and on .
“ No one by themselves is going to help us address all the challenges that we have , ” says Gil Bindewald , acting deputy assistant secretary for research and development at the Department of Energy 's Office of Electricity Delivery and Energy Reliability .
“ You might have underground cables in one place , overheads in another , a plug in hybrid there , a microgrid there .
I think the entire grid and how we interact with it will change .
It is just not the socket in the wall . ”

Update from Washington D.C .
Watch for future alerts related to this news release
July 17 , 2008
( Washington ) - Today House Judiciary Committee Chairman John Conyers , Jr. announced that , on July 25 , the House Committee on the Judiciary will hold a hearing on the Imperial Presidency of George W. Bush and possible legal responses .
“ Over the last seven plus years , there have been numerous credible allegations of serious misconduct by officials in the Bush Administration , ” said Conyers .
“ At the same time , the administration has adopted what many would describe as a radical view of its own powers and authorities .
As Chairman of the Judiciary Committee , I believe it is imperative that we pursue a comprehensive review commensurate to this constitutionally dangerous combination of circumstances .
Next Friday ’s hearings will be an important part of that ongoing effort . ”
The Committee is expected to examine a range of legal and legislative responses to allegations of administration misconduct and their expansion of executive branch power .
Since the beginning of the 110th Congress , the Committee has conducted extensive oversight into allegations of misconduct by the administration , including : ( 1 ) improper politicization of the Justice Department and the U.S. Attorneys offices , including potential misuse of authority with regard to election and voting controversies ; ( 2 ) misuse of executive branch authority and the adoption and implementation of the so - called unitary executive theory , including in the areas of presidential signing statements and regulatory authority ; ( 3 ) misuse of investigatory and detention authority with regard to U.S. citizens and foreign nationals , including questions regarding the legality of the administration ’s surveillance , detention , interrogation , and rendition programs ; ( 4 ) manipulation of intelligence and misuse of war powers , including possible misrepresentations to Congress related thereto ; ( 5 ) improper retaliation against administration critics , including disclosing information concerning CI A operative Valerie Plame , and obstruction of justice related thereto ; and ( 6 ) misuse of authority in denying Congress and the American people the ability to oversee and scrutinize conduct within the administration , including through the use of various asserted privileges and immunities .
The July 25 hearing will be held at 10:00 a.m. in room 2141 of the Rayburn House Office Building .
Additional information , including witness participation , will be announced next week .

Tyler Moore and I are presenting another one of our academic phishing papers today at the Anti-Phishing Working Group ’s Third eCrime Researchers Summit here in Atlanta , Georgia .
The paper “ The consequence of non-cooperation in the fight against phishing ” ( pre-proceedings version here ) goes some way to explaining anomalies we found in our previous analysis of phishing website lifetimes .
The “ take - down ” companies reckon to get phishing websites removed within a few hours , whereas our measurements show that the average lifetimes are a few days .
These “ take - down ” companies are generally specialist offshoots of more general “ brand protection ” companies , and are hired by banks to handle removal of fake phishing websites .
When we examined our data more carefully we found that we were receiving “ feeds ” of phishing website URLs from several different sources — and the “ take - down ” companies that were passing the data to us were not passing the data to each other .
So it often occurs that take - down company A knows about a phishing website targeting a particular bank , but take - down company B is ignorant of its existence .
If it is company B that has the contract for removing sites for that bank then , since they do n’t know the website exists , they take no action and the site stays up .
Since we were receiving data feeds from both company A and company B , we knew the site existed and we measured its lifetime — which is much extended .
In fact , it ’s somewhat of a mystery why it is removed at all !
Our best guess is that reports made directly to ISPs trigger removal .
The paper contains all the details , and gives all the figures to show that website lifetimes are extended by about 5 days when the take - down company is completely unaware of the site .
On other occasions the company learns about the site some time after it is first detected by someone else ; and this extends the lifetimes by an average of 2 days .
Since extended lifetimes equate to more unsuspecting visitors handing over their credentials and having their bank accounts cleaned out , these delays can also be expressed in monetary terms .
Using the rough and ready model we developed last year , we estimate that an extra $ 326 million per annum is currently being put at risk by the lack of data sharing .
This figure is from our analysis of just two companies ’ feeds , and there are several more such companies in this business .
Not surprisingly , our paper suggests that the take - down companies should be sharing their data , so that when they learn about websites attacking banks they do n’t have contracts with , they pass the details on to another company who can start to get the site removed .
We analyse the incentives to make this change ( and the incentives the companies have not to do so ) and contrast the current arrangements with the anti-virus / malware industry — where sample suspect code has been shared since the early 1990s .
In particular , we note that it is the banks who would benefit most from data sharing — and since they are paying the bills , we think that they may well be in a position to force through changes in policy .
To best protect the public , we must hope that this happens soon .

MSN , Yahoo IM and AIM all use clear text in the chat discussions , which means anyone along the path of communication can read what it is you are typing , including your boss if you use chat at work .
Many people , including myself , use Skype as an IM chat client because it has strong encryption built in .
A system admin monitoring the network can still tell you are using Skype , but no one can read what you typed into the chat box .
Until now .
Ebay ’s Chinese partner , Tom Group , has been distributing a version of Skype , with permission , to its Chinese users .
Tom ’s version of Skype has been trojanized by the Chinese communist government to capture certain conversations that contain keywords that the government considers to be subversive .
Those chat sessions , which includes usernames , IP addresses and a record of all phone calls made over Skype , are packaged and sent encrypted to several webservers owned by Tom Group for retrieval by Chicom agents .
Quite simply , this means , if you use Skype and are chatting unknowingly to someone using this Tom - Skype version , and you use a profanity or a banned keyword , the entire chat session gets archived by the Chi-coms , along with the Skype - out phone records of the Tom - Skype user .
With thanks to Steinnon , the details are here at infowar - monitor .
net :
The most damaging information concerns the log files that record call information and the content filter logs that contain full text chat messages .
The call information logs date from August 2007 and contain a record of the IP addresses and usernames of all those that participated in voice calls as well as the username and / or phone number of the recipient of the call .
The content filter logs dating from August 2008 contain similar identifying information as well as the full content of the logged text messages .
These messages contain sensitive information including email addresses , passwords , phone numbers , package tracking numbers and bank card numbers .
As mentioned above , the information is stored encrypted on several webservers at Tom Group .
But the webserver stores the logs in a publicly accessible directory , and politely includes the decryption code on the server so anyone can download the messages and decrypt them .
So not only do the Chicoms know about your chat sessions , lots of hackers and identity thieves probably do too .
Ebay , owner of Skype , should immeditately terminate their partnership with Tom Group for allowing their customers to have their privacy violated and should immediately issue a new version that is incompatible with the Tom Group version of Skype .
U.S. National Labs Probe Abrupt Climate Change
Most people think of climate change as something that occurs gradually , with average temperatures rising two or three degrees Celsius over a century or longer due to forcing mechanisms such as the accumulation of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere from the burning of fossil fuels or widespread changes in land use .
But a 10 degree Celsius rise in global temperatures is not unlikely , the scientists warn .
" There are lots of names for abrupt climate change - nasty surprises , the jokers in the deck , the tipping point , " says William Collins of the Lawrence Berkeley National Lab Earth Sciences Division , who will head the project .
William Collins will head the IMPACT project .

Collins will coordinate the work of scientists from the six labs under the name IMPACTS , which stands for Investigation of the Magnitudes and Probabilities of Abrupt Climate Transitions .
The program will bring together the work of experts in physical , chemical , and biogeochemical climate processes and in computer simulations of the whole Earth system .
" When the national lab participants first met to decide on the most significant potential sources of abrupt climate change in future , the first thing we had to do was define what we meant , " Collins said .
The scientists agreed that abrupt climate change means " a large - scale change that happens more quickly than that brought on by forcing mechanisms - on a scale of years to decades , not centuries - and that persists for a very long time . "
Collins , who heads the Climate Science Department in the Berkeley Lab's Earth Sciences Division , coordinated the development of the most recent version of the Community Climate System Model , one of the leading computer models underpinning the physical science basis of the 2007 climate change assessment conducted by the Intergovernental Panel on Climate Change , which shared the Nobel Peace Prize with former U.S. Vice President Al Gore .
The IMPACTS program will be based on this computer model and will add new capabilities and new diagnostics for processes that could initiate abrupt climate change .
Argonne , Los Alamos , Lawrence Berkeley , Lawrence Livermore , Oak Ridge , and Pacific Northwest are the participating national laboratories .
" IMPACTS is one part of a two - pronged approach to studying abrupt climate change , one based in the universities and the other in the national labs , " says Collins .
" Both elements will share a central web - based portal , with all the participants meeting annually . "
The IMPACTS team will initially focus on four types of abrupt climate change .
Only half joking , Collins refers to these as " The Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse . "
Instability among marine ice sheets , particularly the West Antarctic ice sheet For 40 years earth scientists have worried about what would happen if global warming eventually caused the West Antarctic ice sheet , some 3.8 million cubic kilometers of ice , to break up and slide into the ocean .
Global climate stability depends on the integrity of the West Antarctic ice sheet .
( Photo courtesy NASA ) In January 2006 , in a report commissioned by the UK government , the head of the British Antarctic Survey , Chris Rapley , warned that this huge west Antarctic ice sheet may be starting to disintegrate .
James Hansen , a senior NASA scientist , said the results of Rapley 's study were deeply worrying .
" Once a sheet starts to disintegrate , it can reach a tipping point beyond which break - up is explosively rapid , " he said .
Sea level would rise four to six meters - 13 to 20 feet .
Port facilities worldwide would be submerged ; atolls and island chains would vanish ; parts of Bangladesh , Brazil , Burma , America 's Gulf States , and other low - lying areas would flood ; Venice , New Orleans , and many other cities would sink .
It is now apparent that these events may not be " eventual . "
Abrupt climate change could cause rapid melting and the subsequent rise of sea level not by centimeters but by meters per century .
Positive feedback mechanisms in subarctic forests and arctic ecosystems , leading to rapid methane release or large - scale changes in the surface energy balance More than a third of Earth 's terrestrial organic carbon is concentrated in the ecosystems north of the 45th parallel , much of it in soil , peatland basins , and permafrost .
Positive feedback within ecosystems and among terrestrial ecosystems , climate , and ocean currents could rapidly release much of this stored carbon into the atmosphere .
Positive feedback involving ice - melt has already accelerated the pace of global warming in the far north .
It now seems likely that changes in terrestrial ecosystems , which could occur over only 20 - 30 years , may amplify currently predicted global warming by two or three times , in the Arctic and possibly globally .
Destabilization of methane hydrates - vast deposits of methane gas caged in water ice - particularly in the Arctic Ocean A vast quantity of carbon – possibly more than all the recoverable fossil fuels on Earth – is trapped in frozen methane hydrates under the oceans .
Methane gas molecules are locked inside cages of water ice in a form so concentrated that when the ice melts the gas expands to 164 times its frozen volume .
High pressure and low temperature insure that most deep - water methane hydrate deposits would be stable even with considerable warming of the atmosphere .
But in the Arctic , methane hydrate deposits exist near the edge of the safe temperature - pressure zone ; in these locales , methane release could be abrupt .
The resultant rapid warming would trigger yet more releases of methane : permafrost would melt , the deep sea would become a dead zone , the hole in the Arctic ozone would grow bigger and occur more frequently .
Feedback between biosphere and atmosphere that could lead to megadroughts in North America Ordinary greenhouse warming as forecast by the IPCC will result in warmer and dryer conditions in the subtropics , including Mexico and the southwestern U.S.
More than warming of the air and sea surface are involved .
Sand dunes encroach on a farm during the Dust Bowl of the 1930s .
( Photo courtesy Berkeley Lab ) Storm tracks are likely to shift north , and the jet stream will probably stabilize in a new configuration .
Dried - out soil and hot , dry atmosphere could interact to start abrupt climate change .
If dried - out soil and hot , dry atmosphere interact to trigger abrupt climate change in the Southwest , megadroughts like those that plagued North America a millemium ago could quickly return .
Conditions as severe as the Dust Bowl of the 1930s will return and could persist for decades : a megadrought .
The Dust Bowl of the thirties turned many once productive fields and rangelands into shifting sand dunes .
The past was even worse , with vast sheets of sand on the move all across the High Plains .
One of the great benefits of IMPACTS , in Collins 's view , will be to bring together parts of the climate community whose communication has traditionally been poor .
For scientists concerned with the effects of climate change and those concerned with modeling it , " the working relationship has n't been there , " he says .

Collins says modeling a specific region with a specific set of circumstances in high resolution and making a solid prediction for the next few decades is much tougher than modeling what will happen to the whole planet a century from now .
" Those concerned with the effects of climate change on humans have never asked modelers to do this before , " he says .

Since its earliest days , Google Inc. has largely promoted its search engine and search - advertising products through word of mouth and partnerships .
But in recent months some of the Internet company 's executives have been pushing for the company to overcome its aversion to paid advertising .
That has created some conflict within Google , which is maturing and looking to reinvigorate its slowing growth .
An episode around the Olympics earlier this year illustrates the tensions .
Some Google employees were considering a plan to sell airtime during the NBC broadcast to other advertisers and to take out a spot to promote a Google product as well , according to people familiar with the matter .
The idea did n't get past Google founders Sergey Brin and Larry Page , who felt a splashy television ad would n't fit with Google 's image , these people said .
A Google spokesman declined to comment .
But there are signs that the internal debate is causing Google to shake - off of its reluctance to advertise .
The search giant has recently held discussions with several Madison Avenue agencies , including Wieden +
Kennedy and the boutique firm Taxi New York , about new efforts to promote some products , according to people familiar with the matter .

OTTAWA , Oct 14 ( Reuters ) - Canadian Prime Minister Stephen Harper , the first Western leader to face the electorate since the financial meltdown , won re-election with a significantly stronger minority government on Tuesday .
The Conservatives , who convinced voters they were the best choice to steer Canada through the economic turmoil , will still need opposition support to govern .
It will be Canada ’s third minority government in four years .
Harper ’s Conservatives defeated a Liberal minority government in the January 2006 election .
Initial results showed the Conservatives got 37 percent of the popular vote , just a fraction above the 36.3 percent they got in 2006 .
Vote - splitting on the left meant the party ended up in a much stronger position .
Initial television projections put the Conservatives at 144 of Parliament ’s 308 seats , up from the 127 they held before the election but short of the 155 needed for a majority .
The opposition Liberals were at 74 .
The separatist Bloc Quebecois were up two to 50 seats , the leftist New Democrats were up eight to 38 seats .
Independents took two seats and the Greens had none .
“ We were expecting a minority government .
It looks like it will be a strengthened one .
We ’re going to get right back to work -- that ’s what people expect us to do , ” Health Minister Tony Clement told Global Television .
Harper became only the second Canadian prime minister , after Liberal Lester Pearson in the 1960s , to win a second consecutive minority government .
The Liberals , who have historically governed Canada for longer than any other party , looked set for their worst performance since 1984 .
The rout could trigger an internal battle to replace leader Stephane Dion .
The Conservative leader ran on a modest platform of keeping taxes and spending under control .
The Liberals proposed introducing a carbon tax while cutting income taxes and boosting social spending , and Harper said the Liberal plan would throw Canada into recession .
Dion , a bookish francophone who sometimes makes mistakes in English , found it a hard sell at a time of relatively high energy prices to pitch his carbon tax plan .
“ I think my party failed to deliver a real cogent response to the economic and financial crisis , ” said defeated Liberal legislator Garth Turner .
Dion started to cut into Harper ’s lead during the campaign as he charged the prime minister , a former economist who is also fairly wooden , was not doing enough to prevent financial contagion from spreading into Canada .
But the Conservative lead over the Liberals widened again in parallel with specific action taken to improve Canadian bank liquidity .
Harper had the added benefit that markets and the Canadian dollar rebounded on Election Day .
SPLIT ON THE LEFT
One of Dion ’s problems was that he was competing with two other parties on the left nationally -- the New Democrats and the Greens -- and a fourth party , the separatist Bloc Quebecois in the province of Quebec .
Each party made the pitch it was the best one to deny Harper a second term .
Just as a split on the right guaranteed Liberal rule from 1993 to 2006 , a split on the left now helped the Conservatives .
A Conservative majority looked within reach at times during the campaign , but besides questions on the economy , Harper lost major support in Quebec over cuts to arts funding and plans to give adult sentences to violent youth criminals .
The Conservatives , who began the campaign hoping they might pick up a significant number of Quebec seats , lost one of their 11 seats in the province , according to provisional results .
The careers of both Harper and Dion were on the line .
Dion , who became Liberal leader in 2006 , was re-elected to Parliament but due to his national defeat his party under its rules will have to decide whether to replace him .
The Liberals questioned what the point was of having an election when the result was another minority government .
Harper had said earlier that even if he only got a second minority , he would be in a stronger position than he had been 2 1/ 2 years into the minority mandate he won in the 2006 election since opposition parties would be less likely to topple him for now .
“ This was about trying to reset the clock and move forward , ” Conservative strategist Sandra Buckler told CTV .

If you 've ever bought a spanking new PC game and rushed it home only to find that it runs about as fast as a snail on Prozac even though your machine meets the minimum specs easily , then you 'll surely vote for the Gamer 's Bill of Rights .
The idea comes from PC developers Stardock and Gas Powered games and aims to put an end to the unsatisfactory experience of what they see as dishonest marketing .
10 - step plan
Among the 10 proposals that the ' Bill ' hopes to see adopted by PC game makers are points such as , " Gamers shall have the right to expect that the minimum requirements for a game will mean that the game will adequately play on that computer " and " Gamers shall have the right to return games that do n't work with their computers for a full refund " .
On top of that , the suggestion that – shock !
– companies only release games when they 're actually finished and not bother customers with endless patches to download will ring bells with many .
Console threat
The two developers clearly have an eye on preventing hardcore gamers migrating to the newly powerful consoles , where similar guidelines already exist and are policed by Microsoft , Sony et al .
While the games - playing public is sure to love the ideas in the Bill , the difficult step will be persuading other developers to sign up en masse .
If that happens , then the PC may just have a future as a gaming platform after all .

WAL - MART RAISES STANDARDS WAL - MART RAISES STANDARDS
Wal - Mart said Wednesday it will raise quality standards for its suppliers , following a series of scandals involving Chinese - made products , which account for a major portion of the company 's sales .
Mike Duke , vice chairman of Wal - Mart 's international division , said the company has been working on the initiative for three years .
" We have to ask all our suppliers to take full responsibility , " Duke said .
" Not ... just the factories or final production , but to go all the way upstream to look at any products , any raw materials that go in the products . "
In 2007 , melamine was found in a Chinese - made pet food ingredient and blamed in the deaths of dozens of dogs and cats in North America .
In August 2007 , Wal - Mart quietly began pulling two brands of dog treats from its shelves after tests found they contained traces of the industrial chemical melamine .
Later that year , Mattel recalled more than 21 million Chinese - made toys sold at retailers worldwide because they contained lead paint or tiny , detachable magnets that might be swallowed .
Wal - Mart also sold cribs recalled this week by Delta Enterprises , some of which were made in China .
The cribs , sold between January 1995 and September 2007 , were blamed in the deaths of two babies and have potentially faulty safety pegs or were missing the pegs .
Earlier , in remarks at a Wal - Mart - sponsored conference in Beijing , Duke said starting next month suppliers will be required to " tell us the name and location of every factory they use to make the products we sell . "

LOS ANGELES  Financial insecurity is forcing Wal - Mart ( WMT ) shoppers to change buying habits , cut credit card use and live more paycheck - to - paycheck , the CEO of the U.S. division of the world 's largest retailer said Tuesday .
Economic pain is leading to what Eduardo Castro - Wright termed " disturbing behaviors " among shoppers over the past few months .
For instance , more families are buying baby formula at the start of the month when they are more likely to have money .
In the past , he said , the chain had n't noticed such surges in formula sales .
A double - digit decline in credit card use at Wal - Mart stores in the second quarter this year sharply contrasts with the first quarter of 2007 , when a vibrant economy was resulting in double - digit increases in card use .
" Credit has been declining dramatically , " said the Ecuador - born executive who has run Wal - Mart Stores USA for three years .
" That decline in credit means people have to make choices about how they spend their hard - earned money . "
Many do n't have a choice when it comes to their form of payment .
" They have maxed out on their credit limits , " Castro - Wright said in an interview after a speech to Town Hall Los Angeles , a non-profit that provides a forum for public figures and opinion makers .
" Customers are really going through some hard times . "
The observations are significant because of Wal - Mart 's massive scope , with 4,000 U.S. stores .
Castro - Wright said nine out of 10 American families shop at Wal - Mart at least once a year .
How financial hurt is showing : • Money worries .
About 80 % of shoppers cite " personal financial security " as their top concern in internal surveys , up from 65 % just a few months earlier , he said .
A year ago , the price of gasoline was the top concern .
More consumers worry : " Will I have enough to put on the table so my family can eat ? " Castro - Wright added .
• Fewer name brands .
Wal - Mart has seen a rise in purchases of staples instead of discretionary items .
Shoppers have more then doubled purchases of private - label items , eschewing name brands .
Castro - Wright said , however , that Wal - Mart has no immediate plans to change the stores ' merchandise mix to take advantage of the trend .
• Changing shopping patterns .
Some shoppers are n't coming to the stores as often so they do n't have to drive as much .
Others , who may be unemployed , are coming more frequently to buy a few items when they have money in their pockets , he said .
And more sales are showing up around paydays .
Wal - Mart has seen a 2.5 % increase in sales at the start and the middle of the month , when workers are paid , compared with four months ago .
Wal - Mart is responding to slower growth by cutting back on capital investment and not opening as many new stores .
He also pointed to the chain 's program to sell generic prescription drugs at $ 4 , which he said has saved some of the neediest consumers more than $ 1 billion .
He also pledged that Wal - Mart wo n't cut back on philanthropic spending this year , though other corporations may be forced to reduce their charitable donations .

Crematorium Shortage in Japan : Some Morbid Facts
In a country where annual deaths are projected to rise 1.7 million by the year 2040 , a rapidly aging Japan faces a shortage of crematoriums .
According to the Health , Labor and Welfare Ministry , annual deaths in Japan rose to 1.1 million in 2007 and nearly all were cremated .
It is expected that deaths will rise annually to 1.7 million by 2040 , which is far beyond what Japan ’s 4,900 crematoriums can handle .
Due to high land costs and cultural taboos , expanding the number of crematoriums is no easy task ; few Japanese would welcome a crematorium going up next door .
Nagoya ’s Yagoto Cemetery has been struggling for the last nine years to build a second crematorium , but opposition from neighbors has blocked construction of the 30 - furnace facility .
A non-profit , philanthropic group , the Nippon Foundation , has come to the rescue with a unique solution .
Their idea is to build “ floating crematoriums ” , ships that could incinerate remains at sea .
Will this ever be a reality ?
Only time will tell .

First Fuel Cell - Powered Plane Presented in Germany
October 1st , 2008 by Ariel Schwartz
Last night , the German Aerospace Center ( DLR ) demonstrated the world ’s first manned airplane that can fly exclusively with the use of a fuel cell .
The fuel cell , which is based on polymer electrolyte membranes ( PEM ) , generates power for the motor glider ’s electric engine .
PEM fuel cells are both simple and safe — they can operate between 120 and 180 C , only need a simple cooling system , do n’t require humidification , and and can tolerate hydrogen gas impurities .
While the DLR ’s demonstration is promising , its technology requires significantly more testing before it can be used commercially .
And when PEM fuel cells are ready for aircraft use , they probably will only be used in small planes .
The DLR is n’t the first organization to test fuel cells for flight — this past April , Boeing flew a plane for 20 minutes on power generated solely by onboard fuel cells .
But unlike the DLR ’s plane , the Boeing model used lithium - ion batteries for takeoff .
While fuel cells may not be used to power aircraft anytime soon , they could be used in the near future for auxiliary power - generation in small planes .

“ How much do you need to save for future generations , and at what point are you gouging today ’s generation ? ” said Lynne Munson , of the Center for College Affordability and Productivity in Washington .
In January , the Senate Finance Committee requested detailed endowment and spending data from 136 colleges and universities with endowments of at least $ 500 million , with a possible eye to forcing them to spend at least 5 percent of their assets each year , as foundations are required to do .
Large , tax - free endowments “ should mean affordable education for more students , not just a security blanket for colleges , ” said Senator Charles E. Grassley , Republican of Iowa , who is reviewing the data .
The commissioner of the Internal Revenue Service ’s tax - exempt section said this spring that he wanted his agency to be more aggressive in ensuring that universities made “ appropriate use ” of their endowments .
And officials in Massachusetts are studying a proposal for a 2.5 percent tax on the part of university endowments greater than $ 1 billion  a threshold exceeded by nine of the state ’s universities .
“ The endowments have grown to such an astonishing extent that people are asking , if the wealth and the value of the tax exemption are increasing , is the public benefit increasing , as well ? ” said Evelyn Brody , a tax professor at Chicago - Kent College of Law .
This year , Ms. Brody said , the debate has entered new territory .
Traditionally , discussion about endowments has focused on the balance between using the money for the current generation versus saving it for the benefit of future generations .
“ Endowment spending has usually been a ‘ when ’ question , about when the money would be used for a charitable purpose , ” she said .
“ But now , it ’s also being viewed as a ‘ what ’ question .
What is the money for ?
And I think that ’s new . ”
WASHINGTON ( CNN ) --
The U.S. attorney general is trying to prevent immigration authorities from sending a Muslim woman to her home country , where she was a victim of female genital mutilation .
Attorney General Michael Mukasey ordered an immigration court to reconsider an African woman 's case .
In a stinging order overriding federal immigration courts , Mukasey blasted a decision that said a 28 - year - old citizen and native of Mali should be expelled " because her genitalia already had been mutilated [ so ] she had no basis to fear future persecution if returned to her home country . "
Calling the rationale " flawed , " Mukasey sent the case back to the Board of Immigration Appeals with orders to reconsider .
The woman , a native of Mali , begged the court not to send her back to her Bambara tribe .
The 28 - year - old said if she returned and had a daughter , the child also would be subject to mutilation .
The woman also said she faced forced marriage if she had to go home .
Mukasey cited what he concluded were two significant factual errors in the court 's rejection of her appeal .
" Female genital mutilation is not necessarily a one - time event , " Mukasey said .
He noted that the board in a previous case had granted asylum in to one woman whose " vaginal opening was sewn shut approximately five times after being opened to allow for sexual intercourse and child birth . "
He also concluded that the Board of Immigration Appeals was wrong to assume that the woman " must fear persecution in exactly the same form [ namely , repeat female genital mutilation ] to qualify for relief . "
Mukasey had been urged to look into the matter by angered members of Congress in the wake of the January decision .
" This recent action taken by the Board of Immigration Appeals is a step backward for the rights of women worldwide , " declared Rep. John Conyers , D- Michigan , in a January letter .
" Female genital mutilation is a gross violation of a woman 's human rights and has traditionally been grounds for the granting of an asylum claim , " Rep .
Zoe Lofgren , D - California , said in the letter .
Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Patrick Leahy , D - Vermont , issued a statement applauding Mukasey 's action , and declaring female genital mutilation a " barbaric practice widely regarded as a human rights abuse . "
The Justice Department acknowledged it is extraordinarily rare for an attorney general to jump into a relatively low - level immigration case .
The immigration courts decide about 40,000 cases a year , and an attorney general has issued an opinion on a case only three times in the past three years .
Female genital mutilation is common in parts of Africa , Asia and in some Arab countries , according to the United Nations .
The operation is viewed by some ethnic groups as a means to control a woman 's sexuality and is sometimes a prerequisite for marriage or the right to inherit .
The procedure can cause tissue injury , severe infection and fever , among other complications .
The U.N. has recorded cases in which hemorrhaging and infection lead to death .

Less than a week after controversial comments about investigating the patriotism of members of Congress , the National Republican Congressional Committee has pulled out of Minnesota Rep .
Michele Bachmann 's district , a well - placed GOP source tells Scorecard .
Bachmann earned widespread scorn for her remarks , made on MSNBC's " Hardball " last week .
In the following four days , her Democratic opponent , former state Transportation Commissioner Elwyn Tinklenberg , had raised over $ 1 million and the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee had reserved an additional $ 1 million in advertising time .
Both the campaign and the DCCC are already running new ads .
The NRCC had reserved time on behalf of Bachmann in early October , but the money had yet to flow to her district .
She was not among the beneficiaries of a rush of new independent expenditures the committee made in the past two days .

to be fair , those machines use an older method of touch screens , where an overlay registers your touch and corresponds it to coordinates on - screen .
If that 's out of whack ( which about the only way it would be is if it were never calibrated at the factory ) then something similar would happen .
Basically , in this video his touch was off by about 4 " vertically .
When he pushed Obama , it thought he pushed something 4 " lower .
When he pushed Straight Democrat , same thing happened , whatever was 4 " below was what got pushed .
So , if you find that happening to you , just press 4 " above the selection you want .
It looks like you 'll have as much time to fiddle as you want to get it right before you push the big red " vote " button at the top of the screen .
They played bridge every Wednesday at Netscape .
In the middle of the cafeteria .
Like clockwork .
The players were a collection of ex-SGI guys and they worked for a variety of different groups at the company , but as I learned a few months later , this core group of men quietly defined the engineering culture of the company … with a bridge game .
Ninety Days
If you follow the rules in Ninety Days , you ’re going to have a solid feel for the construction of your immediate team .
Who is who .
Who does what .
What they know .
Who the freak is .
Who the free electron is .
In a start - up when there are only 12 of you , you ’re done .
You know the people landscape because , from where you sit , you can see them all and you interact with all of them regularly .
In a larger company , however , ninety days is only going to give you a brief glimpse of what you need to know about your co-workers , the company , and its culture .
Fortunately , in a large company , tools and documents have been created to help you traverse the culture and process and figure out where people fit .
For example , what do you do when you get a random urgent mail from a co-worker stranger ?
Even if the stranger takes the time to explain who they are and what they do , you still fire up the corporate directory with the simple question : “ Who does this bozo work for ? ”
The corporate directory is the digital representation of a formerly very important document : the organization chart .
A quick glance at the org chart answers a lot of ego - based questions like :
Which org does he work in ?
A cool one ?
How many direct reports does he have ?
More power ?
How close is he to the CEO ?
More influence ?
As sources of information go , the org chart is essential , but it is an incomplete picture of your company , which brings us back to bridge at Netscape .
Bridge
If you looked up the four core bridge players on the org chart , you ’d learn a bit .
One engineering manager , another guy from some oddly named platform team , another guy who had a manager title , but no direct reports , and the last guy who looked like a program manager .
My org chart assessment : Meh .
What I learned months later was that the folks sitting at that regular bridge game not only defined much of what became the Netscape browser , they also continued to define the engineering culture or what I think of as a culture chart .
Unlike the org chart , you ’re not going to find the culture chart written down anywhere .
It does n’t exist .
The culture chart is an unwritten representation of the culture of your company and understanding it answers big questions that you must know :
What does this organization value ?
Who created this value system ?
Given this value system , who contributes high value ?
Who is most aware of how value is being created ?
This is fuzzy philosophical mumbo jumbo , so let ’s bring it home .
In your current job , right now , tell me what it ’s going take to get you a promotion .
“ I need to work really hard . ”
Ok , so you knew you need to work hard to get a promotion before you set foot in your current gig .
My question is , what specific thing do you need to do in order to be promoted ?
I ’d argue that for any engineer who is actively managing their career , it ’s essential to figure out the answer to this question as quickly as possible , and to do so you need to understand the culture .
Detecting Culture
If you are going to be promoted , you are going to succeed in a group of people when you provide that group things that it think it needs .
Now , your gut instinct is that this group of people is the management team , and that ’s a good org chart - centric answer .
The problem is it ’s your job to stay ahead of your manager .
You ’re not going to get promoted giving your manager what he wants ; a promotion comes when you give him what he wants as well as what he does not expect , but desperately needs .
It ’s unfair .
This guy is tasked with your career development and I am saying it ’s your job to tell him what he wants .
You do n’t have to do this ; you can take the reactive cues from your boss , but I derive intense professional satisfaction when I deliver the unexpectedly needed and I discover the unexpected by first finding the culture .
To deduce the culture of a company , all you have to do is listen .
Culture is an undercurrent of ideas that ties a group of people together .
In order for it to exist , it must move from one individual to the next .
This is done via the retelling of stories .
“ Max was this nobody performance nerd and three weeks before we were supposed to ship , he walked into the CEO ’s office with a single piece of paper with a single graph .
He dropped the graph on the table , sat down , and said , ‘ No way we ship in three weeks .
Six months .
Maybe . ’
The CEO ignored the paper , ‘ We lose three million dollars if we do n’t . ’
Max stood up , pointed at the chart , and said , ‘ We lose ten if we do .
We must not ship crap . ”
Whether this story is true or not is irrelevant .
The story about how Max saved the company ten million dollars by telling the CEO “ No ” is retold daily .
In hallways .
At the bar over beers .
The story continually reinforces an important part of this company ’s culture .
We must not ship crap .
There is n’t a corporate values statement on the planet that so brutally and beautifully defines the culture of a company .
There are other stories that you ’re going to hear over and over again , and inside each of these stories are the real corporate values .
Each one , while designed to be entertaining , teaches a lesson about what this particular company values , and these are the lessons that are going to get you promoted .
There ’s a chance you ’re not going to find these stories .
My hope is that you ’re in a company where engineering is valued and , as such , has an influence on the culture of your company .
If it ’s been six months , you ’ve been actively looking , and no one has told you a great story about how engineering shaped the fortunes of your company , there ’s a chance that in your company engineering does n’t have a seat at the culture table .
My question is then , “ How are you going to succeed , how are you going to be promoted , where engineering is n’t an influential part of the culture ? ”
Culture Definers
After you have a healthy collection of stories , you ’re going to have a good idea about some of the culture , but you ’re still missing essential data for your culture chart .
See , the folks who tell the stories about culture usually are n’t the folks who created them .
Stories are told , but first they are born .
The people who are responsible for defining the culture are not deliberately doing so .
They do not wake up in the morning and decide , “ Today is the day I will steer the culture of the company to value quality design ” .
They just do it .
The individuals who have the biggest impact on the culture and company are n’t doing it for any other reason than they believe it is right thing to do , and if you want to grow in this particular company it ’s a good idea to at least know who they are and where they sit .
You need to pay attention to this core group of engineers because as they do , so will the company .
Game Over
Your company is networked in more ways than you can possibly imagine .
Just because you ’ve reverse engineered the development culture in your organization does n’t mean you ’ve got a complete map of the overall culture .
There are endless connections tugging any decent sized group of people in multiple directions at once .
There ’s the been - here - forever network , the I - survived - the - layoff people , and the untouchable - did - something - great - once crew .
Culture assessment is an information game and it ’s never over .
Your job is to continually situate yourself in such as a way that , as quickly as possible , you can assess subtle changes in the culture of your company .
I was n’t concerned when Netscape started losing market share to Microsoft .
I did n’t sweat it when the stock price stalled .
The reason I started thinking about my next gig was , months before either of these two events occurred , one of the lunchtime bridge team left .
The game stopped .
The small group of four no longer spent a long lunch quietly , unknowingly defining the culture of the company and everyone who was watching noticed .
They noticed when one of those who had humbly done the work that defined the company no longer believed enough to stay .
A new clip from “ ” has been released on the official site .
The clip features an introduction by director , who helmed the 2005 “ , ” and features a scene in which Frank Castle unleashes a barrage of bullets on countless bad guys .
Continuing his one - man war against organized crime , Frank Castle , also known as The Punisher ( ) , takes aim at mob boss Billy Russoti ( ) .
An encounter with Castle leaves Russoti horribly disfigured , so the mobster changes his name to Jigsaw and sets out for revenge .
“ Punisher : War Zone ” starring Ray Stevenson , Dominic West , and “ Punisher : War Zone ” is scheduled to hit theaters on December 5th .
After years of testing , the Active Denial System – the pain ray which drives off rioters with a microwave - like beam – could finally have its day .
The Army is buying five of the truck - mounted systems for $ 25 million .
But the energy weapon may face new hurdles , before it 's shipped off to the battlefield ; a new report details how the supposedly non-lethal blaster could be turned into a flesh - frying killer .
The contract for the pain ray trucks is " expected to be awarded by year 's end , " Aviation Week notes .
" A year after the contract is signed , the combination vehicle / weapons will start be fielded at the rate of one per month . "
It 's been a very long time coming .
As we 've previously reported , there have been calls to deploy the Active Denial System in Iraq going back to 2004 .
But it 's always been delayed for legal , political , and public relations reasons .
Anything that might be condemned as torture is political dynamite .
Interestingly , the version being bought is not the full - size " Version 2 , " but a containerized system known as Silent Guardian , which Raytheon have been trying to sell for some time .
They describe Silent Guardian as " roughly 1/3 the size and power of the other Active Denial Systems , " and quote it 's range as " greater than 250 meters . "
The larger system has a range somewhere in excess of 700 meters .
Silent Guardian weighs a shade over 10,000 pounds all up , and will be mounted on an " armored ruggedized HEMTT [ Heavy Expanded Mobility Tactical Truck ] . "
The announcement arrives on the same day as a new report from less - lethal weapons expert Dr. Jürgen Altmann that analyzes the physics of several directed energy weapons , including Active Denial , the Advanced Tactical Laser ( used as a non-lethal weapon ) , the Pulsed Energy Projectile ( a.k.a. " Maximum Pain " laser ) and the Long Range Acoustic Device ( a.k.a. " Acoustic Blaster " ) .
Dr. Altmann describes the Active Denial beam in some detail , noting that it will not be completely uniform ; anyone unlucky enough to be caught in the center will experience more heating than someone at the edge .
And perhaps more significant is his thorough analysis of the heating it produces – and the cumulative effect if the target does not have the chance to cool down between exposures .
In U.S. military tests , a fifteen - second delay between exposures was strictly observed ; this may not happen when the ADS is used for real .
" As a consequence , the ADS provides the technical possibility to produce burns of second and third degree .
Because the beam of diameter 2 m and above is wider than human size , such burns would occur over considerable parts of the body , up to 50 % of its surface .
Second - and third - degree burns covering more than 20 % of the body surface are potentially life - threatening – due to toxic tissue - decay products and increased sensitivity to infection – and require intensive care in a specialized unit .
Without a technical device that reliably prevents re-triggering on the same target subject , the ADS has a potential to produce permanent injury or death . "
This potential hazard need not be a show - stopper – existing less - lethals , such as plastic bullets and tear gas , can also be fatal under some circumstances ( and I 'm not even going to get into the argument about Tasers ) .
Dr .
Altmann notes that " the present analysis has not found convincing arguments that the ADS would be immoral or illegal in each foreseeable circumstance , " and that acceptance will depend very much on how it is used .
If the ADS prevents small boats from approaching a U.S. vessel without harming anyone , then it will be seen as a humane option .
If it is used to clear protesters out of the way it may be seen differently .
Meanwhile , the National Institute of Justice is still has a reported interest in a " hand - held , probably rifle - sized , short range weapon that could be effective at tens of feet for law enforcement officials . "
That 's just one of the likely domestic applications of Active Denial technology which are likely to follow if the Army 's experiment with ADS is successful .
A lot of people will be watching this one very closely .

In case you - like most of us - have difficulty keeping up with Democrat Presidential candidate Barack Obama 's ties to corrupt , terrorist and anti-American groups and individuals a new one has emerged .
The mainstream press -as with Obama 's other associations - is working overtime to cover this latest one up .
Obama is directly tied to a group that has been both accused of and its members convicted of National Voter Fraud , embezzlement and misuse of tax payer funds - ACORN ( Association of Community Organizations for Reform Now ) .
What are Obama 's direct ties to the voter - fraud group ?
Let 's take a look .
Obama was not only ACORN 's attorney but , actually trained the group in " community activism ! "
And , while Obama was Chairman of the Chicago Annenberg Challenge , he arranged funding for the voter - fraud group through the CAC .
McCauley 's World reports : " In Philadelphia alone ACORN has raised over $ 800,000 Dollars for Barack Obama 's Campaign . "
In politics , scratching each other 's back is always the order of the day .
The voter - fraud group is working almost non -stop - except when its members are arrested and taken into custody - to get Obama elected POTUS .
If Obama is elected , we could actually have the least experienced , most corrupt and first Socialist / Communist POTUS in world history .
And the other Obama direct ties to corruption and anti-Americanism ?
Let 's take another look - shall we ?
" William Ayers - former head of terrorist group the Weather Underground - was Obama 's colleague at the Woods Fund of Chicago and Chicago Annenberg Challenge .
Note : Ayers lobbied to have Obama named Chairman of the CAC .
Ayers is also a major fundraiser for Obama
" Obama 's acknowledged over 20 year minister and mentor , Jeremiah Wright , has made and continues to make anti-American , anti-white and anti-Semitic " sermons "
" Obama has direct ties to Saudi Arabian funders and the Black Panthers "
" Depending on one 's sources , Obama was either the # 2 or # 3 Fannie Mae ( Democrats ' personal slush fund ) funded politician "
" Obama is directly ties to now - convicted felon Antoin Rezko "
" Obama wants to work with the very leaders of countries who want to destroy us "
The evidence against this man continues to mount .
But , still Democrats and the Democrats ' media want him as POTUS .
Corruption recognizes and supports its own , folks .
This could never happen in a sane world .

( Via Serf City 2008 - 01 - 31 . )
Here ’s something I mentioned some time back during a conversation about secession , decentralism , and decoupling the revolutionary doctrine of secession from the noxious notion of states ’ rights :
I mean , one kind of decentralist politics that you might endorse would be to advocate the secession of urban centers from the surrounding states and a decentralist order that ’s partly based on people forming a network of poleis around these urban centers .
Certainly there are a number of cities ( New York , San Francisco , Detroit , Austin , Atlanta … ) where enough people are disgusted enough with their state governments that this kind of idea might have some real traction .
After all , the power of suburban and exurban and rural counties to lord it over cities through majoritarian control of the state government is , or at least ought to be , just as much a concern for decentralists as the reverse .
So it ’s interesting to read that Peter Vallone , a City Council rep from Queens , was proposing something like that earlier this year –stressing , in particular , the way that Albany ’s tax - eaters parasitically exploit the wealth that the City produces , and the futility of trying to make your voice heard in a majoritarian regime where you ’re outnumbered and have no right of exit :
Emboldened by Mayor Bloomberg ’s testimony in Albany this week that the city ’s taxpayers pay the state $ 11 billion a year more than they get back , a City Council member is offering legislation that would begin the process of having New York City secede from New York State .
Peter Vallone Jr. , a Democrat who represents Queens , is pushing the idea , and the Council plans to hold a hearing on the possibility of making New York City the 51st state .
I think secession ’s time has definitely come again , Mr. Vallone , who spearheaded a similar push in 2003 , told The New York Sun yesterday .
If not secession , somebody please tell me what other options we have if the state is going to continue to take billions from us and give us back pennies .
Should we raise taxes some more ?
Should we cut services some more ?
Or should we consider seriously going out on our own ?
During a visit to Albany this week , Mr. Bloomberg called on lawmakers to give the city its fair share of tax revenue and said that the state took in $ 11 billion more from New York City than was returned in the state budget .
Mr. Vallone says that the state ’s demands on the city in worsening economic times now make it necessary to dissolve the political bands , which have connected them .
Not only is it about self - determination and self - rule , but it ’s about fairness , Mr. Vallone said .
It ’s something we see every year in the budget .
They take $ 11 billion from us and give us back a mere pittance and they make it seem like they ’re doing us a favor to give that pittance back .
Somehow they missed the point that that is New York City ’s own tax money and we deserve it .
— Benjamin Sarlin , The New York Sun ( 2008-01-30 ) : A Secession Plan Is Floated for New York City
Of course , Vallone is an elected Democrat , and like any politician , he takes a perfectly good radical idea and waters it down with stupid concessions to power : immediately after decrying the way majoritarian state government swindles people in New York City and denies them control over the fruits of their own labor , he goes on to propose that New York City ought to fix it by seceding from New York State , and then subordinating itself directly to the majoritarian rule of the United States federal government as the 51st state .
I suppose there ’s something to be said for cutting out the middle - man , but if you think that ’s going to stop you from having billions taken from you and getting a pittance back , well , I have a fine bridge in the autonomous city - state of Brooklyn that you might be interested in buying .
And , like a politician , he proposes a stupid means to his stated ends :
Mr. Vallone ’s legislation would create a commission to study the issue and then recommend whether to put it to a referendum .
Since secession would have to be approved by the Albany legislators , its passage would be unlikely .
— Benjamin Sarlin , The New York Sun ( 2008-01-30 ) : A Secession Plan Is Floated for New York City
The idea of holding a direct referendum is fine ; but making that referendum contingent on a politically - appointed council of Experts is a waste of time and energy .
If you want New York City to be free , begging Albany to let your people go is n’t about to work .
You ’ve got to just start talking with your people about getting up and leaving , whether Albany likes it or not .
I mean , Christ .
Supposing that you talked it up and got it organized and actually had enough people in New York City behind you , what are they going to do about it ?
Boycott Manhattan ?
Invade the South Bronx ?
Why wait on their permission ?
The answer , of course , is that this is most likely half - sincere at best , and in large part an act of pointless political grandstanding by Vallone , which he would not be attempting but for the fact hat he can be sure it wo n’t go anywhere .
But even if his plan wo n’t , it ’s very interesting , and worth the attention of genuine secessionists and real revolutionaries , that a party hack from Queens figures there ’s enough of that kind of sentiment in his neighborhood that he can exploit it for an applause line .
And that other dissident city council members would be willing to endorse the same logic in the course of public political debate :
Another to council member , Simcha Felder , who chairs the Governmental Operations committee , said the bill will be considered this year .
It certainly has merit , Mr. Felder said of the proposal .
Why in the world should New York City be held hostage to the state ?
It just does n’t make sense .
Mr. Felder acknowledged that the bill would face many hurdles , but said it deserved a debate .
I think the people in New York City are very interested for the most part in it .
The question is the people outside New York City in New York State who have been eating the fruits of our labor for all this time .
They are n’t going to be ready to just say forget about it .
— Benjamin Sarlin , The New York Sun ( 2008-01-30 ) : A Secession Plan Is Floated for New York City
So do n’t give them the opportunity .
Why choose a strategy that requires you to wait on them to get ready for your freedom ?
If the people in New York City really are very interested , then do what every successful independence movement in history has done : stop worrying about what the people who oppress and exploit you will say about it .
Get talking , get organized , declare independence and then , if the state keeps trying to issue you orders , act like you mean it — by ignoring those orders and treating the people who issue them the same way you ’d treat any other lunatic who thinks he ’s Napoleon .
Of course , a strategy like that is hard .
Of course , it ’s likely to fail .
( Lots of independence movements have . )
Of course , it will take years to organize and win even if it does n’t fail .
But it is a strategy that might possibly succeed , which puts it ahead of plans for having the city government petition the state legislature .
And it ’s also a strategy we can start talking about now .
And talking about that may start a lot of other conversations that are worth having , about taxes , war , empire , and the rest .
New York City ALLies : how many people do you know who are very interested in the idea of an independent New York City , which is no longer held hostage to the state ?
Remember that interest and sympathy and idle wishes are enough to start with : conviction and solidarity and organization are things that you can build by getting people to take the idea seriously , by educating them about it , by dispelling their ars , and by showing them that another City is possible .
So , are there possibilities in doing anti-imperialist education , outreach , and , ultimately , organizing to free Occupied New York from the Empire State ?
If so , let ’s talk about how to do it .
Maybe we can start in the comments here .
Free the New York 8,274,527 , and all political prisoners !

The How and Why of Cocoa Initializers
One of the longest ongoing controversies in the Cocoa community is how to write your init methods .
More specifically , how to properly call your superclass 's initializer .
In the hopes of putting this controversy to rest , I want to walk through the right way to write an initializer and exactly why this is the right way .
How it must be done
It should come as no surprise that the right way to write an initializer is the Apple Way , which should be familiar to everyone reading this :
- init { if ( ( self = [ super init ] ) ) { // set up instance variables and whatever else here } return self ; }
Minor variations are of course just fine , as long as they 're equivalent .
For example , some people like to check self for nil and then return nil immediately to avoid putting initialization in a separate block .
Some people like to break out the assignment , then check just plain self in the if statement .
These all do the same thing , so it 's just a matter of taste .
Call super or self ?
For the sake of completeness , I 'll first cover a more obvious part of this method , the call to [ super init ] .
If you 're really new to Objective - C and came from a language like C++ or Java , this may puzzle you .
It 's here because Objective - C initializers are just plain methods like any other method .
If you want the superclass initializer to be called , then you have to call it yourself .
You also have a choice here , between calling super and calling self .
Which one you use depends on circumstances .
If you 're not sure , you can apply one of these rules of thumb :
Call super if and only if the method name matches .
Call super if and only if you 're implementing your class 's designated initializer .
( This rule is more accurate , but sometimes harder to apply . )
Checking nil
And again for the sake of completeness , some may wonder why the if statement is there at all .
The reason is because your superclass may fail to initialize ( for example , if the parameters were n't consistent ) and the standard way to indicate this is to release the object and return nil from the initializer .
If you continue initializing your state after this happens , you will crash .
The if statement lets you fail gracefully if your superclass failed .
The assignment
Now on to the meat of the controversy .
The above is fairly obvious and I doubt anyone will disagree with it .
But that assignment to self is frequently disputed .
Let 's run through the myths one by one , from most obvious to least obvious .
Myth :
The superclass initializer will only ever return nil or self .
Fact : Many Cocoa classes return a different pointer from their initializer .
Myth : Fine , but that only happens with class clusters , and only when you do n't subclass them .
Fact :
It 's true that class clusters do n't do this to their subclasses , but other classes can and do .
Myth :
But those other subclasses are things you would never want to subclass anyway , like NSColorPanel , or it only happens when you do something wrong , like subclass a singleton but fail to make that subclass the singleton .
Fact :
These are indeed situations where it can happen , but it 's not limited to these situations .
Myth :
The superclass initializer has to return self because my initializer can only deal with instances of my class .
Fact :
The superclass initializer could return a different instance of your class .
Myth :
It can't return a different instance because you 're not allowed to re-initialize instances .
Fact :
It 's true about re-initialization , but it could allocate a new instance .
Myth :
But it has no reason to do that .
It already has a new instance right there .
Fact :
It has a good reason to do that if it wants some extra storage at the end , like if it created a dynamic subclass of your class and wants to use an instance of that subclass .
This is why the standard initializer pattern is the only one that works .
Cocoa classes can and do deallocate the original instance , then allocate a new instance of the same class ( or a subclass ) and return it from their initializers .
This is admittedly rare , but it is legal and it does happen .
And that , in a nutshell , is why the standard Apple initializer pattern is the only correct way .
Conclusion
To summarize , the superclass 's initializer can return one of three things , and the standard Apple pattern deals with them all :
self ( This is what you get the vast , vast majority of the time . ) nil ( On failure . )
A new instance of your class ( Rare but legitimate . )
Many people like to leave off the assignment and just check for nil .
This works fine for cases 1 and 2 but will fail in very confusing ways for case 3 .
There are actually a couple of other things that can potentially be returned :
An instance of a different class
An existing instance of your class
Case 4 only happens if you did something wrong , so it 's not something you should be handling .
Case 5 only happens if you either did something wrong , or if you subclassed a singleton .
If you subclass a singleton then you should make sure your initializer can handle re-initializing the existing singleton instance .
This is just good practice for singletons in general anyway .
( As an aside , the standard pattern is not necessary if you subclass NSObject directly .
This is because -[ NSObject init ] in documented to do nothing and always return self .
However , using the principle that we should always write code that 's robust to changes , in this case to changes in what class you inherit from , I very much recommend using the standard pattern even for direct NSObject subclasses . )
So there you have it .
This is how to write your initializers , and why you should write them that way .
I hope it 's clear enough not to generate dispute , but if you must , comment away .

Making Soap from Kitchen Grease
If you ’re saying to yourself , “ Ivory , I do n’t wanna to BUY fat to make my soap .
I have plenty of fat in my grease can ! ” then this is the post for you .
So , how do we turn icky , blech-y , Mr. Ivory - should - be - ashamed - of - how - much - bacon - he - eats kitchen grease into glorious , bubbly , clean soap ?
a . Put half fat , half - ish water in a pan and bring it to a boil .
b. Remove from heat , stir , and add about ½ as much COLD water as before cooking .
( I had a coffee cup of fat , and added a coffee cup of water to boil , so I added a half a cup of cold water at this step . )
c. Let it cool till the fat floats and is scoopable onto a plate .
( Fridge or freezer speeds it up .
Just do n’t accidentally defrost your chicken breasts , K ? )
d . If it still seems a little blech to you , do it again .
I did .
( Cleaner second time , no ? )
2. Weigh and melt fat .
3 . Sprinkle the lye into the water and swirl .
[ As I mentioned previously , the lye calculators say that for one pound of lard - ish fat , you need 6 ounces of water and 2 ounces of lye–I had 3 / 4 of a pound of grease after washing , so I needed 4.5 ounces of water ( 3/4 of 6 oz ) and 1.5 ounces of lye ( 3/4 of 2 oz­ ) . ]
4 . Wait till both are not smoldering hot and pour lye solution into the fat .
5 . Blend with immersion blender .
6 . Stop when you can see where you ’ve been .
( called “ trace ” )
6b . This is the time to put in the fragrance , if you wish .
7 . Pour into custom built soap mold .
( HA ! )
Let it sit a day and peel off the carton , slice , and cure for a few weeks .
Waa -laa !
Soap .
Any residual pork rind -y smells will be GONE when it cures .
** Note to self , if the economy goes to heck in a hand - basket , check crystal ball three weeks ahead so that soap will already be cured when the big one hits .

British mother - of - two faces being ' detained without trial ' after Free Tibet protest
Mandie McKeown will be deported at the end of the month
A British woman faces being detained without trial in China after participating in a Free Tibet demonstration , the Foreign Office has said .
Mother - of - two , Mandie McKeown , 41 , was arrested in Beijing during the protest and will be deported on August 31 .
A Foreign Office spokesman said : ' Consular officials are in contact with her and her family in the UK .
' We continue to underline to the Chinese government the need to respect its commitment to freedom of expression .
' At the same time , we encourage all UK visitors to China to respect local laws . '
Philippa Carrick , chief executive of parliamentary lobby group The Tibet Society , said : ' It is just outrageous that people can be held without trial .
' She was just filming the protest , she was not touching a Tibetan flag or anything .
' I think she would have released the footage to You Tube if she had not been caught .
' It makes a mockery of the assurances about human rights that China has given to the Olympic Committee . '
' We want to make sure Gordon Brown is fully briefed about this ahead of the closing ceremony . '
Activists from Students for a Free Tibet are among those to have protested
Pro Tibet activists have protested throughout the Beijing Olympics .
One arrested British woman now faces being detained without trial
Fabian Hamilton , a Tibet Society council member said : ' I am appalled that anyone should be arrested and sentenced to imprisonment without trial simply for speaking out about Tibet .
' This just shows the other face of China which their authorities do n't want us to see .
There is clearly no democracy , no freedom of speech and no rule of law in China and it's about time we spoke out and made our views known . '
Mrs McKeown , from Bristol , has a five - year - old son , Hamish , and a three - year - old daughter , Neve .
Sarah Palin raised eyebrows Wednesday when she told the evangelical leaderand broadcaster James Dobson that John McCain agrees with the Republican party platform , which states the party 's opposition to embryonic stem cell research , among other things .
As Marc Ambinder over at The Atlanticnoted , Dobson had asked Palin whether it was her impression that McCain supported the views expressed in the platform , and whether she thought he would implement them .
" I do , from the the bottom of my heart , " Palin said .
" I am such a strong believer that McCain believes in those strong planks and we do have good conversations about some of the details too , about the different planks and what they represent . "
Palin opposes federal funding for embryonic stem cell research .
The Republican party platform , adopted during its September convention , does too .
The party prefers scientists to work with stem cells derived from other sources .
" We call for a major expansion of support for the stem cell research that now shows amazing promise and offers the greatest hope for scores of diseases — with adult stem cells , umbilical cord blood and cells reprogrammed into pluripotent stem cells — without the destruction of embryonic human life , " reads the Republican party ' spolicy statement .
" We call for a ban on human cloning and a ban on the creation of or experimentation on human embryos for research purposes . "
But McCain has stated his support for embryonic stem cell research , and has made it a campaign issue by running radio ads in battleground states with lots of independent voters .
Barack Obama 's campaign has also run ads telling voters erroneously , as FactCheck.org notes , that McCain opposes stem cell research .
Palin's statement to Dobson on Wednesday is important because it raises the question of whether McCain , as the scientific community fears , might reverse his stance once in office .
A trio of Nobel Laureates who endorsed Obama September said at the time that they felt that they could n't trust McCain 's positions because of political pressure from religious conservatives .
But McCain 's going to be the decider once in office , said campaign spokesman Michael Goldfarb .
" John McCain 's been very clear on his position on stem cells , and
Sarah Palin's been very clear on her position on stem cells .
Sarah
Palin has made it clear that as vice president , she would not implement her own personal views , but John McCain's , " he said .

As a project for work gets ready for an alpha release , I 've managed to eliminate all the serious bugs and now have some time for what should 've been part of the project from the beginning : writing tests .
As a lapsed tester , I always feel guilty about not writing tests when things start to get complicated with an application .
Whenever you make a change , you have to point - and - click your way through the application to make sure that nothing has broken .
I got tired of pointing - and - clicking , so I decided it was time to shut up and write some tests .
Since I 'm using Code Igniter instead of CakePHP for this project ( did I mention that I inherited the project and could n't switch ? )
I started looking into the culture of testing surrounding Code Igniter .
It 's weaker than a newborn baby .
The built - in testing system is some weird mishmash of unit testing and " you have to create your own test results template " .
WTF ?
You can't be serious .
So I quickly ignored that .
Besides , the first set of tests were going to be using PHPUnit combined with Selenium so I could make the " acceptance testing " automated .
As an aside to this , I remember speaking with Sebastian Bergmann ( the driving force behind PHPUnit ) at a conference maybe 3 years ago and him telling me that he knew someone was working on getting Selenium and PHPUnit to play nicely together .
Anyway , it 's working just fine .
So , next step was to see if I could use something else than the incredibly lame testing tools that Code Igniter came with .
I found something called fooStack , that contained CIUnit .
It lets you use PHPUnit with Code Igniter .
Now we 're talking !
Lickety split I had some unit tests for my models written .
Well , after spending quite a lot of time screwing around with the tests and finding out the difference in relative paths between the application running via Apache and trying to test the models via the command line .
Thanks to all those on Twitter who yelled " use php_sapi_name to figure out what environment you are in , you idiot ! " at me .
But all this got me to thinking : how do some other PHP frameworks stack up in terms of having tests ?
Code Igniter has ZERO tests for the framework itself .
Perhaps I will mention this to my boss next time I 'm asked to create a project from scracth .
Hrm , guess I 'll have to trust that their code actually works the way it 's supposed to .
Zend Framework ( full disclosure : I was one of the original authors of the Zend_Service_Audioscrobbler component ) has huge amounts of tests for the framework itself .
In fact , any new contributions MUST have working tests submitted with it .
CakePHP has lots of tests for the core , and I believe that I saw something in the changelog for CakePHP 1.2RC3 that indicated they were at 80 % code coverage in terms of testing for the CakePHP core .
Bug submissions for CakePHP are supposed to come with tests to prove that there is a repeatable problem .
Symfony recently rewrote it 's core tests and created their own testing framework for it .
So now when you start comparing frameworks to each other , I think it 's important you also consider how much effort has gone into creating tests for the core functionality of that framework .
A well tested framework should mean far less surprises when using it .
Given how many tools are out there to assist you in testing , I do n't think there are any excuses other than being totally lazy to not create tests for the core functionality of any application .
Pay now , or pay later , but you will PAY to fix bugs in your application .
Paying now is simply cheaper .
Would you stake your project on complex code written by someone else that is simply not testable by you ?
Perhaps I am not looking at from the proper distance because I am inside the framework - creator culture , but I can't see why you would n't want to provide tests to prove your stuff actually works the way you claim it does .
Tests prove that the code is * behaving * the way you expect , and code that is testable is also usually easier to modify as time goes on .
There is some sort of sick joy in making a change to code , running the unit tests , and seeing that you did n't break anything .
We Are Change L.A .
October 29 , 2008
On October 7 , 2008 , Naomi Wolf was at Vroman ’s bookstore in Pasadena , California to give a talk and sign her new book “ Give Me Liberty . ”
Stewart Howe , of WeAreChangeLA , was on hand and asked Ms. Wolf to give a message to the truth and accountability movement .
Ms .
Wolf stated that although she has no theory about what happened on 9/11 , no question should be off the table in a free society and saluted the movement ’s desire to seek truth and accountability .
“ I live ten blocks from ground zero in Manhattan , and I know that I had questions as a citizen …
I think every thoughtful citizen has noticed things that might raised questions , ” Wolf commented .
She also pointed out that the 9/11 Commission has disavowed some of their findings because much was based on information gained from torture– therefore there should be a new investigation .
As a resident of Lower Manhattan , Wolf is familiar with the EPA ’s lies about the toxic environment after 9/11 , and has demonstrated to her that government is “ capable of hurting American citizens . ”
Naomi says that such questions have gained even more credibility with her personally , since meeting several firefighers in Seattle , who started http://firefightersfor911truth.org and have articulated many important questions about 9/11 .

The Amish have long been famous for barn raisings .
Now , they 're becoming known for building houses for the non-Amish , often using ancient construction techniques .
About 600 Amish contractors or subcontractors work in at least a dozen states , a rapid increase over the past decade , says Donald B. Kraybill , who has written more than a dozen books on the conservative Christian sect .
Not only do some of them specialize in the timber - frame construction method that does n't use nails , they often can erect a house faster and for less money than traditional contractors , customers say .
Yet working with an Amish builder brings special challenges .
Imagine trying to keep in touch with a contractor who does n't own a phone -- most are forbidden to have one at home .
They also are n't allowed to drive , so they need a driver or other means to get to the job site .
Few use computers , have insurance or will sign a detailed construction contract .
But some customers are willing to put up with these constraints for what they say is a better - built house .
Kevin Heitland was so impressed by the workmanship of a friend 's timber - frame house put up by Amish builder Danny Schwartz that he hired Mr. Schwartz for his new lake house south of Branson , Mo .
The builder framed the 2,200 - square - foot house using wooden pegs in less than a month , for a total cost of $ 129,000 , including the exterior walls , insulation and three porches .
( Other workers finished the interior . )
Mr. Heitland , a convenience - store owner in Nixa , Mo. , says the work Mr. Schwartz did would have cost at least a third more and taken twice as long if he had used regular contractors .
Now he plans to commission the same Amish builder for a spec house he plans to sell .
" Their workmanship is second to none , " Mr. Heitland says .
Customers such as Mr. Heitland are turned off by the anonymous and sometimes sloppy work of mass home builders .
The Amish are known for careful woodworking , whether using the timber - frame technique , in which thick beams are assembled with wooden pegs and mortise - and - tenon joints , or the conventional " stick frame " approach using machine - milled lumber and nails .
And in an industry known for unreliability and corner - cutting , the Amish -- a community known for its work ethic -- can be refreshing , customers say .
Seth Teter / Ohio Farm Bureau Workers from Amish Timber Framers construct a house in Doylestown , Ohio , using the ancient timber - frame technique , which does n't require nails .
Of course , there are plenty of non-Amish builders who take pride in their craftsmanship .
Some use similar old - fashioned techniques , including timber frame .
" There are good and bad contractors .
It is more based on what someone is willing to pay than on whether the contractor is Amish or not , " says Stephen Risser , head of the Department of Building Regulations in Richland County , Ohio .
He estimates that work by Amish contractors and subcontractors makes up 20 % of his department 's inspections .
Amish builders trim costs by using family members as workers and keeping their overhead low .
Many do n't buy insurance , since their communities often have insurance pools to help pay hospital and other medical bills if a member gets sick or injured .
( People who use Amish builders may need to buy their own liability policies . )
Unlike many general contractors who use subcontractors , Amish builders tend to do all the construction themselves .
That cuts out middlemen and allows them to immediately correct any problems on a job .
Matt Breyer , owner of Breyer Construction in Reading , Pa. , says he regularly competes against Amish builders and " we usually get slaughtered " in pricing .
He says a chief reason is his need to pay for unemployment benefits , worker 's compensation and insurance .
He lost a job last year to install a custom deck after he bid $ 50,000 and an Amish contractor bid half that , he says .
And while Amish contractors are hampered by the sect 's restrictions , they find ways to work around the rules :
Many can't own power tools -- but they can rent or borrow them .
They are n't allowed to drive -- but they can use a car with a hired driver .
Use of phones is banned at home -- but many are permitted to use cellphones for business or if someone else owns the phone , like the non-Amish driver .
" There 's no question it is harder to get in touch with me , " says Mr. Schwartz , the Amish builder who erected Mr. Heitland 's lake house .
Though Mr. Schwartz works out of El Dorado Springs , Mo. , he has built houses as far away as Colorado and Montana .
He says he has a driver but has also used taxis and gets rides from clients .
Though computers are taboo , he hires non-Amish to do three - dimensional pictures of his hand drawings .
In his shop , his tools are driven by horsepower using a contraption that resembles a merry - go - round , allowing up to four horses to turn steel shafts that are geared to saws and planers .
But in the field he uses a non-Amish person 's power tools .
Some Amish use non-Amish as conduits for their construction businesses .
Cindy Shepherd , a real - estate agent at Mike Thomas Associates / F.C. Tucker in Fort Wayne , Ind. , agreed to develop a Web site and handle open houses and referrals for an Amish - owned builder of both spec and custom homes .
Deanna Vickery turned to Amish Timber Framers in Doylestown , Ohio , when she bought her grandparents ' farm in nearby Dover , Ohio , and wanted to put an addition on the 100 - year - old barn .
Although the Amish generally are n't allowed to watch TV , if they happen to be in a room where the TV is on , they do n't have to leave .
As a result , she would be asked to show up at lunchtime to turn on football games for the workers .
Mrs. Vickery says she quickly became friends with the crew , inviting them and their families to her annual pig roast .
About 20 years ago , the Amish started to diversify out of farming when it became clear that subdividing a farm among sons was n't sustainable as their population grew and land costs made buying new property prohibitive .
The Amish population has about doubled since then to an estimated 231,000 nationwide , says Mr. Kraybill , the author , who also is a senior fellow at Elizabethtown College in Elizabethtown , Pa .
Many became entrepreneurs , carpenters , factory hands and artisans .
Now , more than 70 % of Amish household heads pursue nonfarm lines of work , Mr. Kraybill says .
Typical Amish thinking views work as an overwhelmingly positive and even formative element of life , says Erik Wesner , a scholar who studies the Amish and runs a blog about them .
D.J. Wagner Cindy Wagner 's Amish - built house in Fort Wayne , Ind. , was erected in 4 ½ months .
Cindy Wagner , a 41 - year - old surgical technician in Fort Wayne , Ind. , used Amish builder Lee Schmucker 's Imperial Homes to erect her 2,500 - square - foot house .
It was finished in 4 ½ months and cost $ 410,000 , including high - end tiles and a walk - in shower , she says .
" They were there every day , regardless of weather , and they did exactly what they said they would do -- and more , " Ms. Wagner says .
While she got a comparably priced quote from a non-Amish builder she went with Mr. Schmucker because she liked his work on one of his spec houses .
" The craftsmanship was beautiful , " she says .
Paul Hackett , an attorney in Cincinnati , chose an Amish builder to help put an addition on his 208 - year - old house because it was the only company he found that could match the home 's exposed , hand - hewn beams .
Though he had to rent a trailer to fetch the beams from the Amish builder 's shop , he says the process was fairly simple .
" There are lots of painful experiences when you build a house , but not this , " he says .
But sometimes the communications issues can be too much .
Jim Zik , a telecom product marketing manager in Mount Airy , Md. , heard from others about the quality of Amish builders and their low pricing .
Mr. Zik says he tried for nine months to find an Amish home builder , putting out messages on Internet sites , asking Amish barn builders and talking with friends .
Finally , he gave up .
" I have a lead on a Mennonite now , " he says , speaking of a related Christian sect also known for construction work .
" They are allowed to drive and have phones , so it should be easier . "

Sideways Mencken Embarrassing Yourself
In 1972 I cast my first vote in a presidential election .
Richard Nixon .
Within a couple of weeks I was in front of the White House demonstrating for the impeachment of Richard Nixon .
So when I talk about embarrassing electoral decisions I know whereof I speak .
Those of you voting for John McCain on the basis of fear of Obama are going down that path .
A vote against Obama will embarrass you later in life .
You 're going to very quickly come to realize -- well , those of you who are n't just blinder - clad partisan tools -- that the McCain campaign 's attacks on Obama were not just dishonest but ludicrous .
Let me put on my magic Slytherin predicting hat : Obama will govern from the center .
He will appoint a cabinet that will be more genuinely bi-partisan , or more to the point non-partisan , than any we 've seen in modern history .
Respected technocrats at Treasury .
A respected - by - the - military moderate , possibly a Republican , at Defense .
His inauguration speech will trouble the
He will reach out to Hillary as a force in the Senate to counterbalance Nancy Pelosi in the House .
He will focus on the economy and put more contentious issues on the back burner .
A year into his presidency the economy will have improved ( it always does : we 're the Americans , and this is n't 1929 , ) and he will have done nothing terribly radical or scary and the McCain smear and fear campaign will be a sort of vague memory .
Those that fell for it will deny ever having done so .
We 'll see whether I 'm right .
But I 'll tell you this : what I 've just described is the real right - wing fear .
The GOP 's hard right does n't fear a radical Obama : they 'd love a radical Obama .
It 's a successful Obama that terrifies them .
Following a second failed Bush with a second successful moderate Democrat would doom the genuinely radical dreams of the far right .
The GOP would be forced to the center .
Forced to compromise on abortion and gay rights .
Forced to choose between moving toward the center or letting themselves be entirely defined by the wingnuts .
The rest of you who cast a vote for McCain on the basis of your fears of Obama will feel like fools .
And by the way , you will be .
Just like I was in 1972 .

ATLANTA — Libertarian presidential candidate Bob Barr appealed Wednesday for the support of Republican - leaning conservatives by declaring his Republican rival John McCain is going to lose the election .
“ Sen . McCain will be spending the last two weeks before the election on his ‘ farewell tour ’ across America , ” Barr wrote in an e-mail message .
“ Sen. McCain ’s mixed and angry message , as well as his support of big - spending policies , have killed any chance McCain may have had to win this election . ”
The former Republican congressman from Georgia wrote that conservatives who want their vote to count should throw their support behind his long shot candidacy .
“ A vote for John McCain is a wasted vote , ” Barr said , but a vote for him would be viewed as a protest of the big- spending policies of McCain and President Bush , particularly their support for the $ 700 billion bailout of the financial industry .
“ Now , principled conservatives can vote their conscience instead of voting for a faux - conservative just because he carries the Republican label , ” Barr wrote .
Some Republicans have long worried that Barr could play spoiler in a close election if he draws disaffected conservatives from McCain .

Even though John McCain himself continues to say that Barack Obama is not a terrorist , his presidential campaign continues to press the Obama is a terrorist smear .
The latest attack came from McCain spokesman Michael Goldfarb who claims that Obama and Ayers are friends , so the Democrat does pal around with terrorists .
“ This much is clear : Barack Obama and William Ayers were friends before that relationship became a political embarrassment for the Illinois Senator - Obama did pal around with a terrorist .
According to his campaign , Barack Obama no longer believes Ayers has been rehabilitated .
And William Ayers did target his own country , ” Goldfarb said .
The McCain spokesman also fired back at Obama campaign manager David Plouffe who today accused Sarah Palin of making remarks that are , “ completely beyond the pale . ”
Goldfarb defended Palin ’s remarks , “ So what part of Governor ’s Palin ’s remarks are ‘ beyond the pale . ’
Perhaps Mr. Plouffe does not like Governor Palin ’s inference that Barack Obama palled around with Ayers because Barack Obama has a different view of America than most of us .
Yet the Obama campaign has offered no alternate explanation - they have not conceded that the relationship was simply the result of a serious error in judgment .
The only thing ‘ beyond the pale ’ here is the Obama campaign ’s failure to explain how it is that Barack Obama carried on a decade long friendship with a man who sought to topple the U.S. government through violence . ”

I do n’t know what ’s more surprising to me , the fact that John McCain seems to have no voice in , and control over his own presidential campaign , or the fact that there are people in his campaign who still believe that this sleaze will actually help McCain win the election .
The McCain campaign looks to be at war with itself .
The entire operation has been plagued with an internal disconnect of message .
For example , John McCain unveiled some new economic proposals today , but his campaign is still talking about Bill Ayers .
A well organized campaign would be maintaining their message discipline , and focused on McCain ’s message of the day , which is supposed to be the economy .
In contrast , the Obama campaign is extremely disciplined to the point where one rarely sees the candidate and his campaign not singing the same tune .
The only thing that these Obama - Ayers attacks are certain to do is create more backlash against McCain .
People do n’t care about Bill Ayers , heck even John McCain has said that he does n’t care about Ayers , so the question is , why is his campaign still talking about him ?
McCain campaign statement
Former Soviet leader joins forces with businessman to campaign for legal and economic reform
This article is more than 12 years old
This article is more than 12 years old
The former Soviet leader , Mikhail Gorbachev , is to launch a new political party with a Russian billionaire , Alexander Lebedev .
Lebedev , a businessman and banker whose company , National Reserve Corps , controls more than 30 % of the Russian national carrier , Aeroflot , announced the launch today and said the party would campaign for legal and economic reform .
Other policies are a stronger role for parliament , " less state capitalism " and the expansion of Russia 's independent media .
Lebedev and Gorbachev between them own 49 % of the independent newspaper Novaya Gazeta , which employed the reporter Anna Politkovskya , a fierce critic of the Kremlin who was reknowned for exposing human rights abuses in the Chechen conflict .
Her death in October 2006 was said to bear the hallmarks of a contract killing .
" I would call the new party project undoubtedly nonconformist , with one simple thought :
We cannot develop further as a country without independent political institutions , " Lebedev told the Russian state news agency RIA - Novosti .
Lebedev , a former state duma deputy who describes himself on his blog as a " capitalist - idealist " , said Gorbachev was the driving force behind the new group , which has provisionally been named the Independent Democratic party .
" He gave our people freedom but we just can't learn how to use it , " wrote Lebedev on his website .
Lebedev said there would be " no extremists " among the party 's prospective membership .
He suggested that economists and members of the right - wing SPS party , which played a role in Russia 's transition to a market economy , would be welcome to join .
He said he would not bankroll the party , but that it would be financed by " non-state sources " .
Gorbachev , 77 , won the 1990 Nobel peace prize for allowing the previous year 's largely peaceful revolutions across the eastern bloc , which saw the fall of communism in Europe .
But he became deeply unpopular at home as the break - up of the Soviet Union led to economic and political chaos , and when he last ran for president in 1996 , he won only 0.5 % of the vote .
The party will contest elections , although Mikhail Kuznetsov , the deputy chairman of Gorbachev 's political organisation , the Union of Social Democrats , said winning seats in the state duma , currently dominated by the Russia 's four biggest parties , was not the objective .
" Mikhail Sergeyevich ( Gorbachev ) is not striving to take seats in parliament , he is going to establish an independent democratic party and its task will be to let young people find fulfilment in new politics , " he said .
Gorbachev has in the past criticised many of the electoral practices of Vladimir Putin 's United Russia party , but has stopped short of personally attacking Putin , the former president who is now prime minister .
Gorbachev also backed Russia 's role in last month 's war with Georgia , which was widely condemned by the west .
Putin has been accused in the west and by Russian liberals of stifling free expression and the development of multi-party democracy .

It 's been a time since we had our last Web Design post , so I 've decided to search the next topic ... and since I was pretty hungry , my stomach did all the thinking to me .
So here are some cool restaurant sites designs .
It came up that the best way to design a Restaurant site is to make the good stuff really noticed .
If their ambiance is the hot thing , then you should really reserve a good spot on your design dedicated to it .
The same if there 's a really unique recipe .
Anyways , this is what I think about it ...
I bet you 'll get your own conclusion checking these out .
So c'mom and enjoy !

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
CONTACT : ( 212 ) 549-2666 ; media@aclu.org
NEW YORK – The American Civil Liberties Union obtained a government " manual " distributed to defense lawyers assigned to represent immigrant workers arrested and prosecuted in last May 's Postville , Iowa meatpacking raids .
The document – posted on the ACLU Web site today – contains prepackaged scripts for plea and sentencing hearings as well as documents providing for guilty pleas and waivers of rights that were used to push the more than 300 Postville workers through mass criminal proceedings as quickly as possible .
" This document provides further evidence of the government 's disturbing pressure cooker tactics for mass guilty pleas that assumed guilt instead of protecting the constitutional presumption of innocence , " said ACLU Immigrants '
Rights Project Director Lucas Guttentag .
" Along with the workers , fairness and due process were the victims of the Postville prosecutions . "
The government " manual " provided for the workers to waive all their legal rights and in the overwhelming majority of cases , to plead guilty to charges of falsely using identity documents for employment .
It was an important tool used to rush defendants through the criminal justice and immigration systems without a criminal trial or immigration proceedings .
The plea forms in the " manual " included a requirement barring immigrants from pursuing any legal claims or procedures under the immigration laws .
After the Postville meatpacking raids , the ACLU and many other organizations sharply condemned the denial of basic legal protections to the arrested immigrant workers .
The troubling system implemented by the U.S. Attorney 's Office and the Department of Homeland Security appeared designed to undermine fairness and due process by criminally prosecuting the workers under circumstances that undermined their ability to understand or protect their rights .
The large scale criminal prosecution of workers is a new tactic of the Bush administration .
Previously , charges of fraud and identity theft were usually reserved for cases that involved the theft of people 's identities to rob them of money and property and did not typically extend to the use of false papers for employment .
A copy of the Postville raids defense " manual " is available online at : www.aclu.org/immigrants/workplace/36215res20080731.html

Christina Brown
Christina Brown said she wanted her $ 30 back .
The cops said she must be crazy .
That 's how a 79 - year - old New Hope woman ended up having her head examined when she asked the SuperTarget in Plymouth to refund the $ 30 she had paid for shirts that did not fit .
When store workers offered her a gift certificate in return for the shirts , but would not give her cash , Christina Brown stood for her rights .
And standing , for her , is n't easy .
Born in Dublin , raised in England and a Minnesotan for more than 40 years , Brown is a feisty , funny woman who does n't let herself be pushed around , except in a wheel chair .
She will be 80 on Saturday , has her left leg in a brace and wears a patch over her left eye ( she lost her sight in the eye in a car accident last year ) .
Normally , she uses a wheel chair .
But on July 31 , she left her chair in her daughter Linda 's car and hobbled in to the Plymouth Target 's service counter , where she hoped to return the shirts she bought on July 28 while Linda waited by the curb .
Then the " ludicrous spectacle , " as Christina calls it , began .
She blames " Mr. Nasty . "
That 's the name she gave to the Target manager who , she says , barked at her to " take a gift certificate and get out . "
Christina , who had her sales receipt with her , did not want a gift certificate .
She wanted her money back .
As she leaned against the service counter , her leg aching , a crowd gathered .
She became upset with the store where she liked to shop ( " The rest of the staff has been like angels to me , " she says ) .
Target spokesman Dave Fransen says Target 's return policy does n't allow cash refunds for items purchased by personal check until seven days go by , allowing checks to clear the bank .
But Target is introducing new technology that allows electronic transfer of check funds , which appears to be what happened to Christina :
Her money was withdrawn from her bank account the day after her purchase .
Target had the proceeds from her check , Christina had her receipt and bank records showing her money had been withdrawn .
She wanted her $ 30 back .
" If they thought I was a cranky old biddy , they should just have given me my money and let me go , " she says , showing me the shirts she still wants to return .
" I paid in good faith , and I wanted my money back .
That 's all .
It 's the principle . "
Christina was stubborn but says she was not unruly .
She let fly one mild oath , but if she had wanted to curse like an Irish - English - American , she says , she could have blistered the walls in the paint department .
She 's not like that , though .
After her auto accident , she received therapy for her injuries and for traumatic stress , too .
When she mentioned these things at Target , she was interpreted to be saying she could blow at any moment .
What she was trying to say , she explains , is that she knows how to handle herself in a stressful situation .
" I 've learned you should focus your anger on the person who 's causing it , and not to lash out , " she says .
" I was very calm .
Mr. Nasty was baiting me , but I kept thinking : ' You can lower your mentality to their level , or be the lady you think you are . ' "
Christina said she would stay in the store until she got her money -- all day , if she had to .
At that point , she says , the store manager told her she was trespassing .
" I 'm not trespassing ; I 'm a customer , " she said .
" Give me my money and I 'll go . "
When the manager said he was going to call the cops , Christina beat him to the punch : Taking a cellphone from her purse , she dialed 9 - 1 - 1 and called police , asking them to come and help her .
Officers responded and later filled out a report , but no charges were filed .
The police report also says she asked to be arrested , but she denies that , saying , " I 'd have to be crazy to ask for that . "
" They can put you in jail for this , " she says a cop told her .
" Well , I 've got nothing else to do today , " she replied .
" Besides , I may meet a better class of people in jail . "
The store would n't budge .
Christina would n't bend .
A stretcher was brought in .
If you ever travel in Siberia then there are some chances that you will see some wooden houses like those are .
As you can see these houses are very interesting with its architecture , some of them really looks beautiful .
SAN FRANCISCO ( MarketWatch ) -- United Technologies Corp. utx said Monday it withdrew its offer for Diebold Inc. DBD , +2.41 % .
In February , United Technologies offered $ 40 - a- share for Diebold , which Diebold rebuffed in March .
" We had hoped we could negotiate a transaction that would have created substantial value for both your and our shareholders , " said United Technologies Chairman George David in a letter to Diebold Chairman John Lauer .
" It 's unfortunate this wo n't happen . "
Shares of Diebold rose 6.2 % to $ 30.03 , and shares of United Technologies rose 9.5 % to $ 52.15 in recent trading .
While this is not about raw milk , it is about raw foods being mistreated as controlled substances by the authorities .
You ’ve got to wonder what agenda is served in cases like this .
Sure , some bored customs officials got to act out their non-consenual bondage and interrogation fantasies on what was probably a cute and innocent young couple .
But beyond that ?
Every time I hear of a case like this my mind drifts off to thoughts of what some would say is the impending North American Union ( NAU ) , a future EU of North America , in which borders between Canada the US and Mexico are erased and we ’d have free movement of persons and goods along with a common currency , the Amero .
I think all this border harassment is preparation for the day when the NAU is announced , a day when the authorities hope that people who ’ve heard and experienced horror stories like this will breathe a sigh of relief because they ’ll think they wo n’t have to deal with these kind of customs nightmares anymore .
Perhaps , like Justin Trudeau , you think the NAU is the stuff of so called “ conspiracy theories ” .
Well , think like that no more .
Our Canadian prime minister Steven Harper has apparently gone on record as supporting the NAU , in a speech given to the Council on Foreign Relations .
You ’d think something as important as dissolving Canada ’s nationhood would be more of an election issue .
But the only party that seems to care is too small to appear on the radar of the corporate media .
And now , some excerpts from relevant sources :
First up is a story from the Toronto Star titled : “ Couple arrested for carrying raw chocolate – for the second time drug test falsely shows their confection to be hashish ” .
This story is from Sept 26 , 2008 and is by Robyn Doolittle :
“ The drug - sniffing dogs were coming .
They knew they were in trouble again – for carrying chocolate .
Even with their certified letter from the Department of Justice , which clearly outlined the organic chocolate they were carting across the U.S. border was , in fact , chocolate , Nadine Artemis and her partner , Ron Obadia , prepared themselves for the worst .
Sure enough , just like the last time , the couple was arrested and charged with exporting a controlled substance …. ”
“ …. ” At first the ( customs officials ) said , ‘ Oh , you guys are just holistic . ’
Then the dogs came . ”
The animals went nuts over the chocolate .
A rapid drug test was done , which returned a false positive result for hashish .
Artemis and Obadia , a yoga expert who once toured with the Barenaked Ladies , were arrested .
Their baby son was taken away .
“ They took us into separate rooms and interrogated us .
That ’s when they ( lied and ) told me Ron had confessed everything , ” she said .
“ We were absolutely dumbfounded , confounded , and , of course , afraid .
Utterly afraid . ”
They contacted criminal lawyer Marcy Segal .
By month ’s end , she had arranged for forensic testing that proved the chocolate was , in fact , just that .
The charges were dropped … . ”
And now here ’s an excerpt from a more in - depth report on the same case , from Mike Adams at NaturalNews.com :
“… Accused of trafficking two and a half pounds of hashish ( which was really just raw , homemade chocolate ) , Ron and Nadine were arrested , physically separated into interrogation rooms and handcuffed to chairs .
Their six - month old baby was forcibly taken from them , and they were immediately subjected to intense interrogation .
Their chocolate looked suspicious , they were told , because it was n’t in a commercial wrapper .
If it ’s not Hershey ’s , it must be drugs !
An on - the - spot drug test from the NIK company ( which makes portable drug testing kits ) returned a positive result , the Canadian police claimed , and that ’s all the evidence they need to arrest anyone .
As you ’ll learn later , however , it turns out the NIK drug testing kits return false positives nearly 100 % of the time if the results are interpreted incorrectly , as they were in this case … ( see photos below ) .
Is this Canada , or Gitmo ?
Emboldened by the positive drug test on the two pounds of raw chocolate , Canadian drug agents scrambled to action .
They had n’t seen a big drug bust in a long time , and excitement was brewing over the possibility of nabbing someone with a whopping two pounds of hashish !
Thus , the tyrants of law enforcement went to work on Ron and Nadine , using Guantanamo Bay tactics to try to force them to admit to being hashish drug traffickers .
Over the next several hours , Ron and Nadine were interrogated by the Canadian equivalent of FBI agents who verbally assaulted them using every lying , deceitful police interrogation tactic in the book .
They screamed at Ron and Nadine , threatened them with years in prison and even told each of them that the other had already confessed to drug trafficking , trying to trick them into admitting to crimes they never committed .
( There is no law that says police have to tell the truth when they are interrogating you , even for false arrest , by the way . )
Through the entire episode , Ron and Nadine resisted the tactics , held their ground and continued to hold positive intentions .
“ As I was sitting in the cell , ” Ron told NaturalNews , “ I kept focused on light and truth .
I felt like no matter what was happening around me , I was opening up a gateway of light and total truth . ”
After the interrogation , the threats of “ life in jail ” and other dishonest tactics used by law enforcement to try to get them to “ admit ” to drug trafficking , they were finally released on bail .
Their baby son was returned to them , and they went home .
For the next 30 days , they were subjected to surprise visits by Children ’s Aid employees ( the Canadian version of Child Protective Services ) , who were told by law enforcement authorities that Ron and Nadine were drug smugglers … . ”
Here ’s all the background and detail on this story in a printable form , again from NaturalNews.com
And now from Justin Trudeau ’s “ Ask Justin ” page on his website , a question and answer on our subject for today :
“ …. What is being done to stop the North American Union and the NAFTA Super Highway ?
You do n’t need to stop a conspiracy theory , you just need to stop feeding it .
There are legitimate concerns about the ‘ Security and Prosperity Partnership ’ ( SPP ) , particularly in regards to the lack of transparency and accountability of the process , but to wildly exaggerate those concerns and use them as a way to drum up xenophobic sentiment or advance a political agenda is something I wo n’t countenance .
We ’ve all had enough of the politics of division and fear , thank you very much … . ”
So why pick on Justin Trudeau , you ask .
Well he certainly seems like an idealistic young man with his heart in the right place , not your usual political reptile .
And yet even he either does n’t know or is n’t letting on .
I guess we have to go all the way to the Prince George Citizen to get the scoop on news that happened more than a year ago ( Sept. 25 , 2007 ) .
In this story by Paul Chen we learn that Prime Minister Harper officially endorses North American Union “ .
And thanks to the Conspiracy Culture folks for the link to this story .
Here ’s an excerpt :
“ … Harvard University educated CNN Veteran anchor Lou Dobbs , has further confirmed the official endorsement of the Stephen Harper Minority Conservative government on North American Union , or “ New America ” .
Mr. Harper has been apparently directed by the principal funders of the Conservative Party of Canada , which are ideologically linked to the CFR , to assimilate Canada into a new “ Fortress North America ” which is controlled by the U.S. political - military - industrial complex by no later than 2010 .
Building a “ North American Community ”
Indeed , the Stephen Harper government has been reported to be in the process of getting various Canadian government departments and agencies to “ harmonize ” , with U.S. governmental agencies , to expedite the assimilation of Canada into the neo-conservative vision of a “ Fortress North America ” .
The Council of Foreign Relations has indeed published a book on its North American Union manifesto entitled “ Building a North American Community ” .
John Manley , former Deputy Prime Minister in the Paul Martin Liberal Government is a co-author of this book .
Yes , my fellow Canadians , that is why Stephen Harper with ONLY a minority government , has been able to easily pursue North American Union , with what Mr. Lou Dobbs has referred to as a cabal at the CFR .
Political party elites including those among the Liberals and Bloc Québécois , have apparently been all co-opted by the very wealthy Council of Foreign Relations .
North American Union architects have used the North American Free Trade Agreement ( NAFTA ) to legitimate the take over of Canada by U.S. interests as a “ logical outcome ” of the terms of NAFTA .
“ When the leaders of Canada , Mexico , and the United States met in Texas recently they underscored the deep ties and shared principles of the three countries .
Security and Prosperity ”
“… Mr. Harper ’s speech at the CFR on 25 September 2007 affirms Mr. Harper ’s Security and Prosperity Partnership of North America ( SPPNA ) commitment to hand over Canada to full control by no later than 2010 , to a political fraternity which is associated with the current U.S. Bush administration .
Mr. Harper ’s government apparently reports to the CFR .
In effect , the Government of Canada appears to be governed not from a sovereign Parliament in Ottawa , but run through a New York City - based political fraternity , which seeks to replace a democratic form of government , with the rule of society by a “ Council of Wise Men ” .
The architects of such a fascistic government look upon their vision of society , to be much more “ efficient ” in dealing with the need to vanquish enemies , i.e. “ terrorists ” .
‘ New World Order ’
A terrorist is broadly defined by the architects of the North American Union , as any individual or group which opposes the New World Order agenda .
The CFR website also openly endorses the Conservative Party of Canada under Stephen Harper , alluding to his government having an alleged mandate to transform Canada substantively into a U.S. colony by implementing the recommendations of the CFR , book “ Building a North American Community ” … ”
The photo of Steven Harper is a frame grab from this video clip .
WASHINGTON -- Federal regulators have launched an inquiry into whether broadcast networks and military analysts violated federal sponsorship identification rules as a result of an effort by the Pentagon to increase favorable news coverage of the Iraq war .
Recently , the Federal Communications Commission sent letters to people mentioned in an April New York Times investigation of military analysts who received private briefings by senior Pentagon and White House officials and taken on tours of Iraq in exchange for more favorable ...
But sometimes mother nature is passive aggressive , throwing a horrifying curve ball out of the clear blue sky .
Something that you could never see coming .
Something that you probably did n't even know was possible .
For instance ...
Hurricanes , floods and tsunamis are all her little ways of letting us know that , deep down , she hates us .
Possibly for all those times we razed a forest to build a CostCo .

What the ...?
So there you are , minding your own business on a nice , clear day when you suddenly get totally killed by a big damn chunk of ice falling out of the sky .
This is n't wimpy hailstone bullshit , either .
Megacryometers ( the scientific name for " big damn chunk of ice falling out of the sky " ) are known to weigh up to 450 pounds or more .
And this is n't something you see in the arctic , either .
The largest stone on record was in Brazil ( a country known for its vast quantities of things that are n't ice ) and weighed in at a whopping 484 pounds .
That will crush your house .
Or at least fuck it up pretty good .

They 're also known to leave huge craters and are commonly mistaken for meteors .
Which they might as well be , if you 're the guy who just got his skull pulverized by one .
What ?
How ?!?
Science does n't exactly know how such a deadly projectile can form naturally .
For a while , they were thought to be ejections from airplane bathrooms , but the discharge from those airborn chemical toilets is always blue due to disinfectants they add .
These monster hail stones , on the other hand , are white and can fall pretty much anywhere with no real pattern .
Scientists did n't start seriously studying them until 2000 when Spain had a 10 - day hailstorm with stones up to six and a half pounds ... without so much as a cloud in the freaking sky .
They seem to be most common in the middle of winter .
And the middle of the summer .
Figure that out .

So what we 're saying is it 's pretty much like God is throwing darts at the Earth , except instead of darts ,
He uses chunks of ice that could kill an elephant .
Chances of it Happening to YOU :
These things happen in every part of the world with little rhyme or reason , except that whole thing about being more common in mid summer and mid winter , which obviously does nothing to help you .
The sky could pretty much fall right on top of you at any moment , any time of the year .
This one in the picture above fell in some dude 's living room while he was watching The Exorcist .
Seriously .
There 's not even some kind of warning , like high winds or sudden temperature change , just a quick whooshing sound before impact .
You 'll have just enough time to look up before the giant hailstone wipes the surprised look off your face , or more accurately wipes your surprised face off of you .

Proposals for a central database of all mobile phone and internet traffic have been condemned as " Orwellian " .
Home Secretary Jacqui Smith said the police and security services needed new powers to keep up with technology .
And she promised that the content of conversations would not be stored , just times and dates of messages and calls .
But the Lib Dems slammed the idea as " incompatible with a free country " , while the Tories called on the government to justify its plans .
Details of the times , dates , duration and locations of mobile phone calls , numbers called , website visited and addresses e-mailed are already stored by telecoms companies for 12 months under a voluntary agreement .
The data can be accessed by the police and security services on request - but the government plans to take control of the process in order to comply with an EU directive and make it easier for investigators to do their job .
Information will be kept for two years by law and may be held centrally on a searchable database .
Without increasing their capacity to store data , the police and security services would have to consider a " massive expansion of surveillance , " Ms Smith said in a speech to the Institute for Public Policy Research earlier .
' Vital capability '
She said : " Our ability to intercept communications and obtain communications data is vital to fighting terrorism and combating serious crime , including child sex abuse , murder and drugs trafficking .
" Communications data - that is , data about calls , such as the location and identity of the caller , not the content of the calls themselves - is used as important evidence in 95 % of serious crime cases and in almost all security service operations since 2004 .
There are no plans for an enormous database which will contain the content of your emails , the texts that you send or the chats you have on the phone or online
Jacqui Smith
Analysis : Behind the times ?
" But the communications revolution has been rapid in this country and the way in which we intercept communications and collect communications data needs to change too .
" If it does not we will lose this vital capability that we currently have and that , to a certain extent , we all take for granted .
" The capability that enabled us to convict Ian Huntley for the Soham murders and that enabled us to achieve the convictions of those responsible for the 21/7 terrorist plots against London . "
She said the " changes we need to make may require legislation " and there may even have to be legislation " to test what a solution to this problem will look like " .
There will also be new laws to protect civil liberties , Ms Smith added , and she announced a public consultation starting in the New Year on the plans .
" I want this to be combined with a well - informed debate characterised by openness , rather than mere opinion , by reason and reasonableness , " she told the IPPR .
' Necessity '
These proposals are incompatible with a free country and a free people

Ms Smith attempted to reassure people that the content of their e-mails and phone conversations would not be stored .
" There are no plans for an enormous database which will contain the content of your emails , the texts that you send or the chats you have on the phone or online .
" Nor are we going to give local authorities the power to trawl through such a database in the interest of investigating lower level criminality under the spurious cover of counter terrorist legislation .
" Local authorities do not have the power to listen to your calls now and they never will in future .
You would rightly object to proposals of this kind and I would not consider them .
" What we will be proposing will be options which follow the key principles which govern all our work in this area - the principles of proportionality and necessity . "
But the idea of storing phone and e-mail records has provoked concern among experts .
The government 's own reviewer of anti-terror laws , Lord Carlile , said : " The raw idea of simply handing over all this information to any government , however benign , and sticking it in an electronic warehouse is an awful idea if there are not very strict controls about it . "
' Soft soap ' claim Shadow home secretary Dominic Grieve , for the Conservatives , said he welcomed Ms Smith 's consultative approach but added her speech " begs mores questions than it answers " .
" These proposals would mark a substantial shift in the powers of the state to obtain personal information on individuals , " he said , adding : " The government must present convincing justification for such an exponential increase in the powers of the state . "
Lib Dem home affairs spokesman Chris Huhne said : " The government 's Orwellian plans for a vast database of our private communications are deeply worrying .
" I hope that this consultation is not just a sham exercise to soft - soap an unsuspecting public . "
He said the government had repeatedly shown it could not be trusted with sensitive data , adding : " There is little reason to think ministers will be any less slapdash with our phone and internet records .
" Ministers claim the database will only be used in terrorist cases , but there is now a long list of cases , from the arrest of Walter Wolfgang for heckling at a Labour conference to the freezing of Icelandic assets , where anti-terrorism law has been used for purposes for which it was not intended . "
" Our experience of the Regulation of Investigatory Powers Act suggests these powers will soon be used to spy on people 's children , pets and bins .
" These proposals are incompatible with a free country and a free people . "

What are these ?
This is total cosmic karmic goodness at its best .
Here I am with a minute windfall for working during Hurricane Ike , and I have been eying netbooks for months now , waiting with bated breath to pounce on one .
I have compared every one that 's not Unicorn Like ( Lenovo , Dell , MSI , ECS ... I 'm looking at you , you trifling bitches )
It came down to the Eee 901 and the Acer Aspire One ....
I was gonna give Linux a go , but this pretty much seals it for me , and here 's why :
1 . Too many damn Linux Distros ( Flavors )
why must I have to figure what what distro I have in order to get what I want .
Fedora , Ubuntu , Xandros , Linpus , Lindows , Octopussy , Red Hat Condom , Suse Homemaker , and they are not all integrated SEAMLESSLY .
I know with Mac ( gasp ! ) or Windows , it may be a different face but its the same guts on the inside and I can pretty much port from one iteration to the next .
Linux has more damn distros than MGS has Snake Characters .
2. Support is Sketchy at best due to above .
3. Terminal ... not all of us want to learn code in order to compute , upgrade or add software , as computer literate as I am , that is a huge turnoff ... give me some WYSIWYG and wizard clones and a NICE README file and we are good .
4. Lack of OS continutity and unity .
If we can get it down to one or 2 main distros with " lite " versions of each for netbooks then I may be a convert .
But with so much disunity amoung Linux , how can I choose when I have no idea which flavor truly tastes the best ... especially when everyone can argue for their specific flavor .
Help a techno - Monk out and tell me I 'm wrong
In George Orwell ’s 1984 , people ’s thinking was controlled in part by controlling the media .
Nobody noticed that the media favoured war with X and peace with Y .
It ’s just what everyone was saying .
And the bias was more powerful because it was invisible .
Journalists and others working in Australian media no doubt pride themselves on being fair and tolerant .
They zealously attack anyone they can accuse as “ racist ” or “ intolerant ” .
But one group remains fair game for the media to attack : men .
Let ’s look at some evidence and then ask why this is so .
Television shows of all kinds love to cast stories as a fight between good and evil .
The heroes are often cast as victims in the media ’s controlled world .
Robert Hughes has called this “ a culture of complaint ” .
Thus innocent victims ( nobody sees this phrase as redundant ) appear as oppressed by powerful , dark forces .
The victims can be ethnic people or Aborigines or women .
The villains can be bureaucrats or police or almost anyone .
And all too often , the villains are men .

TV ads show us a world in which men are fools and clowns .
In one ad , a dad gets hit in the testicles by a tennis ball : later , he is hit on the head .
In another , a dopey guy is washing his spanner in the washing machine ( what person of normal intelligence would do that ? ) .
In retaliation , his wife or partner crashes the spanner down on his head .
The same story is relentlessly carried through in TV comedies .
It ’s forbidden to show violence against anyone , unless , of course , it ’s a man .
And then it ’s funny , apparently .
I do n’t mind the odd joke about men : we are all funny at times .
But let me be clear : I do not approve of violence to anyone .
Research suggests ( though the links are complex ) that TV violence encourages violence in the community .
I agree to a large extent with the comments by Greg Melleuish in another article in On Line Opinion , although I make some mitigating comments .
Many university departments are vocal in support of various kinds of feminism , but they do n’t support men .
Departments like sociology and education are strongly feminist , although engineering and business are far less so .
Universities shut women out for many years and belittled women ’s concerns .
Now many departments have gone the other way , without ever having achieved a balance .
And this influences many social - comment and general journalists , although not the sports and business writers .
Nobody wants to be labelled anti-feminist , because that would be anti-progressive .
But being progressive makes too many people support fashionable opinions .
Feminists complain loudly if people patronise or put down women : and good luck to them .
But nobody objects if writers attack men .
And educated journalists are so anxious to support feminism that most do not bother to support men at all .
So the more educated the media , the more likely it is that men are given a hard time .
For example , Sydney ’s Daily Telegraph is less hostile to men than is the Sydney Morning Herald .
A recent Saturday ’s Herald had - as usual - a number of articles in Good Weekend written by , for and about women .
This supplement is also carried by The Age .
Perhaps it is meant to be a magazine mainly for women .
Of course , there is nothing inherently wrong with that .
But where is the sensible discussion about men - apart from men ’s behaviour being criticised , analysed , and ridiculed ?
The Saturday Herald also carries an arts - and - letters section called Spectrum .
This , too , is largely about women and their concerns .
The same edition of the paper contained the following : Bridget Jones ’
Diary , a satirical feature about women and pregnancy ; an article about a book club ( apparently female ) by a woman ; an article about health , by a woman illustrated by pictures of fit young women ; and an article by Daphne Guinness about why women make better journalists .
The sub - headline for this last article gives us a choice excerpt from the article : “ News editors should keep a copy of … as a reminder that male reporters are less interesting . ”
There were other articles in this section , about arts , entertainment and so on which are not relevant to this discussion .
But observe that it is acceptable for women to say they are better than men , talk about women ’s concerns , and talk about why boyfriends or husbands , or other men , annoy them .
There is no equivalent argument from the men ’s side .
And who would dare to say that men are more interesting than women ?

To be fair , male working - class unemployment is reported occasionally .
There has been discussion about boys ’ educational difficulties , sometimes by people who actually know something about them .
And there was discussion of male depression and suicide in the aftermath of a prominent footballer ’s death .
I have on occasions been able to get a small piece in the Herald about men ’s issues .
But on most days , nobody could find much in the Herald sympathetic to men .
There is little or nothing about men’s health in the weekly Health supplement .
And yet males have many specific health concerns which are not shared by women .
Once a year , the Good Weekend has a so - called “ men ’s issue ” in which men are tartly analysed , some comical pieces are turned out , or men are allowed to make a few jokes - before being banished from the pages for another year .
A recent Herald feature on university entry was illustrated with pictures of approximately six women , one man , and a cat .
The cat had as much right to university entry as men do , apparently .
I could go through most sections of almost any Australian newspaper and make the same point .
Women ’s concerns , their trials and journeys are articulated from a sympathetic viewpoint .
And this is as it should be .
But men ’s journeys , sensitivities and feelings are mainly ignored , made light of , or ridiculed .
A discussion of fatherhood or male circumcision - seemingly experiences only men would understand - will often be written about by a woman .
The parallel - a man writing about the experience of pregnancy - would be ludicrous or impossible .
The different ways that a man expresses his masculinity gets pigeonholed into silly , patronising comments about SNAGS ( sensitive new - age guys ) .
But men themselves are not allowed to talk about these issues in their own words .
If you 've read Ars ' review of the iPhone 3G , you know our opinion on its usefulness as a replacement for the ubiquitous Blackberry family from RIM .
( Hint : not quite there yet . )
That does n't mean the two communication / Internet handhelds are n't going up against each other for market and mind share .
Determining exactly what impact the new iPhone will have on RIM 's chunk of the smartphone market appears to be tricker than you might think , though .
At least one market analyst seems to think RIM is doomed , and dropped his rating on the stock yesterday to " underperform " citing the iPhone 3G as his reason .
According to Charlie Wolf of Needham & Co. , the main force behind RIM 's recent success in the market has been lack of competition rather than innovation , and he seems to think it 's all over now that the iPhone 3G is ( sort of ) available .
Not so fast , says Peter Misek of Cannaccord Adams .
Yesterday , Misek announced he was not only maintaining his " buy " rating on RIM , but raising his revenue and earnings estimates for their next fiscal quarter ( which ends in August ) .
Misek predicts shipments from RIM will improve from 6.1 million units to 6.25 million versus Apple 's one million sales this past weekend , and notes that activations are up 20 to 30 percent over the last six weeks .
So who 's right ?
Well , if recent surveys are any indication , the smart money is on the iPhone 3G .
However , until Apple addresses the iPhone 's limitations when it comes to the Blackberry 's signature service , enterprise e-mail support , the most likely result is that both devices will simply continue to stomp the everliving bejesus out of Palm .
You can expect this issue to be revisited again later in the year , once the iPhone has been available minus the 3 to 4 hour wait in line .

About Our Namesake
Jon was many things to many people in the Internet :
Click here for public relations material .
In its infancy , Jon worked on its development , from its early protocols , to the creation of TCP / IP .
Documenter and co-developer many of the key Internet standards , including TCP / IP ( basic Internet protocols ) , SMTP ( email transfer ) , and DNS ( name servers ) .
Editor of the RFC series from April 7 , 1969 ( its inception ) until his untimely departure in Oct. 1998 , covering over 2400 RFCs , and advocate of clean , conservative protocol design and specification .
See RFC - 2555 for more information .
Co-author of over 204 Internet RFCs
The Internet Assigned Numbers Authority ( IANA ) , and advocate of conservation of protocol and port numbers .
Jon 's influence is felt throughout the Internet , in its protocols , in their documentation , in the DNS names we use and the ' dot ' we use to separate them , and , in no small way , in the ' good engineering ' that helped the Internet thrive from its inception in 1969 to today .
Jon was essentially a shepherd of the Internet .
He watched over it , and helped husband its resources by suggesting simplicity , conservatism , and completeness in its protocols .
Jon worked at ISI from March 21 , 1977 , and since January 1 , 1997 was the Division Director of USC / ISI 's Computer Networks Division , which hosts Postel Center .
Futher information about Jon can be found here , as well as in Internet RFC - 2468 ( as in " who do we appreciate :- ) " .
Quotes
" It 's perfectly appropriate to be upset .
I thought of it in a slightly different way -- like a space that we were exploring and , in the early days , we figured out this consistent path through the space : IP , TCP , and so on .
What 's been happening over the last few years is that the IETF is filling the rest of the space with every alternative approach , not necessarily any better .
Every possible alternative is now being written down .
And it 's not useful . "

a lab and graduate research fellows , to perform research in support of the visiting scholars
an endowment , to support visiting scholars , graduate research fellows , and the lab year - round
It is hoped that the output of the center will be publications , research , and reports that help address key issues in the evolution of the Internet , in helping to educate the community on aspects of long - standing issues ( the end - to - end argument , conservative protocol design , etc. ) , to examine current and emerging protocols and standards , and to perform the kind of research and examination that is of general benefit to the Internet community .
Finally , one thing apparent from the brevity of the note about Jon above is how little of his legacy is documented .
Postel Center also plans to further document Jon 's legacy to the Internet , and examine other ways to archive Internet history for the future .
The Postel Center for Experimental Networking is intended to carry Jon's legacy forward , to continue his husbandry of the Internet .
Critical to that mission are the following aspects :

Why is n't this storyline being pushed harder by the mainstream media ?
Maybe I have n't been paying as close attention as I should but this story is so important that even the whacko
Ted Kaczynski - types living out in the woods should hear about it .
This should clearly be much more than a one - day news cycle story .
This is much bigger than the biggest of gaffes because this was n't an inadvertent mistake on her part .
This was a willful decision to outright lie by the person who wants to have one of the most powerful , and potentially the most powerful , position in the world .
And she expects us to be okay with her lying ?
We 're just supposed to accept it because she colors here lies with some colloquialisms ?
Wake up , media !
Since when has it become seemingly acceptable for a Vice Presidential Candidate to demonstrate a complete separation from reality ?
IMHO , this story should be the lead story on every newscast until Sarah Palin explains how she can claim the report found " no unlawful or unethical activity on my part " when the report says " Governor Sarah Palin abused her power by violating Alaska Statute 39.52.110 ( a ) of the Alaska Executive Branch Ethics Act. Alaska Statute 39.52.110 ( a ) provides . "
I am stunned , absolutely stunned that any politician would have the audacity to make such a patently false claim .
She is denying an undeniable fact .
As many , including the Washington Post 's Fact Checker which gave Palin the maximum Four Pinnochios ( and has there ever been a better case for Five Pinnochios ? ) , have noted this is not a question about the fairness of the report .
This is a factual issue about what the report found .
And Palin is in absolute 100 % denial of reality .
She does n't even try to spin the facts in her favor , she just denies they even exist .
My mom worked at a mental hospital when I was growing up and I spent a lot of time around her patients .
There were quite a few who were way out of touch with reality ( I met everyone from Queen Elizabeth to Eleanor Roosevelt to Michael Jackson ) but I think even most of them could read the first finding of the Branchflower Report and correctly conclude that Sarah Palin , as Governor of Alaska , violated the state ethics law , which clearly means her activities were both unlawful and unethical .
I recently read about a dominant who switches being tut - tutted by submissives who insist that they are not a “ Real Dominant . ”
* shudder *
34 things wrong with that , but I will only address one .
I also have heard dominants assert that they refuse to bottom .
Should someone who is not self - identified as a top or dominant ever switch ?
In a word , “ Yes ! ”
In two words , “ FUCK YEAH ! ”
In twelve words , “ Yes , if you want a shot at owning my curvy black ass . ”
The truth is that all experience , being subjective , is therefore subject to interpretation .
A masochist is certainly going to have a different experience of pain than is a person not wired to sexualize the intense stimuli usually interpreted as pain .
However , I do not feel this absolves a person who chooses to dole out pain from being enhanced by having experienced some quantity of that pain .
If one had physical limitations to intense play , that certainly is a reason to not experience painful sensation yourself .
However , creating sensation is a very complex act of choreography .
A choreographer , sure , does not HAVE to do the dance moves to create gorgeous wondrous works .
They could , theoretically , still create art with the bodies that they sculpt on - stage .
But I would be surprised to find a choreographer who was not themselves a dancer in some phase of their career …
Or a chef who intuits , improvises , creates , executes and serves a dish without EVER tasting it .
Would you eat that ?
As a dancer , would you want a choreographer who had never sweat and broken their bodies in the way that they ask you to do in service to their vision ?
Sure you COULD .
An aficionado of dance , after years of study , could certainly put together a nice piece that would be pleasing to the eye .
But I will put money and heart behind the fact that it would never , ever have the soul or guts or skeleton , sinew and heart of a piece that the choreographer and dancer (s ) put together from communal knowledge and shared experience
It takes a metric fuckton of trust to let someone take several feet of kangaroo hide tipped with Teflon , get it traveling at the fucking speed of sound and throw that punishing destructive force at my body .
Yet you see that on an average day in an average dungeon on any given Saturday night .
I would like …OK , No .
I need to know that the person throwing that whip at me has a clue what they are asking me to take , in a REAL visceral way .
Theoretically , you can sympathize with my plight , and my head - space .
But if you have not been there , it is all theory .
You cannot , by definition , CAN NOT empathize with me because you have not been there in your own body .
And empathy is very sexy for me .
That does not necessarily make you less skilled .
It means you are ignorant of the mindset that CAN occur in your own body when faced with the emotional stress of pain and the mental stress of trust .
If you have not been tied up , KNOWING how bondage MAY impact your thinking and your emotional arc is simply beyond your experience .
If it is not within your experience to be tied up and beaten , can you really know how hard it is to process additional pain when you are immobilized ?
How it can grow to an insane frustration that can take you right out of head space …or how it can push you rapidly to a communicative event horizon of panic ?
Or are you guessing , based on your interpretation of what you can see and what your partner can tell you , and your own subjective experience ?
There are many ways to learn .
In my experience , experience is a peerless teacher .
I have immense respect for dominants and masters who take their welts in the interest of knowing , as fully as they can , what it is that they ask of their property .
I prefer those people as my play partners .
It is not a requisite for everyone .
It is not something I require in a casual , scene - delineated play - space .
It is a core need for me if I am to submit to someone .
I am going to go much further for a top who I KNOW has direct understanding of what they are doing to , with and for me .
If I am taking 50 lashes with a single - tail , and I get to 45 and I think I am about to call out of the scene because I am at the psychological and physical breaking point , and the person administering the beating takes me in hand , looks me in the eyes and says “ I know this is difficult , and I know how much it takes for you to accept this , but it pleases me for you to do this , for me , and to bear it well . ” and I KNOW that they have pleasure and yet they trust me to take that from them , the power exchange becomes blindingly miraculous .
If I know that the top has never been beaten , or has no direct knowledge of what even one good pop from a 10 ′ single - tail feels like , I know I will quail in that moment because my gut will whisper “ They know not what they ask ! ” and I will lack the strength to trust in their capacity to really know how this energy flows .
It is a dance , it is a banquet , it is breath , it is love and it is danger .
My owner is the choreographer , the chef , the air , the lover , and the risk I take .
And I really need to know that my Dominant My Master , My Daddy … .
I need to know that have been there before me .
Light Blue Optics Demonstrates Matchbox - sized PVPro™ Projector Evaluation Kit
Light Blue Optics Ltd ( LBO ) has developed a revolutionary technology for miniature laser projectors dubbed PVPro™ .
Today they announced their latest demonstrator unit , which is only 3.78 cubic inches in volume , and is similar in size and shape to a typical matchbox .
Projectors based on PVPro technology can be used to display images from a range of mobile devices , including laptop computers , personal media players like the video iPod , digital cameras and even mobile phones .
LBO has developed unique laser - based projection technology , which uses computational algorithms and novel optical techniques to allow miniature lasers to display video images in real - time using the diffractive nature of laser light .
This overcomes the size limitation of conventional projection techniques , allowing projectors to be smaller than ever before .
Understand that there is no glass , no prisms , NO MOVING PARTS , and no need for fans to provide heat dissipation .
In addition , it runs on less than 1.5W at full power and less than 350 mW while displaying typical video images ( 50 % average pixel amplitude .
There is also an infinite focus , meaning that no matter how close or far away , there are no optics to adjust for a clear picture .
The latest monochrome ' micro- mini ' version represents the third generation of the PVPro algorithms and optomechanical design .
It is a crucial step in allowing the company 's customers to manufacture compact projectors for use in a range of applications .
Nic Lawrence , CEO , commented , " Our vision is to make it simple for people to share photos with their friends and to comfortably view mobile TV and music videos from their mobile devices .
We believe that access to a large display , such as is provided by our PVPro projection technology , is key to increasing ease of use . "
Plus it 's just plain cool .
The advantage of the Light Blue Optics approach is to address the four key requirements for a small batterypowered device .
These are compact size , low power consumption , which allows the projector to be powered by typical portable battery technology , ease of use due to the focus - free operation of the system , and robustness both physically and in terms of error - tolerance .
PVPro technology is available today to manufacturers as an evaluation kit which includes a demonstration projector unit , appropriate PC software , technical documentation and a bundled package of technical support .
Light Blue Optics is working with a select group of strategic partners to bring to market the first products based on PVPro technology .
Quick Specs :
Color Depth : Monochrome Green at 532nm ( full color available late 2006 )
Depth of Focus : Infinite ( image remains in focus at any distance from the projector )
Resolutions Supported : QCIF , CIF , VGA , NTSC , 1024x512 ( resolutions up to 2048x1280 including SXGA and S - HDTV available upon request )
Typical Diagonal Image & Brightness : 15 " @ 50cd / m^2 ( all pixels full brightness ) ; 15 " @ 200cd / m^2 ( 50 % max average pixel amplitude )
Aspect Ratio Image : 7 " @ 220cd / m^2 ( all pixels full brightness ) ; 7 " @ 880cd / m^2 ( 50 % max average pixel amplitude )
Electrical Power Consumption : 1.4W ( max pixel power , all pixels ) ; < 350 mW ( 50 % max average pixel amplitude )
Light Blue Optics will be demonstrating the miniature PVPro evaluation kit at the 3GSM World Congress in Barcelona , February 13 - 16 2006 .
