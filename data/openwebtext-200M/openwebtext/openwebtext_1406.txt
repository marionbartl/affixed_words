The Obama administration is planning to use the government ’s enormous buying power to prod private companies to improve wages and benefits for millions of workers , according to White House officials and several interest groups briefed on the plan .
By altering how it awards $ 500 billion in contracts each year , the government would disqualify more companies with labor , environmental or other violations and give an edge to companies that offer better levels of pay , health coverage , pensions and other benefits , the officials said .
Because nearly one in four workers is employed by companies that have contracts with the federal government , administration officials see the plan as a way to shape social policy and lift more families into the middle class .
It would affect contracts like those awarded to make Army uniforms , clean federal buildings and mow lawns at military bases .
Although the details are still being worked out , the outline of the plan is drawing fierce opposition from business groups and Republican lawmakers .
They see it as a gift to organized labor and say it would drive up costs for the government in the face of a $ 1.3 trillion budget deficit .
It will soon be half a century since the American astronomer Frank Drake first pointed a radio telescope at the star Tau Ceti in the hope of picking up an extraterrestrial broadcast , and we still have n't heard anything .
So is there anyone out there ?
Fifty years ago Frank Drake – then a young astronomer from Cornell University – began an experiment that would have profound implications for humanity 's understanding of its place in the cosmos .
He turned the newly constructed Green Bank radio telescope in West Virginia towards Tau Ceti , a nearby star that is similar to our own Sun .
His purpose was simple : he wanted to pick up transmissions from any alien civilisations that might be flourishing on planets in orbit round Tau Ceti .
Drake and other scientists had realised that for the previous 40 years our own increasingly powerful radar , radio and TV transmissions – of news programmes and I Love Lucy shows – had formed an expanding shell of electromagnetic radiation that was spreading across space .
Picked up by alert aliens , these signals would tell them that Homo sapiens had arrived in their full intellectual and cultural glory .
And , of course , what was true for earthling transmissions would also be true for broadcasts made by aliens .
We should be able to hear theirs just as they could listen to ours .
So Drake set up Project Ozma – named after the Land of Oz , a place where exotic beings lived – and in early April 1960 turned the Green Bank telescope towards Tau Ceti .
It would be humanity 's first attempt to pick up radio signals from intelligent beings beyond our solar system .
Green Bank was a state - of - the - art observatory , we should note , though it was relatively crudely equipped by today 's standards .
" The radio receiver used vacuum tubes , there was no computer and we only had an old reel - to - reel tape recorder to record any alien voices we might pick up , " Drake recalls .
For half an hour the team listened to the noise of Tau Ceti – a persistent , meaningless hiss – before they switched stars , to Epsilon Eridani , another Sun - like neighbour that they had already selected to be their second target .
This time they got a very different response : a series of regular , clearly artificial pulses boomed from the receiver 's loudspeakers .
The team had struck extraterrestrial gold almost at the first attempt , it seemed .
" Could it be this easy ? "
Drake wondered .
Then a few control adjustments revealed the truth .
The " transmissions " from Epsilon Eridani were in fact coming from a nearby military base .
Despite continued efforts over the next two months to detect intelligent signals from the two stars , in various different wavelengths , Drake 's team of young astronomers drew a complete blank .
Thus human beings ' first search for intelligent aliens ended without finding a hint that there was anyone " out there " .
Scientists heard nothing then and , more to the point , we have heard nothing since then .
Despite half a century of trying to eavesdrop on ET , by pointing telescopes of increasing power at thousands of stars , and by searching across millions of different radio frequencies , not a single signal has ever been picked up to suggest that somewhere in our galaxy there is a life form , other than ourselves , that possesses an IQ that ever rises above room temperature : not a snatch of an episode of the Archers of Arcturus , or even a snippet of news about climate change rows on Betelgeuse .
All we have picked up is static .
The rest is silence .
But why have we not heard from ET after half a century of searching ?
There are a lot of stars – and , by inference , lots of planets – out there , after all , and plenty of potential homes on which aliens could evolve .
So why has n't one had the courtesy to make itself known to us ?
It is a good question , one that was originally posed by the Italian physicist and Nobel laureate Enrico Fermi , one of the founders of quantum physics .
If intelligent life is common in the universe , we would have been contacted long ago , he argued .
After all , Earth is relatively young in astronomical terms while alien civilisations elsewhere in the universe have had billions of years to rise , establish themselves and make themselves known to humanity .
" So where are they ? " asked Fermi .
This is Fermi's paradox and scientists – despite all their efforts – still struggle to resolve it .
Much of their problem lies with the basic make - up of our galaxy , they complain .
The Milky Way is an unremarkable group of stars , in a not very special part of the cosmos that contains 100bn stars , a promising enough number if seeking the odd intelligent alien , you might have thought .
However , most of these stars are going to be too big , too short - lived , too hot or too cold to support planets that might sustain intelligent life , say astronomers .
Thus the hunt to find the homes of clever ETs becomes less of a steady systematic search and more of a hunt for a planetary needle in a galactic haystack .
In fact , it is becoming clear that astronomers may have to search through the radio spectrums of millions of stars before we stumble on an artificial signal from an alien .
And there are other reasons why our galaxy is not alive with the sound of extraterrestrial twitter ( see box on the Drake equation above ) .
Alien life may be commonplace but rarely evolves into complex beings , for example .
Planets may support life – but only the single - cell , plankton type that coat their oceans and rocks .
In other words , all aliens are scum .
" And let 's face it , pond scum does n't qualify as intelligent life , " says Seth Shostak , chief astronomer for the Search for Extraterrestrial Intelligence ( Seti ) , the US group dedicated to the hunt for aliens .
Indeed , it may be that the circumstances that led to the creation of life here are so unusual as to make us , and other earthly creatures , a unique galactic experiment , an argument put forward by US astronomers Peter D Ward and Donald Brownlee in Rare Earth : Why Complex Life Is Uncommon in the Universe ( Copernicus ) .
Earth , from their perspective , turns out to be prime galactic real estate .
First , our sun is a highly stable star and is unaffected by wild fluctuations in radiation output .
Such afflictions affect many other stars and would destroy evolving life forms .
Similarly our solar system is situated in a safe suburban part of the galaxy , the astronomical equivalent of Cheltenham .
It is therefore undisturbed by close neighbouring stars that could dislodge the swathes of comets believed to hover at the edges of most solar systems and cause them to crash into our planet .
For good measure , our world is further blessed in having a relatively large moon which helped stabilise Earth 's rotation , preventing wild swings in our seasons and climate .
In other words , the primitive slime that evolved on Earth four billion years ago was blessed with privileged conditions that allowed it , eventually , to evolve , about 250,000 years ago , into the only intelligent creatures known to science , ourselves .
Humanity may therefore be viewed as the outcome of the biggest accumulator bet in the universe .
' Earth is a charmed place , " says Brownlee .
" We know of no other body that is even remotely like it . "
Or it could be that extraterrestrial civilisations are 10 a penny in our galaxy but doomed from the start .
Aliens may simply be like us : just smart enough to invent technology but not clever enough to control it .
Thus they may be snuffing themselves out round the galaxy almost as fast as they develop technology , an argument put forward by the evolutionary expert Stephen Jay Gould .
" Perhaps any society that could build a technology for such interplanetary travel must first pass through a period of potential destruction where technological capacity outstrips social or moral restraint .
Perhaps , no , or very few , societies can ever emerge intact from such a crucial episode . "
Such arguments get short shrift from other astronomers , however .
Scientists , led by Drake , Shostak , the late Carl Sagan and others , have argued that absence of evidence is very different from evidence of alien absence .
For a start , says Shostak , alien hunting has been stymied – until recently – by a lack of equipment and resources .
Governments have consistently refused to fund Seti programmes and so its practitioners have had to borrow time on astronomical radio telescopes , usually for only a few days at a time .
At best , they have been able to look at a few promising stars over a range of a few radio frequencies .
" It 's like trying to do medical research when you have to go next door to borrow a microscope for a couple of hours at most , " adds Shostak .
However , Seti scientists are now building their own telescopes , a classic example being the Allen Array , funded through a $ 11.5 m donation from Paul Allen , co-founder – with Bill Gates – of Microsoft .
To date , 42 radio telescopes , each with a six - metre diameter , have been erected at a site north - east of San Francisco .
When the project is complete , a total of 350 dishes will transform earthlings ' hunt for aliens .
" When we do get a signal – and I am betting it will happen before 2025 – we will follow its source very carefully across the sky , as the Earth rotates , " says Shostak .
" Then we will ask other observatories to check it out , and if they back us we will simply announce the existence of a message from ET .
There will be no message to the president and no interference from Men in Black .
" As to the nature of the alien that is sending the signal , I am pretty sure they will resemble us in one way .
Computers will run devices like the Allen Array and I strongly suspect the first contact will come from one of their computers talking to one of ours . "
However , the biology of aliens themselves is virtually unguessable , most astronomers agree .
ET could be of almost any size or shape you could imagine , though most scientists believe he or she is likely to be a carbon - based being like ourselves , from a world , like ours , that is rich in water , the matrix of life .
Indeed , there are some scientists who maintain that the similarities between us and them may turn out to be too close for comfort .
The Cambridge University palaeontologist Simon Conway Morris says the process of biological convergence – which produces similar species from organisms from very different evolutionary origins – makes it likely that aliens will be very similar to us , not just in design but in attitude and behaviour .
" Extraterrestrials … wo n't be splodges of glue … they could be disturbingly like us , and that might not be a good thing – we do n't have a great record , " Conway Morris says .
And you know what he means .
Humans have wiped out countless species on Earth , including the Neanderthals .
Aliens could be just as bad , if not worse .
So if ET does phone in , it may be best not to pick up the receiver , it is suggested .
On the other hand , the sheer scale of the universe offers us protection .
Proxima Centauri , the nearest star to our Sun , is four light years away .
That means that a photon from it – travelling at 186,000 miles per second , the speed of light – takes four years to reach us ( a distance of around 23 million million miles ) .
Suppose then we find intelligent life on a reasonably close star – say one that is 50 light years distant .
That means conversations will proceed at a stately rate of a century an interchange .
We wo n't learn a lot that way .
On the other hand , we will have a lot of notice if our new neighbours start taking an unhealthy interest in us .
In fact , it is not what aliens will say or do that will be the really important part of their discovery , say Seti scientists .
The mere fact of their existence will be the bombshell , a point stressed by Prof Paul Davies , a British cosmologist now based at Arizona State University and author of the forthcoming book on life in the universe The Eerie Silence ( Allen Lane ) .
" It would surely be the greatest discovery of all time , greater than those of Newton , Darwin or Einstein put together , " he says .
" The knowledge that we are not alone would affect people 's psyche , and totally transform our world view .
The mere fact alone would be disruptive . "
For a start , the discovery that there is someone more advanced than us out there would tell us that self - destruction is not Homo sapiens 's inevitable fate .
And then there are the religious implications , adds Davies .
" I think the discovery of a civilisation , particularly one that is found to be cooperative and non-aggressive , would have a devastating effect on earthly religions , particularly those with a Christian basis .
After all , Jesus is supposed to be God 's only begotten son , sent specifically to save one planet and one species . "
If we find civilisations that are far more advanced technologically and ethically than us , this will pose a serious problem for Christianity , adds Davies .
" By our standards , they would be saints .
So why should we be saved by Christ but not them ? "
Hence his prediction that there will be bad days ahead for religion should we hear from ET , though we should note this thesis is disputed by theologians .
Professor Ted Peters , of the Pacific Lutheran Theology Seminary , in Berkeley , California , recently reported a survey that suggested that most religious people would have no problem accommodating their beliefs with the existence of advanced extraterrestrials .
" Contact with extraterrestrial intelligence will , in fact , expand the existing Christian vision that all of creation is the gift of God , " he insists .
Davies is unrepentant .
" Few of those Christians who respond to these studies realise the theological minefield posed by the existence of intelligent aliens .
They are just sweeping the problem under the carpet . "
Contact will ultimately prove corrosive and possibly fatal for most religions .
On the other hand , there are likely to be many benefits from studying Seti signals .
Aliens could pass on all sorts of knowledge .
" Besides learning all the physics we do n't know , we might be taught the secret of immortality , or at least lessons in how to get along , " says Shostak .
Thus we have much more to gain than to lose from talking to aliens , he argues .
All we have to do is make contact , of course .
And that remains the problem .
Despite all our efforts for the past half century we have heard nothing .
It is worrying to some scientists but only a minor difficulty for others , including Frank Drake .
" I do n't think the silence is eerie , " he told a recent Royal Society meeting on the subject of Seti .
" It is predictable . "
Dressed in neat black jacket and slacks , with carefully parted grey hair , he displayed a calm sense of certainty about our chances of finding intelligent life out there .
" Fifty years ago I was naive in thinking we could find signals straight away .
For all I knew there were radio broadcasts pouring from civilisations on every star .
But that was really unreasonable .
" I now realise that it is going to be harder than that .
There may be up to 10,000 civilisations in the galaxy but , given that the galaxy also contains 100bn stars , that means we will have to search around 10 m stars before we have a realistic chance of finding one .
That is certainly not going to happen in my lifetime .
Nor might it happen in the next generation .
But we will make contact one day .
I am sure of that . "
A Congressional Progressive Caucus ( CPC ) member said there 's " growing consensus " among liberals that Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner should step down .

Rep. Peter DeFazio ( D - Ore. ) said Wednesday that he and other liberal House members are becoming increasingly tired of Obama administration economic policies that they say are too focused on maintaining the stability of Wall Street firms and largely ignore " Main Street . "
" A growing consensus in the caucus [ believe that Geithner should be removed ] , " DeFazio said on MSNBC this evening , adding that some lawmakers are " considering questions regarding him and other economic advisers . "
DeFazio said that lawmakers have not yet drafted a plan to remove Geithner .
The lawmaker also took aim at top Obama economic adviser Larry Summers for furthering many of the same policies favored by Geithner .
" We need a new economic team , " said DeFazio .
The veteran congressman specifically mentioned last year 's bank bailouts and the Geithner 's handling of the collapse of insurance giant AIG .
At the time , Geithner was head of the New York Fed in the Bush administration .
" We may have to sacrifice just two more jobs to get millions back for Americans , " the congressman added .

When it comes to the spirits industry , London and gin are synonymous .
Hogarth 's pictures of the drunkenness and disrepute of Gin Alley back in the 18th Century are well known .
But it was n't all bad behaviour and time wasting .
Gin making - and consuming - has long been associated with London , as in this 1751 engraving
The distilling and sales , that is said to have taken place in as many as one in four building in parts of the capital , developed into a successful and organised professional industry that led to London being widely regarded as the home of gin .
One by one though , as demand and cost bases changed over the following 200 years , the factories closed or moved away .
Today , Beefeater is the only premium - brand distiller with its own premises in London .
Another , the Thames Distillery , makes gin for a range of independent labels .
Comeback
But now it seems there could be the start of a renaissance of gin production in the capital .
The copper - pot distillery is tucked away on a residential street in west London , the first to be established in London for 189 years .
On the site of a former micro-brewery , Sipsmith uses methods dating back 300 years to make small batches of gin aimed at the upper end of the market .
The small Sipsmith distillery makes gin for the premium end of the market " Hopefully we 'll be at the leading edge of a wave of small distilleries , " says co-founder Fairfax Hall .
He and his business partner Sam Galsworthy gave up their jobs in the drinks industry two years ago and sold their houses to fund the project .
They were inspired after spending time in the US where a change in licensing laws led to small craft distilleries gaining popularity .
" If you look at the way the food market 's gone , what consumers demand of their food , they want to know where it 's made , the source of it , how it 's made , " says Sam .
" So it 's not just the historical factor of being in London that 's important , it 's that we 're accessible , people can see how our gin's made . "
' Authenticity '
The spirit has already made its way into some of London 's best known hotels and department stores and perhaps surprisingly , it 's been welcomed into the industry by some of the bigger players .
GLOBAL GIN CONSUMPTION 2002 : 60.5 m cases 2007 : 49.1 mcases 2008 : 49.2 m cases Source : IWRS Desmond Payne , the master distiller at Beefeater , is pleased to see what he describes as a renewed interest in gin .
" I think it 's great .
It really establishes the authenticity of what London gin used to be .
It 's also a look back at the past where we all start . "
Sipsmith's is not the only new locally produced gin hitting the capital 's shelves .
About eight miles away , former city headhunter and science enthusiast Ian Hart is playing his part in rejuvenating London as the home of gin .
Using a glass still in an outhouse of his home he 's making Sacred Gin .
It 's pitched at the middle of the market at just over £ 15 .
" I felt that most of the so - called ' new ' gins on the market appeared to follow pretty much the same formula as the more traditional brands and that while many of these are extremely good , I perceived there was room for a completely new , fresh - tasting gin , " Ian explains .
When his employer - the investment bank Lehman 's - folded he decided to turn his hobby into his job .
Now , after a year in production it is for sale in over 20 pubs in central and north London .
Ian hand delivers it on public transport .
" I will need to take on staff at some stage , and organise more professional distribution , but for the moment it is great fun , " says Ian .
" In future my aim is to get enough market share in London to make a decent living out of this , and of course to export , though the regulations are very fierce . "
Small runs
The copper - pot distillery is on the site of a former micro-brewery Sipsmith and Sacred Gin know it 's a competitive marketplace they are entering .
In recent years worldwide gin sales have fallen .
But last year they did pick up slightly , largely due to developing countries , particularly , India , acquiring a taste for the spirit .
The higher end of the market held up well and it is here that these small distillers feel they can fit in .
Geraldine Coates , who has written books about gin and runs the connoisseurs website Gintime , thinks the size and flexibility of these new micro-distilleries is their strength .
" It means they are producing the equivalent to caviar as opposed to tuna fish , " she explains .
" Small batch runs mean they can make many different varieties .
They could even , theoretically , take on commissions for certain flavours .
And bartenders in the UK love new types of spirit to play with . "
A new wave of enthusiasm for high quality gin and the entrance of the likes of Sipsmith and Sacred Gin into the market could feed off each other .
And being based in London , they both hope and believe they can reinvigorate the capital as the home of gin for the 21st Century .

Back in 1987 , when Tom and John Knoll created it , nothing could have predicted the deep impact this tool would have in our lives .
At that time , there was photo manipulation , but it was reserved to a knowledgeable few , using airbrushes — which required a lot of expertise — and the first Quantel paint boxes — which required lots of money and training .

Photoshop — running on the first color Macs , accelerated by graphic cards by Radius and RasterOps — democratized all this .
Image editing became accepted as a tool , and as the power of the machines increased , everything started to become possible for everyone .
Like the first industrial oil paintings democratized art in the 19th century — with Cezanne , Monet , Gauguin , and VanGogh quickly taking advantage of the new cheap medium —
Photoshop became the new inexpensive way to create new realities and alter the world surrounding us .

When Photoshop 3.0 introduced layers , things got even more dramatic .
Together with tools like clone stamping and warping , Adobe 's image studio became the beautiful monster that it is today , capable of creating the most stunning works of art , and the most twisted works of marketing .

Here 's a toast for the next 20 wonderful and terrifying years .
Cuisines are profoundly influenced by the spices that are indigenous to that region or country and strongly impact the flavors of the dishes .
What would Indian cooking be without cardamom pods , or Jamaican recipes be without the kick of allspice ?
Imagine an Asian dish without ginger or a Mexican recipe void of cumin .
Sometimes , however , a home cook may not have the spice called for in a recipe — whether because the spice is difficult to find , or a personal dislike for its taste , or it simply did n't make its way onto the grocery list .
Picking the right spice substitute can be challenging , as many spices possess unique character and flavor profiles that are difficult to replicate .
Luckily , there are some good substitutes you can employ to maintain the general taste of a dish .
It is important to keep in mind , though , that although the selected flavors should harmonize or hint at the original , the flavor will not be as originally intended in the recipe .
Even so , to be safe , begin adding the substitution with just half of the specified amount in the recipe and continue to taste and adjust as needed .
Jeff Kingston of Temple University in Japan thinks the entire Toyota disaster has its roots in Japan 's deferential corporate culture .
Essentially , design problems were n't sufficiently challenged and critical information was n't relayed properly to management due to Toyota 's traditional Japanese corporate culture .
He 's careful to remind that every nation shares the communication problems present within traditional Japanese companies too some degree .
Obviously its easy to accuse any criticism of Japanese culture in this matter as horrendously simplistic and perhaps ignorant of what Japan is like .
Yet Mr. Kingston makes the point that he 's rarely seen a Japanese company perform well during a crisis , due to the same old problems -- information takes too long to flow through the company since employees do n't want to tell their boss what he does n't want to hear , and because Japanese companies have a tendency to try and squash bad stories before they get to press .
WSJ : Initially , the safety defects were portrayed as a made - in - America problem , but now the design defects have hit home , raising new questions about Toyota 's famous quality control circles .
Had this story not come out in the U.S. it is doubtful whether Toyota would have even considered a recall at home .
But now , as international coverage of quality problems expand , the domestic media here have their backs covered and are likely to start asking some of the same questions and raising some of the same issues , if more politely .
Much is at stake for the company and the nation as Toyota tries to restore its reputation .
There have been an alarming number of cases in recent years in which Japanese products have not met the high quality standards that the world and its own people expect of it .
In some quarters this is seen as a barometer of a nation in decline , one that is adrift and slipping .
Thus to me what the entire Toyota saga shows is that if any company wants to be a world - class business , it has to be world - class through and through .
Many Japanese companies became extremely competitive based on world - class manufacturing processes .
Yet perhaps they lagged when it came to corporate culture .
Some might have thought this did n't matter , Toyota is n't in the media or consulting industry after all , it does n't need ' soft ' competitive advantages as long as its cars are well built .
But what we 've recently seen is that it indeed does need these things if it wants to not only become a global leader , but then remain one as well .
No manufacturer can claim to be world class if its soft assets are n't handled just as efficiently as its inventory .
Toyota ( hopefully ) has learned this the hard way .
Anyone involved in any sort of emancipatory activism , from flame wars in forums to robust street protesting , is bound to be familiar with the phenomenon I ’m about to describe :
“ What ’s the big deal ! ? ”
This is most often asked when you broach a subject of media criticism or a critique of seemingly innocuous language .
You ’re told that it ’s ‘ not a big deal ’ if someone says , say , ‘ fag ’ persistently in the most derogating way possible .
It ’s ‘ not a big deal ’ if a commercial is in any way commodifying or objectifying women .
It ’s ‘ not a big deal ’ if , say , a late night talk show host predicates a gag on trans panic .
Et cetera .
Et cetera .
Such is the power of privilege that the obvious , and in any just universe the only needed , answer never occurs to the offender for even a moment .
“ It ’s disrespectful ” ought to be enough , yet somehow it never is ; so we are left justifying our anger at a seemingly small bit of errata that must appear like a speck of dust in the night to the privileged people we try so valiantly to reach .
We ’re left trying to explain why it is n’t , in fact , so small .
Why it is that that speck of dust is just one point in a far larger duststorm .
In that process the next bomb is very likely to be dropped :
“ Why are you self - victimising ? ”
So it is that you pass through the gilded oak doors of the Ministry of Strength .
I .
It should go without saying that such little bits of nonsense are a big deal for the same reason my aforementioned dust storm is a big deal .
When one is buffeted and utterly enveloped in one , one tends to be offended by every grain of sand in it .
When we take umbrage at an example of irresponsible journalism or other exploitative or bigoted media , we ’re merely pointing and saying “ look , there ’s the dust in my storm ; that ’s just one part of it , but it ’s there . ”
We are not oppressed by the image or the word en toto , but are instead stung by its existence in a sinful constellation of ideas and legitimations that do us precious little good .
In other words , its role in the grander scheme of things .
That much - the fallacy of the ‘ big deal ’ defence - is abundantly clear .
But wither this Ministry of Strength ?
It flows out of that all too common accusation that tends to come out of our attempts to show others the storm that swirls around us .
The accusation that we are somehow making ourselves victims in pointing out a disrespectful word , thought , or image that is a bolt in the framework of institutionalised marginalisation or oppression .
We point it out to say , in essence , ‘ this is real . ’
In this there is , to be sure , some strength .
There is the strength to break free of seeing only the objectivated meaning of these images and instead see them for what their true purpose - latent or otherwise - really is .
So where does being a victim come into it ?
Needless to say , this is the tip of the proverbial iceberg .
Every single one of you reading this has probably had this happen to you , seen it happen , or perhaps even done this yourself : someone says they ’re offended or disrespected by something and they are told they have a victim complex by the nearest available wielder of privilege .
It serves to immediately put the complainant on the defensive , and it ’s quite effective as a silencer to boot .
And yet the phenomenon goes further still .
Witness this recent exchange on a blog written by a rape survivor .
Familiar words enter the fray immediately :
“ So your life now revolves around victimhood ?
Perpetual and eternal .
That ’s sad .
You should move on .
Life ’s too short .
Yadda .
Yadda . Yadda . ”
I do n’t need to tell any of my readers this is but a small sample of this kind of nonsense .
It ’s ubiquitous and it ’s churned out daily .
In my observation of this I found that a nagging question pressed itself ever more firmly into my conscious thoughts :
What is with this ‘ victim ’ poppycock ?
I believe I can now begin to formulate the elements of an answer .
II .
To say that calling anything “ Orwellian ” is a cliché is to insult clichés .
Yet so rarely is Newspeak found so readily and in its perfect form , just as Orwell intended .
So rarely is a meaning well and truly inverted and perverted in the way that words like ‘ love ’ were in Orwell ’s dystopian future .
“ Victim ” is the word that we ’ve somehow made into a perverse opposite .
Where once ‘ victim ’ necessarily implied the existence of a victimiser , it has now become an individual phenomenon , located entirely in the person labelled ‘ victim . ’
Where once calling out oppression was popularly understood as bold and courageous , it is now seen as weak and ‘ self - victimising ’ ( more on that connection in a moment ) .
In our contemporary and popular understanding of the term , if I am a victim it means I ’ve made myself one and am wallowing in it for some ill - defined reward ; it does not mean , as it once did , that I was hurt by someone or something .
This will take a great deal more careful study but I believe I can trace the origins of this to four points .
The changes to the law in the 1960s .
The self - help culture that emerged in the 1970s .
The backlash against emancipatory activism by the marginalised in the 1980s .
And the general form of rationalist - individualist capitalism that has come to dominate our society .
One of the first things that a privileged person , confronted with their privilege or with the existence of oppression , will try to do is to deny that the oppression exists .
In this aim , they ’ve been greatly assisted by the raft of legislation bequeathed to us by the activism of the 1960s .
From the Voting Rights Act to Title IX , a broad swathe of ( though by no means the entirety of ) de jure marginalisation and oppression was struck down .
This alone facilitates the privileged line that is most often used to combat any number of call - outs : “ You have your rights now so any failures you ’ve had are your own .
You ’re totally equal now , you ’re just being lazy / self - victimising . ”
This ignores the complexity of such things , naturally .
The law is only one avenue of oppression .
Often it is the most overt , yes , and the existence of legal repression is one of the surest and obvious signs of socially sanctioned marginalisation of some group .
But its absence does not mean inequality vanishes with it .
If society itself remains unchanged , it ’ll merely be displaced elsewhere .
But this is how the raft of 1960s - era civil rights legislation is used in this formulation .
In order for it to be used in this way , however , ( with special attention to the ‘ all your failures are yours ’ bit ) more needs to be added to this stew .
By the mid to late 1970s the repackaging of the 60s counterculture into manageable , marketable fun size chunks was well underway and a major spinoff of these efforts was the beginning of the now ubiquitous self - help industry .
Taking bowdlerised ideas of 60s liberation and individual freedom , they began to project a message that you were entirely responsible for how you felt , and that you had the power to completely alter your personal state , regardless of outside influence or outside forces .
Indeed , some even promised that with the right attitude adjustment you could will outside forces to change for you .
( This chicanery continues today in the form of the execrable book / program / cult The Secret ) .
Obviously not everyone bought into this .
But society is a funny thing .
We are ever in a dialogue with it and are invariably shaped by it .
This conversation ( or dialectic if you prefer the five guinea word ) acts on society even as it acts upon us .
Dialectic , in its most literal form , may actually be the best word to use as this is a saga about language and its evolution .
For even as people might ’ve rejected the deeper mysteries of self - help culture , they came to be entrapped by its argot and its message of individual empowerment .
It began to undergird messages in cheerful daytime television ( which would take off in the late 70s ) , children ’s television , and the plotlines of popular programmes .
This then segues into the 1980s .
“ Backlash ” is a term most often associated with feminism due to Susan Faludi ’s perceptive use of it in her groundbreaking book of the same name , examining the travails of the 80s .
But it just as easily belongs to all emancipatory movements .
Ronald Reagan kicked off his 1980 presidential campaign in Philadelphia , Mississippi , a town best known for one particularly gruesome event :
“ Philadelphia is known as the site of one of the most infamous race - related crimes in American history .
In 1964 , three civil rights workers were murdered by white supremacists on a highway outside of Philadelphia .
The crime and decades - long legal aftermath inspired the 1988 movie Mississippi Burning . ” ( from Wikipedia )
Here he declared his unwavering support for “ states ’ rights ” , the same notion trumpeted by segregationist George Wallace nearly twenty years earlier as a bulwark against desegregation .
This would be the beginning of a cavalcade of such ‘ dog whistles ’ to white men who felt increasingly antagonised and threatened by the sudden growth in power of both women and people of colour in general .
It is worth noting that the small but potent transgender liberation movement was no less harmed by this backlash .
What small but significant victories we had won in the 1960s were thrown back in our faces many times over as the 70s and 80s ground forward .
The AIDS epidemic hit trans women of colour especially hard , and the backlash - mood of the time made it all the easier for much of the government to turn a blind eye to this suffering .
The 1980s then were the decade in which those who perceived themselves the losers of the 60s revolts found their footing again and began to reassert themselves as a political force .
Out of this would come the battles against “ special interests ” ( read : NOW and the NAACP ) , the crusade against “ political correctness ” and the beginning of such terms as “ reverse sexism ” and “ reverse racism . ”
All of this nonsense , the New Racism and the New Sexism as I called it in the past , got its true start in the 1980s when the Republican Party ’s infamous Southern Strategy was in full bloom .
Similar forces were at work to varying degrees in other parts of the English - speaking world as well .
It is no coincidence that the 80s were a time of conservative governments blessed with longevity in Britain and Canada as well .
In this period , our final bullet point also rose mightily into the stratosphere .
Though individualist capitalism has been prominent in American culture since at least the 1920s , it truly hit the big time in the 70s and 80s with thinkers like Milton Friedman eagerly exporting new and ever more radical ideas to western democracies that praised the individual and the power of markets .
All of capitalism ’s legitimating mythology - the Horatio Alger myth , social mobility , the power of the individual , and so on - was greatly amplified by the new and ever more expansive pushes towards deregulation .
Needless to say , I do a very poor summary of economic history here and certainly entertain no delusions about doing justice to so complex a subject .
I merely hope to illustrate with broad strokes the historical antecedents of our present predicament .
( Should one wish to learn more they could do worse than to begin with this documentary . )
At any rate , so it was that capitalism itself - a dominant and powerful part of our social legitimating structure , as well as a source of much of our society ’s meaning - came to throw its ever engorging weight behind this notion of the all - powerful individual .
The climax of this would come with Margaret Thatcher ’s infamous proclamation to the magazine Women ’s Own :
“ They ’re casting their problem on society .
And , you know , there is no such thing as society .
There are individual men and women , and there are families .
And no government can do anything except through people , and people must look to themselves first . ”
Thus the ultimate formulation of our current problem was writ large .
At this point they all intersect : privilege of all sorts , capitalist individualism , the denial of collective responsibility , the exaltation of individual power .
What follows from such a belief , now shared by many , is all too easy to formulate .
If you “ cast your problems on society ” you are self - victimising and therefore weak .
Now where did weak part come from ?
All of the above ?
Yes indeed .
There ’s just one more bit , however , one of great interest to the feminist .
III .
Over the course of this time period we came to exalt a very particular type of masculinity .
The classic archetype of the unwavering male - as - stoic - defender , that John Wayne model of manhood that would defy all odds to defend the ones he loved , and so on and so on .
We had always worshipped this model of manhood to some extent over the last , especially , two hundred years but it seemed to become hugely popular in the wake of the Second World War with ever diminishing tolerance for alternate expressions of masculinity , perhaps because of the rise of the mass media combined with pervasive fear of Communism ( the latter making apparent the supposed need for strong male warrior types ) .
What we artificially divided into masculine and feminine fell , as they always did , into a hierarchy with all that was good and masculine at the very top , with the dainty qualities of the feminine relegated to a status of tolerated inferiority .
Because we as women were reified as the weaker sex , and socially defined feminine traits were reified as intrinsic to us , it followed that whatever was feminine was weak .
In regards to this newly juiced up conception of manhood , this meant all feminine traits were verboten for men .
Any hint of weakness was to be scrupulously avoided like death itself .
With the rise of the women ’s movement , women were increasingly free to take on the roles restricted from them by patriarchy .
The unforeseen problem was that this aspirational ideal was still based on a fundamentally patriarchal one : to be masculine is to be good .
This would inevitably bring women as a whole into contact with the idea that weakness ( as defined through objectivated patriarchal structures , lest we forget ) was to be shunned if one wanted to be taken seriously .
Without a doubt , we wanted to be taken very seriously , and we fought twice as hard when we were thought of as half as good .
We swam upstream , and indeed are still swimming upstream in many sectors to reap the fruits of our labours .
Yet while we still live in the master ’s house ( a la Audre Lorde ) , one constructed of patriarchal dark iron , we run into this fear of weakness .
Fear of the feminine in ourselves .
Assuredly this branches off into complex topics all on its own ; these too I ’ll write about in time .
But for now let ’s return to the Ministry of Strength .
IV .
Thus we live in a society that values a very particular idea of strength , one which women now feel very compelled to live up to ( with the added handicap of us being thought of as intrinsically feminine and thus intrinsically weaker ) .
We also live in a society that has constructed the individual as all - powerful , even able to shape her or his surroundings through sheer will , and a society that is increasingly sceptical of its own existence , much less the existence of structures that could repress or marginalise whole groups of people .
At base , to be a victim is to be hurt .
In the patriarchal conception , to be wounded is to be undesirably weak .
To admit it is an even greater taboo .
If one thinks that these masculine ideas do n’t afflict women in dire circumstances I direct you to the heartfelt words of a woman I spoke with recently on the subject :
“ May I add , and this is something else that others may be familiar with :
The alienation from the victim role can inhibit true processing of an event .
Feeling as if something bad has happened is a natural part of grief / processing .
Yet , we ’re encouraged to ignore this huge step of dealing with things that happen in our lives and encouraged to just get back to normal .
Yes , I refused to accept that I was a victim when I was raped .
I thought it would make me sad and slow and weak .
I thought that saying I had been victimized would be caving in and giving power to the person who wronged me .
Now I realize that I did myself a grave disservice , and thought I was being strong when I did so . ”
This is a phenomenon affecting and , indeed , afflicting real people .
Without a doubt , a man who was raped or abused would be compelled to feel even worse by his peers .
By social standards we still nurse , he is given every reason to see himself as a failure .
We pretend that we can will away the fact that we ’ve been victimised .
The assailant becomes almost incidental , tangential , a nonfactor .
All that matters is you .
It ’s not hard to see how this ties into the pervasive culture of victim - blaming that still dominates our society .
When a woman is raped the accusations fly , even sometimes from other women , about the clothes she wore , where she was walking , or where she was partying , or what she was having to drink , or what she did or did not do , or who she did or did not sleep with .
In it all , the rapist is lost , relegated to being a merely implied spectre in the whole thing .
If this woman , who is to blame for her own rape according to some in society , dares to socially locate that rape in broader cultural phenomena rather than as a justified consequence of her actions , she is immediately called self - victimising .
So it was with Ms. Chester , the blogger from earlier , who uses her words to help combat these evils and knows from whence they sprung .
A man accused her of self - victimising to silence her , positing to her that Orwellian ideal that there was strength in supplication , redemption in denial , joy in silence .
He enjoined her to move on with her life , unable to fathom that this is how she is moving on with her life , as she comes to truly understand it for the first time .
It is so mystifying and threatening to him precisely because we believe now that the role of ‘ victim ’ is entirely self created and self - imposed , and that if only one were strong enough it could be wished away , along with all the attendant pain .
In our ongoing conversation with our culture new phrases and ideas have begun to come out of this .
“ Inspiring stories ” in the media will often feature the moment when the subject proclaimed “ that was the day I stopped being a victim . ”
When less - sympathetic victims are spoken of by others it is not uncommon to hear that they “ let themselves ” be a victim .
People fond of giving aggressive , ‘ tough - love ’ style help will take you by the shoulders and say forcefully “ stop being a victim ! ” if they feel you have n’t taken the appropriate amount of control over your life .
All of this is out there , and until quite recently I myself used many of these phrases flippantly , unaware of how I ’d bought into this ugly new concept of victimhood .
It is a Ministry of Strength , in the Orwellian sense , then .
A social institution dedicated to the proposition that weakness is strength .
The activist , oppositional posture is cast as weakness , whereas apologising for those in power is cast as strength .
Strength comes from doing the one thing that obviates your healing : denying that you ’ve ever been hurt .
The focus for victims of rape and abuse is now on shrugging off the mantle of ‘ victim ’ before doing anything else .
If you can erase the label from yourself , you ’ll be cured and pure again , so goes the self - help wisdom .
Inasmuch as it exists on the same continuum as victim - blaming and slut - shaming it is plain to see where the interest for broader Feminism lies in this matter .
Some might argue that we see very prominent cases of victims shouting j’accuse at their tormentors .
Yet study the discourses surrounding those events .
If it is a woman claiming to have been raped , invariably mentions of the Duke Lacrosse team will surface .
If it is the victim of a war crime they ’re branded as glory hogs or terrorists in disguise .
If it is the victim of discrimination in housing or employment , they ’re branded attention whores trying to strike it rich in a lawsuit .
That is how these people who dare to speak up are cast and framed .
They are mercilessly pilloried for their efforts and assumed to be selfish ( another rationalist - capitalist idea , by the by ) , they are rarely seen as entirely sympathetic .
Our present economic structure excels at producing atomised individuals , and when combined with the creaking but still operational machinery of patriarchy , as well as the better oiled rigs of transphobia , racism , and homophobia , it creates atomised victims .
Victims who are actively encouraged to not fight back , or even admit that they ’ve been victimised .
Victims who are encouraged to be alone in their sense of victimhood .
Should they dare speak the name of their assailant , he or she will always be Thatcher ’s individual - never part of something bigger .
There are only individual bad guys out there , and anyway they do n’t matter as much as your own self - victimisation , do they ?
Conclusion .
Recently I got into a sparring match with someone who deployed the self - victimising ploy yet again .
She said to me :
“ I do n’t know , I want to start a [ forum ] for women who look out the window and say ‘ “ i have more control over my life than the world does over me and i am going to live my life knowing that . ” “
I responded as follows :
“ Your concept of “ self - victimisation ” is false and does not exist .
To be honest , I look out the window every day and think “ I have more control over my life than the world does ” in my heart .
How could I not ?
I have things to do , a life to live , degrees to get , dreams to fulfil .
How could I not think that empowering sentence each and every day ?
I want independence , I want the fruits of my labour to be ripe and bountiful .
That ’s exactly why I fight sexism , and there is something ennobling about that very act that gives me even more strength to keep right on saying that the world has no power over me .
I recognise and grapple with reality , but also try my best to rise above it .
Why ?
Because I can do no other .
Recognising discriminatory or biased behaviour , however small , is not self - victimisation .
Fighting against bigotry ( whether it be sexism , racism , transphobia , homophobia , or all of the above ) is not allowing one ’s self to be defeated by the world or surrender power to it .
It ’s the very opposite .
It ’s the seizure of strength , of identity , and independence . ”
What struck me most was that it seemed to win over my opponent , who deleted her accusatory posts and left one to me saying she ’d love to hear my stories of overcoming adversity sometime , something for which I hope an opportunity soon presents itself .
In this is , perhaps , part of the solution to our problem - and it is a problem we all face whatever our group identities .
That solution is to continue to emphasise and frame the strength of activism .
Activism need not mean taking to the streets or leafleting .
It can just mean having the strength to say “ hey , that ’s transphobic , stop that . ”
That alone is the activist posture that resists the perpetuation of marginalising or alienating norms .
That alone will do to qualify for the activist label ( that ’s certainly Fox News ’ standard ) .
But it is not enough in the face of these new oppressive ideas that have redefined victimhood .
We must smash this new Ministry of Strength with the very real strength we possess , and remind others that this strength stems not from apologising for the way things are but from actively working to change it , and from proactively seizing your identity from others who would define it for you .
In this lies strength , in this lies freedom .

As I and others dive into the CRU data dump we learn more and more about how the Global Warming conspiracy was pulled off .
We now know all you need to do to pull this off is statistically cover up true data that tells the wrong story with ‘ bad ’ data that tells the story you want to have told .
Then you compute some statistical correlation factors ( which mean you have ‘ confidence ’ the data is correlated , not ‘ proof ’ there is a physical connection ) and a whole bunch of people with a high school grasp of science run with the new story you want told .
Rinse and Repeat .
In this theatre of the absurd , a couple of stories had to be told to make the case for out of control global warming .
First , you have to cool off history because it has been as warm as it is now many times before , and that does not fit the plot .
This is where we see issues related to the Medieval Warming period , but also about the ‘ 1940 ’s blip ’Â in the CRU emails Â – which turns out to be a real story killer .
So after you cool off history , you have to then deal with the fact that global temps are now cooling off even more !
So what do you do ?
One line in one email from the charlatan Phil Jones at CRU caught my eye and I have been pondering it while I have been looking at the CRU raw temp data .
Here it is :
Phil Jones tells Mike Mann and others how he made his data show warming : I ’ve just completed Mike ’s Nature trick of adding in the real temps to each series for the last 20 years ( ie from 1981 onwards ) and from 1961 for Keith ’s to hide the decline .
Let ’s think about this for a moment .
To make it look warm now , Jones added back in the real temp data .
The data shows it is cooler now than just recently , yet we put in real data to warm it back up ?
This could only mean the series before 1980 and 1960 must have been massaged a lot to really cool off something prior to that time .
Probably a warming ‘ blip ’ .
Let ’s look again at the so called global warming graph from NCDC :
Look at the 1940 ’s blip here , it is nothing .
Was it really this low , or did the CRU con men use statistics to cool it way down , only to have to put the ‘ raw ’ data back into the later decades to make the temperature appear higher now than in the 1940 ’s and 1950’s ?
Well , thanks to the CRU data dump we have some of their temp runs from 2008 and 2005 .
Let ’s look at the CRU Land Temp Data from some selected countries around the globe ( and yes , I cherry picked them , but it was not hard since all countries nearby these saw similar patterns ) .
First , we go to Bolivia ( click to enlarge ) :
Hmm , does n’t look at all like the NCDC graph .
I have added the green lines to help people line up the pre 1960 peaks with the current time period .
Right away one thing jumps out : clearly it was warmer half a century ago than it is now in Bolivia .
Is Bolivia an odd case ?
Let ’s check some other countries .
How about Greenland ?
Yep , similar pattern – the 1940 ’s were near or warmer to now in all but one season .
OK , lets move to Poland :
Now that is one flat temperature signal , except that 1940 ’s blip in JJA .
Let ’s try Egypt :
1940 ’s blips just about everywhere .
How about Madagascar ?
Wow –
It was a lot warmer for a lot longer prior to 1960 than today .
Looks nothing like the NCDC graph .
Feel free to look for yourself , here is the file of CRU land temp plots by season ( i.e. , MAM = March - April - May , Â JJA = June - July - August , etc ) .
The purple lines are the data runs from 2008 , the black lines are the same data processed in 2005 .
The dashed lines are the median temperature for those seasons , again from 2005 ( black ) and 2008 ( red ) .
So now we understand that email about “ Mike ’s Nature trick ” – of course ‘ Nature ’ here probably means the data they published in Nature Magazine , claiming to the world Â there was rampant global warming .
And they wonder why people want them investigated for producing misinformation and conspiracy ?
The exhibition " The Lost World of Old Europe , " in New York , has raised some very interesting questions about prehistoric societies and how they changed .
David Anthony , guest curator of the exhibition and a leading anthropologist specializing in prehistoric Europe , Eurasia , and North America , raised a particularly powerful issue - why did the collapse of a highly sophisticated , matriarchal culture in what is now Bulgaria , Romania , and Moldova , lead to a shift of power to men ?
Women , after all , are naturally capable of running households , and should surely be running countries too .
Think of our powerful , natural capabilities .
We women tend to make the social arrangements , shop for food , raise children , keep the home in order , and generally deal with the practicalities of day - to - day life .
We ’re also good at taking organization and decision - making a step up ; arranging events , getting active in the local community , and networking .
But when it comes to wielding political power , which is arguably simply another step or two up from managing the annual bake sale or housing co-operative , we fall down , spectacularly .
Catalyst Inc. , a not - for - profit organization that tracks such things recently reported that only 3 % of Fortune 500 CEOs are women .
In the United States , arguably the country most pressured to act with a feminist bent , women make up a dismal 17 % of Congress and the Senate .
The maddening question is : why ?
Some clues might come from the recent finds in Romania , Bulgaria , and Moldova that show a sophisticated society flourished there between 5,000BC and 3,500 BC , most likely with women in charge .
These matriarchal Old Europe communities , which grew into some of the biggest cities then in existence ( some had 2,000 buildings ) , show signs of hierarchy , but had no large municipal buildings such as palaces or places of worship .
Archaeological digs there have found thousands upon thousands of clay female figures , apparently a sign that the female was worshipped , pretty much exclusively .
Furthermore , experts such as David Anthony , Professor of Anthropology at Hartwick College , argue that women potters , in making vessels for domestic use , discovered copper , and brought the Copper Age into being .
So , it seems , women were at the top in one of the oldest civilizations in the world .
What happened ?
The Old Europe communities show signs of dramatic , sudden collapse , in the Southern regions around 4,300BC and in the North around 3,500BC .
There is evidence of intrusion from the East by a nomadic culture from the Steppes of Eurasia .
It ’s not entirely clear whether this was a violent invasion or a more subtle VHS - is - better - than - Betamax cultural shift , but it does seem to coincide , notably , with the invention of the wheel - and - axle combination that made it feasible to build load - bearing vehicles such as carts , and the domestication of horses to pull them .
Basically what that meant , according to Anthony , is that you no longer needed a whole village of people to bring in the harvest , hand - carrying every armful to the grain store .
You could do it with a cart , a horse , and family labour .
This , it seems , tempted people into spreading out from their cramped , dirty , conurbations and gave them the freedom to look with a pioneer ’s longing at the huge expanses of grassland to the East .
“ The wheel meant you could kiss your village goodbye , ” said Anthony , at a lecture delivered at New York University ’s Institute for Study of the Ancient World ( ISAW ) in New York , in December 2009 .
What is certain is that the hugely concentrated urban settlements were abandoned , over a relatively short period of time , and the people went wandering off into the vastness of Eurasia to begin a whole new period of human history .
And , now , men were the masters .
Was there something about the huddling together of homes that gave women the upper hand ?
Were women the ones who brokered a sufficient peace between neighbours that made gathering the harvest , pre-axle , possible ?
Is there a correspondingly male advantage to grabbing your horse and your family and making it on your own , remote from others ?
If women were still in charge , would we have no castles or cathedrals , just row upon row of houses ?
I like to think that the men simply felt it was time someone else got a shot at running things , and used the changes in lifestyle to grab power .
Let ’s face it , true power is almost never given : it is taken .
Who knows what happened out there on the steppes .
WASHINGTON  President Obama , cracking down on tax cheats , said on Wednesday that the federal government would no longer award contracts to companies that did not pay their taxes , and called on Congress to pass legislation allowing the Internal Revenue Service to share information about businesses that owe back taxes .
Mr. Obama used his executive authority to direct the heads of federal agencies to bar “ deadbeat companies ” from doing business with the government .
Studies by the Government Accountability Office have identified tens of thousands of such companies that , collectively , owe more than $ 5 billion in back taxes , the president said .

“ In a time of great need , when our families and our nation are finding it necessary to tighten our belts and be more responsible with how we spend our money , we ca n’t afford to waste taxpayer dollars , ” Mr. Obama said .
“ And we especially ca n’t afford to let companies game the system . ”

Vancouver , British Columbia --
When Alexandra Zaretsky takes to the ice in Olympic ice - dancing competition Friday , she 'll look deep into her partner 's eyes as they skate the " Tango Romantica . "
But not too deep .
That 's because her partner is her brother , 26 - year - old Roman Zaretsky .

I have a special fascination with World War One , a fascination that intensified when my father told me that his dad served in the Marines in 1917 - 1918 .
( My other grandfather and my wife ’s grandfathers served in World War II , but my dad ’s dad was in the first war . )
My grandpa had trained as a sniper , but was never sent to France and was discharged after the armistice .
The following are 11 fascinating facts concerning the people and events of the finale of the most destructive and bloody war in human history ( until World War II , of course ) , which ended at 11 a.m. on 11/11/1918 .
11 Journey to Armistice
Once they crossed the lines on Nov. 8 , the German delegates were not driven directly to the railway car where the armistice talks were to be held .
Rather , the French gave them a 10 - hour “ scenic tour ” that showed incredible damage to the French countryside after four years of war .
The delegates were then ushered into a rail car in the forest of Compiegne to begin the talks that lasted three days .
After being informed that Kaiser Wilhelm II had abdicated on Nov. 10 , the German delegates received an un-coded message from general - in - chief Hindenburg to accept whatever terms they could get — and quickly — because of rioting and increasing unrest at home .
The picture shows just a small portion of the devastation in northern France .
10 Rare Visual Record
The Germans and Allies signed the armistice just after 5 a.m. Paris time .
Only one photograph seems to exist of the actual signing , unlike , say , the surrender of France in 1940 or the surrender of Japan in 1945 .
The photo above appears to have been shot through a window ; I think that ’s Matthias Erzberger , the chief German negotiator , at far right .
This other photo shows the Allied representatives shortly after the signing ; Marshal Foch stands second from right .
9 Armistice Rail Carriage and Site
The rail carriage ( car ) and armistice spot later became a national monument .
Almost 22 years later , in June 1940 , Hitler made the French surrender in that very rail car .
Before the Allies liberated France in 1944 , Hitler ordered the monument dynamited and the following year ordered the carriage itself destroyed , to prevent a possible second German armistice or surrender from being signed in that same car .
Here ’s how the site looks today : http://pierreswesternfront.punt.nl/?r=1&id=435051
8 Six More Hours
The armistice was signed just after 5 a.m. ( Paris time ) the morning of Nov. 11 .
The fighting was to officially end at 11 a.m .
The German delegation had requested an immediate cease - fire , but the Allies set a six - hour deadline so that all commanders could get the word .
When they heard the news , some commanders had their men stand down .
Why fight for piece of ground that you could simply walk over a few hours later ?
But others continued to attack — especially some American commanders — who saw chances for “ glory ” or promotion slipping away , or because they thought the Germans needed to be flat - out beaten .
Several thousand men on both sides were killed or wounded in the final six hours of the war .
For example , the Commonwealth War Graves Commission recorded 863 British and Commonwealth deaths on Nov. 11 .
The picture shows German troops under attack in the final weeks of the war .
7 Future American President
One American artillery captain kept his battery firing at the Germans until just minutes before 11 a.m. , because he believed the armistice was premature and the Germans needed to be truly beaten , not just defeated .
His name ?
Capt . Harry S. Truman .
Some historians draw a straight line from Truman ’s actions on 11/11/1918 and his decision to use the atomic bombs .
6 Beginning and Ending at Mons
In a freak coincidence , the British Army started and ended the war at Mons .
Some of the first British soldiers killed in the Great War died at Mons in August 1914 , when the five divisions of the BEF fought their first battle .
More than four years later , the British returned to Mons , and some of the very last Commonwealth soldiers killed in the Great War died there on November 11 , 1918 .
Scroll down this page of the St. Symphorien Military Cemetery at Mons , which has the graves of the first and last British soldiers killed at Mons .
5 No End for the Wounded
Many men wounded on November 11 succumbed to injuries after the 11th hour .
Many more endured years of pain and suffering over physical wounds that could n’t quite heal right or could never be healed .
One of the most horrifying , a Commonwealth soldier named Thomas , was gravely wounded on Nov. 6 , just before negotiations started , and was still alive AND conscious when the armistice took effect .
Whatever hit him in the face literally tore away the lower parts of his face — nose , mouth , jaw .
Amazingly , he survived .
After years of surgical reconstruction , Thomas finally had something approaching a normal looking face in August 1922 .
4 Negotiator Assassinated
Matthias Erzberger , Germany ’s lead negotiator at the Armistice , initially supported the war until 1917 .
By then , the static and incredibly bloody lines in France convinced him that Germany should negotiate a peace .
Prince Max Von Baden picked Erzberger to lead the negotiations because Erzberger was a civilian and known opponent of the war .
After the fighting ended , Erzberger joined the newly formed government and endorsed the 1919 Treaty of Versailles , which many hard - core Germans held in contempt .
For his role in the “ stab in the back ” ( see # 2 ) , Erzberger was forced from office in 1920 and murdered in 1921 .
3 The Last Men Killed
Historians generally ( but not totally ) list a German soldier by the name of Lt. Tomas with being the final German casualty .
He was killed after the 11th hour by an American unit that apparently had n’t received word of the cease - fire .
The final German killed before the 11th hour is not known .
According to generally accepted records , the last British , Canadian , French and American men killed were the following : British soldier George Edwin Ellison died around 9:30 a.m. while scouting around Mons .
French soldier Augustin Trébuchon was killed at 10:45 a.m. while spreading the news that they would get hot soup after the 11th hour .
Canadian soldier George Lawrence Price died two minutes before the 11th hour , just north of Mons .
The last man believed killed in the Great War was American soldier Henry Gunther , 60 seconds before the 11th hour .
German soldiers were shouting and waving at Gunther and the others to go back .

2 The “ stab in the back ”
Most accounts of the end of World War I and the origins of World War II contain some discussion of the “ stab in the back , ” the claim that the German army had not been defeated but was betrayed by the civilian leadership .
This was n’t merely a Nazi propaganda line , either – many Germans heading home from France , Belgium , Romania , Italy , Russia , etc. really did believe it .
Never mind the facts .
The military leaders had told the Kaiser that the army and navy would no longer support him ; naval mutineers had refused to fight any more ; the army high command had sought the armistice before Allied armies hit German soil ; and the home front was literally starving and rioting .
Nevertheless , the legend of the “ stab in the back ” became darn near holy writ .
So , while the Nazis did n’t create the “ stab in the back ” legend , they certainly exploited it to devastating effect .
1 Prophetic Predictions
Both AEF commander Gen. Pershing and Allied supreme commander Foch of France were unhappy with the nature of the armistice and subsequent Versailles peace treaty .
Pershing believed that it was a grave mistake to let the Germans simply lay down their arms without actually being beaten .
( They were defeated , yes , but not beaten . )
He correctly predicted that because they did not make the Germans beg for peace on their knees inside a ruined Germany , the Allies would soon be fighting them again .
Foch was even more prescient .
Upon reading the Versailles treaty in 1919 , Foch was heard exclaiming , “ This is n’t a peace .
It ’s a cease - fire for 20 years ! ”
Twenty years and two months later , England and France declared war on Germany .
He was a mensch .

Martin never shied away from speaking his mind .
He fought for civil , thoughtful and honest discourse .
He did n't backdown because someone challenged him but he did n't get defensive either .
He educated and explained his point of view and he genuinely listened to the other person 's opinion .
As Martin and I were frequently of the same opinion I 'm proud to say that we frequently wrote to each other supporting each others work .
I will miss that just as much as I 'll miss geeking out with him about the comics and sci - fi we both loved .

Before patting yourself on the back for resisting that cookie or kicking yourself for giving in to temptation , look around .
A new University of Georgia study has revealed that self - control -- or the lack thereof -- is contagious .
In a just - published series of studies involving hundreds of volunteers , researchers have found that watching or even thinking about someone with good self - control makes others more likely exert self - control .
The researchers found that the opposite holds , too , so that people with bad self - control influence others negatively .
The effect is so powerful , in fact , that seeing the name of someone with good or bad self - control flashing on a screen for just 10 milliseconds changed the behavior of volunteers .
" The take home message of this study is that picking social influences that are positive can improve your self - control , " said lead author Michelle vanDellen , a visiting assistant professor in the UGA department of psychology .
" And by exhibiting self - control , you 're helping others around you do the same . "
People tend to mimic the behavior of those around them , and characteristics such as smoking , drug use and obesity tend to spread through social networks .
But vanDellen 's study is thought to be the first to show that self - control is contagious across behaviors .
That means that thinking about someone who exercises self - control by regularly exercising , for example , can make your more likely to stick with your financial goals , career goals or anything else that takes self - control on your part .
VanDellen 's findings , which are published in the early online edition of the journal Personality and Social Psychology Bulletin , are the result of five separate studies conducted over two years with study co-author Rick Hoyle at Duke University .
In the first study , the researchers randomly assigned 36 volunteers to think about a friend with either good or bad self - control .
Those that thought about a friend with good self - control persisted longer on a handgrip task commonly used to measure self - control , while the opposite held true for those who were asked to think about a friend with bad self - control .

In the second study , 71 volunteers watched others exert self - control by choosing a carrot from a plate in front of them instead of a cookie from a nearby plate , while others watched people eat the cookies instead of the carrots .
The volunteers had no interaction with the tasters other than watching them , yet their performance was altered on a later test of self - control depending on who they were randomly assigned to watch .
In the third study , 42 volunteers were randomly assigned to list friends with both good and bad self - control .
As they were completing a computerized test designed to measure self - control , the computer screen would flash the names for 10 milliseconds -- too fast to be read but enough to subliminally bring the names to mind .
Those who were primed with the name of a friend with good self - control did better , while those primed with friends with bad self - control did worse .
In a fourth study , vanDellen randomly assigned 112 volunteers to write about a friend with good self - control , bad self - control or -- for a control group -- a friend who is moderately extroverted .
On a later test of self - control , those who wrote about friends with good self - control did the best , while those who wrote about friends with bad self - control did the worst .
The control group , those who wrote about a moderately extroverted friend , scored between the other two groups .
In the fifth study of 117 volunteers , the researchers found that those who were randomly assigned to write about friends with good self - control were faster than the other groups at identifying words related to self - control , such as achieve , discipline and effort .
VanDellen said this finding suggests that self - control is contagious because being exposed to people with either good or bad self - control influences how accessible thoughts about self - control are .
VanDellen said the magnitude of the influence might be significant enough to be the difference between eating an extra cookie at a party or not , or deciding to go to the gym despite a long day at work .
The effect is n't so strong that it absolves people of accountability for their actions , she explained , but it is a nudge toward or away from temptation .
" This is n't an excuse for blaming other people for our failures , " vanDellen said .
" Yes , I 'm getting nudged , but it 's not like my friend is taking the cookie and feeding it to me ; the decision is ultimately mine . "

It is our closest neighbor in space , yet the moon continues to surprise us as new lunar missions overturn old ideas about Earth ’s satellite .
In October NASA intentionally crashed the 2.8 - ton upper stage of a Centaur rocket into a crater near the lunar south pole .
Four minutes later , the Lunar Crater Observation and Sensing Spacecraft ( LCROSS ) followed , analyzing the dust kicked up by the impact .
NASA anticipated a debris plume 30 miles high , which should have been visible from Earth with a 10 - inch telescope .
The smashup proved more whimper than bang for amateur observers , but LCROSS team members were thrilled .
“ We got wonderful measurements from all phases of the impact : the flash , the ejecta plume , and the resulting crater formed by Centaur , ” says LCROSS principal investigator Anthony Colaprete of NASA ’s Ames Research Center .
He and colleagues are still analyzing the data from ultraviolet , visual , and infrared spectroscopy to measure the chemical composition of the lunar material .
“ We ’re looking for water vapor or ice , as well as hydrocarbons and other volatiles , ” he says .
The LCROSS results will flesh out the surprise announcements in September that three other spacecraft — India ’s Chandrayaan - 1 and NASA ’s Deep Impact and Cassini — detected traces of water on the moon ’s surface by studying reflected infrared light from the sun .
The water ’s origins are unclear .
One possibility is that hydrogen ions from the solar wind bond with oxygen in the lunar soil , says University of Maryland astronomer Jessica Sunshine , deputy principal investigator on Deep Impact .
Results like these belie the moon ’s image as an inert rock , Colaprete says .
“ It is an active , breathing body . ”
The moon might have more water deposited by icy comets landing in cold , permanently shadowed craters at the south pole .
The Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter ( LRO ) , circling the moon at an altitude of 31 miles , recently sent back the first global temperature maps of the surface ( at right ) .
Some of those craters dip to around – 400 degrees Fahrenheit , the coldest places ever measured in the solar system .
LRO ’s neutron detector suggests the presence of water in deep freeze there .
The orbiter is also measuring radiation , looking for good spots for future exploration , and mapping the moon ’s topography to 100 - meter resolution .
Anatoly Perminov , head of the Russian Space Agency , caught scientists off guard when he called for a closed meeting of Russian scientists to counter a killer asteroid headed our way .
He said that a potential impact from the asteroid Apothis around 2036 could kill hundreds of thousands of people .
Immediately this conjured up images of Bruce Willis and his space cowboys riding the Space Shuttle to blow up a comet in the movie " Armageddon . "
Scientists , realizing that the danger is slight but real , have in fact seriously proposed various ways in which to deflect the asteroid .
The Russians take such a threat seriously , since a " city buster " hit Tunguska , Siberia , in 1908 , flattening about a thousand square miles of forest , destroying about 100 million trees , and leaving a huge scar in the Earth .
The object that struck Siberia was probably only 100 feet across , yet it created a blast about 1,000 times greater than the Hiroshima bomb .
The shock waves were so intense they were detected in Europe .
It created a strange glow which spread over Asia and Europe so that you could read the London papers at night .
If it had hit Moscow , it would have completely flattened that city and beyond .
A city - buster like that happens once every 100-300 years , with most of them hitting the oceans .
Plans to counter such a hypothetical threat , however , are sketchy .
A staple of science fiction is to send the Space Shuttle to blow it up .
Bad idea .
Issam Mudawar , at left , a Purdue professor of mechanical engineering , and doctoral student Milan Visaria display their first - and second - generation heat exchangers , a crucial component of a hydrogen storage system for cars .

( PhysOrg.com ) --
Researchers have completed work on a crucial component for an experimental hydrogen storage system for cars , part of efforts to reduce pollution and the use of fossil fuels in transportation .
The system uses a fine metal powder to absorb hydrogen gas under high pressure .
When the powder absorbs hydrogen , it becomes a " metal hydride , " and the process is called " hydriding . "
By then decreasing the pressure in the vessel or warming the metal hydride , the hydrogen can be released to drive a fuel cell or engine .
A complication in perfecting the technology , however , is that the hydriding process generates heat , which hinders the absorption process and prevents the hydrogen storage vessel from being filled rapidly , said Issam Mudawar , a Purdue University professor of mechanical engineering who is leading the work with research assistant professor Timothée Pourpoint and doctoral student Milan Visaria .
" If you 're driving your hydrogen car , you can't wait an hour at the filling station , " Mudawar said .
" For this system to be practical , you have to be able to cool the hydride efficiently so that the storage vessel can be filled within five minutes with enough fuel to drive 300 miles . "
The researchers have made progress in solving the problem by designing , building and testing the system 's heat exchanger and circulating coolant through tubes to remove heat and speed hydrogen storage , Mudawar said .
The engineers filed a final patent in February for the heat exchanger , a coil of stainless steel tubing that fits inside a hydrogen storage " pressure vessel " 4 inches in diameter .
Standard automotive coolant is circulated through the tubing .
Such a storage technology could help make hydrogen cars a reality if other researchers are successful in developing improved alloys for hydriding and better fuel cells , which generate electricity to power an electric motor .
The hydrogen also could be burned instead of gasoline in internal combustion engines .
Due to space constraints , it is essential that the heat exchanger occupy the least volume possible inside the storage vessel .
Using a theoretical model they developed , the researchers determined how to precisely position the tubing so that no fins are needed to dissipate heat .
Eliminating the fins reduces the cost , weight and size of the heat exchanger , Mudawar said .
The researchers designed a system that occupies the least space possible while also properly cooling the hydride .
Whereas an earlier prototype occupied 30 percent of the vessel , leaving 70 percent for the metal hydride , the new design occupies 7 percent , leaving 93 percent for the hydride .
" The idea behind this latest design is to provide the coolant as close as possible to the hydride while eliminating the need for bulky heat spreading components like fins , " Mudawar said .
" The main advantages of this design are simplicity and flexibility .
It can easily be adapted depending on cooling and size requirements . "

Now that the Moon is absent from the early evening picture , are you ready to journey around a black hole ?
It ’s not an easy observation , but it is one that does n’t require highly specialized equipment and its not difficult to find .
Can you identify Capella ?
Then let ’s rock …
Using the map below to help you identify the constellation of Auriga , you wo n’t have any problem picking out the sixth brightest star in the northern hemisphere night – bright , yellowish - white Capella .
While Alpa Aurigae is an interested spectroscopic binary star , it ’s not our target .
If your skies are fairly dark , look a few fingerwidths southwest for much dimmer Epsilon ( the backward 3 on our map ) .
Epsilon Aurigae is an eclipsing binary star , but one that has an extraordinarily long period - 27.1 years .
While it only drops .8 of a magnitude , it ’s dark companion is a 10 - 12 solar mass black hole .
According to studies done by Wilson and Cameron a ring of obscuring material surrounds the black hole and accounts for the magnitude drop .
And it ’s dropping now !
According to AAVSO Special Notice # 192 prepared by Aaron Price : “ Epsilon Aurigae continues to progress through its first eclipse since 1982 - 84 .
Visual and photometric observation means place it at around magnitude 3.7 - 3.8 .
Totality was likely reached sometime in January , but it will take some time to analyze the data to establish a specific date .
Totality is expected to last about 15 months , but the system is not expected to remain quiet during this time .
Small amplitude modulations are being detected which are likely not associated with the eclipse itself .
However , their exact source is still debated .
The amplitude of these modulations are at the limit of the average observer ’s ability to detect visually .
Therefore this may make a nice , challenging system to test your eyes .
Right now , Epsilon Aurigae is well placed for observing high in the sky right after dusk .
In addition to these modulations , a mid-eclipse brightening of a few tenths of a magnitude have been reported in past eclipses .
If confirmed , it would contribute significantly to our understanding of the structure of the eclipsing disk of material .
The problem is this will happen next summer when epsilon Aurigae is near solar conjunction .
So observations very early in the morning later this season will be very important .
It may be a good idea to begin practicing twilight observations right now . ”
What will it look like ?
Just a barely perceptible change in brightness , but observers interested in DSLR or photoelectric photometers may want to use this project as an entry point .
A team of observers is working on a series of tutorials on the Citizen Sky web site .
General information regarding the Epsilon Aurigae campaign and a series of online discussion forums can be found at the Citizen Sky web site .
Information is also available to submit your observations to the American Association of Variable Star Observers ( AAVSO ) , too !

FORT STEWART , Ga. 
Under crystalline winter skies , a light infantry unit headed for Iraq was practicing precision long - range shooting through a pall of smoke .
But the fire generating the haze had nothing to do with the training exercise .
Staff members at the Army post had set the blaze on behalf of the red- cockaded woodpecker , an imperiled eight - inch - long bird that requires frequent conflagrations to preserve its pine habitat .
Even as it conducts round - the - clock exercises to support two wars , Fort Stewart spends as much as $ 3 million a year on wildlife management , diligently grooming its 279,000 acres to accommodate five endangered species that live here .
Last year , the wildlife staff even built about 100 artificial cavities and installed them 25 feet high in large pines so the woodpeckers did not have to toil for six months carving the nests themselves .
The military has not always been so enthusiastic about saving endangered plants and animals , arguing that doing so would hinder its battle preparedness .

Google has since offered two methods to turn off Buzz .
" I feel like they did something wrong , " said Hibnick , an active Gmail user and second - year law student , as quoted by ABC News .
" They opted me into this social network and I did n't want it .

Two youths who served alcohol at an unsupervised high school party where a boy collapsed and later died were sentenced to community service , fined and placed on two years of probation Tuesday during a somber hearing in which the boy ’s mother blamed them for her son ’s death .
Patrick “ P.J. ” and Alexandra “ Ali ” Gabrielli , 18 and 20 respectively , at whose Orinda home the party was held , listened gravely as a Contra Costa County prosecutor read a statement from the mother of 16 - year - old Joseph Loudon , the high school sophomore who died after attending the May 23 party .
Marianne Payne said she believed her son ’s death was the “ result ” of the Gabriellis ’ “ actions and inactions ” that night .
Although the siblings initially waived their Miranda rights and spoke to police , Payne said they later refused to cooperate with investigators .
“ The silence has left us without answers , ” wrote Payne , who said through the prosecutor that she was too emotional to appear because it was the nine - month anniversary of her middle son ’s death .
“ There has been built a great wall of silence . ”
Loudon , described by friends as witty , athletic and spiritual , collapsed in a hallway after spending less than two hours at the party .
Witnesses described him as bluish and said he did not appear to be breathing .
A girl revived him with CPR , but no one called 911 .
Most of the partygoers , including the Gabriellis , did not witness the collapse , investigators said .
Loudon told friends he would be fine , and they helped him to a bedroom , where he later vomited and aspirated .
An autopsy revealed that Loudon had a blood - alcohol level of .03 % , the equivalent of about a beer .
Medical examiners listed the cause of death as “ undetermined ” and suggested that he had suffered from a previously undetected heart ailment .
The Gabriellis ’ mother and stepfather were out of town the night of the party .
P.J. Gabrielli was then a junior in high school , and his sister a sophomore in college .
Loudon , who had told his mother he was going to the movies , lived across the street from the Gabriellis , and he and his two brothers grew up with them .
Payne said she wished she could have foreseen “ future dangers lurking below the surface of our seemingly idyllic community , ” an affluent , wooded town bordered by the Oakland and Berkeley hills .
“ Little did I know , ” she wrote , “ that they were right across the street . ”
The Gabriellis pleaded " no contest " to a misdemeanor violation of providing alcohol to minors , a plea that is treated as an admission of guilt for sentencing but cannot be used against them in a civil lawsuit .
They were each fined $ 1,000 , told to perform 200 hours of community service and warned that they could face jail if they drank alcohol or violated any law during the next two years .
A Japanese woman who drove home with the body of an 80 - year - old pedestrian lodged in her windscreen has been arrested on charges of causing a deadly traffic accident and fleeing the scene , police said today .
The 23 - year - old driver was believed to have struck the elderly woman in the early hours yesterday north of Tokyo before driving four miles ( seven kilometers ) home with the victim 's body wedged in the shattered windscreen .
Michiko Sato , a catering school student , was arrested after her boyfriend called police to report the accident , a police spokesman said .
When police called at Ms Sato 's home , they found the body of the elderly woman still stuck in the car 's windscreen .
" The suspect said she was so shocked that she did n't know what to do , " the police spokesman said .
He added Sato was not under the influence of alcohol at the time of the accident .
She was charged with causing a traffic accident resulting in death and escaping after running over a person with a car and faces up to 17 years in prison or a fine of up to two million yen ( $ 23,245 ) if convicted .

Nikhil Arora and Alejandro Velez 's plans after graduating from the UC Berkeley Haas School of Business did n't include becoming farmers .
But they took a detour in the spring during a business ethics class , where the two learned that coffee grounds , one of the country 's largest waste streams , could be used as a medium for growing mushrooms .
" We loved the idea and thought , ' Hey , there 's something we can do with this ' - the country 's addicted to coffee , " says Velez .
Starting out with a fraternity kitchen and a $ 5,000 social innovation grant from the university , they teamed up with UC Berkeley Professor Tom Bruns , a mycology expert .
Once they achieved success , the next step was quality control : Velez and Arora , both 22 , took their mushrooms to the crew at Chez Panisse for a taste test .
They got the thumbs up .
" Who better than a chef at one of the country 's top restaurants ? " says Velez .
Bttrventures ( the first part of the name is pronounced " better " and stands for " back to the roots " ) partners with Peet 's Coffee , picking up 2 tons of grounds each week .
Using spawn from a California supplier , the oyster mushrooms are grown in bags in a temperature - controlled warehouse in Emeryville .
They produce a couple hundred pounds per week and sell to Bay Area Whole Foods stores , where they fetch $ 10.99 to $ 14.99 per pound .
The company is also a zero - waste operation : Leftover grounds become compost for gardens at schools and other organizations in Oakland .
Peet 's Director of Coffee Purchasing Shirin Moayyad , who helped Arora and Velez procure a steady supply of grounds , says that besides reducing waste , Bttrventures offers another layer of benefit : a high - value food stuff .
" We 're providing something that we can feed our local community with , " she says .
Recently Bttrventures began selling mushroom - growing kits for $ 20 at farmers ' markets .
Each bag produces about a pound of mushrooms in up to three flushes .
Cut a cross in the plastic and mist with water a couple of times daily until the first " pins " poke up ( about a week ) .
Once pinning occurs , more frequent misting encourages mushrooms to burst through the bag after another week .
As one might expect , a clear bag of coffee grounds and fungus looks a lot like what you 'd find at the bottom of the trash can .
Velez admits the product lacks a certain ornamental appeal and is hard at work on packaging .
Bttrventures oyster mushroom garden , $ 20 , is available at the following farmers ' markets : Parkmerced in San Francisco and Grand Lake in Oakland on Saturday ; Stonestown in San Francisco and the Moraga market on Sunday , and Old Oakland on Thursday .
Kits are available online at bttrventures.com .
Afghanistan 's president , Hamid Karzai , was dealt a painful political blow yesterday when the country 's parliament rejected 70 % of his nominees for a new cabinet , including a regionally powerful warlord and the only female minister .
The secret ballot of MPs , which came at a crucial point in Karzai 's quest for legitimacy in the eyes of Afghans and the rest of the world , resulted in the rejection of 17 out of 24 of his nominees .
The most high - profile scalp was that of the water and power minister , Ismail Khan , a warlord in the western province of Herat during the 1990s civil war who is accused of corruption and human rights abuses .
Critics say he is an example of how the president remains beholden to regional powerbrokers .
" I think , unfortunately , that the criteria were either ethnicity or bribery or money , " MP Fawzia Kufi said of many of the names put forward by Karzai in the middle of December .
The rejection of the women 's affairs minister , Husn Bano Ghazanfar , was another awkward blow to Karzai , who has pledged to place more women in senior government posts .
The nominations were meant to keep 12 ministers in their posts for a second term and appeared , in part , to be aimed at satisfying US and western wishes that trusted hands be retained .
Karzai is believed to have hoped to put a new cabinet in place by the time an international conference on Afghanistan takes place in London on 28 January .
Of the seven nominees approved during yesterday 's voting by more than 200 MPs , all but one are currently cabinet ministers .
The Afghan president , who visited the southern province of Helmand yesterday to express his condolences to relatives of civilians allegedly killed in a Nato air strike on Wednesday , has pledged to make new nominations for the empty posts but it was unclear when those names will be announced , or when a parliamentary vote will be held .
The chief of Afghanistan 's elections commission said parliamentary elections will be held on 22 May , just 10 months after Karzai 's victory in a presidential vote marred by fraud and violence .
WASHINGTON 
As millions of people along the East Coast hole up in their snowbound homes , the two sides in the climate - change debate are seizing on the mounting drifts to bolster their arguments .
Skeptics of global warming are using the record - setting snows to mock those who warn of dangerous human - driven climate change  this looks more like global cooling , they taunt .
Most climate scientists respond that the ferocious storms are consistent with forecasts that a heating planet will produce more frequent and more intense weather events .
But some independent climate experts say the blizzards in the Northeast no more prove that the planet is cooling than the lack of snow in Vancouver or the downpours in Southern California prove that it is warming .
The international significance of Sri Lanka ’s emerging police state
16 February 2010
The rapid moves by the Sri Lankan government towards a police state not only spell danger for the working class on this island , but are a warning to workers around the world .
As debt crises erupt in country after country and governments encounter resistance to the savage austerity measures being demanded by international finance capital , the anti-democratic methods of President Mahinda Rajapakse are an advance notice of the measures that will be used elsewhere .
Political tensions in Colombo illustrate broader international processes in an acute form .
The island was embroiled in a savage communal war for 26 years which came to an end with the defeat of the separatist Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam ( LTTE ) last May .
President Rajapakse , who had restarted the war in 2006 and conducted it with particular ruthlessness , declared that he would now bring “ peace and prosperity ” to the island .
The opposite has been the case .
The end of the fighting solved none of the underlying problems .
Having mortgaged the country to pay for his criminal war , Rajapakse was compelled to take out a $ 2.6 billion loan from the International Monetary Fund ( IMF ) to prevent a major balance of payments crisis .
Now with the IMF calling the tune , the government is preparing to make major inroads into the living standards of working people .
Rajapakse has been seeking to consolidate his grip over the state apparatus in preparation for social convulsions .
In the course of the war , he increasingly operated through a presidential cabal of relatives , close advisers and generals acting independently of parliament and with growing contempt for constitutional and legal norms .
The president wielded his extensive powers under the state of emergency , which is still in place , to ban strikes , threaten the media and conduct widespread detentions without trial .
Pro-government death squads acting with the complicity of the security forces killed hundreds of people , including politicians and journalists .
Calculating that he could politically exploit the military “ victory ” over the LTTE , Rajapakse called the presidential election two years early in a bid to entrench himself in power .
The opposition parties backed the country ’s former top general , Sarath Fonseka , as their “ common candidate ” in the bitterly fought election on January 26 .
Fonseka had been part of Rajapakse ’s inner circle but fell out with the president and resigned last November to contest the poll .
Rajapakse ’s election win , far from settling the issues , produced what can only be described as factional warfare in the country ’s ruling elites .
Fonseka refused to concede defeat and threatened to mount a legal challenge .
The government responded last week by placing the former general under military arrest , on the basis of unsubstantiated allegations that he was plotting to overthrow Rajapakse .
A day later , the president prorogued parliament and announced a general election for April 8 which will now take place in a political climate of fear and intimidation .
The government has already announced that its aim is to obtain a two - thirds majority , giving it the power to change the constitution and thus provide the legal fig leaf for Rajapakse ’s autocratic rule .
For all the venom of the infighting in the Colombo establishment , the factional disputes are of a tactical character — how to impose new economic burdens on working people and where to line up in the sharpening rivalry between the major powers , especially between the US and China .
Rajapakse ’s extreme measures are a sure sign that class tensions on the island are reaching a breaking point .
While Greek debts are in the international headlines , Sri Lanka ’s economic crisis is of a similar magnitude .
The country ’s overall debts rose to four trillion rupees ( $ US35 billion ) in the first 10 months of 2009 .
According to the IMF , the ratio of total public debt to gross domestic product ( GDP ) reached 87 percent in 2008 .
The budget deficit has risen to 11.3 percent of GDP and the IMF is demanding that the ratio must be slashed to 5 percent by the end of 2011 .
Hongkong and Shanghai Bank Corporation Senior Economist Robert Prior - Wandesforde told a seminar in Colombo last week that the government had to go far further in slashing public spending .
Dismissing Rajapakse ’s economic figures , Prior - Wandesforde said : “ He has to deliver like he did with terrorism [ the LTTE ] .
The one thing that would prevent Sri Lanka from reaching its true potential is the kind of recklessness , wastefulness and corruption in public expenditure . ”
Greek economic measures now have to be applied in Sri Lanka and more broadly .
But the corollary is that Sri Lankan political methods will increasingly be employed in Greece and elsewhere as popular opposition grows to huge new economic burdens .
The crisis is not isolated to economically backward countries like Sri Lanka and problem European states such as Greece , Portugal , Spain and Ireland .
A default by Greece would impact heavily on Germany and France and reverberate throughout the EU .
Britain is heavily indebted , as is the US , which is only able to sustain a budget deficit at 10.6 percent of GDP because its dollar remains the international reserve currency .
The present global economic crisis is not a temporary phenomenon , but results from the breakdown of the mechanisms put in place after World War II to restore the equilibrium of world capitalism .
The United States , which was central to the post - war restabilisation , is now in economic decline and is at the centre of the present financial turmoil .
Whatever the short - term ups and downs of particular economies or the global economy as a whole , the world has entered a new period of economic convulsions that has profound political ramifications for the working class .
Anyone who dismisses the warning signs in Sri Lanka would be badly mistaken .
Because of its particular history and relationship to the global economy , this small island often sharply reflects economic and political processes taking place internationally .
In the final analysis , amid heightened economic and social tensions , the ruling elites around the world are being driven to defend their privileged position by adopting Sri Lankan methods .
The working class needs to draw the necessary conclusion : the only means of defending their basic democratic rights and living standards is to abolish the present social order and to restructure society to meet the pressing needs of the majority , rather than the profits of the wealthy few .

getElementsByTagName ( )
It turns out that document fragments do not implement the getElements ByTagName ( ) method .
But they do implement the Selectors API methods : querySelector/querySelectorAll .
Nobody cares about this except for people that write JavaScript selector engines .
If you are one of those people then keep reading .
I can code around the absence of a lot of DOM methods but getElements ByTagName ( ) seemed impossible to do without .
So I had to fake it !
JavaScript performance
JavaScript is a nice enough scripting language but it is still a scripting language .
For high performance loops you should try to avoid the following :
try / catch blocks function / method calls ( even on native objects ) accessing DOM properties ( or anything that involves calling a complex getter / setter )
Please note that this is an ordered list .
The code
With all that in mind I wrote this simple implementation of getElements ByTagName ( ) which I hope is fast enough for those edge cases where users execute DOM queries on document fragments :
function getElementsByTagName( node , tagName ) { var elements = [ ] , i = 0 , any Tag = tagName === " * " , next = node .
firstChild ; while ( ( node = next ) ) { if ( anyTag ? node.nodeType === 1 : node.nodeName === tagName ) elements [ i++] = node ; next = node.firstChild || node.nextSibling ; while (! next && ( node = node.parentNode ) ) next = node .
nextSibling ; } return elements ; }

Geminid Meteor over Monument Valley
Credit & Copyright : Wally Pacholka ( AstroPics.com , TWAN )
Explanation : The Geminids are expected to put on a good show this year .
Created as planet Earth sweeps through dusty debris from extinct comet Phaethon , the annual Geminid meteor shower is predicted to peak on December 14th , around 0510 UT ( 12:10 am EST ) .
With better viewing for northern hemisphere observers , pictures of Geminids streaking through the night could include wintery landscapes , like this snow - tinged image of a 2007 Geminid meteor over buttes of the Monument Valley region in the southwestern US .
The meteor streak points back to the constellation Gemini and the shower 's radiant point , just off the upper left edge of the scene .
Along with Rigel , the sword and belt stars of Orion are at the upper right .
Near the eastern horizon are bright stars Procyon ( left ) and Sirius .
The two buttes at the far left are known as The Mittens - clearly a reminder that if you want to watch a meteor shower on a cold December night , wearing mittens would be a good idea .
( CNN ) --
It 's a silent , often overlooked danger that kills dozens of children every year , and it 's easily preventable : choking to death on food .
Now the largest pediatrician group in the United States is calling for warning labels on foods that pose the highest risk for choking .
The American Academy of Pediatrics estimates at least one child in the United States dies every five days from choking on food .
The academy rates choking as the leading cause of death among children 14 and younger .
The group is issuing a new policy statement calling on the government and manufacturers to implement a food labeling system warning parents of these risks .
" This is a call to action , " said Dr. Gary Smith , a pediatrician and immediate past chairman of the Committee on Injury , Violence and Poison Prevention of the American Academy of Pediatrics .
" For many years , the U.S. has protected children from choking on toys .
We have legislation .
We have regulation .
We have voluntary standards .
We have labeling .
We have recall programs , " said Smith , also director of the Center for Injury , Research and Policy at Nationwide Children 's Hospital in Columbus , Ohio .
" But we do n't have a consistent set of measures that have been put together for prevention of choking on food . "
Children 4 and younger are at the highest risk for choking on food .
Most only have their front teeth .
They can bite off a piece of food , but they do n't have molars in back to grind it .
" There are certain types of food that have high - risk characteristics that pose severe choking risks , " Smith said .
" For example , foods that are round or cylindrical in shape and are roughly the diameter of the back of a child 's throat -- these types of foods can completely block the child 's airway .
When that happens , the child cannot move air .
They then lack oxygen .
And if that obstruction is not removed within a short amount of time , brain damage and death will ensue .
So these are very serious choking risks . "
The American Academy of Pediatrics lists hot dogs as the highest risk food for young kids .
Grapes , raw carrots , apples and peanuts are also dangerous .
Smith said he has treated many children who later died from choking on hot dogs and grapes .
" If I took the best engineers in the world and asked them to design the perfect plug for a child 's airway , they could n't do much better than a hotdog .
It is exactly the right size and shape to wedge itself down into the back of a child 's throat .
It 's compressible so it fits in very snugly , and it 's almost impossible to dislodge . "
Katherine Zuehlke knows this problem firsthand .
She had a close call with her 2 - year - old daughter , Tiffany , but her quick thinking helped save the child 's life .
Zuehlke said a candy - coated peanut became lodged in her daughter 's throat .
" We flipped her over and started to pat her back pretty heavily , " Zuehlke told the pediatrician group .
" We were all really scared . "
Zuehlke was lucky .
As many as 100 families a year are not -- a rough estimate of how many children choke to death on food every year , according to the most recent statistics from a 2002 Centers for Disease Control and Prevention study .
There is no centralized system for collecting data on child death and injury from choking on food .
Smith and the American Academy of Pediatrics want to see that change .
Smith said he believes it 's important to start a central database that includes those kinds of statistics .
" We can do it now for toys and other consumer products .
But we can't do it for food .
That 's one of the things we 're calling for in this new policy statement , " he said .
In the meantime , the American Academy of Pediatrics lists a few tips on its Web site to help parents with problem foods .
It suggests parents :
• Cut hot dogs lengthwise and grapes in quarters .
This changes the dangerous shape of the food , which can block throats of young children and even teenagers .
• Avoid giving toddlers other high - risk foods such as hard candy , nuts , seeds and raw carrots .
• Never let small children run , play or lie down while eating .
The American Academy of Pediatrics ' new policy statement on foods that pose a high - choking danger for children 14 and under appears online .
It 's scheduled for publication in the March issue of the journal Pediatrics .
MAD Architects ’ latest contribution to Shenzhen came in the form of two huge monster footprints .
The design , made for the Urbanism \Architecture Shenzhen & Hongkong Bi-city Biennale , is a sunken space that functions as a playground .
Paved in pink EPDM material , the Monster ’s Footprint attempts to enter a very “ surreal reality ” , and offer a possibility for city dwellers to find their own freedom and joy in the Citizen Square .
The playful space illustrates MAD ‘s ability to bring their design attitude to smaller scale projects .

Several officials identified the Iraqi lawyer as Jaafar al - Mousawi , who had earlier served as the chief prosecutor in the trial of Saddam Hussein .

The second document is a response from a senior Embassy official , an e-mail message warning Blackwater officials not to bribe the Iraqi government , the officials said .
In an interview in Baghdad on Friday , Mr. Mousawi said that in February 2008 he worked with top Blackwater officials to spend up to $ 1 million to compensate the families of the Nisour Square victims .
He said he consulted with Mr. Maliki about the payments .
“ He said , ‘ Go ahead and help because these are poor people , ’ ” Mr. Mousawi said .
Saying that 40 families received a total of about $ 800,000 , he added that he believed that Blackwater hoped the compensation would help “ moisten the situation with the Iraqi government to get the license . ”
But he said that he was unaware of any efforts by Blackwater executives to bribe Iraqi officials , and that news reports misinterpreted the purpose of the victims ’ fund as intended bribes .
Several former Blackwater employees , however , had told The Times that Blackwater ’s president at the time , Gary Jackson , authorized about $ 1 million for payments to Iraqi officials , with only a small portion intended for victims .
While the documents apparently do not offer proof that Blackwater paid off any Iraqi officials , the American officials who have reviewed them say they suggest that officials at the United States Embassy in Baghdad were concerned enough about Blackwater ’s plans to issue the warning to the company .
A Justice Department spokeswoman declined to comment .
Stacey DeLuke , a spokeswoman for Blackwater , now called Xe Services , which is based in Moyock , N.C. , did not respond to a request for comment .
The bribery investigation is still in its early stages , according to officials familiar with the inquiry .
They said that lawyers in the fraud section at the Justice Department ’s Washington headquarters were working with federal prosecutors in North Carolina , where a federal grand jury has been examining Blackwater ’s activities for several years .
The State Department is also cooperating with the bribery investigation , several officials said .
If the United States is at a loss over what to do about nuclear waste , it may be time to check out the Swedish model .
A symposium at the annual meeting of the American Assn. for the Advancement of Science in San Diego last week highlighted the Swedish power industry in gaining public support for a geological repository for high - level radioactive waste .
The Scandinavian success comes in stark contrast to efforts in the U.S. , where spent nuclear fuel rods have remained for decades in temporary storage at power plants around the country .
Meanwhile , Congress has debated where to bury them , decided on a repository under Yucca Mountain in Nevada , and then changed its mind .
The Obama administration , mindful of the fierce resistance of Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid ( D - Nev. ) , has opposed Yucca and , in the 2011 budget , slashed all funding for the project , which is led by the Department of Energy .
Also , President Obama has called for “ a new generation of safe , clean nuclear plants ” and has budgeted $ 36 billion in loan guarantees for nuclear power .
Like the U.S. , Sweden , which gets 50 % of its electricity from nuclear plants , has faced opposition in its three - decade quest to find a suitable long - term burial site .
Protests halted studies at several sites .
And the Swedes had a high barrier to overcome : Under Swedish law , any municipality can veto a repository within its borders .
The key , according to Claes Thegerstrom , chief executive of Swedish Nuclear Fuel and Waste Management Co. , was a methodical , deliberate process , with a dash of human psychological insight .
Between 1977 and 1985 , the company , a private entity acting on behalf of the nuclear industry , studied the geological suitability of 12 sites .
It then conducted scientific feasibility studies of eight sites .
By 2002 , it had narrowed the search to two municipalities , one south and one north of Stockholm .
The industry worked closely with citizens groups , local politicians and civic groups throughout the process .
It was a marked contrast , remarked one former Yucca engineer in the audience , to the process in the U.S. , where the public comment period to review 6,000 pages of federal documents was 60 days .
“ We looked at how we communicated , ” Thegerstrom said , adding that the firm gave no intimation that the waste was safe .
Instead , “ we started with the basic message :
This spent fuel is very dangerous .
It exists , so we have to find a solution . ”
By the time the choice was narrowed to two sites , Thegerstrom noted , “ some basic psychological things played a role .
One was to have different options .
In our case , we got to the point of having competition .
That is a strong driving force . ”
The two municipalities came to see the repository as a source of jobs and international prestige and were “ eager to be selected . ”
Another difference : The U.S. effort was led by the Department of Energy , with Congress pulling the strings , canceling the original plan to have one repository in the East and another in the West , instead anointing Yucca .
“ There were selection criteria ” for geological , tectonic and geochemical suitability , noted Allison Macfarlane , a George Mason University geologist who served on the symposium panel , “ but they were abandoned . ”
Thegerstrom said the national government in Sweden , once it enacted a law allowing a repository , maintained a hands - off policy as to its location , allowing industry officials to make the decision , in consultation with local government .
“ In Sweden , the industry is responsible , ” he said .
“ But in the U.S. , the industry is absent from the nuclear waste discussion .
That seems very strange . ”
The Swedish underground repository , in crystalline bedrock , is expected to be built by 2020 .
Macfarlane , recently appointed to Obama ’s Blue Ribbon Commission on America ’s Nuclear Future , said upcoming decisions in the U.S. should include geologists “ in a decision - making role ” and allow communities to reject sites .
Multiple repositories will be needed , not only because there is too much waste for Yucca alone , even if it were to be revived , but also , she said , “ to restore a sense of fairness and share the burden . ”
The U.S. should consider “ moving waste management out ” of the Department of Energy , Macfarlane suggested , perhaps into a public - private partnership .
The big question , she added , is : “ Can we resolve the nuclear waste issue before we have a large expansion of nuclear energy ? ”

â€ œThe bourgeoisie , by the rapid improvement of all instruments of production , by the immensely facilitated means of communication , draws all , even the most barbarian , nations into civilization , â€ declared Karl Marx in The Communist Manifesto .
These days , authoritarian regimes of all sorts find such " immensely facilitated means of communicationâ€  alarming , most especially the intellectual heirs of Marx who rule the Peopleâ€™s Republic of China .
And nothing has facilitated communication more immensely than the spread the Internet across the globe in the past two decades .
Now nearly 2 billion people use the Internet , some 400 million of them in China .
Chinaâ€™s rulers have attempted to deny their citizens Internet access to subversive ideas by constructing the Great Firewall of Chinaâ € " or as the Chinese Ministry of Public Security prefers to call it , the Golden Shield Project .
The Firewall was instituted in 1998 and censorship has grown increasingly strict ever since .
It is estimated that some 30,000 people are employed by the Ministry of Public Security to monitor and block offending websites .
The Firewall prevents Chinese citizens from accessing at least 18,000 foreign websites , including such subversive sites as Twitter and YouTube .
Given the Chinese governmentâ€™s attitude toward critical reporting , I used Website Test to find that the access to the nonprofit Committee to Protect Journalists * website is blocked .
Recently the controversy over the Firewall heated up in the wake of a series of hacker attacks on the gmail accounts of Chinese human rights activists .
Spurred by this intrusion , last month Google announced , â€ œWe have decided we are no longer willing to continue censoring our results on Google.cn , and so over the next few weeks we will be discussing with the Chinese government the basis on which we could operate an unfiltered search engine within the law , if at all .â€ 
Google entered the Chinese market in 2006 with the launch of Google.cn .
When China joined the World Trade Organization ( WTO ) in 2001 it agreed that foreign service companies would have the same access to markets in China as domestic companies do .
Now the European Union and the U.S. Trade Representative office are considering an argument that the Great Firewall violates Chinaâ€™s obligations to permit free trade in services under its agreements with the WTO .
Last year , in a working paper titled Protectionism Online : Internet Censorship and International Trade Law , the European Centre for International Political Economy ( ECIPE ) think tank argued that â€ œWTO member states are legally obliged to permit an unrestricted supply of crossborder Internet services.â€ 
Since 2007 , the California First Amendment Coalition ( CFAC ) has been pushing the U.S. Trade Representative to file a case against China on the grounds that it has been violating its WTO obligations .
CFAC argues that , among other violations , China discriminates against foreign suppliers of Internet services by blocking them at the border while allowing domestic suppliers to offer like services .
In addition , China has violated its commitments not to introduce or apply non-tariff measures when it joined the WTO by blocking a number of imported products without explanation or justification .
China has also not set up any administrative procedures through which foreign suppliers of online services could appeal the blocking of imported publications and content .
Based on precedent , the ECIPE report argues that the WTO would very likely find that Chinaâ€™s censorship is a breach of its free trade obligations .
For example , last year the WTO ruled that China was violating its obligations to allow foreign enterprises and individuals to import , either physically or via electronic means , reading materials , audiovisual home entertainment products such as DVDs , music and other sound recordings , and films for theatrical release .
In international contexts , China is often a stickler that insists that other countries adhere to their agreed upon treaty obligations , so there is some possibility that China would lower its Firewall if the WTO ruled against it .
But a ruling from the WTO does n't necessarily come anywhere close to guaranteeing that China will open up Internet access .
â€ œNot all WTO rulings … result in actual compliance , â€ the ECIPE report notes , with a certain understatement .
â€
œThe member found to be employing WTO - inconsistent measures might decide to continue to use them and accept the consequent retaliation .
â€ 
Generally , if a country refuses to accept a WTO ruling other countries can retaliate by imposing tariffs on goods and services from that country .
For example , the WTO found that the European ban on the import of beef from the U.S. that had been treated with growth hormone is based on specious health concerns and is not compatible with its WTO obligations .
When the European Union refused to lift the ban , the U.S. imposed retaliatory tariffs on such European products as Roquefort cheese .
If the WTO found that Chinaâ€™s censorship was a violation of its commitments to free trade in services , but nevertheless refused to lift it , China could either accept retaliatory tariffs or withdraw its commitments and pay compensation to companies that had been adversely affected by the censorship .
A spokeswoman for the trade representative 's office recently told Agence France - Presse , â€ œThis is a very complex area that we continue to think through , in consultation with interested groups including the First Amendment Coalition and have not made any decisions one way or another .â€ 
Googleâ€™s stand against Chinese censorship offers the Obama administration an opportunity to put pressure on China to open up its information markets , especially by filing of a WTO case .
As Karl Marx also noted in The Communist Manifesto , commerce is the â€œheavy artilleryâ€ that â€œbatters down all Chinese walls .â€ 
It will be commerce that brings down the Great Firewall of China as well .

* Disclosure : I have been making small donations to the Committee to Protect Journalists for a number of years .
Today I had to write an assignment for my Evolutionary Algorithms course , which was to implement a genetic algorithm to solve the Traveling Salesman Problem .
I wrote the Python code , it worked well but it took a while to find a good solution with 100 cities , and I realised it would be a few days before I could get a solution for the dataset with 3000 cities .
I definitely needed to speed up my program somehow .
I decided to give Cython a try .
Cython is a Python optimizer , you basically annotate your code with types so that Cython can get rid of your Python calls and convert them to pure C , with all the speed that entails .
After spending a few hours adding types to my program ( it would be a lot less if I did n’t need to pass a huge array to two classes ) , I finally had working code .
My code did n’t require many changes , I only really optimised two functions .
One went from this :
def fitness ( self ) : cost = 0 for index in range ( 1 , GENOME_LENGTH ) : cost += GRAPH [ self .
genome [ index - 1 ] , self .
genome [ index ] ] cost += GRAPH [ self .
genome [ GENOME_LENGTH - 1 ] , self .
genome [ 0 ] ] return cost
to this :
def fitness ( self ) : cdef numpy .
float64_t cost = 0 cdef int index cdef numpy .
ndarray [ numpy .
float64_t , ndim = 2 ] graph = self .
graph cdef numpy .
ndarray [ numpy .
int64_t , ndim = 1 ] genome = self .
get_genome ( ) for index in range ( 1 , GENOME_LENGTH ) : cost += graph [ genome [ index - 1 ] , genome [ index ] ] cost += graph [ genome [ GENOME_LENGTH - 1 ] , genome [ 0 ] ] return cost
The other went from this :
positions = ( randrange ( GENOME_LENGTH ) , randrange ( GENOME_LENGTH ) ) start = min ( positions ) stop = max ( positions ) son = father .
copy ( ) daughter = mother .
copy ( ) if start == stop : return ( son , daughter ) # Crossover for mother - son. for gene in mother .
genome [ start : stop ] : for counter in range ( GENOME_LENGTH ) : if son .
genome [ counter ] == gene : son .
genome [ counter ] = - 1 for counter in range ( start , stop ) : if son .
genome [ counter ] != - 1 : for counter2 in range ( start ) : if son .
genome [ counter2 ] == - 1 : son .
genome [ counter2 ] = son .
genome [ counter ] son .
genome [ counter ] = - 1 for counter2 in range ( stop , GENOME_LENGTH ) : if son .
genome [ counter2 ] == - 1 : son .
genome [ counter2 ] = son .
genome [ counter ] son .
genome [ counter ] = - 1 son .
genome [ start : stop ] = mother .
genome [ start : stop ]
to this :
positions = ( randrange ( GENOME_LENGTH ) , randrange ( GENOME_LENGTH ) ) cdef int start = min ( positions ) cdef int stop = max ( positions ) cdef int counter cdef int counter2 cdef numpy .
int64_t gene cdef numpy .
ndarray [ numpy .
int64_t , ndim = 1 ] mother_genome = mother .
get_genome ( ) cdef numpy .
ndarray [ numpy .
int64_t , ndim = 1 ] father_genome = father .
get_genome ( ) son = father .

Compiling it with - O3 in GCC gave me the following results :
cities python cython
--------
------------
---------- 17 20 sec 3.45 sec 48 69 sec 3.92 sec 100 217 sec 4.88 sec 2500 many hours 868 sec
You read that right , there ’s a 43 x speedup with the 100 cities dataset .
I suspect that reading it is what takes the most time .
I have not tried this with the largest dataset yet , but pure Python had n’t finished 100 epochs in about 20 minutes while the Cython code did them in about 30 seconds .
These speedups are nothins short of amazing , especially considering that I only spent an hour or two , and most of that was spent looking at the manual or trying to figure out how to pass my array in the code .
If you have a piece of Python that you need to run fast , then I would recommend you used Cython immediately .
This means that I can exploit the beauty of Python and the speed of C together , and that ’s a match made in heaven .
Lack of Flash in the iPad ( and before that , in the iPhone ) is a win for accessible , standards - based design .
Not because Flash is bad , but because the increasing popularity of devices that do n’t support Flash is going to force recalcitrant web developers to build the semantic HTML layer first .
Additional layers of Flash UX can then be optionally added in , just as , in proper , accessible , standards - based development , JavaScript UX enhancements are added only after we verify that the site works without them .
As the percentage of web users on non-Flash - capable platforms grows , developers who currently create Flash experiences with no fallbacks will have to rethink their strategy and start with the basics before adding a Flash layer .
They will need to ensure that content and experience are delivered with or without Flash .
Developers always should have done this , but some do n’t .
For those who do n’t , the growing percentage of users on non-Flash - capable platforms is a wake - up call to get the basics right first .
Whither , plug-ins ?
Flash wo n’t die tomorrow , but plug - in technology is on its way out .
Plug - in technology made sense when web browsing was the province of geeks .
It was a brilliant solution to the question of how to extend the user experience beyond what HTML allowed .
People who were used to extending their PC via third - party hardware , and jacking the capabilities of their operating system via third - party spell checkers , font managers , and more , intuitively grasped how to boost their browser ’s prowess by downloading and updating plug-ins .
But tomorrow ’s computing systems , heralded by the iPhone , are not for DIYers .
You do n’t add Default Folder or FontExplorer X Pro to your iPhone , you do n’t choose your iPhone ’s browser , and you do n’t install plug-ins in your iPhone ’s browser .
This lack of extensibility may not please the Slashdot crowd but it ’s the future of computing and browsing .
The bulk of humanity does n’t want a computing experience it can tinker with ; it wants a computing experience that works .
HTML5 , with its built - in support for video and audio , plays perfectly into this new model of computing and browsing ; small wonder that Google and Apple ’s browsers support these HTML5 features .
The power shifts
Google not only makes a browser , a phone , an OS , and Google Docs , it also owns a tremendous amount of video content that can be converted to play in HTML5 , sans plug - in .
Apple not only makes Macs , iPhones , and iPads , it is also among the largest retail distributors of video and audio content .
Over the weekend , a lot of people were doing the math , and there was panic at Adobe and schadenfreude elsewhere .
Apple and Adobe invented modern publishing together in the 1980s , and they ’ve been fighting like an old unmarried couple ever since , but Apple ’s decision to omit Flash from the iPad is n’t about revenge , it ’s about delivering a stable platform .
And with HTML5 here , the tea leaves are easy to read .
Developers who supplement Flash with HTML5 may soon tire of Flash — but Adobe has a brief but golden opportunity to create the tools with which rich HTML5 content is created .
Let ’s see if they figure that out .
Discussion has moved to a new thread .
In an event - related fMRI study , we scanned eighteen normal human subjects while they viewed three categories of pictures ( events , objects and persons ) which they classified according to desirability ( desirable , indifferent or undesirable ) .
Each category produced activity in a distinct part of the visual brain , thus reflecting its functional specialization .
We used conjunction analysis to learn whether there is a brain area which is always active when a desirable picture is viewed , regardless of the category to which it belongs .
The conjunction analysis of the contrast desirable > undesirable revealed activity in the superior orbito - frontal cortex .
This activity bore a positive linear relationship to the declared level of desirability .
The conjunction analysis of desirable > indifferent revealed activity in the mid-cingulate cortex and in the anterior cingulate cortex .
In the former , activity was greater for desirable and undesirable stimuli than for stimuli classed as indifferent .
Other conjunction analyses produced no significant effects .
These results show that categorizing any stimulus according to its desirability activates three different brain areas : the superior orbito - frontal , the mid-cingulate , and the anterior cingulate cortices .
Desire is defined in the Oxford English Dictionary as “ that feeling or emotion which is directed to the attainment of some object from which pleasure or satisfaction is expected ” .
The definition is well suited as an introduction to this study , for it has three elements that are critical to it , namely an external object , a feeling directed to the attainment of satisfaction from that object , and an internal ( subjective ) reward or satisfaction .
We therefore hypothesized that desire would activate at least some segment of the reward system of the brain , especially areas that are involved with both expectation and satisfaction .
Previous studies have attempted to clarify the neural correlates of emotional states related to reward and motivation , such as monetary reward [ 1 ] – [ 3 ] , drug craving [ 4 ] , [ 5 ] , and food choice [ 6 ] , [ 7 ] , without however identifying a common brain area whose activity correlates with these different categories of reward .
In the present study , we investigated desire in general , without confining ourselves to a particular category , for example desire for persons .
Our aim was to learn whether there are any brain areas in which activity correlates with desire in general and , if so , whether the level of activity in them is related quantitatively to the declared levels of desire .
Table 1A shows the distribution of the classification of stimuli by category averaged across all scanning subjects .
A 3×3 chi-square test shows no significant differences , either across response classifications or across stimulus categories ( df = 4 , χ 2 = 2.08 ) .
A chi-square test was also used to check that subjects made equal numbers of ‘ desirable ’ , ‘ indifferent ’ and ‘ undesirable ’ responses in each category and no significant differences were found ( events χ 2 = 3.18 , persons χ 2 = 0.91 , objects χ 2 = 1.46 , df in all cases = 2 ) .
Table 1B similarly shows response times in classifying a stimulus according to its desirability .
A 3×3 ( stimulus categories x response classifications ) repeated measures ANOVA showed no significant main effect either in stimulus category ( F 2,34 = 0.865 ) or in response classification ( F 2,68 = 1.195 ) , and also showed no significant interaction between the two factors ( F 4,68 = 0.275 ) .
We can conclude that , averaged over all subjects , there were no significant differences in the behavioral data , either between stimulus categories or between response classifications .
Each subject was scanned in a 1.5 - T MRI scanner ( Shimazu - Marconi , Japan ) to obtain blood oxygen level - dependent ( BOLD ) contrast functional images , using a gradient - echo EPI sequence ( TE , 50 ms ; TR , 4 s ) .
Each functional image volume of the whole brain was acquired in 40 slices , each consisting of 64 ×64 voxels , of 3.5 - mm thickness ( no gaps between slices ) .
After completion of the experiment , a T1 - weighted anatomical scan was obtained for each subject .
Statistical analysis was performed with SPM5 ( Statistical Parametric Mapping , http://www.fil.ion.ucl.ac.uk/spm ; Wellcome Trust Centre for Neuroimaging , London , UK ) .
The EPI images were realigned , normalized to the Montreal Neurological Institute ( MNI ) template , smoothed with a 8 - mm Gaussian kernel , and filtered temporally with a high - pass cutoff ( 128 seconds ) to remove drift terms .
The images were also realigned in time using sinc interpolation before spatial normalization .
The data were analyzed in a conventional fashion , using the summary - statistic approach to implement a random effects analysis at the between - subject or second level .
At the within - subject level , we specified regressors based on stimulus functions convolved with a hemodynamic response function .
These stimulus functions encoded the presentation of each of the three categories of stimuli ( events , objects , and persons ) and their desirability ( desirable , indifferent , and undesirable ) based on the subject - specific ratings .
Contrasts of category and desirability effects were taken to second - level t- tests to produce statistical maps at the group level .
Unless otherwise stated , activations were significant at p<0.05 corrected family - wise for multiple comparisons at the whole brain level .
We also report other activations , where we had an a priori reason to expect activity in a specific area ; the latter are thresholded at p<0.05 corrected within a spherical small volume of 15 mm radius , centred on the cited co-ordinates and are indicated by ‘ SVC ’ appended to the co-ordinates .
For display purposes all figures are thresholded at p<0.001 uncorrected .
Co-ordinates are given in MNI space .
We also report the cluster size ( k E ) associated with each activation at this display threshold .
The stimuli were back - projected onto a screen viewed through an angled mirror .
The resolution of the screen was 1,024×768 pixels , and the height of each stimulus was about 18° ( 600 pixels ) while its width varied .
We used an event related design , in which pictures were presented in random order , and therefore unpredictably .
Each stimulus was classified as ‘ desirable ’ , ‘ indifferent ’ , or ‘ undesirable ’ by pressing one of three buttons .
Each of the 216 stimuli was presented for 3s ( no fixation required ) .
After each stimulus presentation , subjects fixated a central cross on a blank screen for 1s .
All instructions were in Japanese , and subjects were asked to push a button with the right hand to classify each stimulus as ‘ hoshii ( or nozomashii ) ’ , ‘ dochirademonai ’ , or ‘ hoshikunai ( or nozomashikunai ) ’ , Japanese words corresponding to ‘ desirable ’ , ‘ indifferent ’ , or ‘ undesirable ’ .
We emphasize at the outset that we are studying a complex sentiment , which has at least two components , ‘ wanting ’ and ‘ preference ’ .
The two , though usually linked , are not always necessarily so .
In our instructions , we therefore strongly emphasized to subjects that their classification should be based on desirability , and not on preference , giving them the example of their preferred food , which they may not desire when on a full stomach .
Subjects were interviewed to confirm that they understood the distinction before proceeding with the experiment ( see also Discussion ) .
We wanted to ensure that the scanned subjects would classify roughly equal proportions of the viewed stimuli as being ‘ desirable ’ , ‘ indifferent ’ or ‘ undesirable ’ .
To do so , we obtained normative data from fifty subjects who did not take part in the scanning ( 25 male and 25 female Japanese psychology or education students aged between 20 and 22 ) .
Although these subjects were not especially matched to those taking part in the scanning experiment in terms of age or sociological metrics , behavioral data ( see below ) collected from the scanning group nevertheless shows roughly equal proportions of ‘ desirable ’ , ‘ indifferent ’ and ‘ undesirable ’ responses when averaged across all subjects .
The scaling subjects viewed 432 pictures of three stimulus categories ( 144 pictures each of events , persons and objects ) .
The ‘ events ’ category included pictures of , for example , ‘ a traffic jam ’ , ‘ a trip to south island ’ , ‘ playing football ’ , with explanations in words given as subtitles .
The ‘ persons ’ category consisted of pictures of famous people ( e.g. , actors , politicians , etc ) and also of anonymous ones , divided between males and females .
The ‘ objects ’ category included pictures of cars , foods and adornments ( e.g. jewellery , fashion accessories etc. ) ( see Fig. 1 ) .
Subjects were shown each picture for 3s with an interval of 2s between pictures and each picture was given a desirability score between 1 and 10 .
Scores of 1 – 4 were classified as ‘ undesirable ’ , 5 and 6 as ‘ indifferent ’ , and 7 and above as ‘ desirable ’ .
We then selected the stimuli to be used for the scanning experiment .
For each of the three categories ( events , persons and objects ) we selected 24 ‘ desirable ’ , 24 ‘ indifferent ’ and 24 ‘ undesirable ’ pictures ( where the desirability classification was the common decision of at least 50 % of the subjects ) .
This resulted in a total of 216 images viewed by each scanning subject .
Eighteen healthy , right - handed , Japanese subjects ( nine females ) in the 20 to 48 yr age range participated in the study .
All had normal or corrected - to - normal vision , and none had a history of neurological or psychiatric disorder .
Informed written consent was obtained from all subjects .
The study was approved by the Ethics Committee of the National Hospital for Neurology and Neurosurgery , London , UK , and the Ethics Committee of the Institute of Advanced Technology Research , Japan .
To investigate the distribution of these relationships , we carried out a separate analysis in which we modeled the regressors for the three categories ( events , persons and objects ) with desirability as a parametric modulator .
Desirability was coded as 0 , 1 and 2 for ‘ undesirable ’ , ‘ indifferent ’ and ‘ desirable ’ respectively , and 1 st and 2 nd order polynomial expansion elements were included in the parametric modulation .
We carried out a similar conjunction analysis across the three categories ( Fig. 5 ) and found that only the SOFC ( peak − 6 , 46 , − 4 ; k E = 56 , SVC ) exhibits a linear relationship ( Fig. 6A ) while the MC ( peak − 2 , 2 , 36 ; k E = 44 , SVC ) exhibits a quadratic dependency on desirability ( Fig. 6B ) .
These locations differ very slightly from the locations discovered in the CAs of desirable > undesirable ( −4 , 46 − 6 ; Fig. 3 ) and desirable > indifferent ( 0 , 2 , 36 ; Fig. 4 ) but nevertheless lie within the corresponding cluster groups .
When the desirability rating was coded in the opposite sense ( 2 , 1 and 0 for ‘ undesirable ’ , ‘ indifferent ’ and ‘ desirable ’ respectively ) we found no areas exhibiting either a 1 st order or a 2 nd order relationship .
In the SOFC ( Fig. 3B ) the weakest activation was for stimuli classified as ‘ undesirable ’ and the strongest for those classified as ‘ desirable ’ , with activity for those classified as ‘ indifferent ’ lying in between .
In the MC ( Fig. 4B ) there was much greater activity for both ‘ desirable ’ and ‘ undesirable ’ than for ‘ indifferent ’ responses , irrespective of stimulus categories .
In the AC ( Fig. 4C ) activity to ‘ desirable ’ was greater than activity to ‘ indifferent ’ .
Peak activity was located in the mid-cingulate cortex ( MC above ) ( 0 , 2 , 36 , SVC ) .
Another activation was in anterior cingulate cortex ( AC above ) ( 0 , 34 , 4 SVC ) .
Both are shown in sagittal section ( A ) .

The peak activity voxel in MC at 0 , 2 , 36 falls within the cluster of active voxels shown in Fig 6B which exhibit a quadratic relationship with desirability .
Peak activity was located in superior orbito - frontal cortex ( −4 , 46 , − 6 SVC ) and is shown in sagittal section ( A ) .
Parameter estimates for the three stimulus categories and for the three desirability classifications ( B ) .
A proximal voxel ( −6 , 46 , − 4 , see Fig 6A ) exhibits a linear relationship with desirability .
Figure ( C ) shows the overlap in areas of cortex activated by each stimulus category ( in red , green , and yellow ) on sections through a template brain at −4 , 46 , −6 .
The main aim of the present study was to investigate the neural correlates of desire in general .
The CA of desirable > undesirable , in which three contrasts ( desirable > undesirable for events , persons , and objects ) were analyzed to extract common activations , disclosed the superior orbito - frontal cortex ( SOFC ; BA11 ) ( −4 , 46 , − 6 ; k E = 14 , SVC ) ( Fig. 3A ) .
Fig. 3C shows that there is an overlap in the activity produced by the CA of desirable > undesirable for each stimulus category .
( Fig. 2C ) The CA of objects > non-objects ( [ objects > events ] and [ objects > persons ] ) showed activation bilaterally in the occipito - temporal sulcus ( BA37 ) at − 44 , − 64 , −6 ( k E = 72 ) and at 46 , − 56 , − 10 ( k E = 80 ) ( both SVC ) , bilaterally in the lateral occipital gyri , especially centered on V3 ( BA19 ) at − 36 , − 88 , 10 ( k E = 27 ) and 36 , − 84 , 6 ( k E = 43 ) ( both SVC ) within the lateral occipital complex [ 19 ] , and in the right medial parietal lobe ( BA7 ) at 28 , − 66 , 38 ( k E = 55 ) ( SVC ) .
The areas BA37 [ 20 ] , [ 21 ] and V3 ( BA19 ) [ 22 ] have been implicated in object and shape recognition , and BA7 in categorizing or discriminating a visual shape from others [ 23 ] .
( Fig. 2B ) The CA of persons > non-persons ( [ persons > events ] and [ persons > objects ] ) produced activity bilaterally in the posterior amygdala at − 20 , −8 , − 14 ( k E = 55 ) and 22 , −8 , − 14 ( k E = 94 ) , which has been implicated in facial perception [ 15 ] , [ 16 ] , in the superior frontal gyrus ( BA9 ) at 4 , 54 , 28 ( k E = 135 ) , in the posterior cingulate ( BA23 ) at 6 , − 50 , 22 ( k E = 22 ) , in the orbito - frontal cortex ( OFC , BA11 ) at 2 , 40 , − 16 ( k E = 5 ) , in the left cerebellum at − 34 , − 78 , − 36 ( k E = 5 ) , and in the thalamus at − 2 , − 10 , 8 ( k E = 4 ) .
It also produced relatively weak activation in the middle of the fusiform gyrus ( BA37 ) at 44 , − 56 , − 24 ( k E = 12 ) ( SVC ) corresponding to the fusiform face area ( FFA ) , which has been implicated in the recognition of faces [ 17 ] , [ 18 ] .
The relative weakness of the latter activation probably reflects a confound in the stimulus ; many of the ‘ events ’ themselves included people , such as ‘ watching TV ’ or ‘ jogging around a park ’ ( see also a sample shown Fig 1A ) , which may have diminished activation in the fusiform face area .
( Fig. 2A ) The CA of events > non-events ( [ events > persons ] and [ events > objects ] ) produced activity bilaterally in the para - hippocampal place area ( PPA , [ 13 ] ) within Brodmann Area ( BA ) 36 , at − 28 , − 42 , −8 ( k E = 84 ) and at 30 , − 40 , − 8 ( k E = 24 ) , bilaterally in the angular gyri within BA39 at − 36 , − 76 , 30 ( k E = 62 ) and at 46 , − 72 , 22 ( k E = 32 ) , and in left inferior frontal gyrus ( BA44 ) at − 52 , 22 , 2 ( k E = 12 ) .
It also produced responses in the ventral posterior cingulate ( BA30 ) at − 12 , − 56 , 12 ( k E = 1514 ) , possibly reflecting the engagement of semantic and episodic memory retrieval systems ( e.g. , [ 14 ] ) .
We first identified activity specific to each stimulus category ( events , persons or objects ) using statistical parametric maps ( SPMs ) of the main effect of category .
We identified voxels that were significant and specific in showing an increase in activity for one category of pictures over the others by using a conjunction analysis and testing for greater activation in one category relative to the two others .
Discussion
In our experiments , we asked subjects to classify objects , events , or persons as to their desirability , not their preference .
A subject might categorize a stimulus as undesirable when on a full stomach at scan time , even if he or she likes the specific food stimulus ( e.g. , cake ) presented by the visual image ; heterosexual men might categorize the image of a male actor as ‘ undesirable ’ even if they have a preference for the actor and the movie .
Disentangling desirability from preference is important but not easy ( see [ 24 ] ) .
Unfortunately , the distinction is difficult to make neurologically , at least in humans .
While recent animal ( rat ) studies have shown that responses in the nucleus accumbens ( NAc ) and the ventral pallidum ( VP ) correlate with hedonic ‘ liking ’ reactions to sweetness , the NAc dominated appetitive ‘ wanting ’ reactions independently of VP activation [ 25 ] .
In humans , Rolls and McCabe [ 26 ] have shown high correlations with pleasantness ratings in chocolate cravers and non-cravers in medial OFC activity , with the non-craver group showing smaller effects .
By contrast , they did not find such correlations with ‘ wanting ’ ratings in either group .
Even so , the distinction is worth keeping in mind for future studies of this fundamental state .
Functional specialization
In this study , we explored brain areas that are specialized for categorizing a stimulus according to its desirability .
We found , as in our previous study of beauty [ 27 ] , that different categories of stimuli ( e.g. , persons or events ) activated distinct parts of the visual brain , thus emphasizing the generality of the functional specialization of the visual brain , seen even at its earliest stages [ 10 ] – [ 12 ] .
This strongly suggests that these specialized areas are participants in the classification , feeding their inputs into distinct areas of the brain which , subsequently , abstract the quality of desirability , since these latter areas do not show any evident specialization , their responses correlating with desirability instead , regardless of the source .
This result is similar to our recent study of brain activity in response to temporally irregular patterns , where the irregular patterns generated activity in different regions of the occipital lobe depending upon whether they were generated by color , luminance , number or letter stimuli ; by contrast , there was a common area in the frontal lobe that was active regardless of the category of stimulus that generated the irregular pattern [ 28 ] .
Activity in the brain 's reward system
In addition , other cortical areas related to the reward system of the brain were also activated ; in one ( SOFC ; Fig. 6A ) , the activity is related linearly to the declared intensity of the experience of desire while in another ( area MC in Fig. 6B ) the relationship is quadratic , implying that it registers whether the stimulus is desirable or undesirable without classifying it further .
Activity in a third area ( area AC in Fig. 4A ) correlated with the contrast desirable > indifferent without a significant linear or quadratic modulatory effect .
The cortex extending between the OFC and the medial cingulate cortex has many subdivisions , which may be involved in different aspects of social , emotive , and cognitive processing [ 29 ] , [ 30 ] , [ 31 ] , [ 32 ] .
The number of functionally distinct areas within Brodmann areas 11 , 12 , 24 , and 32 and the connections between them and sub-cortical regions such as the ventral tegmental area or the ventral striatum / nucleus accumbens remains unknown .
This expanse of cortex is associated with a variety of emotional states related to reward and motivation , such as monetary reward [ 1 ] – [ 3 ] , drug craving ( e.g. , [ 4 ] , [ 5 ] see also [ 33 ] , [ 34 ] for reviews ) , sexual arousal ( e.g. , [ 35 ] , [ 36 ] ) , food eating or choice ( e.g. , [ 6 ] , [ 7 ] ) , beauty [ 27 ] , and love [ 37 ] , [ 38 ] .
Overall , the results of the present study are similar to results obtained in antecedent studies by us [ 27 ] and other groups ( e.g . [ 2 ] , [ 39 ] , [ 40 ] , [ 41 ] , [ 42 ] ) in showing that activity in some of these areas ( as in the SOFC in this study ) is related linearly to the declared intensity of experience while in others ( represented in this study by MC ) it is not , ‘ desirable ’ and ‘ undesirable ’ stimuli eliciting greater activity than indifferent ones .
AC , by contrast , was only active to stimuli classified as ‘ desirable ’ .
A . The orbito - frontal cortex The OFC is part of the reward circuitry , where the assessment of facial beauty or attractiveness [ 39 ] , [ 43 ] , [ 44 ] , of pleasurable response to music [ 40 ] and of pleasant touch [ 45 ] seems to be registered .
Other evidence relating to the graded response of this area , in relation to intensity of subjective experience , comes from the subjective evaluation of the attractiveness of faces [ 46 ] , [ 47 ] .
BOLD activity was found to relate to the experienced attractiveness and , interestingly , related to gender - and sexual orientation - based evaluation of attractiveness ; thus activation of OFC was more pronounced when heterosexual men and homosexual women rated a female face as attractive or when heterosexual women and homosexual men rated male faces as attractive .
It is interesting that the OFC has also been implicated in emotional disorders , including depression ( e.g. , [ 48 ] ) .
Patients with depression commonly exhibit symptoms of loss of interest , energy , motivation , pleasure and / or sexual interest ( e.g. , [ 49 ] , [ 50 ] ) .
Antidepressants enhance noradrenergic and dopaminergic activity to offset these symptoms ( e.g. , [ 51 ] ) .
Our evidence is thus consistent with other studies in highlighting the OFC as a cortical area whose healthy functioning correlates with states of desire and whose abnormal physiology may lead to a loss of motivation and desire , of which the general loss of the ability to experience pleasure and the specific loss of sexual desire ( i.e. libido ) are key symptoms .
B . The cingulate cortex
The other two areas that responded when stimuli were judged to be desirable were located in cingulate gyrus .
In one area ( area MC in Fig. 4 ) , the desirable and undesirable states gave a higher response than the indifferent judgment .
In fact , in a previous study this area was found to be active in response to both pleasant and unpleasant odours compared to clean air , in contrast to the OFC which was activated by pleasant odours only [ 52 ] .
Similarly , the function of MC in our study would appear to be quite distinct , and only related to the experience , not its intensity .
Interestingly , only desirable or undesirable stimuli induce the need for potential response selection ( approach or avoid respectively ) , a role this area has been implicated in [ 31 ] , [ 32 ] , [ 53 ] .
Similar responses can be recorded from the amygdala , which responds to a broad range of emotions relative to stimuli of neutral valence [ 54 ] , [ 55 ] .
The amygdala also responds with equal intensity to attractive and unattractive faces , relative to those of medium attractiveness [ 41 ] .
This suggests that such structures are tuned to the detection of events of emotional value irrespective of valence in the sensory environment [ 56 ] , [ 57 ] .
The other area ( area AC in Fig. 4 ) showed a higher response for ‘ desirable ’ than for ‘ indifferent ’ .
This area was also active in our previous beauty study in the comparison beautiful versus neutral , but not ugly versus neutral [ 27 ] .
Another area engaged in a similar way is the angular gyrus which is associated with spatial attention [ 58 ] .
This region was active in the comparison beautiful versus neutral , which may have placed a greater load on the attentional system [ 56 ] but its responses , unlike the OFC but like AC , were not graded with the declared intensity of the beauty experienced [ 27 ] .
Other activations
In addition to the common activation of SOFC , there were activations that were particular to each category of visual stimulus ( Fig. 2 ) .
Previously , drugs and monetary rewards have been shown to activate regions such as the nucleus accumbens ( NAc ) , the striatum , and the hypothalamus ( e.g. , [ 59 ] , [ 60 ] ) .
Although these areas were partially activated with each stimulus category in the present study ( e.g. , object in NAc , persons in hypothalamus ) the precise neural network activated is not identical for the different categories , implying that each has a unique neural signature .
However , these more specialized activations are not of present interest to us , in work whose aim was to locate the cortical areas that correlate with desirability in general .

" the rising costs of Social Security and government health - care programs by offering to open talks with no preconditions . "
Lori Montgomery of the Washington Post reporter has a problem with Social Security .
She writes :
They are on tap as subject for debate in future talks between the GOP and Democrats in Congress .
Medicare and Medicaid are at - risk financially .
In brief , the reason for the financial fragility of Medicare and Medicaid is the affordability crisis of the U.S. health - care system .
Against this backdrop of the national health - care crisis , Social Security is the most successful insurance program going .
The key to its success is the social pooling of risk .
Social Security is not an investment .
Individual savings accounts are not insurance coverage .
President George W. Bush has tried to partially privatize Social Security , proposing individual investment accounts for younger workers .
They remain the rhetorical target as potential members of the presidentâ€™s â€œownership society .â€ 
Now increasingly , these younger workers face being paid lower wages as new hires .
Add their student fees for higher education that are rising with a grim constancy .
The White House is well aware of the social conditions that this demographic is living , which can make it desperate and therefore at - risk to scare tactics .
One example is the oft - repeated claim that Social Security will be gone when young workers retire .
Thus there is a need to change the program now .
The go - to guy for such Social Security reform is Treasury Secretary Henry M. Paulson Jr .
As the Bush presidency faces low polling numbers for its foreign and domestic policies , he needs political allies for yet another go at building support to reform Social Security .
So we see an olive branch of sorts being extended to the Democratic - majority Congress to discuss Social Security .
The problem with the administrationâ€™s plan to privatize Social Security remains what it has been .
The programâ€™s finances are sound , on rock - solid ground for the next 40 years with no change at all , the non-partisan Congressional Budget Office reports .
Presumably , the Post reporter is ignorant of this fact .
It is not arguable .
Maybe that explains the editorializing in her reporting , combining the finances of Social Security with Medicare and Medicaid .

How does theory translate into practice ?
In my other blog I discussed various approaches to concurrency , including ownership - based type systems .
And now I ’m faced with the task of applying these methods to a real - life software product , Code Co-op .
Our clients asked us to add more concurrency to make one part of Code Co-op , the dispatcher , more responsive .
The implementation language is plain old C++ , so the methodology must be based more on strict discipline than on the help from the type system .
I would like to use message passing as much as possible but , for performance reasons , I often find myself forced to operate on shared state using locks .
I will discuss various trade - offs between message passing and sharing .
I invite the readers to share their opinions , or even come up with better implementations .
When writing this code I often thought how much easier it would be to do it in the D programming language , which supports immutable and shared types , not to mention garbage collection .
However , D is strongly biased towards message passing , which is restricted to value types and immutable objects à la Erlang .
My C++ implementation combines the passing of messages that are not necessarily value types and direct sharing of data structures between threads .
I welcome discussion from the D community .
How the Dispatcher Works
The dispatcher is a program , part of Code Co-op , whose task is to distribute various deltas ( we call them scripts ) to local and remote members of version - controlled projects .
Scripts materialize in a special directory and the dispatcher gets notifications every time something changes in that directory .
It lists the directory and creates a container of file names .
For each file , it reads its header to find out the intended recipients for that script .
It looks up the recipients in its own database and maps them to destinations .
A destination is a path or an email address .
Paths may be local or network , e.g. , \\computername \sharename .
For the sake of discussion , I ’ll concentrate on network paths only .
When decoding the file header , the dispatcher creates two data structures for each script .
One is the immutable description of the script called ScriptInfo .
It contains data that never change , like the file path , a list of recipients , etc .
The other , called ScriptTicket is mutable : it contains a pointer to the corresponding ScriptInfo , a number of flags that mark its progress , and a list of copy requests –each request corresponding to a destination ( here , a network path ) .
Notice that C++ has no notion of immutability , so it ’s up to the programmer to enforce it in the case of ScriptInfo .
In a nutshell , the dispatcher has to iterate over ScriptTicket s , iterate over each ticket ’s copy requests , perform the copying and , if successful , physically stamp the corresponding file ’s header to avoid sending multiple copies in the same direction .
Only after all ScriptTicket ‘s copy requests have been successful , the corresponding script file is deleted from disk .
There is one big problem : script copying , especially across a network , might be very slow .
We do n’t want the dispatcher to be completely unresponsive during copying , so we need a separate worker thread to dispatch scripts asynchronously .
Of course the main thread has to be able to communicate , back and forth , with the worker thread .
Let ’s have a look at the data structures that must be either shared or passed between threads .
Inter - Thread Communication Objects
ScriptInfo , being immutable , can be safely shared between threads without any need for synchronization .
ScriptTicket on the other hand is mutable .
Fortunately it ’s a value type , so it may be safely passed between threads by value .
ScriptTicket is not just a flat structure–it contains pointers .
A data structure with pointers can be passed around by value as long as it is deep - copied .
Not only pointers must be copied but also the objects they point to , recursively .
However , deep copy is not always necessary for thread safety , as illustrated by ScriptTicket .
The ticket holds a pointer to the corresponding ScriptInfo but , since ScriptInfo is immutable , there is no need to deep - copy it .
ScriptTicket also contains a container of ( mutable ) copy requests .
C++ Standard Library containers of value types are also value types , even though they are pointer - based .
Their copy constructors and the assignment operators perform deep copy .
( D might have a problem with this : objects with pointers to mutable data cannot be passed as inter - thread messages . )
There is one more twist : the ticket also contains a pointer to a shared monitor ( an object that has its own lock and whose all public methods are “ synchronized ” – they all take a lock ) .
This monitor ( not shown in the picture ) is used by the UI part of the dispatcher and must reflect all changes in the status of the scripts being processed .
As long as the monitor is correctly implemented , it is safe to embed a ( shallow ) pointer to it inside the ScriptTicket –an object that is passed “ by value ” between threads .
Here we are stepping out of value semantics , but without sacrificing thread safety .
Note that ScriptTicket is easily described in terms of ownership types .
The owner of the ticket is always the current thread ( owner : : thread ) .
The mutable container , _requests , is owned by the ticket and , consequently , by the current thread .
The ScriptInfo inside the ticket is immutable ( owner : : immutable ) .
The monitor used for UI communication is owned by “ self ” ( owner : : self ) .
The latter two can be shared between threads .
Although script tickets are passed by value between threads , they are often passed by reference within threads – not only for performance reasons but also because the caller wants to see the changes made by the callee .
In the ownership - based system , such references would be marked as lent and the system would ensure that no aliases to them were ever leaked to the outside world .
The Worker Thread
When working with threads , the most fundamental rule is to separate shared state from thread - local state .
Shared state requires synchronization , local does n’t .
This is why I fell out with the OO active object pattern–in particular the Java Thread object .
Active objects are notorious for mixing shared and local state .
Since the dispatcher was written before I had this epiphany , it used our library of active objects .
Not any more !
Here ’s how it works :
The main thread spawns a worker thread , passing it a function and some data .
The new thread calls this function and passes it the data .
The types of data that may be passed to a worker thread are restricted .
The list is pretty short :
Value data that are passed by copying .
Simple examples : an integer , a vector of values , etc .
The important thing is that this data is not shared –each thread works on its own copy .
To be exact , thread - safe values may safely contain ( shallow ) pointers to shared monitors and immutable objects .
Example : ScriptTicket .
Monitors .
Monitor objects are shared ; they contain a lock , which is used to synchronize all their public methods .
( In Java or D these methods would be synchronized ) .
Examples : WorkQueue , which I will describe shortly .
Also , message queues are usually monitors .
Immutable objects –they can be shared without synchronization , since nobody ever modifies them .
Example : ThreadInfo .
Unique data , à la auto_ptr .
A unique object is guaranteed to be only visible in one thread at a time .
The sender of this object automatically loses access to it , so unique objects do n’t need synchronization .
That ’s it !
A vast majority of concurrency problems may be ( efficiently ) solved using these patterns .
Some languages , like Erlang , are restricted to pure values ( immutability being used internally as an optimization ) .
The drawback of such restrictions is poor performance in the local case ( e.g. , when Erlang processes are just threads ) .
Going back to the dispatcher :
The worker thread is spawned with two objects :
WorkQueue , which is a monitor and
, which is a monitor and TransportManager , which is passed as a unique object and becomes local to the worker thread .
WorkQueue contains shared data , which is protected by its lock .
TransportManager contains data local to the worker thread and does n’t require any synchronization .
Before the rewrite , both of these object were combined into a single active object , and extreme caution had to be used to avert the dangers of incidental sharing .
In the current design , WorkQueue has no access to TransportManager so it ’s impossible for the main thread to accidentally touch the not - to - be - shared data of the worker thread .
You have no idea how this separation simplified the reasoning about and the coding of interactions between threads .
The worker thread function has access to both objects .
In its idle state it is blocked waiting for a message from the main thread .
The message queue is part of the WorkQueue object .
When a message arrives , the worker thread wakes up , picks whatever data it needs from WorkQueue and calls the methods of TransportManager .
When it ’s done , it loops back and waits for further messages .
Notice that , in the picture , threads are not associated with objects , as they would be in the active - object model .
Instead objects exist between threads , when they are shared ; or inside threads , when they are not .
The Message Passing Approach
In principle all communication between threads could all be implemented with message passing .
I will describe how it could be done in this particular case and then consider other options .
Let ’s start with a use case : a hundred scripts are dumped , one by one , into the dispatcher ’s directory .
In the naive approach , each time the main thread is notified it lists the directory , reads the header of each script from disk , creates script slips and passes them to the worker thread .
In the worst case that would create and send about 5,000 bulky script tickets , 4900 of them unnecessary duplicates .
That ’s because each file drop creates a separate notification followed by a new complete directory listing .
Files might be dropped quickly but their processing can take arbitrarily long .
The first optimization that comes to mind is to send whole arrays of tickets at once .
If such an array could be passed as a unique object , the copying could be avoided ( and the message queue lock would be used once per array ) .
The worst case timing would involve 100 such messages ( one per directory change ) .
This is still very wasteful considering that we’d be reading and interpreting 5,000 file headers , and disk I / O is very expensive .
Also , in the current design , the dispatcher ’s main thread performs relatively cheap local copying to recipients on the same machine .
Without additional checks , each file would be delivered locally , on average , 50 times ( the delivery is idempotent , but not free ) .
That ’s clearly an overkill , considering that we do store a list of scripts that are already being processed .
There ’s no need to process them again and again .
So the second optimization is to take the raw directory listing and compare it with the in - progress list , before doing anything expensive with the scripts .
The in - progress list is maintained by the worker thread and resides inside the TransportManager .
The main thread sends a vector of file names through the message queue ( again , using the unique - array trick to avoid copying ) and waits for the return message that contains a pruned list of files .
It then proceeds with this much shorter list .
Inversion of Control
Let me summarize the algorithm :
List the directory .
Compare this list with the list of scripts currently being processed .
Keep the ones that are not already in the in - progress queue .
Perform local processing and local copying of the remaining scripts .
Send the leftovers back to the WorkQueue and insert them into the in - progress queue for remote copying .
It ’s relatively easy to translate this algorithm into sequential code , if we were to use synchronous message passing .
In that case , after sending a message to WorkQueue , the main thread would wait for the acknowledgment before continuing .
The problem is that the worker thread might be busy , well … working .
It might take quite some time before it is free to check for messages .
All that time the main thread is blocked and the program is unresponsive .
Remember , our goal was to decrease the latency !
Asynchronous message passing would work better but it has its own problems .
First of all , the nice sequential code would have to be chopped up into separate functions :
Directory notification handler list the directory and sends a message with the list of file names to the worker thread .
Return .
In the worker thread , the handler for this particular message compares the list with its own list and sends a message to the main thread with the pruned list .
Return .
In the main thread , the handler for the pruned - list message performs local processing and sends another message to the worker thread with the leftover list .
Return .
In the worker thread , the handler for that message adds the list to the in - progress queue .
Return .
Notice that this sequence would exist only in the mind of the programmer ( maybe in some documentation too ) .
It ’s very hard to reconstruct it by just looking at the code because it ’s scattered between various handlers .
This is called reactive programming and it ’s notoriously difficult .
What makes it even harder is that , after sending a message , the context of the call is lost .
The return message must contain enough information to restore this context .
There are many advanced techniques to overcome this problem : closures , continuations , co-routines , etc. ; but they are mostly restricted to functional languages and are hard to adapt to the object - oriented paradigm .
Another big problem is the lack of direct support for message passing in many languages , including C++ , Java , C# , or D .
These languages are strongly typed so , barring unsafe casting , the programmer must create a separate message queue type for every message type .
This is not only a major annoyance , but raises the problem of composability : A thread might want to wait for several types of messages at once .
Consider how , because of these limitations , type safety is compromised in Windows .
All Windows messages have to fit the same mold : ( message ID , WPARAM , and LPARAM ) .
All typing information is lost and it ’s up to the programmer to recover it , often by unchecked type casting .
In functional languages , composability of message queues ( also called channels or mailboxes ) is solved using pattern matching .
In a nutshell , pattern matching is like a switch statement with each case potentially having a different type .
Within the same statement you may be able to match a string message or an integer message .
The latest batch of modern all - purpose languages like Scala or F# have excellent support for pattern matching .
Sharing is Sometimes Simpler
Let ’s re-consider the problem of list pruning :
The main thread has a list of candidates , the worker thread has an in - progress list .
We want to remove all items from the candidate list that are present in the in - progress list .
In the message - passing approach , the main thread must send the list of candidates to the worker thread and wait for the answer ( in the asynchronous case , it might pick up other tasks while waiting for the answer ) .
It has to wait even if the worker thread is not currently using the in - progress list .
There is no way for the worker thread to say , “ I ’m busy , why do n’t you do it yourself . ”
Actually , there is –if we allow inter - thread sharing .
Of course , concurrent access to shared state must be protected , for instance , by locking .
In our current implementation , the WorkQueue is a monitor that protects the in - progress list .
The main thread takes the WorkQueue lock and compares the two lists directly .
The only time it must wait is when the worker thread has already taken the lock and is in the process of accessing the in - progress list .
In fact , our the in - progress list is split into two lists :
One contains the immutable ScriptInfo objects and is shared as part of WorkQueue .
The other contains ScriptTicket s and is part of TransportManager , which is not shared and therefore does n’t require locking .
Sharing has its problems too : races and deadlocks .
Races can be avoided if you are religious about protecting all shared data with monitors .
Deadlocks are also avoidable , if you use locks sparingly .
The more monitors you have in your program , the more likely they will deadlock .
On the other hand , the more messages you have , the more data copying you do and the more chopped - up your code is .
So the best approach , in my opinion , is to judiciously combine message passing with sharing .
What ’s Next ?
So far I have described the preliminary re-write of the dispatcher .
At Reliable Software , we usually start the implementation of a new feature by re-writing the surrounding code .
I realize that this is a very unusual practice in most software companies yet it ’s been working miracles for our product .
There is very little “ code rot ” in Code Co-op after 14 years of continuous development .
There are no parts of the product that “ better not be touched or they will break . ”
The next implementation step will be to divide the actual copying between multiple threads .
But that should be a breeze in the newly re-written dispatcher .
I ’ll keep you posted .
Marc Lynch posts a photograph that has caused quite a stir in the Arab media showing a handshake between Israeli Deputy Foreign Minister Danny Ayalon and former Saudi intelligence chief Turki al - Faisal .
Why it matters :
It 's a common mistake to assume that only the private views of leaders or only public discourse matters .
Both levels matter , the private Realpolitik of Arab leaders and the real passions of the Arab public .
The depth of the gap between the private views of Arab leaders and the predominant views of the Arab public explains much of the vitriol of the current " Arab cold war " .
Many Arabs are worried about Iran , no doubt about it , and many in the official camp are deeply hostile to Hamas , Hezbollah , and most other forms of populist opposition .
But most also continue to be genuinely outraged by Israeli policies and reject any public relationship .
It 's a cliche to say so but also true : do n't expect the much - predicted Arab - Israeli alliance against Iran to ever live up to its hype ( at least publicly ) without real movement towards Israeli - Palestinian peace .
Bill O'Reilly on his Jon Stewart interview tonight : ' Hey , he called us '
Bill O’Reilly , trying to hype tonight ’s interview with Jon Stewart , went on Fox News Channel ’s America Live with Megyn Kelly this afternoon .
O’Reilly said it ’s going to be a “ big night ” for the host of The Daily Show : “ Hey , somebody will actually watch him , ” he said , referring to the smaller audience Comedy Central attracts compared to The O’Reilly Factor ‘s ratings .
O’Reilly said he was “ surprised ” Stewart wanted to come on : “ [ His people ] called us , ” he said .
“ He ’s a witty guy , ” said O’Reilly .
“ I do n’t like the way he chops up his news clips , ” said O’Reilly , implying Stewart edits unfairly .
“ I ’ll talk to him about that tonight . ”
Will you be watching Stewart on The Factor ?
Court of appeal ruling compels British government to disclose what MI5 knew of refugee 's treatment in Guantánamo Bay
This article is more than 10 years old
This article is more than 10 years old
Three of Britain 's most senior judges have ordered the government to reveal evidence of MI5 complicity in the torture of British resident Binyam Mohamed – unanimously dismissing objections by David Miliband , the foreign secretary .
In a ruling that will cause deep anxiety among the security and intelligence agencies , they rejected Miliband 's claims , backed by the US government , that disclosure of a seven - paragraph summary of classified CIA information showing what British agents knew of Mohamed 's torture would threaten intelligence sharing between London and Washington , and therefore endanger Britain 's national security .
One of the key paragraphs states that there " could readily be contended to be at the very least cruel , inhuman and degrading treatment of Binyam Mohamed by the United States authorities " .
The judges – Sir Igor Judge , the lord chief justice ; Lord Neuberger , the master of the rolls ; and Sir Anthony May , president of the Queen 's Bench – shattered the convention that the courts should not question claims by the executive relating to national security .
In damning references to claims made by Miliband and his lawyers , and stressing the importance of the media in supporting the principle of open justice , they said the case raised issues of " fundamental importance " , of " democratic accountability and ultimately the rule of law itself " .
Publication of the material Miliband wanted to suppress was " compelling " , Judge said , since they concerned the involvement of wrongdoing by agents of the state in the " abhorrent practice of torture " .
The material helped to " vindicate Mr Mohamed 's assertion that UK authorities had been involved in and facilitated the ill - treatment and torture to which he was subjected while under the control of USA authorities " .
The disputed paragraphs have now been published by the Foreign Office .
Miliband said in a statement : " The government accepts the decision of the court of appeal that in the light of disclosures in the US court , it should publish the seven paragraphs at issue in the case of Binyam Mohamed .
" At the heart of this case was the principle that if a country shares intelligence with another , that country must agree before its intelligence is released .
" This ' control principle ' is essential to the intelligence relationship between Britain and the US .
" The government fought the case to preserve this principle , and today 's judgment upholds it .
" It agreed that the control principle is integral to intelligence sharing .
The court has today ordered the publication of the seven paragraphs because in its view their substance had been put into the public domain by a decision of a US court in another case .
" Without that disclosure , it is clear that the court of appeal would have overturned the divisional court 's decision to publish the material .
" The government has made sustained and successful efforts to ensure Mr Mohamed 's legal counsel had full access to the material in question .
" We remain determined to uphold our very strong commitment against mistreatment of any kind . "
A Foreign Office spokesman said : " Under the terms of the embargo we were permitted by the court to notify a small number of US officials in advance of this judgment .
We have done so .
" The foreign secretary spoke last night to Hillary Clinton .
He stressed to her that the court had strongly supported the control principle and would have agreed with HMG [ her majesty 's government ] had it not been for the Kessler judgment in the US court last December , which had effectively disclosed the material in the seven paragraphs .
" The foreign secretary and the secretary of state reaffirmed the importance of the US - UK intelligence relationship . "
Shami Chakrabarti , the director of Liberty , said the ruling and revelations made a public inquiry " inescapable " .
" It has been clear for over a year that the Foreign Office has been more concerned with saving face than exposing torture .
" These embarrassing paragraphs reveal nothing of use to terrorists but they do show something of the UK government 's complicity with the most shameful part of the war on terror .
" The government has gone to extraordinary lengths to cover up kidnap and torture .
A full public inquiry is now inescapable . "
Key to the appeal court 's ruling was a recent case in a US court where the judge noted that Mohamed 's " trauma lasted for two long years .
During that time he was physically and psychologically tortured .
His genitals were mutilated ...
All the while he was forced to inculpate himself and others in various plots to imperil Americans . "
The US court , which was hearing a case relating to another detainee at Guantánamo Bay , noted that Mohamed was told " that the British government knew of his situation and sanctioned his detention " .
An MI5 officer known only as Witness B is being investigated by the Metropolitan police over his alleged role in questioning Mohamed incommunicado in a Pakistan jail .
The whole basis of Miliband 's case had " fallen away " because of the US court case , said Neuberger , who added : " It is a case which is now logically incoherent and therefore irrational and is not based on any convincing evidence . "
In his ruling , May said : " In principle a real risk of serious damage to national security , of whatever degree , should not automatically trump a public interest in open justice which may concern a degree of facilitation by UK officials of interrogation using unlawful techniques which may amount to torture or cruel , inhuman or degrading treatment . "
In a stinging reference to claims by Jonathan Sumption QC , Miliband 's counsel , that high court judges in earlier rulings were " irresponsible " in saying that CIA intelligence relating to ill treatment and torture and Britain 's knowledge of it should be disclosed , the lord chief justice said : " No advantage is achieved by bandying deprecatory epithets . "
Mohamed was detained in 2002 in Pakistan , where he was questioned incommunicado by an MI5 officer .
The US flew him to Morocco , Afghanistan , and Guantánamo Bay , where he says he was tortured with the knowledge of British agencies .
In the high court last year , Lord Justice Thomas and Mr Justice Lloyd Jones ruled that it was clear from the evidence " that the relationship of the United Kingdom government to the United States authorities in connection with Binyam Mohamed was far beyond that of a bystander or witness to the alleged wrongdoing " .
HOUSTON , Jan. 14 ( UPI ) -- Gov. Rick Perry says
Texas will not compete in Race to the Top , a move that could cost the state as much as $ 100 per student in federal education aid .
Perry , who has criticized Race to the Top as an attempt to impose federal standards on states , announced his decision Wednesday in Houston , The New York Times reported .

Texas might have received as much as $ 700 million in federal aid .
" We would be foolish and irresponsible to place our children 's future in the hands of unelected bureaucrats and special - interest groups thousands of miles away in Washington , " he said .
Perry and other Texas officials , including Education Commissioner Robert Scott , object to the program 's effort to get states to accept national curriculum standards , the San Antonio Express - News reported .
Many teachers and school administrators have a different view .
" I understand that we want to teach Texas history , but does Algebra I in Texas differ from Algebra I in Maine ?
It should n't , " said John Folks , superintendent of San Antonio 's largest school district .
" I think we should be involved in the process of deciding those standards . "
I joined the staff of the Committee on Degrees in Social Studies at Harvard University in 2000 .
As tutor , then as lecturer , I advised senior theses , conceived and conducted freshman and junior seminars and taught the year - long sophomore tutorial , Social Studies 10 , six times .
The fractured nature of my appointment , renewed annually for six successive years while never amounting to more than 65 per cent of a full - time position in any one year , kept me on the margins of prestige and promotion even as it kept me there long enough to serve three chairmen of social studies , two directors of study and three presidents of Harvard .
The post - pubescent children of notables for whom I found myself holding curricular responsibility included the offspring of an important political figure , of a player in the show business world and the son of real - estate developer Charles Kushner .
In the first meeting of my first seminar of my first year , Kushner 's son Jared entered my classroom and promptly took the seat across from mine , sharing the room , so to speak .
I was drawing an annual salary of $ 15,500 ( £ 7,700 ) and borrowing the remainder for survival in Cambridge , in order that he might be given the best possible education .
Jared later purchased The New York Observer for $ 10 million , part of which he made buying and selling real estate while also attending my seminar .
As publisher , one of his first moves was to reduce pay for the Observer 's stable of book reviewers .
I had been writing reviews for the Observer in an effort to pay my debts .
Most of the students I encountered had already embraced the perspectives of the rich , the powerful and the unalienated , and they seemed to have done so with appalling ease .
In keeping with the tradition of the American rich they worked exceptionally long hours , they were aggressive in exercising their talents , and on the ideological features of market capitalism they were unanimous .
Their written work disclosed the core components of the consensus upheld by their liberal parents : the meaning of liberty lies in the personal choice of consumers ; free competition in goods and morals regulates value ; technological progress is an unmixed good ; war is unfortunate .
Around this consensus crystallised an ethos .
One of my less affluent students , the son of a postman , asked me once for advice about a financial investment .
He said his friends had told him to invest " in prisons " , meaning one of the private companies winning the management contracts for correctional facilities .
I told him what I thought about this recommendation ; but only later , when I learnt how little he had to invest ( $ 2,000 was his total savings ) , did I allow myself to think I understood the significance of his question .
No amount of money may be permitted to lie idle if something may be got for nothing .
The capitalist theory of life as a game disallows uncapitalised advantages .
I asked each of my seminars whether they had so far encountered a teacher they genuinely appreciated .
If so , what aspects did they most admire ?
Invariably they said good teachers made them " feel comfortable " .
To sense the sterility one had only to listen : " shopping period " was the name of the week they selected their classes .
Once , when I proposed to teach a junior seminar entitled " Anarchist cultural criticism in America " , I was instructed to go ahead only if I first changed the title to " America and its critics " .
Here was the same method of cultural hygiene that has transformed Harvard Square from a bohemian enclave into an outdoor mall .
Grading , the one instrument of power I wielded , offers the best example of the degradation of pedagogy by the frenzy of success .
The Boston Globe 's expose of grade inflation at Harvard has left little doubt that it is a semi-rigged competition , another subsidised risk .
The formal scale runs from A to F .
The tacit scale runs from A to B . I learnt the latter from students and supervisors , but especially from colleagues , few of whom wish to carry the opprobrium of the low end .
This is as it may be .
But the presence of two standards of value , one official and one tacit , is always a sign of corruption : the one necessarily dishonours the other .
It also abridges the academic freedom of the teacher .
Although I never gave a final grade below B minus , I can attest to the petty harassment that teachers attract in such cases .
I do not mean merely that the students are never so aggressive and articulate as when they hunt for grades .
I mean that they wage political reprisals against the B - minus grader and send gifts to high - placed academic directors .
Once , a judge and his wife went to my supervisor to complain about a grade I had assigned to their child in a senior oral examination .
They rested their complaint on the fact that I was not yet in possession of the all - encompassing credential , the PhD .
They pointed out that the second examiner in the room had assigned the exam a slightly higher grade , and that this second examiner was , in fact , a PhD .
The judge and his wife did not know , nor did they care to discover , that I was by far the more experienced of the two graders .
I had been conducting exams for four years ; the second examiner had never before conducted one .
A minor gaffe , but one that William James , author of " The Ph.D. Octopus " ( 1903 ) , could have understood and appreciated .
In January 2008 , a " group of Harvard alumni from the Vietnam War era " sent an open letter to the university 's president .
" We are concerned by what we see to be the widespread apathy and political indifference of the student body at Harvard College today , " said the letter ( reported in Times Higher Education on 4 January 2008 ) , which defined the problem as " self - examination and broad intellectual growth versus the careerist , vocational orientation " .
The letter was only half - right : the students are the opposite of apathetic and indifferent .
The new student rich have retained the radical energy of the 1960s , only to engage it in more lushly monetised competencies .
The New Left occupied universities to protest against the bureaucratic hollowness of examination rituals and grading rationales .
Now its children complete the attack on the authority of teachers , who are simply annexed to the management of student careers , drawn into a tacit agreement between corporation and client in which failure is not an option .
I had to grade the students , and I had to grade them well .
Everyone expected a recommendation letter .
The ethos , so understood , mimics the psychodynamics of inflation in this age of unlimited markets .
Since the students were young , apparently , their parents and teachers have bathed them in ambitious glances , so that the source of their very identity has come to lie in their potential .
Perhaps this is why , though they demand to be graded , they resent the teacher 's claim to judgment based on performance , which implies a stable set of values .
A relatively low judgment may be met by the always available thought that they could have done better .
This thought is not as easy to rebut as one might suppose .
Harvard students may be divided into three types .
The first two are those who infer from their presence on campus that they have already made it and those who infer that they are on their way to making it .
Both types are keenly aware of the prestige - value of their situation .
To mention to a stranger where one studies is to drop the " H - Bomb " .
Neither type , accordingly , has encountered any really good reason to suppose that their potential is anything but limitless .
Members of the third type , the ironists and the scoffers , have their degree and eat it too , since their anti-Harvard posturing carries no real risks .
The gigantic endowment , that great symbol of unspent potential , blesses their scepticism by indexing their value on the credentials market .
Consider how the grading scandal ( an open secret on campus ) broke into the public discussion at the same time the dot - com bubble burst .
Try to see these phenomena as twin instances in the chronic overextension of the credit markets .
Now ask the question : when intellectuals act as clerks and students act as clients , how do college teachers differ from corporate accountants ?
Should I say I am grateful for the chance to teach at Harvard ?
I am .
Should I acknowledge the many fine exceptions it was my privilege to instruct ?
I do , with pleasure .
But the sedulous banality of the rich degrades teaching into a service - class preoccupation whose chief duty is preparing clients for monied careers .
The liberal flattery of the student is both sentimental and irrelevant .
If youth is wasted on the young , is teaching wasted on students ?
Teaching on the part - time staff at Harvard is a little like visiting Disney World .
The magic dust induces a light narcosis .
The mind goes incontinent in the presence of paradox and conflict , and it is tough to tell how much fun you are having from how much you are having to pretend .
The important thing is never to become the screamer who ruins the ride for everyone .
The line is long .
In 2008 , Nicholas Carr took to the pages of The Atlantic to make the provocative case that Google might be " making us stupid . "
His basic worry was that a reliance on the Web was rewiring his brain , that he was skimming along the surface of links , facts , and ideas , but now had trouble engaging in more focused thought and in reading longer pieces of text .
Over the past few years I 've had an uncomfortable sense that someone , or something , has been tinkering with my brain , remapping the neural circuitry , reprogramming the memory .
My mind is n't going — so far as I can tell — but it ’s changing .
I ’m not thinking the way I used to think .
I can feel it most strongly when I 'm reading .
Immersing myself in a book or a lengthy article used to be easy .
My mind would get caught up in the narrative or the turns of the argument , and I ’d spend hours strolling through long stretches of prose .
That 's rarely the case anymore .
Now my concentration often starts to drift after two or three pages .
I get fidgety , lose the thread , begin looking for something else to do .
I feel as if I 'm always dragging my wayward brain back to the text .
The deep reading that used to come naturally has become a struggle .
Such worries have been commonplace over the last few years , but are they accurate ?
The Pew Internet & American Life project polled 895 Internet " experts " — including Nick Carr — to see what they thought of such doom - laden prophecies .
It turns out that the experts do n't see much merit to the worries ; more than three - quarters of the sample concluded that Carr was wrong .
Changed , but not for the worse ?
This is n't to say that human intelligence is n't changing as people come to rely on the Web , however .
Respondents were nearly unanimous in their view that tools like Google allow different parts of the brain to take prominence .
Instead of seeing this as " bad , " most respondents see it as merely " different " — one more long change on the continuum of human mental development , the next tech step after reading , writing , and the calculator .
Nick Carr .
Carr sticks to his guns .
It 's not that IQ scores are going down , but that the change in mental activity promoted by long exposure to Google and the Web has real problems .
" What the ' Net does is shift the emphasis of our intelligence , away from what might be called a meditative or contemplative intelligence and more toward what might be called a utilitarian intelligence .
The price of zipping among lots of bits of information is a loss of depth in our thinking . "
Peter Norvig .
Google 's Research Director , not surprisingly , defends the merits of skimming , saying that it sets the stage for more prolonged mental effort .
As to whether people want to make that effort , it remains up to them .
" My conclusion is that when the only information on the topic is a handful of essays or books , the best strategy is to read these works with total concentration .
But when you have access to thousands of articles , blogs , videos , and people with expertise on the topic , a good strategy is to skim first to get an overview .
Skimming and concentrating can and should coexist . "
Dean Bubley , wireless industry consultant , says that the Web is merely the extension of a process that has been going on for millennia : using technology to free up our minds for other tasks .
" I think that certain tasks will be ' offloaded ' to Google or other Internet services rather than performed in the mind , especially remembering minor details .
But really , that 's a role that paper has taken over many centuries : did Gutenberg make us stupid ? "
Andreas Kluth , a writer with The Economist , agrees .
" This is the continuation ad infinitum of the process launched by abacuses and calculators : we have become more ' stupid ' by losing our arithmetic skills but more intelligent at evaluating numbers . "
Sandra Kelly of 3 M says that whether " Google makes you stupid " or not is up to you .
" I do n't think having access to information can ever make anyone stupider .
I do n't think an adult IQ can be influenced much either way by reading anything and I would guess that smart people use the Internet for smart things and stupid people use it for stupid things in the same way that smart people read literature and stupid people read crap fiction . "
Andrew Nachison , cofounder of We Media , argues that access to so much digital knowledge might be edging out other kinds of knowing , leaving us to drown in a sea of facts .
" It has confused and overwhelmed us with choices , and with sources that are not easily differentiated or verified .
Perhaps it 's even alienated us from the physical world itself — from knowledge and intelligence that comes from seeing , touching , hearing , breathing , and tasting life .
From looking into someone 's eyes and having them look back into ours .
Perhaps it 's made us impatient , or shortened our attention spans , or diminished our ability to understand long thoughts .
It 's enlightened anxiety .
We know more than ever , and this makes us crazy . "
The death of literature ?
If the Internet changes the way that we think and process information , it must also have some effect on the way that we produce information .
Sorry , fellow English majors — novels belong to the past .
Clay Shirky , a professor at NYU and a prolific author himself , says that over the next decade , " Long - form expressive fiction will suffer ( though this suffering has been more or less constant since the invention of radio ) while all numeric and graphic forms of rendering knowledge , from the creation and use of databases to all forms of visual display of data will be in a golden age , with ordinary nonfiction writing getting a modest boost .
So , English majors lose , engineering wins , and what looks like an Up or Down question says more about the demographic of the answerer than any prediction of the future . "
Kluth , of The Economist , agrees that people will read more " in terms of quantity , but more promiscuously and at shorter intervals and with less dedication .
As these habits take root , they corrupt our willingness to commit to long texts , as found in books or essays ...
This will result in a resurgence of short - form texts and storytelling , in ' haiku culture ' replacing ' book culture . ' "
But will a culture oriented to short forms create non-ephemeral material ?
In other words , will we create classic literature this way ?
Some are pessimistic .
Gene Spafford of Purdue University sums up the objection : " Most writing online is devolving toward SMS and tweets that involve quick , throwaway notes with abbreviations and threaded references .
This is not a form of lasting communication .
In 2020 there is unlikely to be a list of classic tweets and blog posts that every student and educated citizen should have read . "
Jennifer Davis complained to the school district , demanding an investigation of what was happening in class .
The investigation found that Mr. Freshwater had burned at least one other student with a Tesla coil branding the shape of the cross into the child 's skin and he had taught intelligent design in class .
Freshwater said he had done the same science experiment to hundreds of students before Zachary Dennis , using a Tesla coil , which gives off an electric spark .
The teacher said it was painless and harmless – although a doctor would later testify that Dennis had second - degree burns – and that he had made an X , not a cross , on the boy 's skin .
The investigation produced damning testimony .
official report - PDF
A teacher who was present in Mr. Freshwaters ’ classroom on a substitute basis for one period in either 2006 or 2007 ( The teacher could not recall which year ) stated in a written statement ( Copy as Attachment 15 ) : " The lesson of the day had been on the creation of the universe .
John talked about how the textbook could be wrong .
He said , ‘ Let me give you an example of how science can be wrong . ’
He then went on to say that an article in Time magazine a few years back stated that scientists had found a genetic link to homosexuality .
‘ In that case science is wrong because the Bible states that homosexuality is a sin ’ and so anyone who is gay chooses to be gay and therefore is a sinner .
My reaction was one of disbelief that he was saying these things to eighth graders .
I thought of how those two or three students in that classroom who might be struggling with their sexual identities would be feeling , hearing that they were sinners from a teacher .
... I was surprised at how comfortable John was talking about the Bible stating that homosexuality is a sin , and that anyone who is gay makes a conscious choice to be so .
...
He had no problem declaring that not only can science be wrong by the example he gave , but heavily implied that the students ’ textbook was wrong as well on how the universe was created . " ..................
The investigators found the following material in the second cupboard in the front of the room
during a walk through of Mr. Freshwaters ’ classroom on May 15 , 2008 :
· A book titled " Refuting Evolution "
· A video tape titled " Lies In The Textbooks , Part A 4 Of 7 , 10 Lies Of Evolution "
· A book titled " Evolution Of A Creationist "
· A book titled " The Real Meaning Of The Zodiac "
· A book titled " Icons of Evolution " ..................
When asked if he has ever engaged in prayer with students he said that I ’m praying all the time .
He said that he had never led prayer at a meeting .
When asked if he had ever asked students to lead prayer , he said I may have .
When asked if there was an incident this year where the FCA group had gathered in a circle of prayer around a non-school speaker , Mr. Freshwater said that such an incident had occurred about a month to a month and a half ago .
The speaker was Pastor Zirkle who had commented during the meeting about a personal medical issue .
He or the students initiated a circle of prayer around Pastor Zirkle .
He said another teacher also participated in the prayer .
Mr. Freshwater said that he needed to end the prayer because the lunch period was ending , so he said " Amen . "
Mr. Freshwater said that he had been involved in discussions regarding a trip to an abortion clinic , however he could not recall if it was in an FCA meeting or his class .
He said that he did not initiate discussions or propose a trip .
The investigation lead to the school district issuing a notice of intent to terminate employment .
Three years later on January 22 , 2010 , after taking a full year and spending a five hundred thousand dollars , the appeal hearing was finally completed .
Mr. Freshwater and his supporters want to turn this into an opportunity to attack science and to promote teaching of religion in the classroom .
" Freshwater ’s supporters want to make this into a new and reverse version of the Scopes trial , " said David Millstone , the lawyer for the Mount Vernon Board of Education , referring to the Tennessee teacher tried in 1925 for teaching evolution .
" We see this as a basic issue about students having a constitutional right to be free from religious indoctrination in the public schools . "
Mr. Freshwater , who declined to be interviewed , has said he did not mean to burn a cross on any student ’s arm .
Instead , he said he intended to leave a temporary X on the skin using a device called a Tesla coil during a science demonstration .
He says he had done that , with no complaints , hundreds of times in his 21 years as a teacher at Mount Vernon Middle School .
In a radio interview in 2008 , he said he had been a target for removal since 2003 , when he proposed that the school board adopt a policy to teach evolution as theory , not proven scientific fact .
" I ruffled some feathers , " he said .
The appeals hearings revealed that Mr. Freshwater was one of a number of teachers using the school as a mission field , apparently for the Assemblies of God church .
Blogger Richard Hoppe of Panda's
Thumb reported from the hearings on the testimony .
Lori Miller is a middle school science and math teacher – she used to teach science and now teaches 7th grade math .
Her daughter had Freshwater in 8th grade science some unmentioned time ago .
She is also ( I think ) a member of Freshwater ’s Assemblies of God congregation .
First , the shocker of the day : Miller testified that after the Freshwater issue arose last year , she began surreptitiously taping meetings she had with administrators .
( " Surreptitiously " here means the taping was done without the knowledge or permission of the other participants in meetings . )
She said she did it in order to assure herself that she understood clearly what she was to do and understand .
We did n’t learn about the taping until part way through her testimony , so there ’s more on this below .
As noted , Miller is a co-religionist and strong supporter of Freshwater .
She said she supports and encourages him .
She testified that she had n’t read all of the independent investigator ’s report because it sickened and disgusted her .
She said that she did all the things Freshwater was being disciplined for – she had a Bible and four devotional books ( exhibited to the hearing ) on her classroom desk , used a Tesla coil to shock students when she taught science , was an FCA faculty monitor , and had religious materials displayed in her classroom , but she was n’t being disciplined .
She named four teachers who have Bibles on their desks in addition to Freshwater .
She said she thought Freshwater was being specifically targeted .
Displaying a picture of her desk , she showed that the Bible and devotional books were plainly visible , piled on a corner of the desk .
She described religious materials displayed on one quadrant of her classroom bulletin board .
They included a cross given to her by a student ( roughly 8 " high by 5 " wide ) , a " Faith " card , and notes from her husband with Bible verses on them .
She had removed those items on instructions from Bill White , middle school Principal , and Superintendent Short before the start of the 2008 - 2009 school year .
In her testimony she also said that another middle school teacher , Wes Elifritz , a health teacher , had more elaborate religious materials than hers displayed in his room and had not been requested to remove them .
She repeated that several times .
.....
The main topic of the meeting was the display of religious items in her classroom and the necessity to remove them .
She testified that despite asking , she never got a clear idea of what a " display " was , and she asked specifically whether it included her Bible on her desk .
She testified that she told Short that she would n’t take it off her desk , and Short told her that he was n’t asking her to remove the Bible , but the Board might require it and then she could file a grievance .
Hamilton asked if she knew whether Freshwater had ever been advised that he could file a grievance ( she had accompanied him to one meeting with Bill White ) , and she said he had not .
In extended testimony she showed pictures of the religious materials displayed in Wes Elifritz ’s room , including several verses from Psalms 37 , a poster on memorizing the 10 Commandments complete with mnemonic advice , a poem about Christians and Christ , and the lyrics of the chorus of a " praise and worship song . "
She said as far as she knew the display was still there .
When asked , she said the items were grouped together for a purpose , a religious display .
Also when asked if one had no exposure to Christianity would one know it ’s a religious display , she replied " yes . "
She testified that she asked Superintendent Short why she had to take her " less obvious " materials down when Wes Elifritz did n’t have to take his down .
She said she did n’t get a clear answer to that .
Miller testified that she had never had any instruction on the First Amendment Separation Clause .
Asked if she had encouraged students at school to embrace Christianity before the Freshwater affair began last year , she readily responded that she had done so .
She gave examples in an excited voice .
She had prayed over students in the halls and lunchroom , had counseled them to seek Christ , and so on .
She said , " I honestly did n’t think that was wrong . "
She was very enthusiastic in voice and manner about her proselytizing in the public schools .
Questioned about FCA , she said that she had been a monitor up until this last year , when FCA has not been meeting .
She , Wes Elifritz , and another teacher whose name I missed have had several meetings this year with administrators , seeking a way to have FCA meet so that teachers could take a more active role , praying with the students and singing with them , rather than being passive monitors .
She said " We wanted to be part of it rather than just stand by .
We wanted to pray with the kids and be involved . "
She testified that several parents had written to her at the end of the school year thanking her for being a Christian in a public school .
She testified that she never thought that sharing her Christian faith with students in the school was a problem .
Mr. Freshwater told the public that he was being fired for keeping a bible on his desk .
He called in the Minute Men , a group he belonged to that advocates militant Christian theocracy .
One of Freshwater ’s move vocal supporters , Dave Daubenmire , is the creator of the town ’s Minute Men United , a militant organization that endorses Christian theocracy .
Two years ago , according to the Columbus Dispatch , Minutemen led protests at religious services of two local churches that embraced the gay community .
Until the branding incident , Freshwater had been an active participant at Minutemen anti-abortion events .
Daubenmire has characterized the Freshwater case as a war and has accused the district superintendent Steve Short of doing the devil ‘s bidding .
Mr. Freshwater is playing the martyr and many of the townspeople believe he is being fired for keeping a bible on his desk .
However , there was no mention in the original complaint of the bible on the desk .
Many in the Christian community became hostile to the Dennis family , even though they are Christians too , forcing the Dennis family to move to another school district .
Tired of the comments made to their sons in school by students and being singled out by one teacher , the Dennis family put their house up for sale and moved to another district .
Today , Zach is a sophomore and plays hockey .
" I just have to have the attitude that it ’s never going to end , " Jenifer Dennis said .
" Otherwise , it can drive you nuts . "
The lawsuit is an Establishment Clause case , arguing Freshwater violated Zachary ’s First Amendment rights by proselytizing religion and teaching creationism in the classroom .
But it also raises the separate issue of battery because of the cross burn , which , Mansfield notes , feeds back into the Establishment Clause issues .
Freshwater has filed a counterclaim against the Dennis family , as well as a separate lawsuit against the district , alleging religious discrimination , defamation , conspiracy , and breach of contract .
Then , on February 2 , the case got weirder .
A strange story is circulating in Mt. Vernon , Ohio .
According to the story , John Freshwater , currently the subject of an administrative hearing on his termination as a middle school science teacher , received a call from an unnamed person on Thursday , Feb 4 .
The caller purportedly told Freshwater that the school had discarded some documents in a dumpster at the high school and that the documents contained information that would exonerate him .
Sometime during the night of the 4th or morning of the 5th , Freshwater , his lawyer R. Kelly Hamilton , and his pastor Don Matolyak are said to have gone through one or more school dumpsters , removing some documents and taking them to Matolyak ’s church , Trinity Assembly of God , to go through them .
Then the story turns even more bizarre .
$ 45 in cash was found discarded with materials that had been in Mr. Freshwater 's classroom .
No one discards cash .
It looks like an inside job by a church supporter .
From Panda's
Thumb .
In picking up the materials Matolyak was accompanied by a man named Charles Fisher .
According to Matolyak ’s account , Fisher accompanied him at Freshwater ’s suggestion : John asked me to get Charles Fisher and go check this out since he [ Freshwater ] was in Dover [ Ohio ] .
Charles is very trustworthy and has his Conceal Carry ( sic ) permit so he would be armed in case of trouble .
Now think about that last sentence for a moment .
That ’s an indication of the paranoia that is characteristic of the conspiracy theorists in this affair .
And contrast it with another passage from the next paragraph of Matolyak ’s statement :
As I drove to the home of Charles Fisher I questioned whether we should contact the police .
I wondered if we would be facing some kind of danger as the person who did this would be expecting John Freshwater to be the one to follow up on the voice mail message .
But I decided it would n’t be necessary to contact the police because we were just on a factfinding mission .
He takes an armed escort , but decides not to contact the cops .
The materials were not in a dumpster at the high school , but were by a trash can in an area near it , in an " old black computer bag " inside a plastic bag .
On top of the bag was a letter addressed to Freshwater .
The police report does not contain the contents of that letter .
The bag contained a 3 " - 4 " stack of papers and a " large number of photographs of items from John ’s room . "
It also contained three stopwatches , a whistle , and $ 45 in cash .
Fisher and Matolyak took the bag and contents to Matolyak ’s church , where they rummaged through the materials , describing them to Freshwater on the telephone and photographing them .
" One letter was placed in a sealed envelope and left for Pastor Paula Powell to scan and E - fax to Kelly Hamilton when she got to the office Wednesday morning . "
Matolyak then locked the material in his office .
One Wednesday evening , Matolyak , Hamilton , and Freshwater went through the materials .
Freshwater identified all but about 300 photographs as having come from his room .
Fisher came by and showed them the photographs he had taken at the original scene and later .
Hamilton then informed the others that they might need to make a police report .
Hamilton and said he ’d instruct them later on what to do .
The complaint / report was made by Matolyak at 1536 on Thursday , February 4 , and notes that the PD took custody of the property and place it in evidence for safekeeping .
I presume that means in the PD evidence room .
Steve Short , Superintendent of Schools , was notified of the report number .
To be continued .
Update from the Comments
Mount Vernon is a lot like many towns in America .
An activist group linked General Mills to destruction of rainforests in Southeast Asia in dramatic fashion on Tuesday , when it unfurled a giant banner , reading “ Warning : General Mills Destroys Rainforests ” , outside the company ’s Minneapolis headquarters building .
The stunt was executed by the Rainforest Action Network ( RAN ) , an activist group campaigning to highlight the role that palm oil consumption has in deforestation in Indonesia , Malaysia and Papua New Guinea .
Expansion of oil palm plantations over the past twenty years has emerged as one of the biggest threats to the Southeast Asia ’s rainforests , which house such endangered species as the orangutan , the pygmy elephant of Borneo , and the Sumatran rhino .
Palm oil production has also become a significant source of greenhouse gas emissions , which result from deforestation , degradation and conversion of peatlands , and fires set for plantation establishment .

Wetlands International , an NGO , estimates that production of one metric ton of palm oil will result in an average emission of 20 tons of carbon dioxide from peat decomposition alone , not including emissions resulting from production or combustion .
RAN says that at least a hundred General Mills products , including goods sold under Pillsbury , Betty Crocker , Stovetop Hamburger Helper and Toaster Strudel brands , contain palm oil or palm oil derivatives .
RAN is calling for General Mills to commit to buying only responsibly - sourced palm oil .
“ General Mills could do a lot to transform the palm oil supply in the food industry and to protect rainforests , communities and the climate , ” said Madeline Gardner , Minneapolis - based activist , in a statement .
“ As an industry leader and a trusted brand , General Mills could have a huge impact in changing the food industry for good . ”
Unilever , the world ’s largest corporate buyer of palm oil , has already committed to using only palm oil produced in a socially and environmentally responsible manner .
Last month the company severed ties with Sinar Mas after an investigation showed that the palm oil producer was clearing rainforests and draining peatlands .
In its campaign , dubbed The Problem with Palm Oil , RAN argues that General Mills and other companies face a risk of consumer backlash if they continues current sourcing policies .
“ Palm oil is a leading cause of rainforest destruction in places like Indonesia , ” said Ashley Schaeffer of Rainforest Action Network .
“ As long as General Mills is using irresponsibly sourced palm oil , their customers will have to worry that they are contributing money to rainforest destruction . ”

Consumers should help pay the bill for ‘ greener ’ palm oil
( 01/12/2010 ) Palm oil is one of the world ’s most traded and versatile agricultural commodities .
It can be used as edible vegetable oil , industrial lubricant , raw material in cosmetic and skincare products and feedstock for biofuel production .
Growing global demand for palm oil and the ensuing cropland expansion has been blamed for a wide range of environmental ills , including tropical deforestation , peatland degradation , biodiversity loss and CO2 emissions .
In response to these concerns , a group of stakeholders — including activists , investors , producers and retailers — formed the Roundtable on Sustainable Palm Oil ( RSPO ) to develop a certification scheme for palm oil produced through environmentally - and socially - responsible ways .
It is widely anticipated that the creation of a premium market for RSPO - certified sustainable palm oil ( CSPO ) would incentivize palm oil producers to improve their management practices .
Unilever suspends palm oil contract after supplier found to be destroying rainforests
( 12/12/2009 )
The world ’s largest user of palm oil , Unilever , has suspended its $ 32.6 million contract with the Indonesian group Sinar Mas after an independent audit proved that Sinar Mas is involved in the destruction of rainforest , reports Reuters .
The audit was conducted early this year after a report by Greenpeace alleged that Sinar Mas was engaged in deforestation and the draining of peatlands , both of which release significant amounts of greenhouse gases into the atmosphere .
Deforestation across Indonesia and Malaysia , in part for oil palm plantations , has also added pressure on many many endangered species , including orangutans , tigers , elephants , and rhinos .
Oil palm workers still below poverty line , despite Minister ’s statements
( 11/19/2009 ) On October 19th , Plantation Industries and Commodities Minister Tan Sri Bernard Dompok told parliament that oil palm harvesters and rubber tappers are living above Malaysia ’s national poverty line , according to a story in the Malaysian Insider .
But now representatives of the workers are saying Dompok lied .
Palm oil developers in Papua New Guinea accused of deception in dealing with communities
( 09/25/2009 ) Papua New Guinea , the independent eastern half of the world ’s second largest island ( New Guinea ) , houses one of the planet ’s last frontier forests .
These forests support a wealth of plants and animals as well as the Earth ’s most diverse assemblage of cultures — some 830 languages are spoken in Papua New Guinea ( PNG ) , representing more than 12 percent of the world ’s 6,900 .
But PNG ’s forests are fast - changing .
Between 1972 and 2002 PNG lost more than 5 million hectares of forest , trailing only Brazil and Indonesia among tropical countries .
Forest loss has been primarily a consequence of industrial logging and subsistence agriculture , but large - scale agroindustry — especially development of oil palm plantations — has emerged as an important new driver of land use change .
Dozens of international companies have set up operations in the country over the past decade , including Cargill , an agribusiness giant based in Minneapolis .
While Cargill says it is committed to sustainable and responsible palm oil production across its three plantations in PNG , the firm has been targeted by local and international NGOs , which claim it has polluted rivers and deceived local communities into signing agreements they do not understand .
Some landowners say they are receiving few of the benefits oil palm promised to deliver , while losing their independence — they are now reliant on an export - oriented crop they ca n’t eat .
Opposition to further oil palm expansion is now growing , especially in Oro Provice , where Cargill ’s plantations are based .
Britain bans palm oil ad campaign
( 09/09/2009 ) Britain ’s Advertising Standards Authority ( ASA ) , a group that regulates advertisements , has again banned “ misleading ” ads by the palm oil industry , reports the Guardian .
ASA ruled that a campaign run by the Malaysian Palm Oil Council ( MPOC ) makes dubious claims , including that palm oil is the “ only product able to sustainably and efficiently meet a larger portion of the world ’s increasing demand for oil crop - based consumer goods , foodstuffs and biofuels . ”
The ad said criticism over “ rampant deforestation and unsound environmental practices ” were part of “ protectionist agendas ” not based on scientific fact .
ASA held the ad breached several of its advertising standards codes , including “ substantiation , ” “ truthfulness , ” and “ environmental claims . ”
In rebuking the MPOC , the ASA said that the merits of new eco-certification scheme promoted by the palm oil industry is “ still the subject of debate ” and that the ad ’s attacks on detractors implied that all criticisms of the palm oil industry “ were without a valid or scientific basis . ”
Rehabilitation not enough to solve orangutan crisis in Indonesia
( 08/20/2009 ) A baby orangutan ambles across the grass at the Borneo Orangutan Survival Foundation ’s Nyaru Menteng rehabilitation center in Central Kalimantan , in the heart of Indonesian Borneo .
The ape pauses , picks up a stick and makes his way over to a plastic log , lined with small holes .
Breaking the stick in two , he pokes one end into a hole in an effort to extract honey that has been deposited by a conservation worker .
His expression shows the tool ’s use has been fruitful .
But he is not alone .
To his right another orangutan has turned half a coconut shell into a helmet , two others wrestle on the lawn , and another youngster scales a papaya tree .
There are dozens of orangutans , all of which are about the same age .
Just outside the compound , dozens of younger orangutans are getting climbing lessons from the Borneo Orangutan Survival Foundation ( BOS ) staff , while still younger orangutans are being fed milk from bottles in a nearby nursery .
Still more orangutans — teenagers and adults — can be found on “ Orangutan Island ” beyond the center ’s main grounds .
Meanwhile several recently wild orangutans sit in cages .
This is a waiting game .
BOS hopes to eventually release all of these orangutans back into their natural habitat — the majestic rainforests and swampy peatlands of Central Kalimantan , on the island of Borneo .
But for many , this is a fate that may never be realized .
Why is palm oil replacing tropical rainforests ?
( 04/25/2006 )
In a word , economics , though deeper analysis of a proposal in Indonesia suggests that oil palm development might be a cover for something more lucrative : logging .
Recently much has been made about the conversion of Asia ’s biodiverse rainforests for oil - palm cultivation .
Environmental organizations have warned that by eating foods that use palm oil as an ingredient , Western consumers are directly fueling the destruction of orangutan habitat and sensitive ecosystems .
So , why is it that oil - palm plantations now cover millions of hectares across Malaysia , Indonesia , and Thailand ?
Why has oil palm become the world ’s number one fruit crop , trouncing its nearest competitor , the humble banana ?
The answer lies in the crop ’s unparalleled productivity .
Simply put , oil palm is the most productive oil seed in the world .
A single hectare of oil palm may yield 5,000 kilograms of crude oil , or nearly 6,000 liters of crude .

A group of white police officers is campaigning to have the National Black Police Association disbanded following last week 's jailing of Met commander Ali Dizaei , a former president of the association , who was sentenced to four years for corruption .
Keith Jarrett , another former president , said : " A number of colleagues have called for the NBPA and the BPA [ Black Police Association ] to be wound up .
I do n't mean black colleagues ; I mean white colleagues .
" Those police calling for the BPA to be scrapped … show an ignorance of race relations in the UK . "
It has also emerged that members of the Metropolitan Police Authority met in secret last Wednesday and agreed to denote Dizaei as a " special case " , a decision that means they can fast - track disciplinary action against the senior officer and could see him dismissed from the force next month .
It is the first time the MPA has decided that action against an individual police officer is so urgent that it is designated a " special case " .
The Independent Police Complaints Commission and Dizaei himself were formally notified last Thursday that he will be subject to the MPA 's most extreme disciplinary measures .
A hearing will take place next month to determine the fate of the 47 - year - old Iranian - born officer .
Options include dismissing him from the Met , while the MPA can also strip him of his reported £ 1 m pension pot .
Jarrett also revealed that the NBPA had moved to disown Dizaei .
Officers believed that his behaviour has undermined the efforts of black and Asian officers to improve race relations , particularly within Scotland Yard .
Everything changed in 2001 , the year Nintendo decided that the future of gaming did n't lay in faster processors and photorealistic images , but in interaction .

Years later , when the Wii hit stores , it brought gaming and motion control to the masses , showing grandparents , gamers and soccer moms that video games did n't have to be high - def to be fun and that controlling your games without buttons could be as amusing as it looked .
The Wii's success with motion control kick - started efforts by both Microsoft and Sony to make better , more realistic motion controls for the Playstation 3 and Xbox 360 .
Advertisement
But something happened the first time I tried out Microsoft 's high definition motion control system , Project Natal .
Instead of waving a remote around wildly to smack a tennis ball or knock an in - game foe down with a digital sword , I found myself feeling disconnected from Microsoft 's controller - free experience .
I realized , as I played around with the Project Natal prototype , due to hit stores this year , that I was spending more time examining the game 's reaction to my motions than I was having fun .
I had stumbled upon a kinetic dissonance in motion control gaming .
This disconnect between the game and the player was made worse , not better , by Project Natal 's more responsive controls .
Until motion control is perfected , I realized , the pursuit to make it more precise in video games will result in titles that are less fun to play , not more .

This concept of an uncomfortable disconnect , a foreign familiarity , is n't new .
In fact , Sigmund Freud had a word for it : Uncanny .
And Roboticist Masahiro Mori used the term uncanny valley to describe the disconcerting reaction people had to robots as they became more human - like in their appearance .
The uncanny valley , ironically , became one of the chief stumbling blocks for game developers trying to make games that approached the threshold of photorealism .
The idea is that as a game becomes more realistic the emotional response people have to it dives , leaving people slightly repulsed , until the game finally delivers graphics that are perfectly realistic .
Advertisement
To get around this , a game developer has to shoot for games that hit the peaks of either side of that uncanny valley , either by creating games that feature caricatures or completely realistic people .
Now , it seems , developers escaping the unavoidable graphics journey through the uncanny valley have stumbled upon a new uncanny valley , one marked not by appearance , but by motion .
Advertisement
And this kinetic dissonance is n't just an issue for Microsoft and Sony , both of which promise technology that will deliver more precise , more realistic , motion gaming .
Last year , Nintendo released an add - on for their motion - sensing remote designed to make the peripheral better at detecting movement .
While more than a dozen games have already shipped for the new device , March will see the release of Ubisoft 's Red Steel 2 , a game that will likely define the potential of MotionPlus .
Advertisement
Roman Campos Oriola , the game 's lead designer , says the team is well aware of the issues motion control faces in terms of quasi realism .
" With motion a game is much more accessible for players " Oriola said .
" The problem with motion is that you can quickly fall into the issue of having too much repetition or too much of a simulation . "
Advertisement
If , he explains , they had decided to make the gun-shooting , sword - wielding gameplay of Red Steel 2 a perfect motion simulator it would n't have felt right .
" If you give too much to the player they might start to wonder why you do n't feel the weight of the sword or the knock back when you hit something , " he said .
Advertisement
In other words , as the motion approaches realism , gamers began to pay more attention to the dissimilarities than the similarities .
So Oriola and his team decided to design the game around that first peak approaching the uncanny valley of motion , instead of risking a journey through it .
Advertisement
While Red Steel 2 has moments of one - to - one control , like when a player pulls out the sword while not in battle , the meat of the game , the action moments , instead rely on a caricature of motion .
When a player slashes with the sword in combat , the game recognizes the direction and speed , but instead of using the exact pathway of the motion , it uses that data to trigger a pre-rendered animation .
It 's not the sort of thing that a player will likely notice , but the result is a sort of cartoonish movement as opposed to a realistic one .
Advertisement
" We have the technology to do one - to - one motion , but then you have that strange feeling of being too precise , " he said .
Oriola says that Microsoft's Project Natal , and Sony 's motion controller , which he called the Arc , offer a much wider variety of motion capturing than does the Wii .
But he says he is n't sure yet if that means that those two systems could deliver true motion that does n't feel uncanny .
Advertisement
" So far , from what I can tell , the Wii , going to a full , exact replication of movement is not the right way to do it , " he said .
Aaron Greenberg , director of product management for Xbox 360 and Xbox Live , believes that Project Natal 's ability to see and track your entire body and then translate that into in - game movement lands their motion control safely on the other side of the uncanny valley .
Advertisement
" I have n't felt " a disconnect , " he said .
" The types of experiences the team is focused on creating , the accuracy of them is pretty amazing .
" If you really , really think about it , the beauty of this is that the technology disappears .
We 've been spending so many years , trying to teach more and more people how to use technology .
Now we are teaching the technology how to learn humans . "
Advertisement
But the best way to use motion control , Oriola believes , is for it to highlight whatever the " fantasy of your game " is .
In Red Steel 2 , that means the fantasy of being a samurai , of using a sword with broad , strong , quick slashes .
If the team were to make a game about , say , fencing , it would be the precise wrist motions that deliver parries , counters and quick attacks .
Advertisement
" In that game all of the stuff about power would n't be interesting , " he said . "
They key is figuring out the line between the simulation and the fantasy . "
Advertisement
The biggest risk motion control faces is that the paradoxical nature of that uncanny disconnect may lead gamers and developers to believe that the basic concept is flawed .
In other words , if game developers get it wrong enough , people wo n't want it anymore , no matter how good it eventually gets .

Why a website defending government ?
Because for decades conservatives have been demonizing and attacking government and not enough has been done to defend it .
We need to recognize that despite its problems , government plays an essential role in promoting the good life for all Americans .
When we recklessly reduce and underfund this institution , we are hampering our ability to improve people ’s lives and to effectively address our pressing social , economic , and environmental problems .
To see what is at stake in this battle over government , we need only consider how efforts to limit government in this country have caused us to fall behind many other advanced democracies in providing important public services .
Most western European countries , for instance , have larger public sectors and do much better in a wide variety of areas , including retirement security , poverty reduction , child care availability , affordable higher education , pollution control , limiting workplace injuries , affordable housing , crime control , infrastructure investment , healthcare access , and much more .
A 2014 study found that among similar countries , the U.S. ranks 31st in personal safety , 34th in access to water and sanitation , 39th in basic education , 69th in ecosystem sustainability , and 70th in health .
Most Americans are aware of the crucial role that government plays in addressing these kinds of issues .
Polls consistently show a majority wants the federal government to do more to aid education , protect the environment , strengthen Social Security , and improve access to medical care .
And yet Republicans continue to insist that what we need is even less government , and they persist in waging a relentless political war against this institution .
GOP politicians have been joined in this anti-government crusade by libertarian thinkers , right - wing media pundits , billionaire political activists , and wealthy corporate lobbies .
Make no mistake : the goal of this anti-government movement is not merely to eliminate waste or make the government more efficient .
The ultimate aim is to undermine many of the most important and successful government programs that have been in place since the New Deal and the Great Society .
They want to slash spending on vital safety net programs like Medicare , Medicaid , Food Stamps , and Social Security .
They would like to roll back key regulations protecting consumers , workers , and the environment .
And they want to reduce taxes so drastically that many crucial programs and agencies would be starved of funds .
A Congressional Budget Office analysis of Rep. Paul Ryan ’s budget proposal found that by 2050 , there would no money left for any federal programs except Social Security , Medicare , and defense spending .
Virtually everything else the federal government does would come to a halt .
Few Republican leaders seem bothered by this , perhaps because many have already called for the wholesale dismantling of entire federal agencies , including the Environmental Protection Agency and the Departments of Energy , Housing and Urban Development , Commerce , Interior , and Education .
During the Obama administration , Republicans were blocked from enacting these extreme cuts in government programs and services .
But with the election of Donald Trump and the GOP control over both houses of Congress , this radical anti-government agenda has a much better chance of becoming a reality .
The attack on Obamacare was simply the opening salvo .
Also on tap are other parts of the Republicans ' government - destroying wish list : large tax cuts and assaults on basic social safety net programs .
Another top priority is wide scale deregulation .
Trump has promised corporate leaders that he will eliminate 75 % of business regulations .
And he appointed heads of federal agencies who actually oppose the basic missions of those agencies .
This includes installing a climate change denier to lead the EPA ; a man who previously sued the EPA to stop regulations on carbon dioxide , ozone , and mercury , Clean Water rules , and more .
Chief White House strategist Stephen Bannon made it clear early on that one of the main goals of the Trump administration was the " deconstruction of the administrative state " -- meaning the deliberate sabotaging of the administrative system that runs our social programs and implements regulations , and that is an essential part of modern democratic government .
Note that much of the material on this site was originally written during the Obama years , so some of the examples used may seem a bit dated .
But the basic principles and arguments remain valid .
The agenda of the anti-government movement remains the same , as does its tactics .
For example , I detail here how President George W. Bush promoted deregulation by cutting administrative budgets and appointing administrators who were ideological enemies of their own agencies .
This same blueprint is being followed by President Trump , albeit with more vigor .
This website is a response to this increasingly extreme anti-government movement and its distorted depiction of government .
It makes the case that government – despite its flaws – plays a valuable and indispensable role in promoting the public good .
In reality , most government programs are working well and are actually improving the lives of all Americans in innumerable ways .
Our democratic government is a unique institution that allows us to pool our resources and to act collectively to address the serious social , economic , and environmental problems that we are unable to deal with as individuals .
The public sector is also how we provide for essential human needs that are neglected by the market – such as clean air and water , safe workplaces , and economic security .
What ’s more , government serves as an important instrument of moral action – a way for us to rectify injustices , eliminate suffering , and care for each other .
In short , democratic government is one of the main ways we work together to pursue the common good and make the world a better place .
If we want an America that is prosperous , healthy , secure , well - educated , just , compassionate , and unpolluted , we need a strong , active , and well - funded public sector .
Articles on this site will also show that the arguments used by conservative to try to justify their attacks on government are often based on misinformation and faulty assumptions .
Consider , for example , the charge that the federal bureaucracy is growing at an uncontrollable rate .
Simply not true .
The facts are these : in 1970 , 2,944,000 civilians worked in the federal executive branch ; by 2014 , that figure had grown to – or rather been reduced to – 2,663,000 .
In 1966 , the federal government employed 4.3 % of all people with jobs in the U.S.
In 2013 , federal employees made up only 2 % of the total workforce .
So much for the ever - growing federal bureaucracy .
Most of the other traditional conservative criticisms of government are off the mark as well .
This site shows that Americans are not hugely overtaxed , that big government does not inevitably impinge on individual freedoms , and that government is not the natural enemy of business .
This is not to deny that American government has its problems .
There are incidents of waste , some regulations are poorly designed , and some politicians abuse their power .
More importantly , our government is certainly not as democratic and accountable as it could be , money plays too big a role in politics , and special interests have way too much political power .
Such problems need to be fixed , and this site identifies several needed reforms .
Nonetheless , whatever drawbacks this institution has right now are far outweighed by the enormous benefits that we all enjoy from a vast array of public sector programs .
On the whole , government is good for us and we need to start coming to its defense .

This is a video of the recent Atlas V liftoff and subsequent sonic boom .
The Australian Science Media Centre rounded up questions on climate science from journalists and put them to leading scientists in the field .
Below is the resulting Q&A .
1 ) There has been conflicting messages about warming in recent years – is it or is it not getting warmer ?
Professor Steven Sherwood , Climate Change Research Centre at the University of New South Wales
“ The trend on meaningful time - scales has remained upward .
Recent observations remain consistent with mainstream models and theories that predict warming .
A longer period of sustained flat or cooling temperatures would be needed to challenge them . ”
Associate Professor Kevin Walsh , Associate Professor of meteorology in the School of Earth Sciences at the University of Melbourne
“ It is getting warmer , but not at the same rate everywhere .
Take the global average temperature , for instance .
The year 1998 was the warmest year to date ( because it was a big El Nino year ) , and if a trend line is calculated starting at 1998 going to 2009 , this trend is not statistically significant .
But if you take the same trend from 1997 or 1999 , the upward temperature trend is statistically significant .
And if you take a trend from 1900 to 2009 , the upward temperature trend is REALLY statistically significant . ”
“ Why do I pick 1998 ?
Because it is often said that the lack of a trend since 1998 invalidates the global warming hypothesis .
But global warming is a trend superimposed upon natural variability , variability that still exists despite global warming .
This means every so often you would expect a spike in the global average arising from natural variability alone , just like the year 1998 .
It would be MUCH more surprising if the global average temperature just kept on going up , year after year , without some years of slightly cooler temperatures . ”
Professor Neville Nicholls , Professorial Fellow in the School of Geography and Environmental Science at Monash University
“ The graph below shows global temperatures of the lower atmosphere ( just above the Earth ’s surface ) averaged over November - January each year ( ending in November 2009 – January 2010 ) .
The data are from Dr Roy Spencer and Dr John Christy ( http://vortex.nsstc.uah.edu/data/msu/t2lt/uahncdc.lt), whose data have been used in the past to suggest that warming has ‘ stopped ’ .
As the figure shows , global warming is going strong , despite rumours of its demise .
Global temperatures have increased about 0.5C since 1979 /80 ( satellite data started in 1979 ) .
Other data ( temperatures over land , sea surface temperatures ) show similar warming . ”
Dr Paul Beggs , Senior Lecturer in the Division of Environmental and Life Sciences at Macquarie University , NSW
“ The message from climate change experts about warming in recent years has been clear and consistent .
Warming of the climate system is unequivocal .
It is getting warmer . ”
1 ) Is the warming of recent years statistically significant compared to other periods of inter-glacial warming ?
Are we simply seeing a blip , which will be smoothed out to something approaching normal inter-glacial periods or is this the start of something big ?
Professor Steven Sherwood , Climate Change Research Centre at the University of New South Wales
“ Most studies find that the warming stands out statistically , though this will be contested .
What is more important is that the warming was predicted decades ago based on physical principles , and the predictions came true .
The predicted future warming is much larger , if emissions continue .
We ai n’t seen nothing yet . ”
2 ) Some sceptics say there is no evidence of a link between increasing carbon in the atmosphere , and increasing temperatures .
Is the link clear ?
Professor Steven Sherwood , Climate Change Research Centre at the University of New South Wales
“ Yes , satellites can measure the greenhouse effect and its increase over time .
These claims are false . ”
Associate Professor Kevin Walsh , Associate Professor of meteorology in the School of Earth Sciences at the University of Melbourne
“ If there is no link between increased concentrations of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere and global warming , then we do n’t understand physics that has been used successfully in other scientific fields since the nineteenth century .
There has to be a link .
The controversy is about the size of the effect , not whether it exists or not . ”
Professor Neville Nicholls , Professorial Fellow in the School of Geography and Environmental Science at Monash University , Melbourne
“ Confidence in the reality of the link between carbon dioxide in the atmosphere and warming comes from three sources :
1. Laboratory experiments 150 years ago ( and repeated many times since – you can even see a demonstration on YouTube ) show that carbon dioxide is a greenhouse gas and that increasing its concentration will lead to warming unless other processes ( a weakening sun , or massive volcanoes , or dust from an asteroid hitting the earth ) offset this warming .
2. Predictions of the amount of warming expected from the likely increases in carbon dioxide have been made since at least 1959 ( the 1959 prediction was published in Scientific American at the time ) .
These predictions were initially done without the use of climate models , and were just based on physics .
By the early 1970s , warming ( up to the end of the 20th century ) was being accurately predicted in journals such as Nature , using the climate models available at that time .
Better models were used in 1988 to make predictions of warming , again proving quite accurate .
Successful prediction is the standard technique that scientists use to confirm their understanding of a process .
The success of repeated predictions ( made over 50 years ) of warming confirm our understanding of the physics of the greenhouse effect .
3 . In recent decades , a large number of more sophisticated climate models that take account of a wider range of climate mechanisms , and do a better job of simulating atmospheric behaviour , have been shown to reproduce the observed 20th century warming and cooling episodes when they use anthropogenic influences ( including greenhouse gas increases ) but cannot reproduce the observed temperature behaviour if only natural processes ( solar variations and volcanoes ) are included in the model .
Some of the variations in the Earth ’s climate in previous ages were caused by changes in the amount of energy received from the Sun .
But satellite observations show that there has not been a trend to more heating from the Sun over recent decades , so the Sun has not caused the warming of the past 50 years . ”
Dr Paul Beggs , Senior Lecturer in the Division of Environmental and Life Sciences at Macquarie University , NSW
“ The sceptics are wrong .
There is considerable evidence of a link between the observed increase in anthropogenic greenhouse gas concentrations in the atmosphere and the observed increase in global average temperatures .
The link is clear . ”
3 ) With the recent attacks on the IPCC reports , can we trust the science and the scientists ?
Can peer review be trusted ?
Professor Steven Sherwood , Climate Change Research Centre at the University of New South Wales
“ This event has been horribly overblown .
The unfounded claims that have caused the controversy were so minor , they were not even mentioned in the report ’s Executive Summary .
The executive summaries are vetted very very thoroughly , could not have errors of this kind , and contain all the findings of importance to policymakers .
The bowels of the text , where errors have been found , are not vetted very well ( especially in the WG II and III reports ) and IPCC needs to address this .
It is worth pointing out that the sin of the IPCC –publishing a prediction with no scientific foundation –is one that contrarians do every time they say we have nothing to worry about . ”
Associate Professor Kevin Walsh , Associate Professor of Meteorology in the School of Earth Sciences at the University of Melbourne
“ I ’m assuming that most will understand the process of peer review , but maybe not , so I ’ll just briefly describe it .
A “ peer ” is someone who is an expert in the field of the work being evaluated , or who is an expert in a closely related scientific field .
Often , they will be scientific competitors of the scientists whose work is being evaluated .
Sometimes , the reviewer may be deeply sceptical about the topic of the work being assessed .
So peer review is certainly not a self - congratulation society of like - minded scientists .
On the other hand , though , even rigorous peer review can let things slip through , or assess work incompletely .
It ’s not surprising , therefore , that in the several thousand pages of the IPCC reports , a few problems have been found with the review process .
“ Can peer review be trusted ?
I guess the next question is what is the alternative ?
Review by non-peers , or in other words by non-experts ?
This does not seem like a viable alternative .
There will always be some issues with any review process .
But peer review is the best process that we have come up with so far to perform quality control on scientific publications . ”
Professor Neville Nicholls , Professorial Fellow in the School of Geography and Environmental Science at Monash University , Melbourne
“ In 2009 there were 7,541 peer - reviewed scientific papers published in the peer - reviewed literature with the topic of ‘ global warming ’ or ‘ greenhouse effect ’ or ‘ climate change ’ .
With such a large number of papers there must be some that are incorrect .
But the large number indicates that this is a very busy field , and such a busy field should ensure that most of the work published is checked by many other scientists .
“ All those journal papers have been reviewed by 2 - 3 other scientists , prior to their publication .
The IPCC then assesses this mountain of published scientific literature .
The Fourth Assessment cites over 10,000 papers from the scientific literature , most of which have already been through the peer - review process to get into the scientific literature .
The IPCC reports themselves are subjected to four reviews , over a 2 - 3 year period .
The IPCC Fourth Assessment received about 90,000 comments from about 2,500 reviewers .
The review comments are publicly available , as are the responses of the authors .
So , any errors made by the authors in response to the reviewer comments should be found pretty quickly .
It is hard to conceive of a more comprehensive and transparent process than that used by the IPCC .
“ Once the IPCC reports themselves are completed , there is another process of review to prepare and revise summaries of the reports .
Every sentence in these summaries is discussed and argued about ( and finally agreed by consensus – not a vote ) by scientists and representatives from more than 130 governments ( and many of these government representatives are also scientists ) .
It is hard to imagine any process of assessing a complex subject that would be subject to more comprehensive debate and review . ”
Dr Paul Beggs , Senior Lecturer in the Division of Environmental and Life Sciences at Macquarie University , NSW
“ Peer review can certainly be trusted , particularly the IPCC peer review process which is arguably the most rigorous and transparent peer review process in the history of science .
Similarly , of course we can trust the science and scientists .
Asking if we can trust the science and the scientists is like asking if we can trust medicine and the doctors .
Just like we consult a doctor when we are unwell , we must trust and accept the consensus of the world ’s climate change experts as clearly presented in the IPCC ’s most recent Assessment Report ( published in 2007 , the year it was jointly awarded the Nobel Peace Prize with Al Gore ) . ”
4 ) My sense is that earth ’s carbon cycle is very poorly understood , the link between atmospheric , marine and terrestrial sinks .
Much focus has been on the atmosphere – but is the real carbon action is in the world ’s oceans ?
Professor Steven Sherwood , Climate Change Research Centre at the University of New South Wales
“ If I began pumping carbon monoxide into your office , and an alarm soon went off indicating CO levels were rising toward dangerous levels , would you dismiss concerns on the basis that there is much more CO in the global atmosphere than in your office and that you do n’t fully understand the building ’s air handling system ?
“ This is a slight of hand to distract the public from the clear facts that carbon dioxide rises are unequivocally due to fossil fuel burning ( plus a few smaller sources ) .
It sounds inspired by Ian Plimer ’s book .
His arguments rest on false assertions ( which he continues to refuse to recant ) and a willingness to ignore the most crucial evidence and arguments .
His assertion that we do n’t know why CO2 levels are rising or that is natural is preposterous and easily disproved . ”
5 ) The sceptics say rainfall has not reduced in the Murray Darling Basin .
What is the true story and how strong is the link with climate change ?
Professor Steven Sherwood , Climate Change Research Centre at the University of New South Wales
“ The sceptics here are ( for once ) technically correct , in that there is no proven link –yet– between Murray - Darling drought and climate change .
BUT …( a ) there are good reasons to expect most of Australia to gradually dry due to warming , regardless of any particular drought happening right now ; ( b ) the severe droughts in southern Victoria and southwest Australia have been more firmly attributed to global warming ; and ( c ) temperatures everywhere , including the Murray - Darling , are rising which increases the need for rainfall .
Thus drought is worsening even though rain is n’t decreasing ( because it is n’t increasing enough ) . ”
Professor Neville Nicholls , Professorial Fellow in the School of Geography and Environmental Science at Monash University , Melbourne
“ Annual MDB rainfall in each of the last nine years has been below 500 mm ( you can find these data at the Bureau of Meteorology ’s web page ) .
Prior to this dry period , the longest run of years below 500 mm , since we have had decent data ( starting in 1900 ) , was six years ( 1925 - 1930 ) .
So , the current dry period is 50 % longer than the previous record dry period .
But this current dry period might still be just a fluke , or natural variability .
We cannot confidently attribute it to global warming . ”
6 ) What is the link between extreme weather and climate change ?
Sceptics say the link is weak and unproven .
Professor Steven Sherwood , Climate Change Research Centre at the University of New South Wales
“ For some extremes this is true , but there is little doubt that a warmer climate will bring more extreme heat waves , and heavier downpours in areas that still receive ample rain .
These things are being observed .
We also expect more frequent and severe droughts , which is also being observed . ”
Associate Professor Kevin Walsh , Associate Professor of meteorology in the School of Earth Sciences at the University of Melbourne
“ The link is weak , but not necessarily unproven .
I say it is weak because , so far , there is little indication of detectable trends in extreme weather events that can be tied directly to the warming that has occurred to date .
One exception , of course , is increases in extreme high temperatures , which have been demonstrated in some regions of the globe to be associated with climate change trends .
But for other phenomena such as tropical cyclones , trends have not been unambiguously associated with global warming .
On the other hand , climate predictions suggest that we should start to see trends in some of these other phenomena , but probably not until later this century . ”
Professor Neville Nicholls , Professorial Fellow in the School of Geography and Environmental Science at Monash University , Melbourne
“ Hot extremes ( hot days and nights , and heat waves ) over much of the world have increased as the world has warmed over the past 50 years , while cold events ( cold days , cold nights ) have decreased in frequency and intensity .
The link between these changes in extremes and global warming is very clear .
Linking global warming and other types of extremes is more complicated .
Some extremes ( tornadoes , strong winds ) are not monitored well enough to determine if they are changing .
Some ( tropical cyclones ) are not modeled sufficiently well to make confident predictions of changes , or to understand the causes of changes .
Some extremes ( droughts , heavy rains ) have been changing in different ways in different regions , so it is hard to make a global assessment .
All the above issues are discussed in the IPCC Fourth Assessment reports . ”
7 ) With so much uncertainty , what can we be sure about ?
There must be unknowns / missing links / things science is not so sure about .
What are they ?
Professor Steven Sherwood , Climate Change Research Centre at the University of New South Wales
“ Relatively few things are certain , but these things should compel people to action .
They are : ( a ) human activities ( mainly fossil fuel burning ) are increasing greenhouse gas levels , ( b ) increased greenhouse gas levels have a warming effect , and ( c ) we are observing warming at the rate calculated from this effect .
None of this is contestable . ”
Associate Professor Kevin Walsh , Associate Professor of meteorology in the School of Earth Sciences at the University of Melbourne
“ If we wait until we have absolute certainty on all aspects of this topic before acting , we will never act .
People in their daily and professional lives make decisions all the time without being absolutely certain about the consequences .
Regarding uncertainty : most scientists – and not just most climate scientists , most scientists in general – are pretty certain that the observed global warming over the past 100 years is due to man-made greenhouse gases , and have been for some time .
But it seems very difficult to get this message across to the public .
One reason is that it is much harder to figure out what the effect of global warming will be at the local level , for example , what will be the average rainfall in the Murray - Darling basin in 2050 .
It ’s harder because calculations involving rainfall are harder to do , since some of the processes involved are not as well understood as they should be , and so the uncertainty is greater .
We are dealing here with likelihood and risk management , not certainty .
The important thing for scientists ( and journalists ) is to clearly convey an appreciation of the likelihood of a particular prediction , which will range from almost certain ( e.g. that the global temperature will continue to increase , although not always every year ) to predictions of much lower certainty .
But some predictions ARE certain enough for action to be taken , and it has – like restrictions on the building of new structures close to the coast due to predicted sea level rise , for instance .
The only way to reduce uncertainty is with better science . ”
Dr Paul Beggs , Senior Lecturer in the Division of Environmental and Life Sciences at Macquarie University
“ There is , of course , some uncertainty regarding some aspects of climate change , but we can be sure about many things .
I think the public is being underestimated if the media or anyone else thinks it will only act if it has certainty on this issue .
The public acts without certainly all the time .
Many people are already acting on climate change .
While the research on climate change must continue , I look forward to much more community discussion of the many responses to climate change . ”
8 ) How much credence do we give to the central plank of Monckton ’s argument that spending loads on cutting carbon will have basically sod all impact on restraining temperature rise ?
Professor Steven Sherwood , Climate Change Research Centre at the University of New South Wales
“ Monckton has no credibility on this issue and is peddling snake oil .
It is true that meaningful reduction will not be easy , but economic studies show that half the job can be accomplished at zero net cost .
It just requires changing habits and standing up to some special interest groups . ”
9 ) We hear a lot about the difference between ‘ weather ’ and ‘ climate ’ , but where do climatologists tend to draw the line ?
How significant is it , for example , if a given region of Australia were to suffer both its hottest and its driest summer ( Dec - Feb ) this year ?
Would that be considered a solid AGW signal or does three months still count as ‘ weather ’ not ‘ climate ’ ?
Professor Steven Sherwood , Climate Change Research Centre at the University of New South Wales
“ That would count as weather , not climate .
The real question in science is whether observations are consistent with different hypotheses .
The snowstorms in Europe and the US , for example , are fully consistent with greenhouse warming predictions : less than one degree of warming will not put an end to snowstorms !
The only evidence that matters is that which would be inconsistent with one argument or the other .
The observed global warming , and its geographic pattern , is inconsistent with the notion that greenhouse gases have no effect on climate and has been shown so in many independent , peer - reviewed studies . ”
Professor Neville Nicholls , Professorial Fellow in the School of Geography and Environmental Science at Monash University , Melbourne
“ As the IPCC Fourth Assessment says very clearly , a single extreme event cannot be attributed to global warming ( or any other cause ) .
This is the case whether we are talking about a single storm or a single hot summer .
But a consistent string of extreme events of the same type – such as the run of unprecedented heat waves that have hit Australia in the past few years – starts to look a lot more like climate change , and less like a fluke . ”
10 ) What greenhouse gas cuts need to be made and by when to achieve certain temperature - rise limits ( i.e. of 2 degrees ) and to minimise the impact of climate change ?
Professor Steven Sherwood , Climate Change Research Centre at the University of New South Wales
“ We can predict temperature rises over the long term to about a factor of 2 , which is n’t great and means we are dealing here with probabilities .
To have a decent chance of avoiding an eventual 2C rise would require that future emissions be roughly equal to all past emissions .
This would require emissions to peak in the next decade or so and then decline almost as fast as they rose over the 20th century . ”
I have been covering the story of Dr. Steven Laureys , a Belgium neurologist whose research involves disorders of consciousness , and his most famous patient , Rom Houben .
Houben is a 46 year old man who is the victim of a car accident at the age of 23 .
For the latter half of his life he has been in an apparent persistent vegetative state - except recently it was discovered that he has more brain activity ( almost normal ) than expected .
So Dr. Laureys attempted to establish communication with Houben as if Houben were in a locked in state – someone who is conscious but paralyzed .
All they could get Houben to move was his foot to depress a pedal , and that could theoretically be used to answer yes / no questions .
But Houben has too much spasticity and he could not lift his foot off the pedal .
This is where the story gets interesting , and where it became an international controversy .
Enter Linda Wouters – a speech therapist who uses facilitated communication ( FC ) .
She claimed that after months of training she could communicate with Houbens by sensing the subtle movements of his right hand , which he could use to direct her across a computer screen keyboard .
FC , unfortunately , is pure pseudoscience .
It was introduced in the late 1980s as a wonderful new method for communicating with children with cognitive disorders , on the assumption that they were more verbally than mentally impaired .
Many therapists were convinced , and many parents were overjoyed as their previously non-communicative children starting writing poetry expressing their love for their parents .
( And there was also a dark side as some children , through FC , started reporting physical and sexual abuse by parents and caretakers . )
When people got around to actually testing FC scientifically it turned out , rather unequivocally , that all the communication was being done subconsciously by the facilitator – a phenomenon called the ideomotor effect .
They were not just supporting the hand of their client , they were directing it .
Well - designed studies showed that the facilitator was always doing all the communication .
FC then shrank to a fringe phenomenon – but its adherents would not give up , and FC continues to this day ( even sometimes in courtroom testimony ) , hoodwinking the unawares and having to be debunked all over again and again .
It is very unfortunate that Dr. Laureys was unfamiliar with FC .
Had he known more about it he could have nipped this travesty in the bud .
But he was taken in by it , claiming that he tested Wouters and it looked to him as if Houben was doing the communication .
This story , in fact , is a good cautionary tale about why mainstream scientists need to be familiar with the pseudosciences that touch their specialty .
Regarding Rom Houben video showing Wouters performing FC with Houben clearly showed that he could not be doing the communication .
In one video Houben was not even looking at the keyboard , and may not have even been awake .
But in every video Wouters was moving his hand across the keyboard at unbelievable speeds – not even a neurologically intact person could direct another to keystrokes with such speed an accuracy by just moving one finger .
But to Laureys credit he promised a more thorough test – although he seemed confident such test would validate the FC communication with Houbens .
Well finally we have the results of this further testing .
Spiegel Online reports :
Laureys has now carried out those tests , and his results hold that it was n’t Houben doing the writing after all .
The tests determined that he does n’t have enough strength and muscle control in his right arm to operate the keyboard .
In her effort to help the patient express himself , it would seem that the speech therapist had unwittingly assumed control …
In the more recent test , Houben was shown or told a series of 15 objects and words , without a speech therapist being present .
Afterward , he was supposed to type the correct word — but he did n’t succeed a single time .
Good for Laureys for doing proper tests and sharing the results with the world .
This is , of course , what skeptics like myself predicted would be the results of proper testing .
We also warned about the pitfall of doing less than rigorous testing , like those that initially convinced Laureys .
Once again pseudoscience fails under properly designed scientific testing .
Unfortunately , is appears that Laureys ’ conversion to FC skeptic is not yet complete .
He is also quoted as saying ,
This does n’t necessarily discredit facilitated communication altogether .
Laureys analyzed another paralyzed test subject who answered all 15 control questions correctly despite having a comparable brain - damage diagnosis .
“ That means it is really necessary to verify every single case , ” Laureys says .
Laureys does not seem to appreciate that he is claiming here that he has overturned 20 years of FC research showing that it is not legitimate .
You cannot casually claim from a single case that you have demonstrated a highly implausible phenomenon that has previously been rejected by carefully controlled studies .
What are the details of this new case he is referring to ?
Is it really FC ?
I could find nothing published , and there are no further details in the report .
It is possible that the reporting itself is inaccurate – this requires further follow up .
The rest of the Spiegel article deals with the very legitimate and interesting research of Laureys and others involving attempts at using various brain imaging technology to better assess , and possibly even communicate with those who are locked in or in a minimally conscious state .
I discussed this research recently here .
This article adds a discussion of the research of Marie Bruno – who is using EEGs ( electroencephalogram ) to communicate .
The idea is that the EEG can detect difference in brain wave activity in different brain states voluntarily created by the subject .
The method is still crude , and will likely require years of research to become useful .
But it is promising .
Rom Houben ’s story has grown to encapsulate the plight of those with disorders of consciousness , our attempts to better assess and communicate with them through advancing technology , and the mischief that can still be caused by lingering pseudosciences .
It is truly a scandal that FC is still around .
Like homeopathy , therapeutic touch , and many similar medical pseudosciences – their persistence is not a failure of science , which has adequately shown them to be nothing but illusions , but rather of collective rationality .

Enter " Juby " .
Juby is intended to be basically like Duby , in that it uses Java 's types and Ruby 's syntax .
But it takes advantage of the new invokedynamic opcode to be 100 % dynamic .
Juby is a dynamic Duby , or perhaps a dynamic Java with Ruby syntax .
It 's not hard to comprehend .
But the name was a problem .
Juby sounds like " Jewbie " , a pejorative term for a Jewish person .
So I sent out a call for names to the Twitterverse , ultimately ending up with far more names than I could choose from .
Syringa vulgaris .
The genus " Syringa " is derived from New Latin , based on a Greek word " surinx " meaning " shepherd 's pipe " from the use of the Syringa plant 's hollow stems to make pipes .
Perhaps Surinx is building on the " hollow stem " of the JVM to produce something you can smoke ( other dynamic languages ) with .
Combined with its cousin " Duby " , we have quite a pair .
The name I have chosen , Surinx , has a simple story attached .
You see , when James Gosling created Java , he originally named it " Oak " , after the tree outside his window .
So I followed his lead ; the tree ( a bush , really ) outside my window is a lilac , .
The genus " Syringa " is derived from New Latin , based on a Greek word " surinx " meaning " shepherd 's pipe " from the use of theplant 's hollow stems to make pipes .
Perhaps Surinx is building on the " hollow stem " of the JVM to produce something you can smoke ( other dynamic languages ) with .
Combined with its cousin " Duby " , we have quite a pair .
And in other news , the simple Surinx implementation of " fib " below ( identical to Ruby ) manages to run fib ( 40 ) in only 7 seconds on current MLVM ( OpenJDK7 + invokedynamic and other tidbits ) , a five - fold improvement over JRuby 's fastest mode ( jruby -- fast ) .
def fib(a )
if a < 2
a
else
fib(a - 1 ) + fib(a - 2 )
end
end
In June of this year , I spent a few hours formulating a dynamic cousin to Duby .
Duby , if you do n't remember , is a static - typed language with Ruby 's syntax and Java 's type system .
Duby supports all Ruby 's literals , uses local type inference ( only argument types * must * be declared ) , and runs as fast as Java ( because it produces nearly identical bytecode ) .
But with the advent of invokedynamic , Duby needed a playmate .
Given that JRuby has started to support invokedynamic , the solid performance of Surinx bodes very well for JRuby 's future .
Please welcome Surinx to your language repertoire !
When 30 - year - old Ronald Kennedy speaks of the Netherlands , he is at pains to point out that the air is " unbreathable . "
A native of Vlaardingen , an industrial town close to Rotterdam , he studied journalism at Utrecht — a city located at the junction of four motorways , where locals there consider a house with a quiet bedroom to be the height of luxury .
With 470 inhabitants per square kilometre , the Netherlands is one of the most densely populated countries in the world , and overpopulation is the main reason for Dutch emigration .
In 2008 , close to 120,000 people ( from an overall 16 million ) left the country for good .
Surveys have shown that approximately one Dutch person in 30 has plans to emigrate .
Similar trends hold sway in the United Kingdom and Germany — two of the richest and most stable countries in the world , which figure in the dreams of millions of Asian and African refugees .
Last year , Germany registered a record 165,000 departures .
In 2008 , 318,000 British citizens chose to live elsewhere , following in the footsteps of 400,000 who left the previous year .
The figure for 2009 is expected to be even higher .
Ask people to define a typical immigrant , and they will talk about pensioners who move to Spain or Asia , where the climate is better , and the low cost of living allows them to lead a life of luxury .
Occasionally , they will speak about young hedonists who succumb to the lure of Caribbean beaches , and a life of casual sex and cheap Colombian drugs .
But what most of us do not realize is that the majority of emigrants are responsible middle - aged people with families , who are seeking tranquility and more space .
Typically , they come from busy and inhospitable cities in Europe , which they cannot wait to abandon for the charms of new lives in Canada , the United States , Australia and New Zealand .
As sociologists have recently discovered , the phenomenon of emigration is no longer confined to the rural poor , but now mainly concerns middle - class city dwellers .
A highly dangerous brain drain
Studies by the Netherlands Interdisciplinary Demographic Institute ( NIDI ) show that one in three aspiring emigrants is ready to accept a reduction in income .
" No one is leaving Europe to become a millionaire .
On the contrary , in Australia and in Canada , average incomes are lower than they are in the United Kingdom , " remarks Frans Buysse , who runs a visa reservation service in Culemborg .
A desire for a change in life - style is the key motivating factor .
Research has also shown that in Europe , aspiring emigrants not only take into account their personal circumstances in their countries of origin ( notably with regard to salary and housing ) , but also the level of public services .
The decision to leave can be motivated by " dissatisfaction with long hospital waiting lists , poor quality schools , the level of crime , or industrial strife , " explains Harry van Dalen , a professor at the Netherlands Interdisciplinary Demographic Institute and the University of Tilburg .
Van Dalen 's work has revealed for example that the murders of eccentric nationalist politician Pim Fortuyn and film director Theo van Gogh — shot for his anti-Islamic stance in 2004 — clearly boosted emigration from the Netherlands .
For many people , these attacks definitively put paid to the ideal of the Netherlands as the world 's most liberal country : so they upped and left .
In Germany , the lure of a better life elsewhere has cast a spell over broad sections of society , launching a fashion for television series about the daily lives of emigrants .
The private television channel VOX was the first to exploit this trend with a 2006 show entitled Goodbye Deutschland !
A book of practical advice for those planning to leave was also published under the same title last year .
The fact that many emigrants are highly qualified is particularly bad news for the German government .
" The brain drain is a highly dangerous phenomenon .
In four years , the German economy will have 330,000 unfilled vacancies for third - level graduates , " warns Reiner Klingholz of the Berlin Institute for Population and Development .
Already one in seven scientific theses written by a German is presented in the United States , and three of Germany 's current crop of four Nobel prize laureates have opted to live on the other side of the Atlantic .
There are plenty of volunteers willing to replace people who are leaving , but the majority of immigrants to Europe are unskilled workers .
As a result , the state is doubly penalized : it loses the investment made in the training of experts who opt to live elsewhere , and at the same time it must finance language classes and skills training for immigrants .
MCLEAN , Va . — When Charles E. Haldeman Jr. became Freddie Mac's chief executive officer in August , the ailing housing - finance giant had already consumed $ 51 billion of government money to stay afloat .
It 's likely to need even more .
Freddie 's federal overseers nevertheless have instructed Mr. Haldeman to focus on something that is n't likely to make the bleak balance sheet look any better : carrying out the Obama administration plan to allow defaulted borrowers to hang onto their homes .

Death in the family ( Olga , Ophelia and the later deceased Olivia )
A wild bonobo has been seen cannibalising her own recently deceased two and a half - year - old infant .
Among apes , such behaviour is extremely rare , only being reported before among orangutans , and never by bonobos , our closest relative alongside chimps .
Though uncommon , the behaviour may not be aberrant , says the scientist who witnessed it .
But it does further challenge a widely perceived notion that bonobos are an especially " peaceful " ape species .
The discovery is reported in the American Journal of Primatology .
Bonobos ( Pan paniscus ) were once known as pygmy chimps , due to their similarities with the common chimpanzee ( Pan troglodytes ) , from which they diverged in the past one million years .
Researchers have often emphasised the differences in behaviour between the two species ; bonobos are reported as being less aggressive , hostile to one another , and living in societies dominated by females rather than high - ranking males that control communities of common chimps .
The idea of the ' Hippy Chimp ' is more a metaphor than a scientific argument
Dr Andrew Fowler
Max Planck Institute for Evolutionary Anthropology
They were also regarded as less violent , being thought not to commit infanticide or hunt and eat other primate species .
Last year , however , that more peaceful image was shattered when scientists discovered that bonobos do kill and eat monkeys .
Now , primatologists Dr Andrew Fowler and Dr Gottfried Hohmann of the Max Planck Institute for Evolutionary Anthropology in Leipzig , Germany have recorded an example of a bonobo ape consuming , along with other apes in her group , the body of her recently deceased infant .
Taking of the body
Dr Fowler and colleague Ms Caroline Deimel were conducting routine observations of a group of bonobos living in the forest at Lui Kotale in the Democratic Republic of Congo .
Through the trees , they saw a female called Olga carrying her dead infant , Olivia , over her shoulder .
That morning Olivia had been seen alive , and her body showed no signs of injury .
The next day , Olga still carried her dead infant , and spent an hour or so grooming her body .
" After an hour , Marta , a dominant female then took the body , retaining it despite initial resistance from Olga .
She then began to consume it , joined by most of the community including the mother , " Dr Fowler told the BBC .
" Consumption took several hours , and possession of the carcass changed several times .
At times Olga and Ophelia , her remaining daughter , were not involved but remained nearby throughout the period , " he says .
" When a single foot and hand only remained attached to a long skin fragment , Olga took the remains , placed them over her back and walked away . "
Dr Fowler says that such behaviour is not usual , but it may be more widespread than this one incident .
Researchers may have witnessed it , but been unwilling to report it for fear of drawing undue attention to cannibalism among our close relatives , he says .
Or there may simply not have been enough long - term studies of bonobos to previously notice it .
Infanticide , the practice of killing younger members of the same species , occurs among common chimps and gorillas .
Cannibalism , where animals eat their own kind , has also been reported among chimps , and inferred on one ocassion in gorillas .
Biologists believe that infanticide is often triggered by males who wish to eliminate infants carrying genes different to their own .
I do n't think it necessarily says anything about ' empathy ' or ' morality '
Dr Andrew Fowler
Max Planck Institute for Evolutionary Anthropology
By killing infants , they can also make the mothers sexually receptive again , increasing their own chances or mating with her .
Filial cannibalism , where a mother eats her own offspring , is much rarer , particularly among great apes , in which it has only once been reported before .
Last year , Mr David Dellatore of Oxford Brookes University in the UK reported two incidences of female orangutans eating their recently deceased babies .
He suspected the orangutans may have acted this way due to stress .
But Dr Fowler believes the behaviour may occur among apes more often .
Like Mr Dellatore , Dr Fowler is reluctant to make any definitive claims as to why the behaviour occurred .
He suspects that Olga and the other bonobos consumed Olivia 's body for nutritional gain , even though it carried a risk of contracting disease from the dead infant .
Sexy and peaceful ?
However , says Dr Fowler : " I am not sure there are wider implications from a scientific point of view . "
" I do n't see that occasionally consuming dead infants , however distasteful it might seem to us , is a sign of pathology or aberration per se . "
" I do n't think it necessarily says anything about ' empathy ' or ' morality ' , " he adds .
" It had been suggested in the past that bonobos might feel more sympathy for victims , which is why they did n't hunt monkeys , for example .
Metaphor
" But we now know they do hunt monkeys .
So I think eating an already dead baby says little about bonobos in that respect .
" Bonobos are often used in a symbolic way , held up as the sexy , peaceful ' Hippy Chimps ' .
" The fact that they eat monkeys and consume their own dead offspring may not accord with this view , but I personally do n't see this as a problem . "
" The idea of the ' Hippy Chimp ' is more a metaphor than a scientific argument , " he continues .
" I think the major implication is that we do n't need to see it as an aberration among other apes .
" A more interesting question is why this female bonobo , Olga , allowed her infant to be eaten , because this is not always the case in chimpanzees .
" The incident might tell us more about relationships between adults , and particularly adult females , in the sense that Marta was able to take and consume the body of another female . "

Science fiction movies should be allowed only one major transgression of the laws of physics , according to a US professor who has won backing from a number of his peers after creating a set of guidelines for Hollywood .
The proposals are intended to curb the film industry 's worst abuses of science by confining scriptwriters to plotlines that embrace the suspension of disbelief but stop short of demanding it in every scene .
The guidelines are by Sidney ­Perkowitz , a professor of physics at Emory University in Atlanta , Georgia and a member of the Science and Entertainment Exchange , an advisory body run by the US National Academy of Sciences .
Perkowitz said he liked Starship Troopers , but criticised its giant insects , saying if you scaled up a real bug to that size it would collapse under its own weight .
He hated The Core , in which a team of scientists travel to the centre of the Earth and detonate a nuclear device to start the planet 's core spinning again .
The Science and Entertainment Exchange is backed by Dustin Hoffman , Harvard psychologist Steven Pinker and Lawrence Kasdan , who wrote the screenplays for The Empire Strikes Back and Raiders of the Lost Ark .
Perkowitz said : " The hope is that it will get better science into film while still making them interesting . "
Most recently , the exchange has advised on the Watchmen movie and the TV series , Heroes .
" I am not offended if they make one big scientific blunder in a given film , " Perkowitz added .
" You can have things move faster than the speed of light if you want .
But after that I would like things developed in a coherent way . "
" If you violate that you are in trouble .
The chances are that the public will pick it up and that is what matters to Hollywood .
The Core did not make money because people understood the science was so out to lunch , " he added .
Ron Howard 's 2009 production of Dan Brown 's Angels and Demons also fared poorly among scientists .
In it , Tom Hanks 's character , Robert Langdon , has to protect the Vatican from being destroyed by an antimatter bomb that is confined in a glass vial by a magnetic field produced by a small battery .
" The amount of antimatter they had was more than we will make in a million years of running a high - energy particle collider , " said Perkowitz .
" You can't contain it using an iPod battery . "
A record number of Pakistani civilians and security forces died in militant violence last year as the country reeled from an onslaught of Taliban suicide bombings that propelled it into the ranks of the world 's most perilous places .
Pakistan saw 3,021 deaths in terrorist attacks in in 2009 , up 48 % on the year before , according to a new report by the Pakistan Institute for Peace Studies ( PIPS ) , an Islamabad - based defence thinktank .
Researchers counted a total of 12,600 violent deaths across the country in 2009 , 14 times more than in 2006 .
At least half of the dead were militants who were killed in US drone strikes or , mostly , sweeping army offensives against their mountain strongholds of Swat and South Waziristan along the Afghan border .
Another 2,000 or so Pakistanis died in bloodshed unrelated to militancy : political clashes , tribal feuds and border skirmishes .
In comparison just over 2,000 civilians were killed in war - torn Afghanistan during the first ten months of 2009 , according to the UN .
In Iraq 4,500 civilians were killed during the year , said Iraq Body Count , an independent monitoring organisation .
The high militant death toll in Pakistan was driven by the army operations , although battlefield casualty figures are notoriously difficult to confirm .
The army dislodged the Taliban from their Swat stronghold but failed to capture the local leader , Maulana Fazlullah , who reportedly slipped into Afghanistan .
In October the army moved into South Waziristan , capturing roads and towns but not the militant leadership , which is thought to have moved into North Waziristan , a hornet 's nest of militancy , where speculation is growing that the army will open a third front .
The army has failed to stop the suicide attacks , which surged by one third to 87 bombings that killed 1,300 people and injured 3,600 .
PIPS researcher Abdul Basit said the militants were using " innovative tactics " such as targeted assassinations , kidnapping and the use of sophisticated bomb materials .
" This year they were more technologically savvy , " he said .
The strife is frazzling public opinion .
A recent Gallup poll found that four - fifths of Pakistanis feel unsafe in public .
" Life has completely changed for everyone , " said Ali Mustafa , a doctor whose best friend was gunned down during a " swarm " attack on a Rawalpindi mosque in December .
The new year started as badly as the last one ended : a Taliban suicide attack on a volleyball match near South Waziristan on January 1 killed over 90 people .
In recent days , Karachi has been wrenched by a spate of politically driven killings , unlinked to Taliban militancy , that have killed about 40 people .
Imtiaz Gul , author of a book on militancy , said that although only a small number of al - Qaida fighters were hiding in Pakistan , the group provided the inspiration for much for the mayhem .
" What we see in this region right now is a fusion of interests and ideologies , " he said .
" Al - Qaida is connecting people . "
The tight bond between homegrown and foreign militants was underscored at the weekend when a video emerged showing the Taliban leader , Hakimullah Mehsud , sitting beside Humam Khalil Abu Mulal al - Balawi , the Jordanian suicide bomber who killed seven CIA operatives at a base in southern Afghanistan on December 30 .
Pakistan has become a magnet for aspiring jihadis across the world , partly thanks to the power of the internet .
Yesterday five young American Muslims went on trial in the eastern city of Sargodha .
They are accused of coming to the country to try and plot terrorist attacks .
The men deny the charges .

Most of us do n’t think much about yellow fever nowadays .
There are still a couple hundred thousand cases , and some 30,000 deaths , each year , but almost none are in the first world .
Out of sight , out of mind .
But this indifference is new .
Until the beginning of the 20th century , yellow fever ran rampant , and was one of the most dreaded of all diseases .
Epidemics of yellow fever in New York , Philadelphia , Memphis , and New Orleans killed tens of thousands .
There ’s a WHO manuscript [ pdf link ] on yellow fever that lists these and many more outbreaks – page after page of fine - print dates and deaths .
Those who have not lived between Cancer and Capricorn can well fail to conceive readily the sensation of numb , chill dreariness which steals on all hearts , when the news spreads , from mouth to mouth , that Yellow Jack has once more come .
… at last it is admitted on the housetops , as well as whispered in the closet , that the deadliest , most awe - inspiring of the plagues of the equatorial regions has obtained admittance within our borders .
–“ Yellow Jack “ , in Cornhill Magazine , 1892
As I noted earlier , Carlos Finlay made the original suggestion that yellow fever was a mosquito - borne disease in 1881 ; in English , in 1886 .
Walter Reed and his team confirmed this in 1900 , and the discovery was seized on at once .
“ Shows the Distribution of the Principal Mosquitoes of New Orleans ” .
Dark squares represent Stegomyia fasciata , the major carrier of yellow fever Yellow fever cases in New Orleans , 1905 .
“ The infected blocks are most numerous in the old , Italian , quarter of the city . ”
( This post was mainly an excuse to post those maps .
Click for larger versions . )
New outbreaks were checked with enthusiastic mosquito control .
In a few days with very little opposition , sixty to seventy thousand cisterns had been screened in order to prevent the breeding of the Stegomyia fasciata .
Mosquito nets became more than ever the rule …
— Yellow Fever Prophylaxis in New Orleans , 1905
The virus itself was was isolated in 1927 and the vaccine , made in 1937 by Max Theiler , turned out to be extremely effective ; but even before that , the understanding that mosquitoes were the carriers allowed great strides in reducing the disease .
Not just in the USA , but throughout the Americas :
Havana and Cuba freed from fever by Gorgas , who organized anti-mosquito measures , 1901 - 1902 ; example followed in Rio de Janeiro and Vera Cruz , 1903 - 1909 ; Panama Canal Zone successfully protected by same methods , 1904 - 1906 … intensive campaign , 1918 - 1919 , under Connor eliminated disease from Guayaquil , the chief endemic centre …

The Pleasure of Finding Things
Out was filmed in 1981 and will delight and inspire anyone who would like to share something of the joys of scientific discovery .
Feynman is a master storyteller , and his tales – about childhood , Los Alamos , or how he won a Nobel Prize – are a vivid and entertaining insight into the mind of a great scientist at work and play .
In this candid interview Feynman touches on a wide array of topics from the beauty of nature to particle physics .
He explains things that are hard to grasp in layman ’s terms much like Carl Sagan did in the cosmos series .
His explanation of the scientific method covers what we know , why we know it and most importantly , what we do n’t know and the pleasure of figuring it out .
While the video quality is less than desirable the content of this program more than makes up for it .
Professor Sir Harry Kroto , Nobel Prize for Chemistry said “ The 1981 Feynman Horizon is the best science program I have ever seen .
This is not just my opinion – it is also the opinion of many of the best scientists that I know who have seen the program …
It should be mandatory viewing for all students whether they be science or arts students . ”
I was beginning to think we ’d never get around to making the CD that Nathaniel Anthony Ayers has been talking about for years .
Last summer , on a trip to San Francisco , where Mr. Ayers was honored for his spirit by the National Alliance on Mental Illness , we came up with the perfect name for it :
“ Putting on Ayers . ”
But when readers and friends asked when it would be available , I had no good answer .
Some days Mr. Ayers is fine ; some days not .
Some days he wants companionship ; other days he needs to be alone .
As for the CD , he ’d back off one day , calling it a terrible idea .
And then he’d be ready to roll the next day .
Finally , a few weeks ago , it all seemed to be coming together .
We had a day booked in a Silver Lake studio .
A pal of his , Joe Russo , had agreed to fly in from Connecticut to record with him .
L.A. Philharmonic pianist Joanne Pearce Martin and violinist Robert Gupta had juggled schedules .
And Michael Balzary , also known as Flea of the band Red Hot Chili Peppers , was eager to join us .
Then , the night before , Mr. Ayers -- a former Juilliard student who was homeless and playing a two - string violin when I met him five years ago -- backed out of the recording session .
“ It ’s not going to happen , ” he said , complaining of an upset stomach that I suspected was caused in part by a case of nerves .
I woke the next day to an urgent message from Mr. Ayers :
He was feeling better and ready to go , and I was relieved I had n’t called off the whole thing .
An hour later , he canceled , and I lost a few more strands of hair .
The other musicians were standing by .
Would Mr. Ayers reconsider ?
OK , he said .
I picked him up on skid row and packed his bass , cello , violin , guitar , trumpet and flute into my car .
He left his viola , French horn , keyboards and trombone in his room , perhaps saving them for his second CD .
On the way to Silver Lake , Mr. Ayers was nervous but game .
He wanted to know how the day would play out , and I reminded him there was no strategy other than for him to jam on as many instruments as he cared to play .
Steven Argila , a pianist and owner of the studio , had met Mr. Ayers before and was ready to go with the flow , and the same was true of Stephen Krause , the recording engineer .
Bass player Flea and drummer Scott Gold , my mate at The Times , beat us to the studio .
I think it ’s fair to say Mr. Ayers had never met anyone named Flea at Juilliard , but musicians are musicians , and they were all playing together before long .
Mr. Ayers was on piano , Flea and Gold backing him up .
Mr. Ayers had a smile on his face , and Flea seemed happy just to be there .
He had begun e-mailing me when I first started writing about Mr. Ayers , telling me he was inspired by the story and would love to play with him if possible .
“ For me , it ’s just having a belief and a faith in the healing power of music , ” Flea said , telling me he could identify with the way music gives Mr. Ayers sanctuary during tough times .
Flea described himself as “ a street urchin ” in his youth , running around L.A. and getting into trouble before music rescued him .
After the success of the Chili Peppers , he set up the Silver Lake Music Conservatory , which has taught music to hundreds of kids , whether or not they can pay .
It was just such a nonprofit , the Music School Settlement in Cleveland , that gave Mr. Ayers his start 45 years ago .
Ayers and Flea have another thing in common :
They are both still students .
Flea studied music theory last year at USC and has been learning piano .
Mr. Ayers started on the bass but ca n’t stop exploring other instruments .
He ’d rather struggle with the viola , say , for the sake of the challenge , than impress on the instrument he ’s mastered .
“ That ’s exciting , ” Flea said , telling me the artistry is in the risk .
Yes , but it makes for mixed results .
Mr. Ayers played violin , cello , bass , piano and trumpet with varying degrees of success .
There were moments of brilliance , with Mr. Ayers swinging on cello and bass , and there were moments that wo n’t make the CD cut .
He ’s got his own sound , for sure , unstructured and sometimes unresolved , manic , lost .
He plays his life , and he plays it in a jazzy , bluesy voice framed by the classical training .
I wonder sometimes if formal treatment , which Mr. Ayers resists , would smooth his expression or remove the soul .
Flea and Argila were wowed by Mr. Ayers ’ rich , haunting tone on trumpet .
And after giving Mr. Ayers an impromptu lesson on violin , Gupta insisted the man ’s got magic fingers .
“ What I notice in him when we play together is a sort of different glint in his eyes ; there ’s a different character , ” Gupta said .
“ It ’s the student at Juilliard , the really brilliant , talented , quick student .
That has n’t gone away . ”
Nor has the dream that whatever instrument he holds in his hands , something is out there and possibly within reach , something pure and magical and uncompromised .
“ Mr. Russo , ” he asked his friend after the recording session , “ do you think I could be good again ? ”

Abstract
We address a longstanding open problem of [ 10 , 9 ] , and present a general transformation that transforms any pointer based data structure to be confluently persistent .
Such transformations for fully persistent data structures are given in [ 10 ] , greatly improving the performance compared to the naive scheme of simply copying the inputs .
Unlike fully persistent data structures , where both the naive scheme and the fully persistent scheme of [ 10 ] are feasible , we show that the naive scheme for confluently persistent data structures is itself infeasible ( requires exponential space and time ) .
Thus , prior to this paper there was no feasible method for implementing confluently persistent data structures at all .
Our methods give an exponential reduction in space and time compared to the naive method , placing confluently persistent data structures in the realm of possibility .

The dreaded shipworm is moving into the Baltic Sea , threatening artefacts of the area 's cultural heritage .
Researchers at the University of Gothenburg , Sweden , suspect that the unfortunate spread is due to climate change , and are currently involved in an EU project to determine which archaeological remains are at risk .
The shipworm is capable of completely destroying large maritime archaeological finds in only 10 years , and while it has avoided the Baltic Sea in the past , since it does not do well in low salinity water , it can now be spotted along both the Danish and German Baltic Sea coasts .
Malmö landmark infested
' The shipworm has for example attacked shipwrecks from the 1300s off the coast of Germany , and we are also starting to see its presence along the Swedish coast , for example at the Ribersborg cold bath house in Malmö , ' says Christin Appelqvist , doctoral student at the Department of Marine Ecology , University of Gothenburg .
Effect of climate change
Appelqvist and her colleagues believe that the development may be due to climate change .
In short , the increased water temperature may help the shipworms to become adapted to lower salinity .
The group is part of the EU project WreckProtect , a cooperative effort to assess which archaeological treasures are at risk .
The project includes researchers from Sweden , Denmark and the Netherlands , as well as experts from France and Germany .
Covering the shipwrecks
One of the objectives is to develop methods to protect the shipwrecks , for example by covering them with geotextile and bottom sediment , and another is to try to predict to which areas the shipworm is likely to spread in the future .
The researchers say there are some 100 000 well - preserved shipwrecks in the Baltic Sea .
' Around 100 wrecks are already infested in the Southern Baltic , but yet it has n't even spread past Falsterbo .
We know it can survive the salinity of the Stockholm archipelago , although it needs water with higher salinity than that to be able to reproduce , ' says Appelqvist .

Russia will finance the work on the Belene nuclear power station project until a strategic investor is chosen .
This is what became clear after the meeting between the energy ministers of Bulgaria and Russia Traycho Traykov and Sergey Shmatko .
And interesting details is that it was this morning that the Bulgarian Energy Holding ( BEH ) published the announcement for a tender to choose a consultant for the Belene project .
Because the finding of a strategic consultant is expected to take between a year and a year and a half , the Bulgarian and the Russian side decided that this should not prevent the work on the project .
This is why Russia will provide funding against which it does not expect anything from Bulgaria - neither a corporate guarantee from the National Electricity Company ( NEC ) nor BEH .
In spite of the insistent questions of the journalists , the Bulgarian energy minister Traycho Traykov refused to comment on a specific scheme of financing , explaining that this is a matter of tools .
He only said that a project company would be established which will build the Belene station .
It is to be decided with what apport Bulgaria is supposed to take part :
" A calculation of the Bulgarian apport should be made - this includes the value of the assets of the construction site and the site itself because it exists and the Bulgarian government has already made it possible such a project to be realised at this particular site , as you know , this is an asset by default and the expenditures are already spent for assets and for consultancy services " .
Minister Traykov explained that with this capital an association would be established and it will be able to use debt financing and to increase its capital up to a specific amount of shares .
He added there were different ways the association to be structured in such a way that the project to become attractive for a strategic investor after the consultant is ready with the tender .
It is expected the consultant to be chosen by mid-June .
To the question what funding the Russian side is willing to provide , the Director General of the Russian state corporation Rosatom Sergey Kirienko replied " as much as it is necessary " .
This caused the indignation of the journalists and Kirienko was forced to specify :
" For 2010 350 -400 mn euro will be necessary for Belene .
This is payment for the next stages of the production of equipment for the station and for direct organisation of the activities at the site .
The financial needs for 2011 depend on the activities in 2010 but are estimated to be around 1 - 1.5 bn euro " .
Rough estimations show that the total amount is around $ 2 bn .
This amount was mentioned as a possible loan from Russia by minister Traycho Traykov on Tuesday after the visit of the Chairman of the Board of Directors of Gazprom Alexey Miller .
This morning , however , the financial minister Simeon Dyankov said in an interview for the Bulgarian National Radio that he would now allow a state loan from Russia for the Belene power station .
And regarding what the Russian side will get against its money , Sergey Kirienko explained that Rosatom was ready to invest part of the money on a temporary basis , which means that the money would be returned by the future strategic investor .
Another part of the money could be invested against shares in a limit , defined by the Bulgarian government , Kirienko said - again without quoting any numbers .
The Russian energy minister Sergey Shmatko specified that at the meeting on Friday all major energy projects between Russia and Bulgaria were discussed .
And underlined that Bulgaria remained the most important and significant partner in the South Stream project .
Later it became clear that during the meeting minister Traykov asked his Russian counterpart about the publications that Bulgaria would be replaced by Romania in South Stream .
Shmatko noted with satisfaction that on Friday the agreements from the 13th session of the Bulgarian - Russian Committee for Economic and Science and Technology Cooperation started to realise .
The session took place in Sofia on December 10th and 11th .
The Russian side is expecting the technical issues to be concluded by the end of March and the necessary decisions to be taken so as practical work could start .
And it is ready to start financing the project in very short terms .
NASA 's Mars Rover has Uncertain Future as Sixth Anniversary Nears
PASADENA , Calif. -- NASA 's Mars rover Spirit will mark six years of unprecedented science exploration and inspiration for the American public on Sunday .
However , the upcoming Martian winter could end the roving career of the beloved , scrappy robot .
Spirit successfully landed on the Red Planet at 8:35 p.m. PST on Jan. 3 , 2004 , and its twin Opportunity arrived at 9:05 p.m. Jan. 24 , 2004 .
The rovers began missions intended to last for three months but which have lasted six Earth years , or 3.2 Mars years .
During this time , Spirit has found evidence of a steamy and violent environment on ancient Mars that was quite different from the wet and acidic past documented by Opportunity , which has been operating successfully as it explores halfway around the planet .
A sand trap and balky wheels are challenges to Spirit 's mobility that could prevent NASA 's rover team from using a key survival strategy for the rover .
The team may not be able to position the robot 's solar panels to tilt toward the sun to collect power for heat to survive the severe Martian winter .
Nine months ago , Spirit 's wheels broke through a crusty surface layer into loose sand hidden underneath .
Efforts to escape this sand trap barely have budged the rover .
The rover 's inability to use all six wheels for driving has worsened the predicament .
Spirit 's right - front wheel quit working in 2006 , and its right - rear wheel stalled a month ago .
Surprisingly , the right - front wheel resumed working , though intermittently .
Drives with four or five operating wheels have produced little progress toward escaping the sand trap .
The latest attempts resulted in the rover sinking deeper in the soil .
" The highest priority for this mission right now is to stay mobile , if that 's possible , " said Steve Squyres of Cornell University in Ithaca , N.Y .
He is principal investigator for the rovers .
If mobility is not possible , the next priority is to improve the rover 's tilt , while Spirit is able to generate enough electricity to turn its wheels .
Spirit is in the southern hemisphere of Mars , where it is autumn , and the amount of daily sunshine available for the solar - powered rover is declining .
This could result in ceasing extraction activities as early as January , depending on the amount of remaining power .
Spirit 's tilt , nearly five degrees toward the south , is unfavorable because the winter sun crosses low in the northern sky .
Unless the tilt can be improved or luck with winds affects the gradual buildup of dust on the solar panels , the amount of sunshine available will continue to decline until May 2010 .
During May , or perhaps earlier , Spirit may not have enough power to remain in operation .
" At the current rate of dust accumulation , solar arrays at zero tilt would provide barely enough energy to run the survival heaters through the Mars winter solstice , " said Jennifer Herman , a rover power engineer at NASA 's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena , Calif .
The team is evaluating strategies for improving the tilt even if Spirit cannot escape the sand trap , such as trying to dig in deeper with the wheels on the north side .
In February , NASA will assess Mars missions , including Spirit , for their potential science versus costs to determine how to distribute limited resources .
Meanwhile , the team is planning additional research about what a stationary Spirit could accomplish as power wanes .
" Spirit could continue significant research right where it is , " said Ray Arvidson of Washington University in St. Louis , deputy principal investigator for the rovers .
" We can study the interior of Mars , monitor the weather and continue examining the interesting deposits uncovered by Spirit 's wheels . "
A study of the planet 's interior would use radio transmissions to measure wobble of the planet 's axis of rotation , which is not feasible with a mobile rover .
That experiment and others might provide more and different findings from a mission that has already far exceeded expectations .
" Long - term change in the spin direction could tell us about the diameter and density of the planet 's core , " said William Folkner of JPL .
He has been developing plans for conducting this experiment with a future , stationary Mars lander .
" Short - period changes could tell us whether the core is liquid or solid , " he said .
In 2004 , Opportunity discovered the first mineralogical evidence that Mars had liquid water .
The rover recently finished a two - year investigation of a half - mile wide crater called Victoria and now is headed toward Endeavor crater , which is approximately seven miles from Victoria and nearly 14 miles across .
Since landing , Opportunity has driven more than 11 miles and returned more than 132,000 images .

Missing e-mails .
As SNL's Church Lady would say , How convenient . . .
I work at the Government Accountability Project , the operative word being " accountability . "
This is n't just a little computer problem .
It 's a systematic pattern and practice of evading justice for some of the worst -- and criminal -- scandals that have tarnished our nation .
For those of you who want to geek out on the criminal basis , see 18 U.S.C. § 2510 ; in particular § 2517 , http://www.law.cornell.edu/....
This disappearing act also violates the Federal Records Act .
Enough is enough .
Is n't it just rich that the Justice Department cannot find critical e-mails , in the most recent example , between the Justice Department 's John Yoo & Co. , CIA and White House about the development of torture policy ?
The Justice Department can borrow my 12 - year - old .
He could probably point them in the right direction .
Or , it can hire a computer forensics expert to recover the missing e-mails , and just as important , expose who deleted them and when .
" Missing e- mails " sounds so innocuous , so accidental ( the sole witness at yesterday 's hearing , Acting Deputy Attorney General Gary Grindler , said the whitewash ethics report " does not suggest there is anything nefarious . " )
But in case anyone needs further evidence of the bad faith here , consider that the Justice Department did n't bother to notify the National Archives -- whose very mission is to collect such information -- before OPR 's ethics report was released last week .
If John Yoo , Alberto Gonzales and countless others have benefited from curiously and mysteriously missing e-mails that document their role in criminal wrongdoing , then there needs to be some independent intervention .
Because all of the bad actors have skated on their actual crimes , we can still give meaning to the old adage that " it 's not the crime , but the cover - up " that will ultimately get them .

I 've just published the source code to a port of Quake to the Android platform .
This is something I did a while ago as a internal test application .
It 's not very useful as a game , because there has n't been any attempt to optimize the controls for the mobile phone .
It 's also awkward to install because the end user has to supply the Quake data files on their own .
Still , I thought people might enjoy seeing a full - sized example of how to write a native code video game for the Android platform .
So there it is , in all its retro glory .
( Porting Quake II or Quake III is left as an exercise for the reader . :-)

LCA : Static analysis with GCC plugins
Did you know ...?
LWN . net is a subscriber - supported publication ; we rely on subscribers to keep the entire operation going .
Please help out by buying a subscription and keeping LWN on the net .
Taras Glek works for Mozilla , but he is not a browser hacker ; instead , he works on GCC and other tools aimed at making the browser development process better .
It is , he says , a good job .
While carrying out his duties , Taras has been able to put a new GCC feature to work in ways which may prove to be useful well beyond Mozilla .
Development tools are important ; they can help us to produce software more quickly and with far fewer problems .
Unfortunately , Taras says , we are stuck in the stone age of software development , using tools from the 1970's .
Our code base is growing , though , to the point that developers often cannot understand the entirety of even a single application .
We need some way to amplify our capabilities so that we can continue to make more powerful applications ; static analysis tools can bring some of those capabilities .
Static analysis , in essence , treats the code as data which is then the subject of further analysis .
It has often been seen as a backwater , an area of primarily academic interest .
When static analysis tools have found their way into more common use , it has generally been in their ability to find certain classes of bugs .
But there 's more that can be done with these tools : finding API abuse , generating library bindings , improved code base visualization , and more .
Static analysis has been put to use with Mozilla to find dead code ; thousands of lines of code have been found to be completely unused , despite the fact that engineers were putting their time into maintaining it .
The Mozilla project has an especially strong need for good tools .
It is a huge code base ( 1.7 million lines of C++ and 1 million lines of JavaScript ) ; humans just do not scale to that amount of code .
This code base is under constant optimization work , so refactorings are frequent .
Without some help , keeping this code in good condition is a major challenge .
Much of Taras 's work seems to be aimed at mitigating some of the pains that come with C++ development .
One of those pains is that the language is just about impossible to parse ; the parser must actually instantiate types before it can complete its job .
So anybody who wants to analyze C++ code must first find a decent parser for it .
The available options are limited .
The LLVM compiler is promising , but it 's going to be another year or two before it 's really ready for prime time .
The Elsa tool can be used , but it 's essentially unmaintained and not really guaranteed to be correct .
The one other option - one which is known to have a complete C++ parser - is GCC .
But the GCC code has a bit of a nasty reputation , so Taras started off using Elsa for his work .
Eventually , though , he turned back to GCC for something more solid , and has n't looked back - the hairiness of GCC has , perhaps , been exaggerated .
But , more to the point , the upcoming GCC 4.5 release is , he says , " the most exciting release ever . "
The reason for that is the long - delayed addition of the plugin API , which became possible once the runtime library license exemption finally went into place .
With this API , analysis code can easily hook into the compiler and inspect code at whatever stage of the process best suits its needs .
Beyond plugins , GCC has a few other features which make it suitable for static analysis work .
The ability to attach attributes to objects in the compiled code makes it easy to pass hints through to later processing steps .
The new pass manager brings a relatively modern structure to a compiler which did not originally have one .
And the GIMPLE intermediate representation provides much of the rest of what 's needed for code which needs to inspect other code .
There are a few interesting plugins in the works .
One of them is the LLVM compiler , which can be plugged in to perform the back - end functions for GCC .
Another is milepost , which uses a brute - force approach to figure out the optimal settings of the command - line flags for a specific body of code .
Then , there are " the hydras , " which are Taras 's work .
These plugins take an interesting approach , in that the actual analysis work is done in JavaScript scripts .
The idea was originally seen as amusing - " would n't it be fun to put Spidermonkey into GCC ? " - but it has actually worked out well .
JavaScript is a relatively nice , concise language which makes it easy to implement the needed capabilities .
The first plugin is Dehydra , so named because the control flow graph in Mozilla somewhat resembles a Hydra monster .
Dehydra produces a JSON - like representation of the objects found in a C++ program ; individual JavaScript scripts can then use this representation to analyze the program .
The Treehydra plugin , instead , provides a JavaScript interface to the GIMPLE representation of the program ; it can be used for more traditional sorts of static analysis tasks .
One of the pains that come with large C++ programs is that simply finding code can be difficult .
It 's not always clear which method will be invoked in a specific situation , even in the absence of things like macro tricks .
To help with this problem , Dehydra has been used as the base of a source browsing tool called DXR ; it 's like LXR , but with a great deal of semantic information thrown in .
DXR users can find types defined by macros , look up parent class information , and so on .
There 's also a call graph tool which can find all the callers of a specific method ; that 's important in C++ , where overloading can make grep thoroughly unusable for this kind of task .
It is , Taras says , " Eclipse - like stuff , " except that , unlike Eclipse , it scales to a Mozilla - size code base .
Various other tools have been written .
The final .js script ( a dozen lines of code which can be seen on this page ) looks for C++ methods tagged with the " final " attribute ; any attempt to override those methods will result in a compilation error .
It is , in other words , a port of the Java final keyword to C ++.
A checker which might be interesting in other environments - including the kernel - is flow .js , which can add a constraint that all exits from a function must flow through a specific label .
Consider this common kernel pattern :
if ( something wrong ) goto out ; /*
Do some real work */ out : release_locks ( ) ; free_memory ( ) ; cancel_self_destruct ( ) return something ;
It 's a common mistake to add a return statement to the middle of a function like this , shorting out the cleanup code ; flow .js can catch errors like that at compile time .
Additional modules include must - override.js , which can mark methods which must be overridden ( but which cannot be virtual ) ; outparams.js , which ensures that any output function parameters have been set on a successful return from the function , and stack.js , which enforces a requirement that specific classes only be instantiated on the stack , since the garbage collector is not prepared to deal with them .
Taras is also working on a checker for variables which shadow class members - a mistake which GCC does not catch now .
For the time being , this work is mostly used within the Mozilla project , though Taras would clearly like to see users from the wider community .
He looks forward to a day when libraries are distributed with a plugin which ensures that the library is being used correctly .
Another nice feature would be a distribution - wide DXR , enabling cross -package source browsing .
For now , though , we have a set of tools that serves as a good proof of the concept that GCC plugins can be used for static analysis .
Editor 's note :
The United States has been granted a freeze on a recent federal ruling that would allow its military recruiters to accept openly gay applicants , keeping in place for now its long - running policy of " Do n't Ask , Don't Tell . "
In February , as part of our Rainbow Planet series investigating gay rights around the world , GlobalPost looked at the policy of foreign militaries and found that most had long allowed gays to serve openly .
BOSTON —
In many corners of the world , the policy on gays in the military could be labeled this way : “ Do n’t Ask , Do n’t Care . ”
In the military establishments of more than 30 countries , including U.S. allies such as Israel , Canada and the United Kingdom , gays and lesbians are allowed to openly serve in their country ’s military .
It ’s just not a big issue out there in much of the Western world .
But here in the U.S. , the long - simmering debate over “ Do n’t Ask , Do n’t Tell ” has heated up after President Barack Obama vowed to repeal it during his State of the Union Address last week .
On Tuesday , the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff , Adm .
Mike Mullen , in a powerful and emotional statement , denounced the policy before the Senate Armed Services Committee .
Now the stage is set for a year - long debate over what is best for the U.S. military and the country it serves .
And it seems the military brass is on the retreat on a policy that needs to be changed because , as Mullen put it , “ It is the right thing to do . ”
Obama could now seek to change the law through legislation or repeal the policy through an executive order .
Advocates for repealing “ Do n’t Ask , Do n’t Tell ” say it is high time for gays to serve their country proudly and openly , and they claim there is no evidence that such a change would be detrimental to the military .
These advocates for changing the 1993 policy add that the U.S. military needs the tens of thousands of gays and lesbians who currently serve and the tens of thousands more who would enlist if they were allowed to do so .
Supporters of the existing policy say it has worked well and that now , while the country is fighting two active wars , is not the time to take on a substantive change in policy that could hurt the military ’s “ preparedness and effectiveness , ” as they like to say in the Pentagon .
They fear such a change could undercut recruitment in an all - volunteer army that is already overstretched .
The deadlocked debate in the U.S. could benefit from lessons about how allowing gays and lesbians to serve openly has worked with many of our allies .
According to military analysts and experts who have studied the issue in Israel , the U.K. and elsewhere , the policy has had little impact on the effectiveness of the military .
There are about 30 countries in the world , including nearly all of the NATO members , as well as South Africa , Brazil and the Philippines , that allow gay and lesbian servicemen and women in the military , according to Aaron Belkin , a political science professor at the University of California , Santa Barbara .
“ In just about all of these countries there is research and anecdotal evidence that illustrates there is no problem , no decrease in cohesion among units , nor a diminishing effectiveness of the troops , ” said Belkin , an expert in the area of civil - military relations whose research has been published in the military publications " International Security " and " Armed Forces and Society . "
In 2000 , Belkin co-authored an exhaustive 44 - page study on Canada , which , after a series of lawsuits in 1991 , changed its policies to allow gays to openly serve in the military .
Belkin ’s study , which at the time was regarded as the most comprehensive academic study of homosexuality in a foreign military ever completed , concluded that the change in policy had “ not led to any change in military performance , unit cohesion , or discipline . ”
The U.S. military walks a fine line on this issue , not outright banning gays in the military , but insisting that their sexual orientation must not be openly discussed .
Under the 1993 policy adopted by President Bill Clinton , service members who remain closeted are allowed to serve , and investigation into a member ’s sexuality without suspicion is prohibited .
It ’s a private matter , in other words .
But any gay or lesbian in the military who refuses to stay silent , seeks to publicly proclaim their orientation or wants to get married , even in states where gay marriage is legal , risks being discharged .
Russia is one of the very few other countries in the world with a blurred line .
In Russia , the policy holds that “ well - adjusted homosexuals ” are permitted to serve in a “ normal capacity . ”
But those alleged to have “ sexual identity problems ” are to be drafted only during wartime .
Most countries in the world , particularly in the Muslim world and in religiously conservative countries in Africa , Asia and most of Latin America , clearly prohibit gays from serving in the military .
There are some 80 countries in the world that still see homosexuality as a crime and a handful that still see it as a crime punishable by death .
Gen . Robert Magnus , who served as assistant commandant of the Marine Corps until his retirement in 2008 , was among the hundreds of retired officers who signed a letter to Obama from the Center for Military Readiness last year warning against a repeal of the policy .
“ We sent the letter to the commander in chief because with this policy we have maintained good order and discipline and we see no grounds to change the law , ” said Magnus .
Magnus said that while he respects other countries , such as Israel and the U.K. , that have allowed gays to openly serve , he does not believe their example informs what is best for the U.S .
In Israel , he pointed out , there is universal conscription for all healthy men and women .
The Israeli military , which adopted its openly gay policy in the early 1990s , is a place where men and women often meet their future spouses and where dating is a common occurrence .
It ’s part of the military culture .
So creating equality for gays could be seen as making sense in that culture , Magnus said .
In the U.S. military , there is no tolerance for either heterosexual or homosexual relationships .
There ’s a policy against any sexual relations in the service .
It ’s not part of the culture , he said .
Similarly , U.S. Army Lt. Col. Robert Maginnis , who has studied the British military system and who was part of the impact study of the U.S. military prior to the 1993 “ Do n’t Ask , Do n’t Tell ” policy , said , “ I love the Brits , but they are very different from the U.S. military .
They have a different culture . ”
Maginnis said that the British army is much smaller at only 100,000 troops compared to the U.S. military , which has an active service of 1.5 million and a reserve force of some 170,000 .
“ The Brits do n’t have the same force and the comparison just does n’t work , ” he said .
“ You have to be globally aware .
There are some practices in other parts of the world which are better than the U.S. military .
And then you have to ask , if we did that would it work within our system ? ” asked Maginnis .
“ When I look around the world , I ’d say America is different , ” said Maginnis .
So in the end is “ Do n’t Ask , Do n’t Tell ” another example of American " exceptionalism , " that , as Maginnis would see it , shows the United States and its armed forces have a higher purpose , a different role in the world ?
Or is it one more example of how we contradict our highest ideals of equality and justice for all in a way that is increasingly evident to so many of our allies ?
The case of Lt. Daniel Choi , an openly gay Iraq war veteran who had to give up his military career last year as a much - needed Arabic language expert after he publicly stated his sexual orientation , defines the debate on a personal level .
“ For me it is not about politics .
This is my life and my platoon and my job , ” he said yesterday , speaking on CNN .
“ We all agree on one thing .
We want our military to be strong and to succeed .
By kicking out valuable members of the force , I do n’t see how we achieve that … .
For me it is simple , people all around the world are asking how come America is n’t ready to do this ? ”

Boycott Christopher Nolan January 11 , 2010
Christopher Nolan .
Here is a director that seems like a talented guy who has it going on .
But few people realize that he is a bully separatist !
I am here to spread the truth about his hatred of Eskimos !
Let ’s take a look at his full filmography so I can explain to you in detail how he has forcefully excluded Eskimos from his movies .
Memento :
There are no Eskimos in the entire movie !
In fact , I did n’t see any nationality other than white !
This is not tolerable !
: There are no Eskimos in the entire movie !
In fact , I did n’t see any nationality other than white !
This is not tolerable !
Insomnia :
There are no Eskimos in this movie and it takes place in Alaska !
He is obviously excluding our brother Eskimos when he wo n’t even put them in an Alaskan movie .
: There are no Eskimos in this movie and it takes place in Alaska !
He is obviously excluding our brother Eskimos when he wo n’t even put them in an Alaskan movie .
Batman Begins : Eskimos ?
Nope .
: Eskimos ?
Nope .
The Prestige :
This movie has whites , chinamen , and an Australian .
But there is not an Eskimo in sight .
: This movie has whites , chinamen , and an Australian .
But there is not an Eskimo in sight .
The Dark Knight : Pretty good movie , but once again he banned Eskimos from the cast .
I am calling from a boycott of all of these movies .
That includes any DVDs or Blu Rays or any other merchandise or theatrical showings .
I am also calling to boycott any further movies he releases until he agrees to work with an Eskimo .
He is scheduled to release a movie called Inception and a movie called The Last Heretic .
Please do not go see these movies and please tell your friends about how bigoted these movies are .
Please help me spread the word of Christopher Nolan ’s anti-Eskimo agenda !
Today is disgusting .
When I woke up in my warm bed this morning I thought , " I am definitely calling in sick . "
But here I am .
Why ?
Because it would violate the rules for getting away with this sort of thing .
Let 's get one thing straight : everyone calls in sick to work when they 're not really sick .
Whether it 's from laziness , hangover , weather - related malaise , or just something you 'd rather be doing than sitting at a blue carpet - lined cube for eight hours pretending to work while you surf the internet , everyone has fudged an illness for a " mental health day . "
This is absolutely nothing to be ashamed of , but it 's still frowned upon by your boss , that uptight prig in HR , and that scary lady in accounting who has n't missed a day in 23 years .
That 's why we 've come up with a set of rules to help you get away with selecting your " sick " day .
May you enjoy it in good health .
Mondays and Fridays Are Off Limits :
This is why we did n't call in today .
Since both days abut the weekend , you 're sending red flags by making the call to freedom on either day .
Friday it seems like you 're trying to get out of town early to go away , and on Monday it looks you partied too hard over the weekend and need an extra day to recover .
You already have a reputation for being a booze hound thanks to your disgraceful behavior at the office Christmas party , so calling in on a Monday is just going to make you look like a full - fledged alcoholic .
Do n't Ever Say You Have Food Poisoning : " Food poisoning " is to office call - outs as " exhaustion " is to celebrity break downs .
Everyone says they feel bad for you , but they do n't buy it for a second .
The downfall of food poisoning is that it really is the perfect excuse because it is random , short - lived , and everyone who eats Chinese food gets it eventually .
That 's why the " some undercooked chicken " line has been used to death .
Instead , go for strep throat .
It comes on just as quickly and it 's contagious so you can use the " I 'm going to the doctor today , but i do n't want to get anyone else sick " approach .
Of course , when you get back to work , it was just a cold .
And , yes , ladies , if you have a male supervisor the " time of the month " trick still works .
Wait for the Second Nice Day :
When we finally reach spring , there is going to be that first day when it 's 65 degrees , the sun is shining , and everyone wants to put on their shorts and take a day off .
Do n't you dare !
Calling in on this day is as obvious as Ted Danson 's toupee .
A bunch of suckers are going to do it anyway , and then you can give them the stink eye and feel superior at the office .
Do n't worry , there will be another 65 - degree day , and once everyone has gotten it out of their system you 'll be able to work on your tan without an ounce of guilt — or crowds at the park .
Use a Big Meeting as Cover : Well , not a career - changing meeting that you 're running , of course , but a big meeting that you should attend but do n't really want to .
That way when you have " kidney stones " ( yeah , you 're going to have to pull out the big guns for this to work ) no one is going to think you 're faking , because if you 're going to miss the meeting , then you must really be ill .
Do n't Waste
It on Snow Days :
When the weather is really nasty , the first response is to behave like an eight - year - old , declare a snow day , and spend all day watching The Price Is Right and sledding in the back yard .
This is a waste .
Instead , use another grammar school trick and take a " 90 - minute delay . "
Call with some drama about how your road is n't plowed yet and take your time getting in .
Once you 're there , you 'll look like a real trouper for braving the elements to get to work .
Then , at the office , everyone is going to be so thrown off by the snow that no real work is going to get done anyway .
Kick off your galoshes , and put your feet up .
Yeah , you had to go in , but you did n't have to do shit .
When the Boss Is Away :
This gambit could go either way .
When your boss is on vacation is really the ideal time to take a day off .
He 's not there to catch you , and little work is getting done .
However , there is little work getting done , so why take the day off ?
Also , if something drastic does happen and you 're not there , then this could really blow up in your face .
Rather than actually calling in sick , make this a " work from home " day .
Yeah , we all know that " work from home " really means loosely monitoring your Blackberry for a catastrophe while inviting over dates from Craigslist , but no one is going to blame you while the fat cat is away .
Never , Ever Use a Sick Day When You 're Actually Sick :
Your sick days are five windows of unexpected freedom from the dim dungeon that is your professional career .
They should be used for couch lounging , pool swimming , bike riding , and general merriment making , not actually holed up with the fever and the sniffles .
Sure , if you get the Swine Flu or something truly debilitating , you 're going to have to stay at home , but otherwise just work through it .
You 're already miserable , you might as well double up and be miserable at work .
Save your sick days for when you can enjoy them !

My thoughts :
Ingredients : 2 pounds boneless pork ribs3 / 4 cup chili sauce ( like Heinz ) 1/ 3 cup blueberry jam * 2 tablespoons balsamic vinegar1 tablespoon mesquite liquid smoke1 teaspoon thick Worcestershire sauce1 tablespoon ginger juice2 teaspoons ground chipotle1 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper1 / 2 teaspoon smoked paprika1 / 2 teaspoon ground jalapen o1 / 4 teaspoons salt1 clove garlic , minced1 shallot , mincedDirections : Rub both sides of the pork with the chipotle , salt and pepper .
Quickly brown on each side in a nonstick skillet .
Place in a ( preferably oval ) 4 quart slow cooker .
In a small bowl , whisk together the remaining ingredients until smooth .
Pour over the ribs .
Cook for 8 hours .
*I used yummy Spoon NYC jam which is just sugar + blueberries and has really true blueberry flavor .
This is a great weeknight meal , you are basically making a simple barbecue sauce ( which can be made ahead and refrigerated overnight ) and pouring it over the meat and then walking away .
The pork stays juicy and the sauce hits that perfect not too sweet with a bit of a kick balance .
I love using jams as a short cut to flavor in quick barbecue sauces , it adds a not too sweet , fruity flavor without a lot of effort or adding sugar .
Not to mention that adding jam helps me use up all of the jams I seem to accumulate / compulsively buy but since I do n't actually eat jam or jelly or preserves on toast or bread or whatever people eat jam on I end up with piles and piles of them , unopened and wasting their potential .
I tasked myself with finding alternative uses for them and found that barbecue sauces were a surprisingly good fit .
Jam is especially great in the slow cooker because one of the potentially tricky bits associated with slow cooker is that nothing evaporates while cooking , so you need ingredients that will add some moisture / flavor but that wo n't give off so much liquid things become soup or need to be reduced .
You can drain off sauces and reduce them in a pan but that sort of defeats the one pot , ready - to - eat charm of the slow cooker .
Jam is thick enough that it does n't really water anything down but provides much needed moisture .
And you should believe me because I , um , wrote the book on slow cooking .
( How long have I been waiting to make that joke ? )
Owen Van Natta made waves when he became MySpace CEO in April 2009 after having previously served as a high - ranking exec at Facebook .
But his effort to revitalize the once top social network has come to an end tonight after less than 10 months on the job , as Van Natta has resigned from MySpace , effective immediately .
Here 's the statement we just received from the company :
" News Corporation today announced that Owen Van Natta will step down from his position as MySpace CEO , effective immediately .
Mr. Van Natta will be replaced by newly - elevated co-Presidents Mike Jones and Jason Hirschhorn , who will each report to Jon Miller , Chairman and CEO of Digital Media for News Corporation .
All three executives joined MySpace in April 2009 , with Mr. Jones and Mr. Hirschhorn previously serving as Chief Operating Officer and Chief Product Officer , respectively . "
Needless to say , this news does n't look good for MySpace , who continues to fall further behind Facebook as it tries to reinvent itself as an entertainment destination .
The company has also undergone significant job cuts and restructuring — in June of last year , MySpace laid off 30 percent of its staff at Van Natta 's behest .
The search is on for a family to live in Australia 's first ever smart home .

An electric car is an added bonus .
The NSW government wants a family to live in the house rent free for a year , while keeping a blog on the pros and cons of the home .
Advertisements by Sydney Water and Energy Australia are asking for applications from people who are experienced writers , but do n't specify what kind of writing .
Photoshop has been a part of every web designer ’s life since they picked up their first mouse .
On February 10th , 2010 , Photoshop turns twenty .
To mark this anniversary , we ’ve come up with an article that takes you through the evolution of Photoshop from its modest beginnings as a bundled program sold with scanners to its current version .
For each version and major feature listed , we could n’t help but think “ did Photoshop ever exist without that feature ? ” .
Some of the minor details are fun too , such as the one - liner Easter Eggs that Photoshop developers hid in some versions and the fact that the most current versions of Adobe Photoshop CS are equipped with anti-counterfeiting measures for multiple world currencies .
Please join us in thanking the Knolls and Adobe for making all of our lives more awesome , every day .
Photoshop : Origins
One of the most impressive things about the company is the fact that one gifted family , consisting of an engineering prof , a PHD engineering student , and a talented special effects whiz working at Industrial Light and Magic came up with the core idea of Photoshop .
Thomas Knoll , the PHD student , is still heavily involved with Photoshop years later .
Glen Knoll was a college professor with two sons and two hobbies ; computers and photography .
He had a darkroom in his basement , and an Apple II Plus that he was allowed to bring home from work .
Thomas Knoll adopted his father ’s photography habit throughout high school , while his brother , John Knoll , purchased one of the first Macs available to the public .
Fast forward to 1987 : Thomas Knoll was a PHD student studying Engineering at the University of Michigan .
His brother was working at Industrial Light and Magic .
Thomas Knoll wrote a subroutine for a program to translate monochrome images on his monitor to grayscale .
The successful subroutine led Knoll to create more and very soon he had a number of processes for achieving photographic effects on digital images .
After his brother John saw what Thomas was doing , he recommended that Thomas turn what he was doing into a full - featured image editor .
The combination of Thomas ’ programming abilities with John ’s pragmatic design background led to a collaboration between the two brothers to develop more processes and improve on the initial application .
Even though the process led to interruption in Thomas ’ thesis work , the brothers released “ Image Pro ” in 1988 .
John suggested that they begin to sell Image Pro as an application .
Within six months , the brothers had a partnership with a company that manufactured scanners , Barneyscan .
They purchased 200 copies of the program to ship with their scanners .
They called on Supermac and Aldus , but were turned away at both , a move that Aldus would come to seriously regret .
Shortly after , the Knoll brothers struck gold when they won over Adobe management with their product , and formed a licensing partnership with Adobe that was to launch their software and Adobe into the stratosphere .
In February of 1990 , Adobe 1.0 was released .
This video , shot in January of 2010 , is a great interview with John Knoll about the early days of Photoshop :
Photoshop Through the Years ; Version Changes
We ’ve included major changes within each version and some minor ones .
This is meant to be a fun stroll down memory lane rather than a complete version catalogue .
If you have a particular version change that got your hackles up or a feature that you ’d to mention , feel free to add it to the comments section .
1990 – Photoshop 1.0
John Knoll , Thomas ’ brother , wrote “ special effects ” for the program which were frowned upon by Adobe staff as being too “ gimmicky ” .
Thomas and John found a way to sneak them into Photoshop as plugins , giving rise to what is now a huge cottage industry in add - ons to the popular program .
John and Adobe staff constantly pushed Thomas to make improvements until the final product shipped .
The first version of the Photoshop splash screen features just four Photoshop programmers .
In subsequent versions , more and more names are added to the list .
In more recent versions , a limited number of Adobe VIP ’s appear in the splash screen .
1991 – Photoshop 2.0
Photoshop 2.0 included the Path feature , which allowed users to trim around an object easily and to save that path for future use .
This feature was added by a second engineer , Mark Hamburg , that Adobe hired to work on the application .
Up until 2.0 , Thomas Knoll was the only engineer working on it .
Adobe called Mark the “ Path Man ” .
2.0 also featured rasterizing for Illustrator files , support for CMYK colour which led to widespread Photoshop adoption by the printing industry , and the Pen .
Photoshop 2.0 also required 4 megabytes of RAM to run rather than 2 , which really helped program stability .
Photoshop 2.5 , released in 1992 , was notable for being the first release for the Windows operating systems .
The code had to be completely changed in order to accomplish this goal which meant that the first effort was slow going .
16 - bit file support and palettes were added to this version as well .
The initial Windows release had a “ memory bug ” , a bug which actually saw Mark Hamburg offer to make house calls .
The patched version was released as 2.5.1 .
Filters got their own menu in 2.5 as well .
The workspace shot below is of Photoshop 2.5 for the Mac .
1994 – Photoshop 3.0
The big story for Adobe Photoshop 3.0 was layers .
Layers were and are a lifesaver for any marginally complex design .
Prior to their introduction , designers would save different versions of designs so that they could go back and grab them if needed ; layers made this practice redundant .
Layers are individual slices of the image that go together to make the final “ sandwich ” of the image .
Different images , such as those used in the image above in the 3.0 splash screen , are assigned their own layers , making it easy to work on those images without tampering with other areas of the image .
Thomas Knoll , the original creator of the program , was responsible for their development .
Other engineers made improvements in the program ’s performance with Power Mac chips and bringing the Windows version up to the same level as the Mac version .
Tabbed palettes also had their debut in 3.0 .
Adobe engineers included Adobe Transient Witticisms ( ATW ) with this version .
They were little Easter Egg funny one - liners that would appear only when you pressed obscure combinations of keys .
1996 – Photoshop 4.0
Adjustment layers and macros were the two most notable features of Photoshop 4.0 .
Adjustment layers allow the designer to apply one effect to a group of layers .
Macros , or actions in Photoshop speak , allow you to map a series of commands to one command .
This allows you to perform the same operation in much less time if you have a bunch of images to work on .
The most important change to 4.0 was the unification of the user interface with other Adobe products , a feature which Adobe has stayed consistent with right up to present - day incarnations of the program .
This meant a less steep learning curve for Adobe products , a blessing for those who got their start with Photoshop 4.0 .
Loyal users of Photoshop were not amused with the redesign , the common question from the community being “ Why did you break Photoshop ? ” .
1998 – Photoshop 5.0
The two most important features released with 5.0 were editable type and the ability to undo actions multiple times in the “ History ” palette .
Previous versions of Photoshop allowed text to be added , but the fuzzy rasterized type did n’t make for pretty magazine mastheads or decent web menus .
This was a huge step forward .
Multiple undos via the History palette were very helpful , especially since designers were starting to use the new Adobe tools for increasingly complex designs .
Color Management made its debut with 5.0 .
Like other major changes to Photoshop , it was greeted with equal parts of praise and condemnation .
It allowed colors to be managed natively within the application rather than relying on third - party tools that had been used , a huge improvement .
However , it also automatically converted the colors when opening files , a “ feature ” that engineers quickly eliminated after multiple user complaints .
The magnetic lasso tool debuted in 5.0 , making selecting areas of an image to work on much easier .
1999 – Photoshop 5.5
Photoshop 5.5 featured the huge time saver , “ Save For Web ” .
This feature allows those who choose it to save the image in a preset specifically designed for web use which allows the user to adjust image quality to achieve a smaller image .
Version 5.0 had failed to take the Web into account with all of its other major feature changes on the table .
It was also bundled with ImageReady , a standalone program that was purpose - built to edit web graphics .
Most of the features of ImageReady were later incorporated into the full version of Photoshop and the idea of a simpler program was reborn eventually in the form of Photoshop Elements .
2000 – Photoshop 6.0
The layer styles panel made working with layers even easier in Photoshop 6 .
Vector shapes were also added in this release ; the ability to draw vector shapes such as arrows into a bitmap was lauded by users .
There was also a new custom shapes palette that allowed the user to draw using vector shapes rather than just using lines .
Text could also now be typed directly onto a picture , rather than being typed first into a text box .
Multi-layer functions made their first appearance with version 6.0 .
The Blending Options dialogue was also introduced which made blending various elements of an image much easier .
6.0 separated the crop tool from the marquee tool , making it that much easier to get to this commonly used command .
2001 – Photoshop Elements
With the increasing complexity of the tools available to users , Photoshop was risking losing a significant market share that did n’t understand or need some of its more advanced tools .
In order to combat this , they released Photoshop Elements in 2001 .
The new product was a success , and designers continue to recommend it to clients for simple image resizing and other non-design tasks .
While its current interface , shown below , is n’t intuitive for those trained in traditional Photoshop , it is highly usable and labeled clearly for the average user .
If there are any problems with it in terms of functionality , the simple answer is to upgrade to the full - featured Photoshop .
2002 – Photoshop 7.0
Version 7.0 introduced the healing brush and text that was fully vector - based .
More importantly to veteran users , it introduced a new file browser that let designers easily pore through folders to find the graphics that they wanted .
Files within a folder could be renamed using Batch Rename , plus a bunch of other helpful commands that made working with a high volume of files much easier .
Workspaces could also be created and saved , allowing you to save your file locations and groups for future use .
The brush palette also featured a number of changes , including the new healing brush tool , patch tool , and the ability to create custom brushes .
Spell check and a find / replace feature rounded out the updates to the text tool .
A number of enhancements were also included for web use , including the addition of rollover effects for images and a web gallery feature .
One of the most important upgrades was under the hood ; 7.0 was optimized for use with Mac OS X , virtually eliminating crashes in the middle of working on large files .
The tool presets palette let users program presets for commonly performed tasks , increasing efficiency .
2003 – Photoshop CS
Photoshop CS was the first to employ the CDS ( counterfeit deterrence system ) which recognized and refused to allow duplication of paper currency .
Scripting support for various web languages , including JavaScript , was also new to this release .
Layer groups were introduced with this version , which allowed various layers to be grouped together for effects to be applied to some and not others .
Improvements to the File Browser made images easier to work with , and the 16 - bit and better large file support made CS much easier to work with for designers who constantly worked with larger images and photographers .
2005 – Photoshop CS2
The red eye removal tool , previously exclusive to Elements , was popular enough to make an appearance in the core version of Photoshop .
Smudging options and the ability to select multiple layers also added to the functionality of Photoshop .
The Vanishing Point tool allowed users to edit images in perspective .
The largest moment of panic when upgrading to PS2 came for most when they tried to find the Paint Bucket tool , which had been classified under the Gradient tool .
There were other significant changes to the UI that prompted one writer to put out this “ Where ’s My Stuff ? ” column .
Layers and the layers palette were other areas of note .
The “ links ” column was removed because CS2 included a link button rather than the small chains beside each layer .
The “ Smart Object ” feature was introduced , which allows the user to scale a layer up without significant loss of quality .
2007 – Photoshop CS3
A faster load was probably the most noticeable feature of this 2007 release .
It included fine tuning to a number of its existing tools rather than focusing on new ones .
The most notable new feature was graphic optimization for mobile devices , a feature which many web designers focusing on mobile design were thankful for .
This version also saw significant feature updates to Adobe Camera RAW , a Quick Select tool , alterations to core commands like Brightness and Contrast and Black and White conversion .
CS3 shipped in Standard and Extended editions .
The Extended version was intended for high end video and scientific users .
Improved performance for Intel - based Macs significantly improved the speed of Photoshop , while Windows users also enjoyed performance upgrades .
The new Quick Selection tool put the rest of the selection tools in Photoshop to shame with easy object selection with one or two strokes .
Cloning became easier in CS3 with the birth of the Clone Source palette which increased the options available to the Clone Stamp tool in an easily accessible palette .
2008 – Photoshop CS4
The smoother pan and zoom allowed for fast drill down on the areas of an image that you wanted to look at .
Prior to this , there was a lag time of a few seconds ( depending on your system ) if you wanted to zoom in or out on an image .
The Masks and Adjustments panel was added , making working with masks easier .
CS 4 also dealt with edges on masks more effectively .
Colour correction took a huge step forward with this release .
The user interface was significantly simplified in CS4 .
The support of tabbed documents made it much easier to use and the main tools were added to the title bar for easier access .
Quick access for common actions was made available in the panel area .
Where Are The Knolls Now ?
Thomas Knoll
Thomas was the lead developer of Photoshop right up until CS 4 .
He now leads up the Camera Raw plugin for Photoshop , which allows Photoshop to develop a smooth handshake between different models of camera raw image formats .
John Knoll
John is still employed by Industrial Light and Magic as a Visual Effects Supervisor .
He was the Visual Effects Supervisors for the recent efforts on the first three Star Wars prequel films .
He also supervised work on two Star Trek movies , Star Trek episodes , and the Pirates of the Caribbean movies .
Glenn Knoll
Their father is a teacher at the University of Michigan in the Engineering Department .
Let ’s all get together to wish Photoshop a Happy Birthday !

How has Photoshop impacted your design career over the years ?
Share your experiences and let us know which version you first cut your teeth on .
Alan Saunders :
Hi , this is The Philosopher 's Zone , I'm Alan Saunders and let 's take a walk with Albert Einstein .
In the 1930s , Einstein bought a house in Princeton and from there he would walk every day to and from his office at the Institute of Advanced Studies , along with the great logician Kurt Gödel .
Nobody knows what they talked about but Einstein later said that he came to the Institute merely to have the privilege of walking home with Gödel .
So who was this man with whom Einstein was so keen to chew the fat ?
He was a logician who proved a number of surprising results , most significantly his celebrated incompleteness theorem which tells us that there are parts of mathematics that traditional methods of proof cannot access .
To tell us about that , here 's Mark Colyvan , Professor of Philosophy at the University of Sydney and Director of the Sydney Centre for the Foundations of Science .
Mark Colyvan : I think he's one of the great logicians ; I think he belongs right up there with Aristotle , Descartes , but just in general philosophy , in mathematics , I think he ranks in any one of those areas ; he was someone who did bridge across both mathematics and logic and philosophy .
I think he stands as one of the greats in any of those three areas .
Alan Saunders : Let 's start at the end .
He died in 1978 .
How did he die ?
Mark Colyvan :
He basically died of malnutrition .
He degenerated physically and no doubt mentally as well .
Alan Saunders :
He was in Princeton at the time , and it was n't as though there was a famine in Princeton in the United States , so this was a willed death in some way , was n't it ?
Mark Colyvan :
Yes , that 's right .
It 's hard to know exactly what went on , but he certainly was n't in full possession of his cognitive faculties at the time , and he just let himself go , as it were .
I think the accepted view is that he did basically an act of slow suicide .
Alan Saunders :
And actually if we 're talking about fundamental issues like that , we should say that he was a believer in God , was n't he ?
I do n't know that he was a believer in orthodox religions , but he certainly believed in God and worked on proofs of the existence of God .
Mark Colyvan :
Yes , that 's right .
He 's famous for the couple of results , the completeness theorems but he is so amazing a polymath , you know , he played around with proofs of existence of God , he made major contributions within mainstream mathematics .
Alan Saunders :
But his proof of the existence of God was a version of the famous ontological proof from the Middle Ages of St Anselm which basically says
God is a being greater than which nothing can be conceived .
Therefore God must exist , because if you conceive
God is not existing , then you 're conceiving something that is less than the greatest being that could be conceived , therefore it is necessary that God exists .
And he actually developed a highly mathematical version of that , did n't he ?
Mark Colyvan :
That 's right .
It was a very strange proof for someone who worked in set theory of all places , because you do n't get existence that cheaply in set theory , you can't just define the set of all sets for instance .
Alan Saunders :
Let 's just pause for a moment , because we 're sort of on the cusp , as it were , of mathematics and logic here , and let 's just pause to ask what logic is for .
Logic does n't actually tell you the truth , that 's not what it 's for , is it ?
Mark Colyvan : No .
No , logic is about inference if you like , it 's about consequence .
So when someone gives you an argument , whether it be an editorial in a newspaper , or a philosophy class or a mathematics class , or whatever , when someone says , ' Such - and - such plus such - and - such , therefore ... something else ' , they 're making an inference , they 're claiming that the conclusion follows from what went before , let 's call them the premises .
And logic is about that relationship .
It does n't tell you that the premises are true , because for instance all pigs can fly , Percy is a pig , therefore Percy can fly , that 's a valid inference , that 's for a logician , as good as it gets , but of course one of the premises is false , so it does n't tell you that the premises are true , and therefore that conclusion is true , it 's just about the relations between the premises and the conclusion .
Alan Saunders :
And mathematical logic is essentially the same thing but carried to a higher or more complex level .
Mark Colyvan :
That 's right .
So mathematical logic is just fleshing out that basic idea but using quite a bit of mathematical machinery to do it .
And the other side of it is using that mathematical machinery to understand the logic within mathematics itself .
Because mathematicians do a great deal of this kind of work , drawing conclusions from premises .
Alan Saunders :
When Gödel was a young man in the early 20th century , the foundations of mathematics were in crisis .
What was the nature of that crisis and what did it have to do with logic ?
Mark Colyvan : A couple of sources for the crisis I think .
Perhaps most serious was that ( in ) a very famous letter to the mathematician and logician , Frege , Bertrand Russell wrote that he'd found a contradiction in his formalisation of this mathematics of set theory .
And it turns out it very generalisable , although Russell was particularly interested in a contradiction he'd found in this formalisation that Frege had run with , one of the foundation mathematical sciences of set theory .
It turns out it 's perfectly general , so Russell had shown that there was a liar - like paradox .
Alan Saunders : Let 's back up a bit here .
And first of all , look at what set theory is .
Now a set essentially is just a collection of things is n't it ?
I mean you can have a set of socks , a set of pens , a set of anything really .
Mark Colyvan :
That 's right .
So it 's just a way that you collect things together , not necessarily physically , so in mathematics there will be a set which is my right big toe and the Eiffel tower , that 's a set .
So you can just collect things together in this formal sense .
And the thing that 's collected together it 's important to note , is a set , it 's not the things in the set .
So the set of people in this room is not a person , it 's a set .
Alan Saunders : OK .
Now Frege is working on the foundation of mathematics , and in order to do that , he 's actually asking very fundamental questions .
What is the number two ?
for example .
And he decides that a number is a set , does n't he ?
Mark Colyvan :
That 's right .
Yes , he 's asking these very fundamental questions , so fundamental in fact that many of the mathematicians at the time just did n't get what he was on about .
He was worrying about what the number two is , whereas most mathematicians were worried about all sorts of fancy infinities .
And Frege thought , well no wonder you can't understand all of these fancy infinitives .
We do n't even know what two is , so let 's get a grip on that .
So his proposal was that two is a bunch of sets that have two things in them .
Alan Saunders :
So we have a way independent of counting from one to two , we have a way of determining that there are two things in this set ?
Mark Colyvan : Yes .
So typically if you want to say that two sets have the same size , so if you want to say that you 've got seven people in the room and you want to say that the number of things in that set is the same as the number of things in the set of days of the week for instance , you typically would count both , notice that they both had seven , and then say that they 're the same .
But you can do it without counting .
So for instance , in a large theatre , you can note that there are the same number of people as there are chairs by just simply noting that no - one is standing and all the chairs are full , you do n't have to actually do the counting , you can pair them up .
And so this was an insight that was around at the time , and certainly Frege 's idea was to pursue this , that it 's about one - to - one correspondence as a mathematician would put it .
Alan Saunders : OK , so there 's Frege doing this in Germany , and then he gets this letter from his English colleague , Bertrand Russell .
What does Russell have to tell him , and why is it bad news ?
Mark Colyvan :
He points out that there is a paradox in the set theory , and without going into the details of the actual set theory paradox , the basic idea is very similar to the liar paradox , which was well - known to philosophers , which is simply a sentence that says of itself that it 's not true .
So if I say to you now ' I am lying right now ' , that sentence turns out to be paradoxical .
If it 's true , it 's false , if it 's false , then it 's true .
Alan Saunders : Because if what you say is true , then it must be false , because you 've just asserted the falsity of what you 're saying .
And if it 's false , given that you 've asserted the falsity of what you 're saying , it must be true .
So we go back and forth .
Mark Colyvan :
So it 's paradoxical .
What Russell did , he'd been thinking about such things for far too long to be healthy , I think , and he realised that you could construct these things in other mediums , if you like , and so he constructed a set theoretical analogue of this , and again , we do n't need to go into the details , but it really is just the same kind of trick , this liar - like paradox to be found in Russell in the Frege system .
And although the letter was directed to Frege and to Frege 's system , the paradox is perfectly generalisable .
You can construct such a paradox in any of the set theories of the time .
Well that was the really big crisis .
It looked like mathematics itself was inconsistent .
Alan Saunders :
Let 's just look at the way in which it works in set theory .
Russell assumes that you can make sets of anything , and you can make sets of sets .
You can bung sets together and have bigger sets .
And he assumes that there must be ... some sets are members of themselves , and some are not .
So the set of all short words it 's itself a short word .
Short is a short word .
The set of all French words , well French is not a French word , so that 's not a member of itself .
And he says then Well if some sets are members of themselves and some are not , what about the set of all sets , which are not members of themselves .
Is that a member of itself , or is it not .
And you get exactly the same paradox , do n't you , because the qualifications for being a member of the set are that you 're not a member of yourself , therefore if it 's a member of itself , it can't be a member of itself and if it's not a member of itself , then it is .
So it 's exactly the same sort of , as philosopher 's say , ' self - referential paradox ' .
Mark Colyvan :
That 's right , yes .
So that was the basic idea .
It came from thinking about the liar and just a very , very clever move , to see that the liar paradox was n't just about truth , which is what the standard story was , but to see that there 's a set theoretic analogue of it , and that was devastating for foundations of mathematics , because it looked like the best mathematics of the day was in fact inconsistent .
Alan Saunders :
In his autobiography , Bertrand Russell says it seemed really , really silly to be worried by this .
This was just a sort of child 's game , and I was - I do n't know whether we need to believe his autobiography but what he says is ' I spent months and months and months puzzling over this , over what seemed such a silly problem . '
Why was it perceived by him to be such a big problem , and by Frege to be such a big problem , and was it really that big a problem ?
Mark Colyvan : I think that it was .
There is a sense in which it is this little trick , indeed I called it a trick a moment ago , I did n't mean to trivialise it by that , but there is a sense in which this is a kind of trick .
Once you 've seen how to construct liar paradoxes , you can see them all over the place and you can instruct them .
But as you said in the opening , mathematics is supposed to be this bastion of rigour and truth , and here right in the heart of mathematics is a contradiction .
So here is one reason why it 's so serious , because from the Russell set , I mean the Russell set is a perfectly well - formed set of standard set theory , the so - called naïve set theory , and the fact that that set is both a member of itself and not , from that you can prove just about anything using classical logic .
In fact you can prove that one equals two starting from the Russell set .
That 's strikes me as bad .
Alan Saunders :
It 's at this stage that David Hilbert enters the story .
Who was he and what did he have to say ?
Mark Colyvan : Well Hilbert was one of the , if not the leading mathematician of the early part of the 20th century , an absolute major figure .
Alan Saunders :
He was German , was n't he ?
Mark Colyvan : German , that 's right .
And he took this very seriously as well .
I think Russell 's comments about it not being that serious , I think were later in life when he was worried about other things , but it should be said Russell himself spent decades on something that he later thought was silly , but Hilbert thought it was very serious as well .
And he was intent on finding rigorous foundations for mathematics , and set about trying to get a systematic story about what mathematics was about .
And part of that story was that he required a finite consistency proof of mathematics .
That is , he wanted to prove consistency of mathematics , but it had to be done by finatory means .
That actually does n't really worry us too much for the purpose of getting to Gödel 's theorem , but he did require this consistency proof of the certain portion of mathematics .
Alan Saunders : so what we 're looking for here is consistency and we 're looking for completeness .
In other words , we want a system in which everything that is true can be proved , that 's your completeness , and nothing can be proved that is n't true .
That 's your consistency .
Mark Colyvan : Yes .
Perhaps a little bit more stringently : consistency is you do n't want to be able to prove something and its negation , you do n't really want to prove that two plus two equals four , and that it does n't as well .
Alan Saunders : OK .
So we know what we want , and now Gödel comes on the scene with his first theorem , which as you 've said , he actually arrives at a very early age .
What does he have to say and what does it have to do with the paradoxes that troubled Russell ?
Mark Colyvan :
Well it connects up with paradoxes in two ways .
One of which was Gödel had also spent far too much time thinking about the liar paradox to be healthy , and realised that this trick could be used to actually motivate some positive results as well .
So in a way , what Russell did was generate an analogue of the liar paradox in set theory .
What Gödel did was to realise that you can use this same kind of trick , this self - reference trick , things that talk about themselves , to show that if you like there are kind of blind spots in mathematics .
So the first theorem , first incompleteness theorem of Gödel 's says that there will be mathematical sentences that will not be provable within a particular axiomatic system of mathematics , if that system is consistent .
So if you 've got a consistent system , it will have blind spots , if you like .
Alan Saunders :
So in the original liar paradox , I 'm saying what I am now telling you is false , and that 's paradoxical .
With Gödel , what I 'm saying is , This cannot be proved , and that 's paradoxical .
Mark Colyvan : Yes .
So with a very clever technique which is often brushed over because it's mere technicalities , but it 's actually quite complex technicalities , but by this little process , he is able to encode these sentences in mathematics .
So effectively it 's a sentence of mathematics that says of itself that it's not provable , and again , just go through the familiar liar reasoning that you went through earlier , you see that if it 's provable then it's not , and if it 's not , then it is .
You can't prove that sentence within the mathematical system .
So there 's an example of if you like to think of it as a blind spot .
Alan Saunders : Given what Hilbert was after , he wants a mathematical system that is consistent and complete , this is problematic for Hilbert , but it 's not a disaster , is it ?
Mark Colyvan :
No , that 's right .
It 's a problem with the completeness , it means that Hilbert 's hope of being able to get all the true sentences out in a kind of algorithmical sort of way by just deriving them within the system , it looks like that 's going to have some limitations .
That 's what the first theorem effectively tells us .
There will be some sentences in the system , moreover recognisably true ( we 'll get to this perhaps later , the consequences of Gödel 's theorem ) but the sentence that I am not provable , it 's recognisably true from someone outside the system , as it were .
So there 's a truth of mathematics that 's not provable within mathematics .
So it looks like Hilbert 's hope of getting access to all the truths in mathematics via this formulaic computational method was not going to work .
Alan Saunders :
But unfortunately for Hilbert , Gödel had something else up his sleeve , has n't he , he 's got his second theorem .
Mark Colyvan :
That 's right , so the second incompleteness theorem says if you like informally one of the blind spots is a consistency of the system itself .
So you can only prove the consistency of the system if in fact the system 's inconsistent .
That 's one way of putting the second incompleteness theorem .
So no formal system , that 's rich enough to embed the mathematics that we want is able to prove its own consistency .
Alan Saunders : Let 's look further at the significance of this .
For something that might not have been too much of a problem in Gödel 's time but certainly is in ours : the computer .
Now the computer is a system for cranking out axiomatic proofs .
How is that affected by what Gödel has to say ?
Mark Colyvan :
Well there 's his very tempting thought .
It 's been put forward by a number of people : the philosopher Lucas and physicist Roger Penrose , have advanced a thesis along these lines .
And the basic idea is very seductive .
The thought is that in a sense what Gödel has shown is that these formal systems have blind spots , if you like .
Let 's keep it in those terms .
There are things that these things can't prove , including they can't prove their own consistency .
And yet a human can see the truth and recognise the truth of the sentence that says that it 's not derivable , not provable .
So there 's a sense in which the system is blind to the truth of that , but a human is not .
It 's a very tempting thought then to say ' Aha !
Here 's something that humans can do that machines cannot do even in principle , that a human can recognise a sense of the so - called Gödel sentence , but a machine can not do that . '
I actually think that that 's misguided , but it 's worth sort of pausing on it for a moment , just to reflect on how tempting that thought is .
It does seem to be a natural extension of Gödel 's incompleteness theorems .
Alan Saunders :
Well it does reflect on whether this has consequences for our understanding of the human mind , and I suppose one immediate thing you want to say is that if it's a trade - off between consistency and completeness , well in those circumstances , I do n't really care .
Almost certainly completeness is n't going to trouble me very much in my daily life .
Consistency possibly rather more , but I 'll have one or the other , I 'll have whatever 's going , and that 's the way the mind works .
Mark Colyvan :
It 's one of those fascinating , I think mistakes .
I 'm inclined to call it a mistake in philosophy that he 's been incredibly fruitful .
I mean there are some mistakes that are just a straight - out mistake and as soon as someone points out the mistake that 's the end of it , and the person who made the mistake has egg on their face .
But this is not one of those cases .
I think it 's led to all sorts of interesting responses .
I think there are a number of ways you can come at this Penrose / Lucas argument .
So one response is , as you say , Well where 's the surprise ?
Humans do n't worry about completeness in fact , and I do n't think they worry about consistency , excepting locally : I do n't want to sell you that I 'm in Ultimo right now and I 'm not in Ultimo .
But if one reflects upon your overall system of beliefs of course there 'll be inconsistencies in that system of beliefs .
And so we really do n't care about consistency all that much either , it would seem .
But I think there 's actually a more fundamental way in which these arguments fail and that 's just simply that what the theorem says is that there 'll be a blind spot that 's peculiar to that system .
It does n't say that it 's a blind spot full - stop .
It 's a little like the idea that there 'll be sort of blind spots or trouble spots if you like in your belief system that wo n't be problems for me , and vice versa .
So for instance , physically you can say this , but it 's deeply paradoxical for you to say the following : ' We 're in Ultimo , but I do n't believe it . '
But I can say of you , I can say ' We 're in Ultimo , but Alan does n't believe it . '
And you can say it of me , so there 's a sort of blind spot for you , but not for someone else .
That does n't mean that somehow or other my mind works differently from yours , or whatever , it 's just each system has these little blind spots .
And so in a way , what Gödel 's theorem shows is there are these blind spots , and someone who tries to make too much out of the fact that some other system , i.e. a human mind , can see the truth of these blind spots that the mathematics can't , I think is missing the slipperiness if you like of these blind spots .
Everybody has them and they slide around .

Advocates argue that a soda tax would reduce consumption and pay for anti-obesity campaigns .
In an opinion piece in The New England Journal of Medicine last year , Dr. Brownell and Thomas R. Frieden , the director of the C.D.C. and former New York City health commissioner , estimated that in New York State alone a penny - per - ounce soda tax would raise $ 1.2 billion annually .
Small excise taxes on soda are already in place in Arkansas , Tennessee , Virginia , Washington and West Virginia , and Chicago imposes a 3 percent retail tax on soft drinks .
Soda taxes were proposed in at least 12 other states in 2009 , though none were approved .
Mississippi is considering legislation that would tax the syrup used to sweeten soda ; the mayor of Philadelphia is weighing a tax on soda and other sugar - sweetened drinks , and Gov. David Paterson of New York recommend a penny - per - ounce tax on sugared beverages in his proposed state budget last month .
The penny - per - ounce tax , favored by Dr. Brownell and others , would produce a significant increase in retail costs : the 12 - pack of Coke on sale for $ 2.99 would go for $ 4.43 and a 75 - cent can would rise to 87 cents .
These increases , Dr. Brownell estimates , would reduce the annual per capita consumption of soda by more than 11 gallons , to 38.5 gallons .
“ And the revenue , ” he says , “ could be used to subsidize fruits and vegetables , fund obesity prevention programs for children and home economic classes in schools , and more . ”
The model , clearly , is tobacco .
Dr. Frieden , who promoted a soda tax when he was a health commissioner , sees further parallels between soda and tobacco :
“ There are aspects of the food industry that are reminiscent of tobacco — the sowing of doubt where there ’s no reasonable doubt , funding of front groups , use of so - called experts , claims that new products which are safer for consumers are available , and the claim that they are not marketing to children . ”
The public war against tobacco has worked , if imperfectly : Americans smoke at half the rate they once did , half of all smokers have quit , and the tobacco companies finance strong antismoking campaigns .
In the case of tobacco , the health risks of smoking were clear .
But the beverage industry contends that science does not back up the assertion that childhood obesity is even partly caused by soda consumption , and has sought to make the discussion about personal choice and freedom .
“ Soda has calories , and food with calories causes people to put on weight when consumed in excess , ” says J. Justin Wilson a self - described “ libertarian consumer advocate ” and senior research analyst for the Center for Consumer Freedom , an industry - sponsored advocacy group .
“ But there is no unique link between soda and obesity . ”
Besides , says Ms. Neely , the industry is taking measures : “ The beverage industry supports real solutions to obesity and continues to step up to do its part .
We ’ve removed full - calorie soft drinks from schools across the country and , in support of Mrs. Obama ’s initiative , will place the full calories for our products on the front of our containers . ”
Charlton Heston starring as Moses in " The Ten Commandements " , 1956 film by Cecil B. DeMille .
The rationale for formally designating Israel a Jewish state – as Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu now demands [ 1 ] – rests on three religious - political pillars :
God ’s purported covenant with Moses instructing the ancient Israelites to conquer the land , the injustice of the Roman - era Diaspora that supposedly removed them centuries later , and the brutal persecution of European Jews in the Holocaust .
Yet , the first two of these pillars appear to be based on almost no historical reality , the stuff of legend and possibly even lies that crumble under any serious scrutiny .
Normally , such ancient stories might be regarded as harmless tales that some people treasure as part of their Judeo - Christian faiths , except that Netanyahu ’s new demand means that these myths now threaten peace in the Middle East and conceivably could push the modern world into more bloody warfare .
Therefore , they must be given fresh examination .
Ironically , it was the Nazis ’ drive to exterminate European Jews during World War II that is the one pillar founded on historical reality , although some extreme enemies of Israel insist on making Holocaust denial a central feature of their attacks .
Also , some adversaries , like Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad , have argued that it is unfair to make the Palestinians pay for a crime against humanity committed by the Germans . [ 2 ]
Yet , the Holocaust is not in historical dispute .
That horrible reality – an industrial - style extermination campaign that also targeted Gypsies , homosexuals and Communists – was proven after the World War II from a multitude of Nazi records , photographs and eyewitness accounts .
It is the tales of Moses from the Torah ( or the first five books of the Old Testament ) and the legend of the Roman Diaspora that lack serious historical underpinnings .
The Diaspora myth has been addressed in a new book by Israeli historian Shlomo Sand [ 3 ] , When and How Was the Jewish People Invented ? [ 4 ]
It debunks the notion that Rome removed the Jewish people en masse from the Holy Land in the First and Second Centuries A.D. and scattered them across Europe .
Instead , most East European Jews appear to be descendents of converts , principally from the Kingdom of the Khazars in eastern Russia , who embraced Judaism in the Eighth Century , A.D.
The descendants of the Khazars then were driven from their native lands by invasions and – through migration – created the Jewish populations of Eastern Europe .
Thus , Sand argues , many of today ’s Israelis who emigrated from Europe after World War II have little or no genealogical connection to the land .
According to Sand , a bitter irony of Israel ’s founding may be that it displaced Palestinians who could be the actual descendants of the ancient Israelites , who stayed on the land and eventually converted to Islam .
Other descendants of those ancient Israelites maintained Judaism as a strong presence in the Middle East , both in Palestine and in successful communities from Egypt to Iraq and Iran .
These Jews faced few religious pressures until after Israel was founded in 1948 , when this new European intrusion into Islamic lands was viewed in the context of the Crusades a millennium ago .
The Moses Myth
Yet , while questioning the Diaspora myth is a sensitive topic for many Israelis and their supporters around the world , it is even touchier to challenge the Biblical claim that God , through Moses , struck a covenant with the Israelites to conquer the land and possess it for all time .
Because the Torah is sacred to Jews – and to many Christians as the revealed word of God in the Old Testament – it has been dangerous to examine the factual history behind these texts in an objective manner .
For centuries , the Catholic Church and some Protestant faiths persecuted anyone who questioned Moses ’s supposed authorship of the chapters even though their internal contradictions and the description of Moses ’s death at the end of Deuteronomy made that long - held belief untenable .
As Richard Elliott Friedman recounts in his 1987 book , Who Wrote the Bible ? , “ Religious opposition to the new investigation ( into the traditional belief about Moses ’s authorship ) persisted during the 19th Century ” and did n’t collapse until 1943 when Pope Pius XII “ encouraged scholars to pursue knowledge about the biblical writers . ”
Modern Biblical scholars now agree that Moses was not the author of the Torah , that the stories were passed down orally from the 14th Century B.C. and were put into writing centuries later .
But the legendary figure of Moses has remained almost beyond criticism , not only for many Jews but for people of the Christian and Islamic faiths .
( He is treated as a holy messenger in the Koran . )
Many Americans think of Moses as the angry but righteous leader as portrayed by Charlton Heston in the 1956 epic “ The Ten Commandments ” , or they think of their feel - good Bible studies as children .
Yet , many archaeologists believe that the Moses stories were largely made up .
“ This is what archaeologists have learned from their excavations in the Land of Israel : the Israelites were never in Egypt , did not wander in the desert , did not conquer the land in a military campaign and did not pass it on to the 12 tribes of Israel , ” summed up Professor Ze ’ev Herzog , director of the Institute of Archaeology at Tel Aviv University .
“ The many Egyptian documents that we have make no mention of the Israelites ’ presence in Egypt and are also silent about the events of the Exodus . ”
However , other scholars believe that some did emigrate to Egypt , suffered in servitude there , and may have been led back to Canaan by Moses or a Moses - like leader .
Nevertheless , because of the powerful influence of the Torah ( and the Old Testament ) , the biblical Moses carries extraordinary religious and historical weight , inspiring Israeli settlers to claim Palestinian lands as rightfully theirs and rallying fundamentalist Christians across the American heartland to embrace whatever actions the Israelis take .
A Tyrannical Leader
But who was Moses ?
According to biblical lore , Moses was a Hebrew child raised in the royal Egyptian court before breaking with his protectors and remaking himself into a leader of Hebrew slaves .
He guided them out of Egypt and transformed them , as they wandered for decades in the Sinai desert , into an Israelite nation , giving them specific laws and detailed rules of behavior .
During that time , Moses announced a covenant with God that granted the Israelites permanent dominion over the lands across the Jordan River , and he instructed them to destroy other peoples inhabiting those territories .
Moses , however , never returned to the Promised Land , dying near the Jordan , before the conquest began .
Though Moses is regarded by many as a great law giver ( the Ten Commandants ) and as a major force in the formation of monotheism ( the belief in one God ) , the text of the Torah present him as a cruel and tyrannical leader .
From a modern perspective , Moses might be viewed as a “ dictator who killed his own people ” when they disobeyed him and an advocate of genocide against outsiders .
His claims that he spoke with the Lord sound more like a megalomaniac who believed he could scare a primitive people into following his orders by claiming they were edicts from God .
Indeed , over the centuries , many tyrants have used religion ( especially monotheism ) to justify repression and to eliminate enemies and rivals .
The religious wars in Europe during the Middle Ages are a classic example of how kings and popes wrapped their personal power in the bloody cloak of religion , torturing and burning alive “ heretics ” who would n’t submit .
The biblical Moses appears to have been such a tyrant , though the Sunday school version often played down this extreme side of his personality .
In Exodus , for instance , there is the famous story of the Israelites , creating a visible idol of their God in the form of a golden calf while Moses is absent on Mount Sinai .
When Moses returns with stone tablets conveying laws of behavior , he is furious and smashes the tablets .
According to the Torah , Moses then grinds up the golden calf , mixes it with water and makes the Israelites drink it .
Then , Moses recruits what we would today call a “ death squad . ”
The Torah reads : “ Moses stood at the gate of the camp and said , ‘ Whoever is for the Lord , to me ! ’
And the Levites gathered round him .
And he said to them , ‘ Thus said the Lord God of Israel , “ Put every man his sword on his thigh , and cross over and back from gate to gate in the camp , and each man kill his brother and each man his fellow and each man his kin ” ’
And the Levites did according to the word of Moses , and about three thousand men of the people fell on that day . ”
In other words , Moses ordered a massacre of Israelites whom he regarded as his enemies , people who had challenged his authority in the form of dancing around the golden calf .
Robert Alter in his 2004 book , The Five Books of Moses , comments on Moses ’s instruction : “ each man kill his brother , ” etc .
“ This chilling command enjoins the sword - wielding Levites to show no mercy to friend or kin , ” Alter wrote .
“ The figure of three thousand dead in the next verse indicates that this is not an indiscriminate massacre but an assault on the ringleaders – or perhaps , those guilty of the most egregious excesses – among the orgiasts . ”
Higher Authority
It also seemed that whenever Moses was setting some rule , whether as grand as the Ten Commandants or as minor as personal hygiene , he always invoked the Almighty .
In Leviticus , for instance , God supposedly takes a direct interest in dictating how women should be treated after childbirth , with one set of rules for giving birth to sons and another for daughters .
According to this account , the Lord tell Moses , “ Speak to the Israelites , saying ‘ Should a woman quicken with seed and bear a male , she shall be unclean seven days , as in the days of her menstrual unwellness she shall be unclean .
And on the eighth day , the flesh of his foreskin shall be circumcised .
And thirty days and three she shall stay in her blood purity .
She shall touch no consecrated thing nor shall she come into the sanctuary till the days of her purity are completed .
“ And if she bears a female , she shall be unclean two weeks , as in her menstruation , and sixty days and six she shall stay over her blood purity .
And when the days of her purity are completed , whether for a son or for a daughter , she shall bring a yearling lamb for a burnt offering and a young pigeon or a turtledove for an offense offering to the entrance of the Tent of Meeting , to the priest .
And he shall bring it forward before the Lord and atone for her , and she shall be clean from the flowing of her blood . ”
If you think that ’s a lot of unnecessary detail , you should read the Lord ’s instructions via Moses for how to assess whether a boil is leprosy or not .
In Deuteronomy , Moses explains to the Israelites about their right to reclaim the land of their forefathers , again speaking for God :
“ And the Lord your God shall bring you to the land that your fathers took hold of , and you shall take hold of it , and He shall do well with you and make you more multitudinous than your fathers . ”
Moses also makes clear that God expected the conquest to include massacres and genocide .
Again speaking for the Lord , Moses said :
“ I will bring back vengeance on My foes and My enemies I will requite .
I will make My shafts drunk with blood , and My sword will eat up flesh from the blood of the fallen and captive , from the flesh of the long - haired foe . ”
In his final blessing to the Israelites , Moses makes the genocide message even more explicit , painfully so .
He called on them to “ smash the loins of [ the Lord ’s ] foes , that His enemies rise no more .
…
Your enemies cower before you and you on their backs will tread . ”
So , more than 3,000 years later , should a modern state like Israel be demanding that Palestinians recognize Israel as an explicitly Jewish state , as Netanyahu now says ?
The Diaspora Myth
The second pillar – the Roman Diaspora – also comes from ancient times though not as far back as the stories of Moses .
If anything , however , the Diaspora has less of a historical basis .
In When and How Was the Jewish People Invented ?
Dr. Sand , an expert on European history at the University of Tel Aviv , says the Jews were never exiled en masse from the Holy Land and that the myth of the Diaspora was used by Zionists over the past century to buttress their argument for creating Israel .
Sand , a European Jew born in 1946 to Holocaust survivors in Austria , argues that until the Zionist movement arose , Jews thought of themselves as Jews because they shared a common religion , not because they possessed a direct lineage to the ancient tribes of Israel .
However , at the turn of the 20th Century , Sand asserts , Zionist Jews began assembling a national history to justify creation of a Jewish state by inventing the idea that Jews existed as a people separate from their religion and that they had primogeniture over the territory that had become known as Palestine .
The Zionist movement also invented the idea that Jews living in exile were obligated to return to the Promised Land , a concept that had been foreign to Judaism , Sand states .
If Sand ’s thesis is correct – and it has faced no substantive rebuttal – it would suggest that many of the Palestinian Arabs have a far more substantial claim to the lands of Israel than do many European Jews who arrived there asserting a God - given claim .
Indeed , Sand theorizes that many Jews , who remained in Judea after Roman legions crushed the last uprising in 136 A.D. , eventually converted to Christianity or Islam , meaning that the Palestinians who have been crowded into Gaza or concentrated in the West Bank might be direct descendants of Jews from the Roman era .
In his book – and in an interview with Haaretz about his book [ 5 ] – Sand challenged the myth that the Romans relocated the Jews by force to Europe .
In the interview , he said :
" I started looking in research studies about the exile from the land - a constitutive event in Jewish history , almost like the Holocaust .
But to my astonishment I discovered that it has no literature .
The reason is that no one exiled the people of the country .
“ The Romans did not exile peoples and they could not have done so even if they had wanted to .
They did not have trains and trucks to deport entire populations .
That kind of logistics did not exist until the 20th Century .
From this , in effect , the whole book was born : in the realization that Judaic society was not dispersed and was not exiled . "
The True Descendants
Asked if he was saying that the true descendants of the inhabitants of the Kingdom of Judah are the Palestinians , Sand responded :
" No population remains pure over a period of thousands of years .
But the chances that the Palestinians are descendants of the ancient Judaic people are much greater than the chances that you or I are its descendents .
“ The first Zionists , up until the Arab Revolt 1936 - 1939 , knew that there had been no exiling , and that the Palestinians were descended from the inhabitants of the land .
They knew that farmers do n’t leave until they are expelled .
Palestinian farmer : early 20th century .
“ Even Yitzhak Ben - Zvi , the second president of the State of Israel , wrote in 1929 that , ’ the vast majority of the peasant farmers do not have their origins in the Arab conquerors , but rather , before then , in the Jewish farmers who were numerous and a majority in the building of the land . ’ "
Criticism of Sand ’s book has focused mostly on his credentials as an expert on European history , not ancient Middle Eastern history , a point that Sand readily acknowledges .
One critic , Israel Bartal , dean of humanities at the Hebrew University , attacked Sand ’s credentials , but disagreed mostly over Sand ’s assertion that the Diaspora story was created as an intentional myth by Zionists seeking to fabricate a direct genealogical connection between many of the world ’s Jews and Israel .
“ Although the myth of an exile from the Jewish homeland ( Palestine ) does exist in popular Israeli culture , it is negligible in serious Jewish historical discussions , ” Bartal wrote in the newspaper Haaretz .
“ Important groups in the Jewish national movement expressed reservations regarding this myth or denied it completely . ”
In other words , Bartal is not so much disputing Sand ’s historical claims about the Diaspora or the origins of Eastern European Jews , as he is contesting Sand ’s notion that Zionists concocted a false history for a cynical political purpose .
But there can be no doubt that the story of the Diaspora has played a key role in the founding of Israel and that the appeal of this powerful narrative has helped generate sympathy around the world , especially in the United States .
" After being forcibly exiled from their land , the people remained faithful to it throughout their Dispersion and never ceased to pray and hope for their return to it and for the restoration in it of their political freedom , " reads the preamble to the Israeli Declaration of Independence .
As recently as Israeli ’s bombardment of Gaza [ 6 ] in January 2009 , the myth of the Diaspora was used to justify the slaughter of some 1,400 Palestinians dead , including many children and other non-combatants .
When the Israeli government investigated alleged war crimes by its army , Israeli troops testified that extremist Rabbis had proclaimed the invasion a holy war .
The troops said the Rabbis brought them booklets and articles declaring : “ We are the Jewish people .
We came to this land by a miracle .
God brought us back to this land , and now we need to fight to expel the non-Jews who are interfering with our conquest of this holy land . ”
Today , with the emergence of a new Likud - led government in Israel , the Diaspora myth and Moses legends are intruding again on the prospects for finally achieving peace between the Israelis and the Palestinians .
Prime Minister Netanyahu has insisted on a new precondition for talks – that the Palestinians must agree to a “ public , binding and unequivocal ” recognition that Israel is “ the nation state of the Jewish people , ” [ 7 ] not simply the nation state of the people of Israel .
Netanyahu is making this demand although Arabs make up about 20 percent of Israel ’s population .
This appears to be another case of ancient bloody myths contributing to a modern bloody reality .
CIRCUMCISION is making a comeback as a new generation of parents arm themselves with medical research to justify their decision .
The rate of circumcision for baby boys in NSW rose from 13 per cent in 1999 to 18 per cent last year , according to Medicare figures .
It 's a long way from the 1950s when boys were routinely circumcised but Sydney paediatric surgeon Dr Anthony Dilley predicts the rate will keep rising .
This is despite NSW Health banning circumcisions from public hospitals in 2006 , except in cases of medical emergency .
" By the time today 's baby boys are in kindergarten , it will be 30 per cent , " Dr Dilley said .
Dr Dilley said parents were asking for circumcision because they thought it would benefit their child – " to look like dad " , be more hygienic and reduce risk of disease – rather than for cultural or religious reasons .
" My own gut feeling is that there are parents who did n't get it done 20 or 30 years ago because they were bullied out of it , " Dr Dilley said .
" Most parents now do n't stand for being told : ' Do n't do it . '
They will do their own research . "
Microsoft 's latest version of Internet Explorer ( IE ) is a hit but Google 's Chrome has been steadily gaining ground on the Web browsing software , according to industry figures released Tuesday .
Chrome 's share of the browser market rose from 1.62 percent in March of last year to 5.22 percent last month , according to Net Application trend data .
During the same period , Internet Explorer 's piece of the Web browser market dropped from 68.46 percent to 62.12 percent , Net Application reported .
The percentage of people using Safari browser software tailored for Apple 's Macintosh computers went from 3.63 percent in March of last year to 4.53 percent in January .
" I think what Microsoft is seeing is that when people upgrade from IE 6 they do n't necessarily go to IE 8 , " said Net Application spokesman Vince Vizzaccaro .
Search giants Google and Yahoo have joined the Australian Library and Information Association and Inspire Foundation to create a coalition of online interests to lobby against Rudd Government plans to filter the internet .
Called the Safer Internet Group , the coalition is urging Government to adjust its internet filter plans , saying the scheme 's present design is ineffective and puts at risk the benefits of a free flow of information .
Coalition members also argue the scope of the content to be filtered is too broad .
Filtering all Refused Classification content - which the legislation is intended to do - could block content that has strong social or educational value .
" The Australian Library and Information Association has a responsibility to the Australian community to protect the free flow of information for all , " ALIA executive director Sue Hutley said with the release of the coalitions Core Principles for Effective Action for a Safer Internet paper .
The group says peer - reviewed research on the issue found the most effective way to protect kids on the internet was through a combination of education and policing , coupled with technical measures that rely on ISPs , police and governments working together .
On technical measures the coalition says if governments can achieve the broad aims of these child safety policies through cooperation and partnerships with the industry , and by focusing on a clearly defined and narrow band of child sexual abuse material .
" As a large proportion of child sexual abuse content is not found on public websites , but in chat - rooms or peer - to - peer networks , we know the proposed filtering regime will not effectively protect children from this objectionable material , " the Safer Internet Group coalition statement says .
" In fact , the policy may give parents a ' false sense of security ' encouraging them to reduce their supervision . "
The coalition also voices concern about the technical requirements of filtering and it broader impact on high volume parts of the internet .
Specifically it points to the Enex TestLabs report on the filtering trials carried out by Government , which said " in situations where there is a potential for very high traffic sites , such as YouTube , to have pages on the filtering list , this could result in significantly higher traffic rates passing through the filter , even though the specific pages being accessed are not those on the blacklist . "
" This could cause additional load on the filtering infrastructure and subsequent performance bottlenecks . "

Cannabis clubs – where users flout the law by meeting to smoke and buy the Class C drug – may soon open nationwide .
Next month founding members of New Zealand 's first cannabis connoisseurs ' club , Auckland 's Daktory , plan to meet fellow users throughout the country to help set - up Daktories in other cities .
" We have demand from virtually every city in the country , " Daktory founder Dakta Green told Sunday News .
" I would expect to see in the next 12 months Daktories in every major city in this country , every city should have at least one - 2010 is the year people within our culture are demanding changes throughout the world . "
Auckland 's Daktory , in New Lynn , plans to offer " degrees in Daktology " later this year – formalised study on all aspects of the cannabis industry including hands - on cultivation techniques .
For the first two - and - a - half months the Daktory was open cannabis was sold from the venue , and at one point almost 20 different strands of cannabis were available .
That was stopped , not by police , but by demand Green said : " It got too popular and too busy . "
Cannabis is again for sale from the Daktory , as it's planned to be at all newly established cannabis clubs .
The Daktory 's nationwide plans follow more than a year of hassle - free law - breaking by club members .
In the 14 months since the Daktory opened – in November 2008 – there had n't been a single police raid on their Delta St premises until Sunday News asked questions of police this week .
Police national headquarters refused to comment , as did Waitakere police , but yesterday four police cars swooped on the Daktory .
Officers executed a search warrant and Daktory members said they confiscated lighting equipment and lap - top computers .
Detective Rhys Wilson would n't comment on what police had seized , but said a number of exhibits had been taken and police had a considerable amount of work to do at the address .
Police charged one man with cultivating cannabis and further charges against him were likely , Wilson said .
The Daktory boasts more than 2000 members who pay a monthly fee to smoke ( mainly , their own cannabis ) within the club 's spacious warehouse .
Members , whose names remain confidential , must be at least 18 and sign up for a year 's membership .
Green , 59 , said the oldest club - member was " in their late 70s " , and that doctors , lawyers , court officials and business people were among the membership .
Schoolteachers were most highly represented , he said .
Green , who changed his name from Ken Morgan by Deed Poll , runs the Daktory .
He holds the company shares in trust , but plans to turn ownership over to a community trust in the near future .
That model is planned to be replicated nationwide : " We are a model for that to happen " .
Dad - of - three Green , who is also a Norml – The National Organisation for the Reform of Marijuana Laws – board member wants cannabis legalised .
The Daktory , like Norml 's aptly named Mary Jane bus which is parked there , is a protest vehicle .
" We wish to legalise cannabis , but we also wish to live like it 's legal , " Green said .
" So in my home [ Green lives at the Daktory ] we have a motto `live like it 's legal ' .
We just think it 's wrong and there 's no reason to continue with serious criminality of something that is as relatively harmless as cannabis . "
And Green and his members certainly `live like it's legal ' at the Daktory .
Next to one coffee table , cannabis spotting knives sit on an element , a gas bottle connected beneath .
Plastic bongs , bucket bongs and cannabis smoking pipes are scattered about .
When Sunday News toured the premises this week , more than a dozen cannabis plants were being grown on a sunny window - sill and two others under a heat lamp , in a metallic , heat - reflecting box , locked off from the lounge area .
In Green 's upstairs kitchen , half a dozen cannabis bongs – plastic , metal and glass , small and large – were scattered about and White Rhino strand cannabis buds were present in a glass container .
Under the Misuse of Drug Act 1975 possession of cannabis is punishable by three months ' jail and or a fine of up to $ 500 and possession for supply and cultivation of cannabis is punishable by up to seven years ' jail .
Possessing cannabis utensils is also illegal .
Last month , when asked about the Daktory , New Lynn sergeant Grant Watson said police 's position on cannabis was quite clear – it 's illegal .
" It does n't matter where you are , in a private dwelling or anywhere , smoking and possessing cannabis is an offence against the Misuse of Drugs Act and carries a fine and / or a term of imprisonment , " he said .
Before busting the Daktory yesterday , police had targeted motorists leaving the Daktory during the new year period .
Green took issue with this because " it 's a waste of police resources " and he believes that type of policing is illegal .
" I refuse to be subjected to arrest , harassment by police and imprisonment because I am part of a culture that celebrates and glorifies cannabis for people within our culture , " he said .
To prove Daktory members were being `harassed " , on January 2 , Green drove around the block from his home with a Daktory member filming from the back seat .
Green said his plan " worked beautifully " .
In a video , now posted on You Tube , and proudly shown to Sunday News , Green is pulled over almost immediately by police .
After showing officers his licence he is soon let go – free of charge .
The stunt does n't mean Green is against new legislation making it illegal for motorists to drive under the influence of drugs .
Daktory members are advised to have a sober drive and to rest between smoking and driving .
Members " farewell me with clear eyes " , Green said .
Earlier this week , before the raid , Green said he was n't surprised the Daktory had n't been shutdown by authorities .
" It 's my house and I 've been told by police in the past , `do n't smoke in public , smoke in private and we will leave you alone ' . "
Green 's issue with cannabis laws ' are that ordinary people are being locked up for using a substance " scientifically proven to be less dangerous than alcohol and cigarettes " .
He said cannabis was part of popular culture and " the fact that everybody is doing it is a damn good reason to stop locking a few of us up " .
Norml claims someone is arrested on cannabis - related charges every 37 minutes in New Zealand , some 15,000 annually .
Green also wants to see the cannabis industry " out of the hands of what are criminals by definition , and put in the hands of the community where it can be properly controlled . "
He said at the moment the black - market cannabis trade was " out of control " .
The Daktory , Green said , was a " safe haven " for users and ensured they were n't put in danger while trying to buy cannabis .
Despite championing cannabis law reform , Green – who also pushed for Saturday trading and in the 1980s ran a casino on a boat beyond police jurisdiction – does n't advocate cannabis use .
He was against it until age 40 .
" Cannabis is not for everyone .
I do n't advocate to anyone to take it up , but I do advocate that cannabis is not a dangerous product . "
" Very few over - indulge " in cannabis at the Daktory – it's more coffee - shop than nightclub in that respect , Green said .
Visitors to the Daktory – open Wednesday to Sunday – could expect to see people : " Sitting around enjoying a quiet chat and a quiet toke , perhaps listening to the music , and generally relaxing .
It 's a very laxed out place , " Green explained , quick to dispel beliefs it was a " stoners club " .
The Daktory is a comfortable venue , like a recreation - centre .
There are dozens of couches , armchairs and coffee tables spread around an open - plan space .
Coffee is available – food is planned – and there 's a pool , fus and a table tennis table plus a projector screen , a library – which includes a copy of Shakespeare 's complete works – and music .
President Obama 's administration revealed its new budget Monday , and it increases funding for nearly all areas of science .
The largest raise went to the National Institutes of Health , which added $ 1 billion dollars to an already hefty budget .
With the boost , the NIH would receive $ 32.1 billion in total funding .
Only the Centers for Disease Control would receive less money than last year , although the cut is small .
NASA , the Department of Energy 's Office of Science , and the National Science Foundation , as well as smaller research efforts at the National Institute for Standards and Technology and Department of Agriculture , would also get bumps .
Of course , Obama 's current budget is just a proposal .
It still has to make it through Congress and some of his moves – like scrapping the Constellation program mission to the moon – could face heavy opposition .
If approved , the increases would come in addition to the funding for science handed out by the stimulus package , which the Obama administration has often referred to as the " largest single boost in scientific research in history . "

CAMP TAJI , Iraq —
One night in mid-January , a shift in the wind sent a sudden flurry of white flakes into a detainee internment facility guarded by soldiers from Houston 's 72nd Infantry Brigade Combat Team .
The Texas Army National Guard troops were n't witnessing a rare Baghdad snowfall .
The flakes drifting from the pitch - dark sky were ash and bits of charred trash belched from an open - air burn pit about 100 yards from the outer walls of the internment facility .
Operated by Houston - based contractor KBR , the pit consumes 120 tons of garbage a day here at Camp Taji , a U.S. military base north of Baghdad .
On calm days , noxious smoke billows upward and dissipates into a smog - like haze .
When the wind blows , the acrid - smelling fumes pour into towers and yards where about 800 Texas troops from the 72nd keep watch .
“ It hovers over like a blanket , ” said Sgt. 1st Class Kevin Ethier , 36 , of Montgomery .
“ After it rains , you 'll get puddles of stuff .
It 's like a yellowish , brackish color .
It looks metallic .
It 's just disgusting . ”
Soldiers say a fine layer of soot settles on their uniforms and black goop comes out when they blow their noses .
They complain of migraines , breathing problems , coughs , sore throats , irritated eyes and skin rashes .
The Texas Guard troops are n't the first to report problems from exposure to burn pits at U.S. military bases across Iraq and Afghanistan .
Forty - three pending federal lawsuits allege that KBR and other contractors working for the U.S. military poisoned workers and soldiers alike by incinerating toxic waste in improperly supervised burn pits .
The suits have been consolidated in a Maryland federal district court .
Houston - based Halliburton and a Turkish contractor frequently are named as co-defendants , documents show .
However , a Halliburton spokeswoman said the company has “ no responsibility ” for burn pit operations and should be dismissed from the litigation .
KBR denies blame
The cases feature more than 300 plaintiffs — and the family members of a dozen dead workers and soldiers — all of whom say they were harmed by improper burning of waste by wartime contractors or the military at 20 sites in Iraq and one in Afghanistan .
At least nine people say they were sickened by the burn pit at Camp Taji .
KBR officials told the Houston Chronicle that their company was involved in operating only 10 of the sites named in the lawsuits .
Mark Lowes , vice president of litigation for KBR , said the company disputes that any burn pit directly harmed the health of soldiers or others , saying litigants have failed to prove exposure to burn pits caused the many symptoms they later reported suffering .
While KBR continues to operate 12 burn pits in Iraq — including Camp Taji's — and one in Afghanistan , the company said it does not decide where to locate them or what items to burn .
“ KBR operates burn pits in accordance with guidelines approved by the Army , ” the company said .
“ Further , it is the Army that also decides where on base to locate the living and working facilities for base personnel . ”
More than 100 people have complained about a massive burn pit a few kilometers north of Taji at Iraq 's Joint Base Balad — including allegations that lithium batteries and human body parts were incinerated there , according to lawsuits filed against KBR and others in Houston , San Antonio and elsewhere .
KBR repeatedly has denied operating the pit , though it recently got a multimillion dollar contract to replace pits at Balad with four huge incinerators .
Sgt. 1st Class El “ Kevin ” Sar , who considers Houston his hometown , said he did two tours of duty at Balad in 2006 and 2007 and developed migraine headaches , shortness of breath and chronic insomnia .
Sar said he ended up being evacuated because of a recurring lung infection .
Sar , 41 , remains abroad on active duty as a U.S. Army solider , but said he continues to take medication for chronic lung problems doctors have blamed on toxic exposure .
“ I can't run anymore .
I still cough and once in a while I feel chest pain and regurgitate mucus , ” said Sar , one of 18 Texas - based victims named in a burn pit lawsuit originally filed in San Antonio .
In that case , othersoldiers from San Antonio , San Marcos and smaller cities also complained exposure to burn pits caused them health problems , including acute abdominal pains , chronic respiratory infections , burning sensations in the lungs , a tumor and persistent cold - like symptoms .
David McMenomy of Lampasas and Steve Wayne Palmer of Forney complained of health problems suffered after being stationed at Camp Taji .
McMenomy developed a football - size tumor that was removed from his hip .
Soldiers doubtful
Military officials acknowledge that burn pit smoke causes acute short - term health effects in some people — such as irritated eyes and coughing — but the long - term effects are less clear .
A Navy Health Research Center study that evaluated 40,000 service members found a 30 percent increase in complaints immediately after deployments , but no increase in respiratory conditions such as asthma or bronchitis two years later , said Col. Timothy Mallon , a physician assigned to U.S. Forces - Iraq .
Texas soldiers at Taji are reluctant to believe that exposure to the burn pit wo n't cause them long - term harm .
“ You ca n't start your day without a splitting headache , ” said Staff Sgt. Charles Bloom , 31 , of Sugar Land .
Staff Sgt. Scott Jarvis , 45 , of Houston , said he tries not to think about what 's being burned and released into the air .
“ I have a very hard time breathing sometimes , and I have a big rash on my face , ” Jarvis said .
1st Lt. Sean Lindley , 27 , said the air aggravates his throat and eyes .
The health worries increase the stress of deployment , he said .
“ It sucks being here , ” said Lindley , who 's from Portland , Texas .
“ You 're away from your family and friends and everything and then you add this on top of it . ”
Lawsuits specifically allege contractors and others dumped a human arm , other body parts , batteries , tires , asbestos and a variety of toxics into burn pits .
Aside from Balad , all of those pits apparently remain in operation , said Susan Burke , one of two chief counsels for plaintiffs in the consolidated cases .
Fewer pits in operation
Military regulations dictate that burn pits should be used as short - term solutions when incinerators or recycling options are not available .
Items prohibited from the pits include batteries , tires , fuel cans , propane cylinders , appliances and electronics .
The number of burn pits and incinerators is decreasing as U.S. forces draw down , said Col. John R. Robinson , spokesman for the Deputy Commanding General for Operations , U.S. Forces - Iraq .
As of November , 74 installations in Iraq used burn pits , Robinson said .
He added that there are 49 incinerators in Iraq , and that the military is installing more to reduce the number of pits .
KBR operates 45 incinerators at 14 locations , said KBR communications director Heather Browne .
She said U.S. Army officials began ordering incinerators to replace burn pits at several bases , including Taji , in 2004 , but many orders got put on hold until 2007 or 2008 because of budgetary concerns .
A solid waste incinerator opened at Taji in July 2008 .
Construction of a second one was completed in December .
But the pit near the detainee facility still consumes 2,000 cubic meters of trash weekly .
Taji is set to be turned over to the Iraqi government in March , and the Texas troops hope they 'll soon get orders to transfer elsewhere in Iraq .
“ I go home at night smelling like burned garbage , ” said Spc. Gerald Jacob , 30 , of Humble .
“ It ’s not pleasant .
But it ’s OK .
As long as time ’s not standing still I can make it work .
I ’m just counting the days . ”

Computing boffins say they have demonstrated rootkits which can be used to turn your smartphone or " upcoming tablet computer " into a remotely - activated bugging or tracking system .
“ Smart phones are essentially becoming regular computers , ” says Vinod Ganapathy , computing prof at Rutgers uni in New Jersey .
“ They run the same class of operating systems as desktop and laptop computers , so they are just as vulnerable to attack by malware . ”
Ganapathy and his colleagues developed various rootkits for demonstration purposes , choosing that class of malware because - they say - virtual machine monitors necessary to detect rootkits can't yet be run on portable devices .
According to the boffins :
Rootkit attacks on smart phones or upcoming tablet computers could be more devastating because smart phone owners tend to carry their phones with them all the time .
This creates opportunities for potential attackers to eavesdrop , extract personal information from phone directories , or just pinpoint a user ’s whereabouts by querying the phone ’s Global Positioning System ( GPS ) receiver .
Smart phones also have new ways for malware to enter the system , such as through a Bluetooth radio channel or via text message .
“ What we ’re doing today is raising a warning flag , ” said Ganapathy 's fellow - prof Liviu Iftode .
“ We ’re showing that people with general computer proficiency can create rootkit malware for smart phones .
The next step is to work on defenses . ”
The researchers demonstrated means whereby a badhat could send an invisible text message to an undetectably - rootkitted phone , causing it to place a call out - for instance during a meeting - and so allow the malware operator to listen in to conversations around it .
Likewise it was possible to query the phone 's GPS so as to locate or track its owner .
It was also possible to remotely switch on multiple power - hog capabilities of the phone - for instance WiFi , GPS and Bluetooth all at once - and so drain its battery without the owner noticing .

Hey there , time traveller !

TORONTO -- Tim Hortons has fired off another round in the breakfast war among Canada 's quick - service giants , introducing its own version of rival McDonald 's Egg McMuffin breakfast sandwich .
Tim Hortons , which gave McDonald 's some serious competition in the breakfast segment in 2006 when it began offering a hot morning sandwich on a baked biscuit or a bagel , has avoided selling an egg sandwich on an English muffin , which has about half of the calories of a bagel , until now .
Canada 's biggest coffee chain has seemingly triumphed in the breakfast sandwich segment over competitors McDonald 's and Starbucks with a 51 per cent share in the category , but market researcher NPD Group Canada says consumers still buy one in four breakfast sandwiches in Canada on an English muffin .
" We initially came out with a homestyle biscuit ( breakfast sandwich ) to differentiate us from the competition , " said Tim Hortons spokesman David Morelli .
" This was a natural extension of our line .
We want to give our customers choice , and these are the healthiest option among our breakfast sandwiches . "
Tim Hortons is launching the sandwich with a promotion , selling it at $ 1.99 for a month before returning to the regular price of $ 2.59 .
The move comes nine months after McDonald 's offered its reformulated " premium roast " coffee in Canada and gave it away to customers for free for two full weeks , no other purchase required .
While not initially direct competitors when Tim Hortons and McDonald 's both began operating in Canada in the 1960s , the two quick - service giants have been encroaching upon each other 's traditional turf for more than a decade , with Tim Hortons evolving from a coffee and doughnuts chain into a meal and sandwich destination .
With close to 3,000 restaurants in Canada , it overtook McDonald 's in 2002 as the country 's biggest quick - service restaurant chain .
McDonald 's has also broadened its menu options considerably and has opened 72 McCafes , which sell espresso drinks and other specialty coffees , in a test market in eastern Canada .
There are no plans as yet to roll out McCafes to the remainder of Canada .
McDonald 's has targeted the so called " better for you " quick - serve dining offerings of Subway and Tim Hortons by introducing grilled chicken sandwiches , wraps and salads to complement its core offerings of burgers and fries .
Last year , McDonald 's launched a " dare to compare " nutritional calculator so consumers could cross-reference the nutritional breakdown of its menu items with that of other chains .
" They are both incredibly successful strong operators , but for very different reasons , " Luke Sklar , partner at Toronto - based market research firm Sklar Wilton & Associates , said of the two chains .
" I think of Tim Hortons as a marvellous executor and operator , but I do not think of it as strategic the way I do McDonald's .
I think that McDonald 's is the turnaround of the decade by getting back to its original mantra of quality , service , cleanliness and value , and it also upgraded its image , both internally and with its customers . "

Even a man who is pure in heart
And says his prayers by night
may become a wolf when the wolfbane blooms
and the autumn moon is
bright
-- Curt Siodmak ,
“ The Wolf Man ”
Screenwriter Curt Siodmak was a German Jew of Polish descent who fled Europe for Hollywood in the 1930s to escape persecution from the Nazis .
So there ’s little wonder that his 1941 Universal horror classic “ The Wolf Man ” parallels the experiences of Jews in Europe before and during World War II .
“ The Wolf Man ” revolves around an everyman , Lawrence Talbot ( Lon Chaney Jr. ) , who arrives at his father ’s mansion in England after years of living in America .
One evening , he ’s bitten by a werewolf in the forest and finds himself turning into a vicious beast whenever the moon is full .
Filled with self - loathing for what happened to him , Talbot fears not only what he might do to his friends and family but also being hunted down and killed .
Siodmak “ understood drama and pathos , ” says Constantine Nasr , producer of the documentaries on the new two - disc DVD of “ The Wolf Man , ” which came out Tuesday in conjunction with the Feb. 12 release of Universal ’s new version starring Benicio Del Toro as Talbot .
“ The original title was ‘ Destiny ’ because he believed it was the story of an outsider whose destiny was cursed by forces he could not control , ” Nasr says .
“ There was going to be no way out for him . ”
Even the pentagram in Talbot ’s hand signifying a werewolf is a “ very obvious substitute for the Star of David , and if you had that symbol you were going to be cursed , ” Nasr says .
“ That is not how Siodmak felt as a Jew but how he felt others perceived him .
Larry Talbot was an interesting substitute for what was going on with the Jewish people in the early 1940s . ”
From 1925 , Universal had been the major monster movie factory in Hollywood beginning with Lon Chaney in “ The Phantom of the Opera ” and continuing with 1931 ’s “ Dracula ” and “ Frankenstein , ” 1932 ’s “ The Mummy , ” 1933 ’s “ The Invisible Man ” and 1935 ’s “ The Bride of Frankenstein . ”
But in 1936 , Universal founder Carl Laemmle and his son Carl Jr. were forced out and the horror genre went dormant .
But the new regime soon realized that horror films were big box office and resurrected the genre in 1939 with “ Son of Frankenstein ” and soon began to make sequels to its popular characters .
“ The Wolf Man ” was the first original monster movie the studio produced in the 1940s .
Though its other famous monsters were based on books and plays , “ The Wolf Man ” came from the imagination of Siodmak .
Scott Essman , the author of the book and DVD project on the famed Universal makeup artist , “ Jack Pierce -- The Man Behind the Monsters , ” says “ The Wolf Man ” was “ an aberration for the studio at the time because it was an original . ”
The studio had produced a werewolf movie , though , in 1935 called “ Werewolf of London ” with Henry Hull as the man bitten by a wolf .
There had also been a werewolf project in the works for the studio ’s superstar Boris Karloff , but it had been scuttled .
By 1941 , Universal resurrected the idea .
Siodmak was under contract to the studio and given the task .
“ It was all the magical kind of thing where all the elements came together in one film , ” Essman says .
Siodmak established the werewolf lore on screen , including pentagrams , wolfbane , the full moon and that a werewolf can be killed only by a silver bullet .
Director George Waggner got great performances from his cast , including Claude Rains , Evelyn Ankers , Bela Lugosi as the gypsy werewolf who bites Talbot , and Maria Ouspenskaya .
Pierce supplied the brilliant makeup , which included yak hair , fangs and a rubber snout .
The film made a star out of Chaney , son of the Man of a Thousand Faces , who starred in Universal ’s “ The Hunchback of Notre Dame ” and “ Phantom of the Opera . ”
Though he hated the grueling hours in the makeup chair , Chaney Jr. relished the role of Talbot .
“ He called it his baby , ” says the actor ’s grandson , Ron Chaney .
In fact , he was the only actor to play the role at Universal , resurrecting Talbot four more times at the studio .
Years later , he played a werewolf in the 1960 monster / horror comedy “ House of Terror , ” and in 1962 , Chaney reprised the Wolf Man for a “ Route 66 " episode .
Ron Chaney loves to tell of his grandfather ’s relationship with Moose , a big shepherd mix owned by the night watchman at Universal .
Chaney insisted the hound be cast as the wolf that bites Talbot .
The scene was shot in the shadows , so it ’s really a fake dog that attacks Chaney in the close - up .
So there were no hard feelings between them .
In fact by the time the film was done , Ron Chaney noted , “ the dog had switched his alliance to my grandfather .
He purchased Moose from the night watchman . ”

The £ 25 million giant pin cushion in China that 's funded by British taxpayers
Just take a glance at the relatively tiny man in the bottom left - hand corner of the photograph below to gain a measure of the scale of this bizarre structure that looks like a giant pin cushion .
The ' Seed Cathedral ' , the intended centrepiece of the United Kingdom Pavilion at the Shanghai World Expo , also comes with an equally enormous bill for the British taxpayer .
Costing £ 25 million to build , the 60 ft - high cube - like construction is covered by 60,000 quivering , transparent acrylic rods , received investment from eight Government departments and agencies .
Workers dwarfed as they complete construction of the Seed Cathedral
The 60,000 rods , which are filled with vegetable seeds and will move in the breeze , being put in place last month
The curious building makes its mark against the Shanghai skyline as the UK Pavilion nears completion
The structure forms the centrepiece of the UK Pavilion at the World Expo which opens later this year
It was organised by UK Trade & Investment , a government agency which promotes British companies abroad .
It 's purpose is to present a dynamic view of Britain to the outside world and counter persistent Chinese perceptions of a Victorian - era UK .
UKTI chief executive officer Sir Andrew Cahn said : ' The Chinese view of Britain is a rather old - fashioned one ; it ’s all to do with Britain as being a heritage country , a traditional economy - there ’s an awful lot of cobblestones and fog .
' It hopes that updating Chinese preconceptions will attract foreign investors and students to Britain , as well as encourage exports between the two countries .
' We think of Britain as a cutting - edge , forward - looking country . '
So , as Britain faces a national debt of nearly £ 800 billion , the organisers ' fingers must be hoping it wows wealthy visitors and does n't leave us a laughing stock as well as further out of pocket .
The Foreign Office , which oversees UKTI , would not disclose at how much taxpayers ' cash had been used to build the Seed Cathedral .
A spokesman for the department told Mail Online tonight that the full details could not be obtained until tomorrow morning .
He said that five corporate sponsors had also invested in the Shanghai project and when asked if the majority of the cash was public money , the spokesman would only say a ' large chunk of it was '
The building was designed by Thomas Heatherwick , who is best known for The B of the Bang sculpture in Manchester , and it was inspired by the UK ’s public parks and gardens to meet the Expo ’s brief of ' Better City , Better Life ' .
He also created the East Beach Cafe in Littlehampton , the Rolling Bridge in London and the Blue Carpet in Newcastle .
He is also a senior fellow and external examiner at the Royal College of Art and a fellow of the Royal Academy .
" He was arrested on a flight from Dubai to Kyrgyzstan , " Mr Moslehi said .
" It is such a scandal for Dubai in this incident , which shows that the Zionist regime , by using the US and Europe , is seeking to turn the region into a haven for terrorists .

Until the LHC finally gets up to full speed , Brookhaven National Lab's Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider ( RHIC ) remains the world 's most powerful heavy ion smasher .
And on Monday , they showed off some of that power by announcing that a recent collision resulted in the hottest matter ever recorded .
Coming in at a scorching 7.2 trillion degrees Fahrenheit , the plasma not only recreated the environment of the Big Bang , but might have also resulted in the temporary formation of a bubble within which some normal laws of physics did not apply .
Lordy , Lordy , Lordy , look what the pollsters just brought in .
A pair of new surveys revealing that President Obama is still declining and has hit a new low in job approval among Americans just 56 weeks after they elected him with a decided margin .
A Top of the Ticket post Tuesday on the relative popularity of Sarah Palin and Barack Obama erred in stating in the text and the headline that there was a Palin - Obama gap of 1 point .
Two separate polls were cited , as the post notes , so the findings are not directly comparable .
And -- wait for it -- Republicanis successfully selling a whole lot more than books out there on the road .
Even among those not lining up in 10 - degree weather to catch a glimpse of pretty much the only political celebrity the GOP has these days .
First , el jefe .
Facing double - digit unemployment , rising spending , deficits and Afghan war casualties plus a keystone but stalled healthcare reform effort that caused a rare Sunday presidential visit to Capitol Hill , Obama recently fell below 50 % job approval for the first time .
Then , last week 's deft dance of rhetoric over sending reinforcements to Afghanistan but , on the other foot , bringing them home quickly maybe gave him a brief boost .
That , however , collapsed with equal rapidity .
Obama 's new Gallup Poll job approval number is 47 % .
Last month it was 53 % .
Regular Ticket readers will recall how in this space in late November we pointed out that Obama 's closely watched job approval slide was coinciding with Palin 's little - noticed rise in favorability .
And it appeared they might cross somewhere in the 40s .
Well , ex-Sen. Obama , meet ex-Gov. Palin .
The new CNN / Opinion Research Poll shows Palin now at 46 % favorable .
[ A previous version of this post said that , at 46 % , Palin was “ just one point below her fellow basketball fan . "
The CNN / Opinion Research Poll did not ask respondents about Obama . ]
( The same poll , btw , has bad news for Dick Cheney - haters ; the outspoken former VP has climbed out of the 29 % basement , back up to 39 % now .
How do you suppose he 's done that without a new book ?
But that 's another story . )
Not that either Palin or Obama will admit caring about such trivial things as disparate political polls ....
So , this is insane :
That 's Spring .
What 's Spring ?
Well , it 's a fairly neat open source RTS framework that started out as a Total Annihilation clone , but more to the point , it 's a pretty complex 3D game .
What 's cool about the picture ?
Well , it 's in the renderer info in the console ( which you probably can't quite make out , never mind ) .
Yup , that 's Spring ... running on Nouveau !
Huge kudos to the whole nouveau team for this .
Nouveau 's 3D support recently became available in Rawhide / Fedora 13 with an update to the mesa - dri- drivers - experimental package .
I was impressed when it ran Compiz , really impressed when it ran Neverball and Foobillard , but running Spring is nuts .
Does n't seem to manage gnome - shell yet , but I 'm sure they can fix that .
I admit I never expected to see things working like that in such a time frame .
Obviously it 's heavily hardware dependent , it does n't run super - fast ( looked like about 20 - 25 fps , just by eyeballing it , on my 9400 GT ) and I have n't stressed it much yet so it may be crashy , but still , that 's incredible stuff .
edit : it also runs Quake 3 .
Quake fricking 3 !

It is now 12 days since the hacked emails from the Climatic Research Unit at the University of East Anglia first appeared online , and the propaganda machine for the climate change denial lobby is in overdrive .
The University of East Anglia has rightly announced an independent investigation into the hacking episode .
It is essential that the investigation examines , thoroughly and transparently , the substance of the email messages and establishes whether there has been any wrongdoing .
From what I have seen , there is no evidence of research misconduct , but the only way to clear the air now is through an investigation .
Some people have already , and predictably , taken on the role of judge , jury and executioner , and have called for Phil Jones , the director of the unit , to resign .
Yesterday Jones announced he would be temporarily standing down while an inquiry is carried out .
But such a hysterical witch hunt is a sign of desperation rather than justice .
Despite nearly two weeks of frantic brandishing of the " smoking gun " , there is still no evidence of the alleged bullets that would constitute an overturning of 200 years of climate research .
The greenhouse effect still exists and the Earth is still warming .
Nevertheless , the denial lobby – and it is denial rather than scepticism because they reject all of the evidence they do n't like and embrace any alternative theory no matter how flaky – is claiming victory .
And to some extent they have succeeded – by confusing the public and perhaps reducing public pressure on politicians to reach a strong and effective agreement at Copenhagen climate talks this month .
They have been aided in their campaign of disinformation by some feeble media reporting .
Take the Global Warming Policy Foundation , a lobby group launched on 23 November , a few days after the stolen emails first appeared on the web .
The chairman of its board of trustees , Nigel Lawson , promoted his new group by listing alleged misdeeds by the Climatic Research Unit and calling for a public inquiry by a high court judge .
What Lawson neglected to mention and which no journalist sought to quiz him about was a graph featuring prominently at the top of every page on the foundation 's website , using data published by the Climatic Research Unit and the Met Office 's Hadley Centre .
Nor did he reveal that the foundation had " hidden " the temperature record prior to 2001 , so that visitors could not tell that eight of the 10 warmest years since the instrumental record began in the 19th century have occurred since 2000 .
But most damagingly of all , nobody reported that the temperature data in the graph had been inaccurately misrepresented , with 2003 wrongly appearing to be warmer than 2005 , and 2006 and 2007 erroneously appearing warmer than 2004 .
Who knows , maybe the " sceptics " will be evenhanded now and call for a public inquiry into the data on the foundation 's website .
But do n't hold your breath .
Perhaps unsurprisingly , the hysterical atmosphere created by the emails has encouraged more of the denial lobby to emerge from the shadows .
The British National party leader , Nick Griffin , gave a speech in which he claimed that climate change was a leftwing conspiracy , in much the same way as Lord Christopher Monckton has in his recent speeches in the United States .
Monckton and Prof Ian Plimer then helped the UK Independence party to launch its own declaration of climate change denial this week .
Suddenly climate change denial has become a new article of faith among the far right .
Who knows where this will end .
The denial lobby is determined to make this story drag on for as long as possible , and some are even claiming that it contributed to the failure of Australian climate change legislation this week and the ousting of the opposition leader .
But when is all is said and done , the climate will still be changing and the risks will be mounting .

Pictured : Dyson invents world 's smallest vacuum cleaner that is so tiny it can sit on a bookshelf
Dyson has launched its smallest vacuum cleaner to date , specifically designed for city dwellers with tiny flats .
The new City DC26 is compact enough to fit on a piece of A4 paper but , Dyson promises , packs the same punch as its larger models .
Compact :
The new Dyson City DC26 is small enough to fit on a piece of A4 paper
The vacuum cleaner is the first the company has launched in the UK for two years and costs ' for £ 250 .
Created from scratch with 275 parts re-engineered and miniatured by Dyson 's technicians , the DC26 comes with 13 inner cyclones which suck dirt out of the air using centrifugal force .
Tiny friend : James
Dyson standing beside his company 's latest vacuum cleaner
Inventor Sir James Dyson said : ' It took us five years to painstakingly compress and rebuild every single component before we had a machine that was a third smaller than its predecessor , yet could still tackle dirt like bigger machines . '
At 3.25 kg the DC26 weighs less than some laptops but , despite its tiny proportions , was built for toughness .
Dyson claims it withstood 5,318 drops onto a hard floor and 10,000 pummels against a metal wall during testing .
The smallest Dyson cleaner is a handheld device .
It is meant for cleaning cars and small indoor areas rather than an entire home .
Sir James 's r elatively simple idea for a bagless vacuum cleaner has earned him a reputed £ 1 billion .
In November he was reported to have treated his children to a share of his huge fortune - giving them a cool £ 15 million each .
The three Dyson offspring have been bequeathed shares worth a total of £ 45 million , in a move that bucks the trend for entrepreneurs to make extravagant donations to charity and leave little to their children .
The Dyson children received their windfall through a buy - back transaction of their father 's company shares , according to documents filed at Companies House .
The deal took place shortly before the capital gains tax levied on such deals was increased from 10 per cent to 18 per cent .
Temps très agité attendu pour la fin de semaine .
La tempête " ALEX " va se créer en mer durant la nuit de jeudi à vendredi , avec des rafales attendues le plus souvent entre 100 et 120 km/h à l'intérieur des terres , 130 à 140 km/h voire plus en pointe sur le côtier , essentiellement sur la Bretagne voire une partie des Pays - de - la - Loire ( cf infographie ci-jointe ) .
Vendredi , le pays sera donc concerné par cette perturbation active , donnant aussi de fortes pluies en de nombreuses régions .
On surveillera également le risque orageux sur le Sud-Est .
Ensuite , le week - end se déroulera dans une ambiance venteuse , pluvieuse , et parfois orageuse , avec encore un risque de coups de vent et de fortes pluies .
UFC sues
Web site operator over alleged pirated broadcasts

See the UFC lawsuit
The Ultimate Fighting Championship is suing a Web site operator it says is selling pirated broadcasts of current and past UFC fights .
Las Vegas - based Zuffa LLC , owner of the UFC , filed suit in U.S. District Court in Las Vegas on Thursday against Moazzam Gandu .
Zuffa says Gandu lives in Stafford , Va. , and runs the Web site www.rage-streams.net.
Zuffa complained that rage - streams is offering unauthorized " live streaming " video of UFC 110 for $ 6.99 , even though the lowest authorized price for the broadcast of the event is $ 44.95 .
UFC 110 is a series of bouts set for Sydney , Australia , on Saturday ( Sunday in Australia ) .
Rage - streams also offers for sale unauthorized video of at least 40 past UFC events , Zuffa charges .
Rage - Streams is profiting from these current and past broadcasts by selling advertising with them , attorneys for Zuffa said .
The lawsuit asserts allegations including copyright and trademark infringement , unfair competition and deceptive trade practices .
It seeks a temporary restraining order barring rage - streams from providing unauthorized UFC broadcasts .
" Defendant 's Web site is designed to trade off of plaintiff 's goodwill , " Zuffa 's lawsuit says .
" Defendant is using a mark that is the same and / or confusingly similar to the UFC marks in connection with the sale , offering for sale , or advertising of services in a manner that is likely to cause confusion or mistake , or to deceive consumers as to an affiliation , connection or association with plaintiff , or as to the origin , sponsorship , or approval of defendant ’s services or commercial activities by plaintiff , " charged the suit , filed by attorneys Michael Feder and John Krieger with the Las Vegas office of the law firm Lewis and Roca LLP .
A request for comment on the allegations was placed with the defendant Friday .
From Leo Messi to Wayne Rooney , via a ridiculous rabona , we select some of the most sublime strikes from the past 10 years
The comparisons with another great Argentinian were obvious .
This , though , was better .
The past decade has not been found wanting when it comes to goals of stunning individual skill – Yoann Gourcuff , Dennis Bergkamp and Zlatan Ibrahimovic are testament to that – but what sets this apart is the leg - blurring speed of its execution .
The journey from the halfway line to the back of the net takes just short of nine seconds .
Nine seconds .
Yet this goal was and is about more than just those nine seconds .
It is this image of Messi , just 19 at the time , that endures – the almost cartoonish speed , the mop of hair fluttering like a comet 's tail , the defenders ragged and flailing in panic .
He could score long - range efforts to surpass Xabi Alonso and co , he could finish off a move of breathtaking elan to put Esteban Cambiasso to shame , he could ping one in blindfolded and on one leg in the final minute of a Champions League final , but this picture of pacey poetry will still be the Messi that is burned on the collective football conscience .
Yes , the defending was pitiful .
Yes , in the grander scheme of things , it meant little .
Yes , Maxi Rodríguez 's volley - to - end - all - volleys for the same team in the same tournament was probably better .
And , yes , it failed to make this Joy of Six .
But still , this was arguably the iconic World Cup goal of the decade , the one that stands as testament to that Argentina side 's – sadly unfulfilled – potential .
Would it make any difference if Argentina had fulfilled that promise and gone on to lift the trophy in Germany ?
Not a jot .
Great goals are not the preserve of winners .
José Pekerman 's bottle job against the hosts in the quarter - final does nothing to diminish Cambiasso 's big moment .
If anything , it only adds to the poignancy , the sense of what might have been .
The goal is the sort that gets described as " liquid football " or some such nonsense ( I write disparagingly before attempting to compare said goal to intercourse ) .
Football as sex is something of an overused metaphor , but " liquid " suggests a flow and there was nothing particularly flowing about the move as a whole .
It is cautious at first .
Mostly nervous prodding .
By the climax things are moving very fast indeed .
Feel free to add your own double entendres for Cambiasso's explosive finish .
Or just use that one .
Some ( MEntioning no naMEs ) had heard talk of a promising 16 - year - old striker at Everton and stuck him in their Fantasy Football team for 2002 - 03 .
He did not earn as many points as , say , an intelligent purchase such as David Unsworth ( defenders who take penalties – always a Fantasy winner ) but delivered a juggernaut full of smugness when he decisively ended Arsenal 's 30 - game unbeaten run .
Rooney has scored better goals – take your pick here – but this was the one that announced the arrival of a player who would go on to become the English player of the decade .
It 's a goal that screams : " This is how good I am right now .
Think about how good I may become . "
Even the commentary is self - consciously ( not to mention irritatingly ) Big Moment .
We 're probably still waiting for the career - defining Rooney goal , but this was where it began .
While Rooney 's goal heralded the beginning of something of an era , this was a last hurrah .
As the champagne corks popped to welcome in a new millennium , Rivaldo was on top of the world .
In 1999 he was Fifa World Player of the Year , European Footballer of the Year and the Ballon d'Or winner .
He had Copa América and La Liga winners ' medals dangling from his neck ( two tournaments in which he had been named Footballer of the Year and MVP ) .
At 27 and undisputedly the best player in the world he could look forward to , what , eight more years at or near the top ?
His best , though , was largely behind him and this strike – to complete what the Observer 's John Carlin described as " the most gloriously implausible hat - trick anyone has ever scored in a top - class game " – was his final flourish , even if he did pick up a Champions League medal with Milan in 2003 .
On the final day of the 2000 - 01 season Barça and Valencia were going mano - a-mano at Camp Nou for La Liga 's final Champions League spot .
The visitors were three points clear in fourth – only a victory would be good enough for the hosts .
Twice the Brazilian put Barcelona ahead – first with a clipped free - kick and then with a drive of astonishing ferocity – twice Rubén Baraja levelled for Valencia .
As the seconds ticked down Barcelona were set to miss out on a top - four finish for the first time since 1988 and only the second time in 20 years .
And then ...
Some great goals require faith .
You need to believe , for example , that Laurent Robert got this completely right and not completely wrong and that Roberto Carlos was n't horrendously overhitting an attempt to pick someone out in the middle .
Football sometimes needs us to put aside our cynicism – the world is a better place if we believe Vasquez when he says he meant this .
That is certainly his claim – and a day or two later he showed a TV crew again just to make his point .
Even then , there 's a nagging doubt sulking in the back of the mind and mumbling about it being a botched cross .
And if you dwell on it too deeply , you 'll find sitting alongside that doubt will be another little curmudgeonly chunk of cortex moaning about " percentage balls " and insisting that , even if he did intend to shoot , he should n't have .
Ignore them .
Grab a ball , find a bit of grass and try to do it yourself .
Do n't click on the link until you have read this bit .
It 'll seem ridiculous .
I 'm not for a moment suggesting this is one of the greatest goals of the past decade .
Well , I am .
And I 'm not .
It is clearly not a great goal .
Well it is , but not in the way that Messi 's goal is or Rivaldo 's is .
Please indulge me for a few moments and let me explain .
Ask , say , a Burnley fan for his goal of the decade .
Chances are it will be this .
Rooney ?
Cambiasso ?
Give any self - respecting New Zealander the choice and he will most likely take Rory Fallon over that pair .
It is not just the goal itself , it is what the goal represents , and , in a way , is n't that what all of these have been about ( on some level at least ) ?
This is mine .
My favourite moment of terrace ecstasy .

The Attorney General Christian Porter has defended the State Government 's proposed anti-association laws , saying they will target criminal organisations .
The laws would give police the power to ban people from associating with certain groups , and from visiting some establishments
Perth lawyer Tom Percy QC was one of 500 people who attended a rally against the proposal yesterday , saying it would erode basic civil liberties .
But , Mr Porter has told ABC Local Radio the laws would only be used to combat organised crime .
" You have to show to the relevant standard that an organisation , in this case we say that there are criminal organisations in the form of bikie clubs , that they are a criminal organisation , " he said .
However , Mr Percy says the laws are an attack on basic civil liberties and will not just target bikie gangs .
" It 's about basic freedoms , but specifically the right to associate with whom you want to associate , it 's also about whether the government has the right to take that freedom from us .
I say , it has n't , " he said .
He says the laws are draconian and demonstrate the need for a Bill of Rights .
" The fact that this legislation could even be contemplated that we can even think about it in a civilised country in 2010 , demonstrates the glaring need in Australia for a constitutional Bill of Rights , " he said .
This article is written by Robert Greenwald and appears in the HuffingtonPost.com .
Last Thursday , Americans paused as they have become accustomed to doing , as national news reported a mass shooting at Umpqua Community College in Oregon .
Late Wednesday evening , Google employees posted an " Internet - Draft " outlining proposed changes to the DNS protocol that allow authoritative DNS servers to see the addresses of clients .
This way , geographically distributed content delivery networks can tailor their answers to a specific client 's network location .
So a client from California would talk to a server in California , while a client in the Netherlands would talk to a server in the Netherlands .
Currently , authoritative DNS servers do n't see the client address , only the address of the resolving server that is typically operated by the client 's ISP .
So in the current situation , if our Californian and Dutch clients both use a DNS resolver in New York , a location - optimizing authoritative DNS server would give them both the addresses of servers in or around New York .
By including the client 's address in the request , the authoritative server can send a better response and improve the subsequent interactions between the client and server because the request / response round - trip times across the network are shorter .
Google does have a plan to avoid the most egregious privacy concerns .
" Recursive Resolvers are strongly encouraged to conceal part of the IP address of the user by truncating IP v4 addresses to 24 bits . "
Coincidentally , 24 bits maps directly to the minimum address block that can be carried in the Internet 's routing system .
Carrying any more than that wo n't help solve the network distance problem using the routing tables .
For IP v6 , there is no corresponding number that everyone agrees to , but the authors of the draft suggest truncating IP v6 addresses as well .
Of course , the owner of the authoritative DNS server still gets to see the client 's full IP address when the HTTP request for the actual content is sent .
Internet - Drafts are working documents within the Internet Engineering Task Force .
Anyone in possession of a keyboard and time on their hands can write one .
Drafts live on the IETF servers for six months and are then deleted , so authors must post updates twice a year .
If there is interest and no technical objections , a draft may progress to become an RFC ( Request For Comments ) .
The bar is relatively low for " experimental " and " informational " RFCs , but much higher for those that are intended to become Internet standards .
Very few drafts get that far .
In this particular case , it 's not clear whether purists will object to embracing " two - faced DNS " so explicitly .
Although many organizations have DNS servers that serve up different answers to internal users than to external users , this practice is n't held in high esteem by those in the IETF who care about the Internet 's architecture .
Interestingly , the Google and Neustar employees who wrote the document chose a model where the authoritative server sees the client addresses , rather having the authoritative server publish the full list of server addresses so that the resolving server can figure out which is closest .
And if Web protocols and practices were n't so sensitive to round - trip times , this effort would be largely irrelevant .
( Altough not having to carry packets from continent to continent would still save bandwidth costs . )
It 's too early to make guesses about the success of this effort at the IETF , but Paul Vixie , well known as the original author of the BIND DNS software and no less for his strong opinions , set the tone in a message to the IETF DNSEXT mailing list .
" if we 're going to add client identity to the query , can we do so in a more general way ?

In a remarkably interesting move , the Malaysian car maker Proton have announce that they will be showing a plug - in electric vehicle with a drivetrain developed in - house at Lotus Engineering .
The Italdesign 4 door Proton PHEV will be interesting to see however the real news here is the hybrid electric drivetrain developed by Lotus .
This fully functioning hybrid vehicle platform is more than a little likely to show up in the Lotus product line sooner rather than later with the most likely offering being a plug - in hybrid Elise as early as late - 2010 / early - 2011 .
This would clearly explain the shock announcement by Tesla Motors recently that they would stop producing their only car , the Lotus Elise based Tesla Roadster , in 2011 as it is likely that Lotus would n’t want to risk cannibalizing their own PHEV sales .
Could this be the first inkling of a Lotus Elise Plug - In Electric Hybrid ?
It currently looks very much like it , if you have a look at the images of the 2011 Lotus Elise below you ’ll notice they have increased the height of the front of the car , they would need to do this in order to fit the additional elements of the hybrid drivetrain ( take a look at the picture above and compare the two ) with the 1.2 litre generator fitting in the back of the car in much the same way as the current model Elise .
Having elements of the hybrid drivetrain at both the front and back of the car would greatly assist in even weight distribution , Lotus is notorious for developing some of the best handling cars on the world market so it is safe to assume they would go to great lengths to achieve this with an in house developed hybrid .
Let ’s cross our fingers and hope for the announcement .
Lotus Press Release
The PROTON Concept car , to be unveiled at the Geneva Motor Show , showcases an advanced series hybrid drivetrain , designed and developed by Lotus Engineering .
Lotus Engineering , the world - renowned automotive consultancy division of Lotus Cars Limited today announces its latest series hybrid vehicle technology application in the PROTON Concept , which will be unveiled at the 80th International Geneva Motor Show .
The complete hybrid drivetrain in the PROTON Concept city car has been developed by Lotus Engineering and it includes the Lotus Range Extender engine , designed specifically for series hybrid vehicles .
The PROTON Concept , a plug - in series hybrid city car , has been styled by Italdesign and will be unveiled on the Italdesign stand at the Geneva Motor Show .
Lotus Engineering has designed and integrated the complete drivetrain , including the electrical drive system with single - speed transmission , which delivers low emissions , optimised performance and acceptable electric - only operating range for city use .
For longer journeys , when the battery charge level falls , the 3 cylinder , 1.2 litre Lotus Range Extender engine is used to replenish the charge in the battery and provide electrical power for the drive motors .
The battery can also be recharged via an AC mains domestic outlet to achieve initial electric - only operation .
Dr Robert Hentschel , Director of Lotus Engineering said : “ The hybrid drivetrain of the PROTON Concept is another example of Lotus Engineering ’s expertise in electrical and electronic systems and efficient performance engines .
The high efficiency Lotus Range Extender engine , which we unveiled to great acclaim at the IAA Frankfurt Motor Show last year is perfectly suited for the advanced series hybrid we have created for the PROTON Concept city car .
It is an exciting example of the diverse range of highly efficient total propulsion systems that Lotus Engineering continues to develop for its partners and clients . ”
PROTON Holdings Berhad Group Managing Director , Dato’ Haji Syed Zainal Abidin Syed Mohd
Tahir said , “ Our collaboration with Lotus and Italdesign on progressive technology and design will further propel our competitiveness in the world market .
Through this association , we strive to acquire and jointly develop new knowledge , skills and technologies that will ultimately benefit our customers . ”

In a unique experiment , The Guardian published online the full manuscript of its major investigation into the climate science emails stolen from the University of East Anglia , which revealed apparent attempts to cover up flawed data ; moves to prevent access to climate data ; and to keep research from climate sceptics out of the scientific literature .
As well as including new information about the emails , we allowed web users to annotate the manuscript to help us in our aim of creating the definitive account of the controversy .
This was an attempt at a collaborative route to getting at the truth .
We hoped to approach that complete account by harnessing the expertise of people with a special knowledge of , or information about , the emails .
We wanted the protagonists on all sides of the debate to be involved , as well as people with expertise about the events and the science being described or more generally about the ethics of science .
The only conditions are the comments abide by our community guidelines and add to the total knowledge or understanding of the events .
The annotations - and the real name of the commenter - were added to the manuscript , initially in private .
The most insightful comments were then added to a public version of the manuscript .
We hoped the process would be a form of peer review .
The response of the science establishment to the hacking is set to become a case study in public relations disasters .
One PR figure from a major environment group said : " Their response will be taught in university communications courses - because I 'm going to make sure it is . "
The initial response from both the emailers and their employers was to condemn the hackers and ignore what they hacked .
Michael Mann at Penn State University called the affair " a high - level orchestrated smear campaign to distract the public about the nature of the climate change problem . "
Phil Jones , holed up in the Climatic Research Unit at the University of East Anglia , called most of the charges against them " ludicrous " .
Kevin Trenberth at the National Centre for Atmospheric Research in Boulder , Colorado , and IPCC chairman Rajendra Pachauri both said they saw it as an attempt to undermine the Copenhagen climate conference , that was due to take place two weeks later .
Ben Santer from the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory in California called Jones " one of the gentlemen of our field " .
He was standing firm in the face of " the vilest personal attacks " from " powerful forces of unreason . "
Bob Ward of the Grantham Institute for Climate Change at the London School of Economics said Jones and Mann " have been subjected to a co-ordinated campaign of personal attacks on their reputation . "
The UEA put out a statement saying that " the selective publication of some stolen emails and other papers taken out of context is mischievous and cannot be considered a genuine attempt to engage with the issues in a responsible way . "
But the contents of the emails was not edifying for anyone .
And the sceptics were making hay .
They gleefully blogged that the emails revealed extensive data manipulation .
The Daily Telegraph published a blog by a former news reporter on the paper , James Delingpole , claiming the affair " exposed the conspiracy behind the anthropogenic global warming myth " , adding for good measure that " this scandal could well be the greatest in modern science . "
The Daily Express ran a long story headlined : " 100 reasons why global warming is natural " .
It said the list came from a " dossier " issued by the European Foundation , a UK - based right - wing group that campaigns mostly against European integration .
But two months on , the dossier has not been published .
Most of the hundred reasons were either meaningless or scientific nonsense , according to New Scientist magazine , which gave up after debunking the first 50 .
In the US , sceptical physicists used the moment to revive a campaign to overturn a 2007 declaration by the American Physical Society that evidence of man-made climate change was " incontrovertible " .
Their letter began : " By now everyone has heard of ...
ClimateGate , which was and is an international scientific fraud , the worst any of us have seen .
" A picket formed outside the offices of NCAR in Boulder , where Tom Wigley , Trenberth and other emailers worked .
Wigley was among a number of climate scientists who say they received death threats .
Many who might have been expected to defend Jones and his colleagues were silent .
Most environmentalists sat on their hands , awaiting events .
An exception was Elizabeth May , head of the Canadian Green party .
She said she had read all the emails and declared : " How dare the world 's media fall into the trap set by contrarians without reading the whole set . "
For her " the enormous volume of emails give a picture of thoroughly decent scientists increasingly finding themselves in a nightmare .
They write each other in disbelief , protesting ' I have never been political .
I am an honest scientist ' . "
But four days after the leak , the environmental commentator George Monbiot said that Jones should resign .
The mood changed .
Even Mann , whose words featured prominently in early soundbites published from the emails , began an op -ed in the Washington Post with the words : " I can not condone some things that colleagues of mine wrote . "
The website that Mann co-hosts , RealClimate , offered the half - apologetic insight that the emails offered " a peek into how scientists actually interact and the conflicts show that the community is a far cry from the monolith that is sometimes imagined ...
For instance , we are sure it comes as no shock to know that many scientists do not hold Steve McIntyre in high regard . "
The post went on , " Gravity is n't a useful theory because Newton was a nice person . "
But such guarded apologies did n't turn the tide of invective .
A survey in the US found that 49 % of respondents claimed to have followed news of climategate " very closely or somewhat closely " , and 59 % found it " very likely or somewhat likely " that some scientists have falsified research data in order to support their own theories and beliefs about global warming .
According to American science historian Spencer Weart , the frenzied assaults on climate scientists were unprecedented .
" We 've never before seen a set of people accuse an entire community of scientists of deliberate deception and other professional malfeasance .
Even the tobacco companies never tried to slander legitimate cancer researchers . "
One PR operator for a leading environmental organisation in Britain told me : " The emails represented a seminal moment in the climate debate of the last five years , and it was a moment that broke decisively against us .
I think the CRU leak is nothing less than catastrophic . "
The next recourse was to an investigation .
Jones stood down while the University of East Anglia 's pro-vicechancellor Trevor Davies , who himself had been director of CRU from 1993 to 1998 , launched an independent inquiry to be headed by senior civil servant , Sir Muir Russell .
The IPCC 's chairman Rajendra Pachauri initially said the affair was " a serious issue and we will look into it in detail " .
But later made clear he would only be looking for lessons to learn and would not investigate the affair itself separately from the University of East Anglia and the Norfolk constabulary .
In January the House of Commons Science and Technology Committee announced its own investigation .
The emails made little impression at the UN climate negotiations in Copenhagen in early December .
This was about raw politics and not climate science .
A few sceptics such as Senator Inhofe and Danish economist Bjørn Lomborg were present giving media interviews , and others such as Lord Monckton caused offence by declaring that young climate activists were akin to " Hitler youth " .
Saudi Arabia 's lead climate negotiator Mohammed Al - Sabban , claimed on the opening day that " it appears from the details of the scandal that there is no relationship whatsoever between human activities and climate change " — a view that not even the most sceptical scientists would endorse .
But lobbyists were busy organising .
In Britain , Lord Lawson launched the Global Warming Policy Foundation ( GWPF ) four days after the story broke .
Lawson had been chancellor of the exchequer in 1989 , when Margaret Thatcher assembled her entire cabinet to hear a seminar on climate change at which Tom Wigley , then director of CRU , was the star perfomer .
But Lawson now opposes measures to fight climate change .
The GWPF 's stated purpose is to " bring reason , integrity and balance to a debate that has become seriously unbalanced , irrationally alarmist , and all too often depressingly intolerant " .
But its trustees and academic advisers do not reflect that balance .
Most have a public record as making sceptical comments about climate science .
Lawson appointed as the foundation 's director Benny Peiser .
He is a social anthropologist , part - time lecturer at the School of Sport and Exercise Sciences at Liverpool 's John Moores University , and long - standing co-editor of the journal Energy and Environment .
The journal is trashed by Jones in the emails as " the worst journal in the world " for its patronage of what he regarded as poor - quality papers by sceptics .
Even Peiser 's co-editor Sonja Boehmer - Christiansen , a geographer from the University of Hull , admits that it espouses what she calls a " political agenda " but she has defended the journal , saying that , " it 's only we climate sceptics who have to look for little journals and little publishers like mine to even get published . "
When asked by the Guardian to answer Jones 's specific comment she did not respond .
Within hours of his appointment , Peiser had begun what became a frequent media presence on the increasing number of occasions when editors needed a sceptical voice in their climate coverage .
The BBC and the media reponse
One of the most significant outcomes – and perhaps a bellwether of public mood – has been the response of the media .
" The CRU hack shifted the balance of legitimacy in newsrooms , " says Ben Stewart , media officer at Greenpeace UK .
Many newspaper began to probe the sceptics ' case more thoroughly .
Viewers of the BBC watched a crashing of editorial gears .
For several years most of its coverage of climate change has been based on the scientific consensus that warming is real and that mankind is to blame .
This had been reinforced by a study for the BBC Trust that concluded in 2007 : " The weight of evidence no longer justifies equal space being given to the opponents of the consensus . "
But even before " climategate " , the BBC had been reviewing both its climate and science coverage .
Deputy director - general Mark Byford organised an editorial seminar on climate change in September 2009 .
Insiders say the seminar followed an in - house trawl to find out how much coverage news bulletins gave to climate sceptics .
It had been called after an MP complained that sceptics did n't get a hearing , and it discovered that very often they did not .
After the seminar , deputy editor of news Steve Mitchell sent round a memo advising of the " need to reflect deniers in run-up to Copenhagen " .
One straw in the wind was the awarding of a Leeds - based BBC weather man with mildly sceptical views , Paul Hudson , with the title " climate correspondent " – to the chagrin of news correspondents covering that beat .
In October he began posting blogs on the BBC website .
The ripples of the Mitchell memo spread through the BBC .
Radio 4 's
Today raised eyebrows when , days before the climategate emails leaked , it interviewed an Australian climate change denier , geologist Ian Plimer , giving him what one critical insider called " the easiest of rides " for a string of highly contentious claims .
And after climategate the change became even more visible to viewers and listeners .
Reports say they have been under pressure from editors to " get more sceptics on " .
One major beneficiary has been Benny Peiser from the Global Warming Policy Foundation , who has made repeated appearances of prime - time BBC news .
" We are , " one correspondent said privately , " back to the false balance days that chiefs swore had been left behind . "
Beyond the two tribes
What about science itself ?
Science is about producing findings that others can test by trying to replicate or falsify them .
That is how theories and bolstered , how bad theories discarded and how knowledge is advanced .
Some experiments are easy to replicate .
All you need is a lab .
Others are more complicated .
And few are more complicated than those based on huge amounts of data assembled from all over the world over many decades .
Both Jones 's temperature data and Mann 's proxy data of past temperatures fall into this category .
That is one reason why sceptics , rightly or wrongly , have been able to claim that bad science has proliferated in climate research .
That is why the demands for scientists to release their data , even to people outside the research community , have grown .
But it is also why researchers who have spent years , sometimes decades , assembling their data , are unwilling to hand it out to the first blogger to ask for it under a Freedom of Information request .
For sceptics like Steve McIntyre , the central issue is the principle that scientific findings are only valid if they can be replicated .
And some scientists recognise that .
Stephen Schneider of Stanford University in California and editor of the Climate Change journal , said in an email to CRU scientists and others in January 2009 : " Our best way of dealing with this issue of replication is to have multiple independent author teams , with their own codes and data sets , publishing independent work on the same topics ...
That is how credible scientific replication should proceed . "
But is it enough to ensure replication among the close network of scientists ?
Do non-scientists , or amateur scientists , or scientists who run politically charged blogs , have an equal right to share scientific data ?
Jones believes not .
In October 2009 he wrote an email to Graham Haughton , a geographer at the University of Hull , about how " science should be conducted through the peer - review literature , as it has been for over 300 years .
The peer - review system is the safeguard science has developed to stop bad science being published . "
But many are beginning to disagree .
In the world of the internet and freedom of information laws , the balance is shifting towards more open access .
Some believe that Jones 's cherished peer - review system is itself in jeopardy .
And not before time , says McIntyre .
" I do n't think there should be any issue of drawing up special rules for outsiders .
I simply ask that scientists live up to their own policies , " he says .
" There is an unseemliness about scientists willingly providing data to their friends and resisting the provision of data to people who are perceived as critics . "
One in the mainstream who agrees is Judy Curry , a climate scientist at the Georgia Institute of Technology .
She cut her teeth in public debate after publishing a paper on climate change and hurricanes shortly after Katrina hit New Orleans .
She says much greater efforts are needed to open up science to outsiders .
Reviewing the saga of the leaked emails , she said the various datasets connected to Mann 's hockey stick studies and Jones 's CRU temperature data " stand out as lacking transparency .
The raw data behind the key graphs in the climate debate " were not preserved " by the analysts , she said , though it " presumably is available from the original sources " .
Rather than being stuck in the archives , it needs reprocessing and reanalysing , she believes .
She did n't blame anyone for this state of affairs , but said " given the growing policy relevance of climate data , increasingly higher standards must be applied . "
In an open letter to young scientists involved in climate research , she said she was " trying to figure out how to engage sceptics effectively ...
I have received significant heat from some colleagues for doing this ( I 've been told that I am legitimizing the sceptics and misleading my students ) . "
Far from it , she said .
" Ignoring sceptics from outside the field is inappropriate .
Einstein did n't start his career at Princeton , but rather at a post office .
Scientists claim they would never get any research done if they had to continuously respond to sceptics .
The counter to that argument is to make all of your data , metadata and code openly available .
Doing this would keep molehills from growing into mountains . "
Curry says climate science has fallen victim to tribalism .
" Climate tribes were established in response to the politically motivated climate disinformation machine ... The reaction of the climate tribes ... has been to circle the wagons and point the guns outward in an attempt to discredit misinformation . "
She had found herself in a political storm after publishing a paper on how the number of hurricanes had doubled in 35 years – probably due to rising sea temperatures .
By chance , the paper came out days after hurricane Katrina hit New Orleans .
" I and my colleagues were totally bewildered and overwhelmed by the assault we found ourselves under " from sceptics , she says .
" Associating with a tribe where others were more experienced and savvy about how to deal with this was a relief and very helpful at the time . "
Unlike another victim of the hurricanes fracas .
Kevin Trenberth , Curry does not appear in the leaked CRU emails .
She says that she subsequently fell out with some of her fellow tribes - people after congratulating McIntyre for his work on freeing up data .
And the hacked emails , she says , have reinforced her fears about " the systematic and continuing behaviour from scientists that hold editorial positions , serve on important boards and committees and participate in major assessment reports . "
Other leading figures are also looking for ways to defuse the tribalism .
Hans von Storch , a German meteorologist , often tries to arbitrate between sceptics and mainstream scientists .
In December 2009 , he wrote in the Wall Street Journal : " We need to repair the damage and heal the public 's new mistrust of the workings of climate science ....
The core of the knowledge about man-made climate change is simple and hard to contest .
[ Nonetheless ] data must be accessible to adversaries ; joint efforts are needed to agree on test procedures to validate , once again , already broadly accepted insights . "
He denounced the " CRU cartel " for their efforts to suppress open access to data .
Storch advised that " the authors of the damaging emails would be wise to stand back from positions as reviewers and participants in the IPCC process .
The journals Nature and Science must review their quality - control measures and selection criteria for papers . "
Meanwhile , he told the media and politicians : " You have the knowledge you need for the political decisions .
Let us [ scientists ] sit in our studies and discuss the remaining issues ...
Give us time to consider , to test alternative hypotheses , to falsify theories – to do our work without worrying if the results support our causes .
Science is a valuable and unique societal institution , but not if it is consumed by short - sighted political goals . "
And one of Jones 's former senior colleagues , ex-CRU research scientist Mike Hulme , joined with Oxford science philosopher Jerry Ravetz to write : " Climate scientists will have to work harder to earn the warranted trust of the public – and maybe that is no bad thing . "
But to do that , they said , science itself might have to change .
" This event might signal a crack that allows for processes of restructuring scientific knowledge of climate change .
It is possible that some areas of climate science have become sclerotic ... too partisan , too centralized .
The tribalism that some of the leaked emails display is something more usually associated with ... primitive cultures . "
Hulme and Ravetz called for a " major change in the relationships between science and the public " , with wider public scrutiny of its findings and methods using " the proliferating new communication media ... Science is a deeply human activity , and we need to be more honest about what this entails . "
Ravetz goes further .
He told the Guardian : " In retrospect , it is clear that the Norwich group were practising evangelical science .
For them there was a simple truth that would save us , and all naysayers were evil . "
After the war on drugs and the war on terror , we now had a war on carbon .
He called the " extended peer community " on the blogosphere " necessary for the health of science .
In spite of all the hazards of any extension of democracy , the rejuvenating effects must be good . "
" Climategate " seems set to lead to far greater openness about research data .
RealClimate , the climate science blogsite part - run by Mann , is promising to publish more data and relevant computer codes .
" We have set up a page of data links to sources of temperature and other climate data , codes to process it , model outputs , model codes , reconstructions , paleo - records , the codes involved in reconstructions etc , " it announced within a week of the leak .
" The climate science community fully understands how important it is that data sources are made as open and transparent as possible , for research purposes as well as for other interested parties ...
The providers of these online resources are very interested in getting feedback on any of these sites and so do n't hesitate to contact them if you want to see improvements . "
That is a sea-change from the days in the CRU bunker .
In response to the saga , Britain 's Met Office announced that it was putting into the public domain data on climate change from 1,700 stations round the world .
This was not as big a deal as it sounded .
Jones had told Nature magazine he was working on this back in July 2009 .
And , as the Met Office admitted , a lot of it was old data already " publicly available " through the World Meteorological Organization .
And , while it might disseminate foreign data , it wants to hang to much of its own data because , according to its spokesman David Britton , " We at the Met Office have to offset our costs for the benefit of the taxpayer , so we have to balance that against freedom of access . "
Like other recent battles over access to publicly held information , from lists of paedophiles to school league tables , those demanding freedom of information are winning .
But there look like being many battles ahead .
There is a separate question for the scientific journals themselves .
How much data should they require that scientists provide when they publish .
There seems little agreement on that at present .
The big two , Nature and Science , are relatively relaxed and demand little on top of what is required to allow the paper to pass muster with reviewers .
Schneider asked his board at Climate Change to consider the matter after McIntyre asked him for personal computer codes .
They decided that enough data should be provided to allow others , with the skill to write their own codes to replicate the findings .
But no more .
Others are tougher .
The Royal Society in London demands full data disclosure from contributors to its Philosophical Transactions .
Schneider told the Guardian there might be some middle ground – especially over researchers ' highly prized and personally written computer codes .
Maybe , like commercial patents , they should be allowed exclusive use of their own codes , as their own intellectual property , for two or three years .
That , he said , would be time enough to " publish the initial papers using their hard work " .
But after that , the codes should all be disclosed .
He added : " This broad discussion about the boundaries of data transparency , personal codes and exclusive rights ... may be the only positive that might emerge from this unfortunate incident . "
But many sceptics are not satisfied with such half - way houses .
Many sceptic bloggers are in full cry against the entire peer review process .
They talk about " peer - to - peer " review .
Meaning an end to centralised control through journals and a free for all in which everything is published and anyone can comment on anything .
A journalist active in this movement , the West Coast former street artist and radical arts critic Patrick Courrielche , claims : " Climategate ... triggered the death of unconditional trust in the scientific peer - review process , and the maturing of a new movement of peer - to - peer review . "
Can an entirely free intellectual market deliver better science ?
Can the pioneers of scientific review on the blogosphere do better than the journals ?
Would this ensure quality control or shatter it ?
Should the Jeffrey Archers of the scientific world have as much access to the journals as the Nobel laureates ?
They may shudder in the labs , but we may one day find out .

How Coverity built a bug - finding tool , and a business , around the unlimited supply of bugs in software systems .
This is a fascinating piece by Dawson Engler & co. on their experiences in commercializing their static analysis research through Coverity .
It 's an entertaining read , with many interesting anecdotes from various customers .
But it also contains a number of useful insights about the difference between a research tool and a commercial product , the kinds of static analyses that do and do n't make sense in a commercial context , and the multitude of problems caused by the lack of programming language standardization :
Checking code deeply requires understanding the code 's semantics .
The most basic requirement is that you parse it .
Parsing is considered a solved problem .
Unfortunately , this view is naÃ¯ve , rooted in the widely believed myth that programming languages exist .
There 's a lot of useful information in there for anyone interested in industrial - strength static analysis .
There are also a lot of worthwhile things to keep in mind if you 're designing a programming language , and want to make sure it's as friendly as possible to future static analysis tools .
Diners who are skeptical of the food safety practices in ethnic restaurants have new research to back up some of their assumptions .
In a study of independently owned restaurants in 14 Kansas counties , Kansas State University researchers found a significantly higher number of food safety violations in ethnic restaurants than in non-ethnic restaurants .
The next step for their research is to understand the reasons for these differences and to work alongside restaurant operators to remedy the problems .
Leading the study were Junehee Kwon , associate professor , and Kevin Roberts , assistant professor , both of the department of hospitality management and dietetics .
They found that independently owned ethnic restaurants had significantly more violations for several food safety categories , including time and temperature control , hand washing and proper use of utensils .
The independent ethnic restaurants in the study also had more inspections than their nonethnic counterparts .
Kwon said many of those repeat visits were driven by customer complaints .
The research will appear in an upcoming issue of the journal Food Protection Trends .
Co-authors are Carol Shanklin , dean of the K - State Graduate School , and Pei Liu and Wen S.F .
Yen , doctoral students in human ecology .
Because independent operations do n't have the support of a corporate office that sets policies and organizes food safety training programs , the researchers would like to see their studies help independently - owned ethnic restaurants improve their food handling and , eventually , food safety records .
Underscoring the importance of this study , Kwon said U.S. census data indicate that restaurants are one of the most common businesses for immigrants to start .
" There are some challenges to ethnic restaurants , " Kwon said .
" We can't tell what they are yet .
We do n't know what operators know and think about opening a restaurant in the United States and following the regulations .
It 's likely they have different perceptions of the risk of inadequate food safety , as well as the language barrier . "
Roberts and colleagues are pursuing funding to study the barriers that keep employees from understanding and practicing food safety techniques .
His co-principal investigators are Kwon and Kevin Sauer , assistant professor in the department of hospitality management and dietetics .
" What we want to do with the new project , should it be funded , is to look at whether it is a cultural thing and learn what we can do in food training programs , " Roberts said .
" Now , programs only deal with knowledge , but it does n't persuade people to change their behaviors . "
Kwon said she looks forward to working with the Hispanic Chamber of Commerce of Greater Dallas and hopes to collaborate with Hispanic Chambers of Commerce in Kansas locations to reach more restaurant owners and employees .
She said collaborating with owners on research can be difficult because of skepticism that some immigrants have about government involvement in their businesses .
To understand different food safety perceptions among foreign nationalities , Roberts and a graduate student are pursuing research that will ask international students at K - State about their countries ' cultural norms and food safety attitudes .

agent.strip_query = true
Note :
If YARD documentation generation fails when installing Spidr 0.2.2 , this is due to a bug in RDoc / Simple Markup generation .
We ’ve always known that America ’s reign as the world ’s greatest nation would eventually end .
But most of us imagined that our downfall , when it came , would be something grand and tragic .
What we ’re getting instead is less a tragedy than a deadly farce .
Instead of fraying under the strain of imperial overstretch , we ’re paralyzed by procedure .
Instead of re-enacting the decline and fall of Rome , we ’re re-enacting the dissolution of 18th - century Poland .
A brief history lesson :
In the 17th and 18th centuries , the Polish legislature , the Sejm , operated on the unanimity principle : any member could nullify legislation by shouting “ I do not allow ! ”
This made the nation largely ungovernable , and neighboring regimes began hacking off pieces of its territory .
By 1795 Poland had disappeared , not to re-emerge for more than a century .
Today , the U.S. Senate seems determined to make the Sejm look good by comparison .
Last week , after nine months , the Senate finally approved Martha Johnson to head the General Services Administration , which runs government buildings and purchases supplies .
It ’s an essentially nonpolitical position , and nobody questioned Ms. Johnson ’s qualifications : she was approved by a vote of 94 to 2 .
But Senator Christopher Bond , Republican of Missouri , had put a “ hold ” on her appointment to pressure the government into approving a building project in Kansas City .
The OCAA report , Finishing the coal phase out :
An historic opportunity for climate leadership , recommends that Ontario ’s coal plants be placed on standby reserve and only operated in the event of a power emergency where there is no other option “ to keep the lights on in Ontario . ”
“ This means we no longer need our dirty coal plants to keep the lights on in Ontario or to ensure a reliable electricity supply , ” says Angela Bischoff , Outreach Director OCAA .
The study , released Thursday by the Ontario Clean Air Alliance ( OCAA ) , concludes that Ontario ’s coal - free generation capacity was 23 per cent greater than our forecast peak day demand in the summer of 2010 and 27 per cent greater than our forecast peak day demand in 2014 .
A new report shows that Ontario ’s coal - free generation capacity now exceeds our peak day demands , making it possible to eliminate the province ’s coal plants before the G20 Summit at the end of June .

As I was growing up , on Friday nights my friend Marsha and I would sometimes stay in each others ’ homes .
When we were younger we played with Barbies and as we got older we listened to our stack of 45 records .
Having no siblings of my own , I always enjoyed their family meal time and the lively interactions between Marsha and her brothers and sisters .
But most of all , I was in amazement of Marsha ’s mom .
A beautiful dark - haired woman with soft white skin who sewed wonderful dresses for her girls and made the best lasagna in the world , she was also a screamer and every good cuss word I knew I learned around that family dinner table .
Marsha ’s family was also very religiously devout and she was never allowed to miss any church or church related activities .
Ever .
And this brought a lot of confusion into my 4th grade mind .
How does someone who professes to be a Christian and who is so committed to the church , justify using such abusive language , especially repeatedly taking the name of God in vain ?
Such blasphemy will certainly be punished by death , we are assured in Scripture .
If you are a believer , I am certain this picture causes you to cringe as it did me .
So , as I have considered last week ’s news reports of yet another child beaten to death in the “ name of Christ , ” this time over a child ’s spelling error ( I can not think of any reason whatsoever that would justify such a horror ) , I cannot help but think of the blasphemy of God ’s name these parents have committed .
Evil in the name of “ godly discipline ” is still evil .
Murdering a child , for any reason , is still murder .
Hiding behind God as you murder a child and evoking
His name in the process is blasphemy of the worst sort .
It ought to make us do more than cringe .
Lest anyone think this sort of abuse is an isolated case , let me remind you of some of the situations and teachings I know of that I believe qualify as abuse against children , most of them involving physical abuse , all of these done in the “ name of Christ , ” many of them also done or encouraged in the name of “ homeschool discipline . ”
~ Mike and Debi Pearl
The highly favored book To Train Up A Child by Michael and Debi Pearl , is credited by both the Schatz family and the Paddock family as their go - to book on child discipline .
Here is just one quote from TTUAC : “ If you have to sit on him to spank him then do not hesitate .
And hold him there until he is surrendered .
Prove that you are bigger , tougher , more patiently enduring and are unmoved by his wailing .
Defeat him totally .
Accept no conditions for surrender .
No compromise .
You are to rule over him as a benevolent sovereign .
Your word is final . ”
This is just the tip of the iceberg ; an unbiblical philosophy and theology of power and control is behind their suggestions for discipline .
Please follow the link for much good information and analysis of the Pearls and their teachings on raising children .
( Note : Citing his own wife ’s example and teaching , I once had a pastor tell me that removing a wiggly toddler from worship service and holding him down until he thought being in worship was better was the way parents were to behave in his church .
When I informed him I would not be treating any children in that manner , but rather would be reading to them and coloring with them instead , I was rebuked . )
~ Hephzibah House for “ wayward ” girls Personal testimonies of physical , verbal , emotional , and spiritual abuse abound as grown women are now coming forward to warn of this “ ministry . ”
I know of several homeschooling families who have seen this place as the solution for daughters who were in rebellion , real or imagined , to authority .
~ Bill Gothard ’s Indianapolis Training Headquarters and Alert Programs Established in 1993 as both a training center for homeschoolers who were part of the Advanced Training Institute and as an arm of the juvenile court system in Indianapolis .
A 10 - part investigative news report , complete with hidden camera footage and personal testimony , reported : “ Inside a converted 300 - room hotel , the prayer closet is a little room where kids are taken when they disobey staff at the Indianapolis Training Center ( ITC ) .
Once locked inside , the misbehaving youths are forced to sit and pray to Jesus , sometimes for days at a time .
Some juvenile ITC residents have said the evangelical Christian teens and young adults who staffed the center sometimes forbade them from going to the bathroom , forcing them to sit in their own urine for hours .
Some have complained of beatings with paddles by untrained staff that left bruises and welts .
When not in isolation , the kids are forced to march and chant and pray , with gospel music playing almost constantly . ”
The ALERT program for young men , a paramilitary experience that promotes “ character training ” includes similar tales .
The father of one young man who attended an alert training told my husband how their son was injured during a 20 mile hike in an isolated training center in the north woods .
When he asked for medical attention , he was chastised for being wimpy and forced to march the distance back to camp , experiencing severe physical pain and verbal abuse as he did .
When he was finally able to get medical attention , doctors treated him for a broken leg and sent him back to his family .
~ William Einwechter , pastor , homeschooling advocate , writer , and highly promoted and revered conference speaker with Vision Forum , advocates laws that would require the stoning of rebellious teenagers as part of his “ dominion theology . ”
Here are some of his thoughts : “ The word “ rebellious ” means , literally , to strike or lash , and is used of those who contend against authority and refuse to heed their words .
The “ rebellious ” individual lashes out in contempt against those who have authority over them verbally , and perhaps even physically .
In light of this , it is important to note that the Law of the Covenant prescribes death for anyone who strikes his parents ( Ex. 21:15 ) or curses his parents ( Ex. 21:17 ) .
There is , therefore , reason to suppose that the son in this case law has broken the Law of the Covenant in one or both of these ways .
The parents also describe the character of their son as being a “ glutton ” and a “ drunkard . ”
These sins are put forth as examples of a life lived without restraint .
In the case of such rebellion and riotous living , and after all attempts at discipline and control have failed , the parents are to bring their son before the magistrates for judgment .
If the magistrates concur in the parents ’ estimate of the situation , they are to order the men of the city to stone the rebel with stones so that he dies ( vv. 20 - 21 ) .
The purpose to be served in the execution of the rebellious son is to “ put evil away from among you ” and that all will “ hear and fear ” ( v.21 ) . ” ( Note : Any mention within some homeschooling circles of sins that parents commit against their children is often met with rebuke and belittling , minimizing the behaviors that drive children to rebellion .
Adult children who continue to suffer from such behavior growing up are told to “ get over it ” or “ just stop it . ” )
~ Richard Fugate
His book
What the Bible Says About Child Training is a popular find at homeschooling conventions and was the first book I read that talked about physically beating a child until you see repentance .
Fugate , stating that the Bible “ commands ” the use of the rod , advocates using actual “ rods , ” listing the various sizes appropriate for each age group and includes the note to parents that “ welts ” and “ stripes ” will result , depending on how rebellious the child is .
One mother interpreted Fugate ’s writings in this way in an online forum : “ Have you read Richard Fugate ’s book , “ What The Bible Says About Child Training ” ?
It is the only book I can truly recommend on discipline .
( You can borrow mine if you want but I would recommend buying it eventually . )
I use a wooden dowel for spanking ; believe me it is painful .
The discipline must be more painful than the joy of getting what they want when they disobey .
Most moms go wrong in that the spanking is n’t severe enough , or long enough .
If you just give a few swats , it will only make them mad , not bring them to repentance !
I give about 5 hard swats and I tell them that if they disobey again it will be harder and more swats .
It really hurts and they are in pain and screaming .
If he just sniffles , you are doing more damage than good . ”
These examples do n’t even touch the emotional , verbal , and spiritual abuse that is often part of the mentality within the church on raising children .
From naming “ shyness ” as a sin to telling daughters they have no calling of their own from the Lord to excommunicating children who make different , not sinful but different , life choices than a parent would choose , abuse rears its ugly head in many ways .
I pray that the church will wake up and see children as Jesus saw them , as crucial to His kingdom , precious in His sight , the least of these .
May this latest carnage serve as a wake - up call .
“ The King will answer and say to them , ‘ Truly I say to you , to the extent that you did it to one of these brothers of Mine , even the least of them , you did it to Me. ” Matthew 25:40

FORT LAUDERDALE , Fla . --
The question to DeMaurice Smith was simple , coming from Cincinnati receiver Chad Ochocinco , asking how serious he viewed the possibility of football not being played in 2011 .
Smith did not hesitate .
" On a scale of 1 to 10 , " Smith said Thursday , " it 's a 14 . "
With that , the executive director of the NFL Players Association painted perhaps the bleakest picture yet regarding prospects of labor strife in the league , which could be looking at a 2010 season with no salary cap and , if the collective bargaining agreement expires as scheduled in March 2011 , a lockout that year .
" I keep coming back to an economic model in America that is unparalleled , " said Smith , who often repeated phrases for emphasis .
" And that makes it incredibly difficult to then come to players and say , on average , each of you needs to take a $ 340,000 pay cut to save the National Football League .
Tough sell .
Tough sell . "
Smith said the NFL would receive $ 5 billion from its network television deals even if no games are played in 2011 .
He regarded that as proof owners are preparing for a lockout .
About the author
( NewsTarget )
In response to growing awareness about the dangers of artificial sweeteners , what does the manufacturer of one of the world 's most notable artificial sweeteners do ?
Why , rename it and begin marketing it as natural , of course .
This is precisely the strategy of Ajinomoto , maker of aspartame , which hopes to pull the wool over the eyes of the public with its rebranded version of aspartame , called " AminoSweet " .
Over 25 years ago , aspartame was first introduced into the European food supply .
Today , it is an everyday component of most diet beverages , sugar - free desserts , and chewing gums in countries worldwide .
But the tides have been turning as the general public is waking up to the truth about artificial sweeteners like aspartame and the harm they cause to health .
The latest aspartame marketing scheme is a desperate effort to indoctrinate the public into accepting the chemical sweetener as natural and safe , despite evidence to the contrary .
Aspartame was an accidental discovery by James Schlatter , a chemist who had been trying to produce an anti-ulcer pharmaceutical drug for G.D. Searle & Company back in 1965 .
Upon mixing aspartic acid and phenylalanine , two naturally - occurring amino acids , he discovered that the new compound had a sweet taste .
The company merely changed its FDA approval application from drug to food additive and , voila , aspartame was born .
G.D. Searle & Company first patented aspartame in 1970 .
An internal memo released in the same year urged company executives to work on getting the FDA into the " habit of saying yes " and of encouraging a " subconscious spirit of participation " in getting the chemical approved .
G.D. Searle & Company submitted its first petition to the FDA in 1973 and fought for years to gain FDA approval , submitting its own safety studies that many believed were inadequate and deceptive .
Despite numerous objections , including one from its own scientists , the company was able to convince the FDA to approve aspartame for commercial use in a few products in 1974 , igniting a blaze of controversy .
In 1976 , then FDA Commissioner Alexander Schmidt wrote a letter to Sen .
Ted Kennedy expressing concern over the " questionable integrity of the basic safety data submitted for aspartame safety " .
FDA Chief Counsel Richard Merrill believed that a grand jury should investigate G.D. Searle & Company for lying about the safety of aspartame in its reports and for concealing evidence proving the chemical is unsafe for consumption .
Despite the myriad of evidence gained over the years showing that aspartame is a dangerous toxin , it has remained on the global market with the exception of a few countries that have banned it .
In fact , it continued to gain approval for use in new types of food despite evidence showing that it causes neurological brain damage , cancerous tumors , and endocrine disruption , among other things .
The details of aspartame 's history are lengthy , but the point remains that the carcinogen was illegitimately approved as a food additive through heavy - handed prodding by a powerful corporation with its own interests in mind .
Practically all drugs and food additives are approved by the FDA not because science shows they are safe but because companies essentially lobby the FDA with monetary payoffs and complete the agency 's multi-million dollar approval process .
Changing aspartame 's name to something that is " appealing and memorable " , in Ajinomoto 's own words , may hoodwink some but hopefully most will reject this clever marketing tactic as nothing more than a desperate attempt to preserve the company 's multi-billion dollar cash cow .
Do not be deceived .

Make has a link to a pretty interesting discussion on the ‘ The Home Shop Machinist & Machinist ’s Workshop BBS ’ about using a Watts or Reuleaux drill to make a square hole .
Now the idea of using a spinning drill bit to create a square hole is kind of counter - intuitive , but the animation on the right , while not exactly what a Watts drill looks like , helps you wrap your head around the concept .
And if you find yourself amazed at this new innovation in machining , you might also be surprised to learn that the idea is n’t a new one , and Harry J. Watts , for whom the drill is named after , actually received a patent ( # 1,241,176 ) for it on September 25 , 1917 .

Seriously ?
Nearly a third of Texans believe humans and dinosaurs roamed the earth at the same time , and more than half disagree with the theory that humans developed from earlier species of animals , according to the University of Texas / Texas Tribune Poll .
And is anyone surprised to know that Republicans are more likely than Democrats to believe this crap ?
Extra fun fact : supporters of Kay Bailey Hutchison are even more likely to believe this crap .
Here are some other fun " facts " they believe :
38 percent agreed with the statement " God created human beings pretty much in their present form about 10,000 years ago . "
22 percent said life has existed in its present form since the beginning of time
51 percent disagreed with the statement , " human beings , as we know them today , developed from earlier species of animals . "
only 41 percent know that humans did not live at the same time as the dinosaurs
Maybe instead of rewriting textbooks to teach kids that Newt Gingrich was the most important man ever , Texas should focus on teaching kids that , as Lewis Black said , " The Flintstones " is not a documentary .
Here 's the premise : you take a good old fashioned augmented reality setup , the likes of which we 've seen all over the land , and attach a three - dimensional , rotatable iPhone to it .
Not impressed yet , are you ?
Neither were we , but there 's some secret sauce to this one : you can actually launch apps on the simulated iPhone .
That extra layer of interactivity makes the video after the break a lot more fascinating than it has any right to be , though it 's worth pointing out that we do n't think the apps are actually usable -- they just give the illusion of launching .
Anyhow , do n't wait around while all the cool kids are watching it , go have a gander yourself .
When the City University of New York ’s Graduate Center decided to convene last night ’s session of its Great Issues Forum around the question , “ What Are the Varieties of Unbelief ? ” they seem to have tried as best they could to avoid a New Atheist - style foodfight .
The name itself gestures to the title of a 1964 book by Martin Marty , the great , level - headed historian of American religion .
Moderating was Gustav Niebuhr , a journalist and scholar who comes with a mainline namesake and a new book about religious tolerance .
In the unbelieving corner was Susan Jacoby , the journalist and author whom that very day Stephen Prothero in USA Today called a “ gentler atheist , ” together with philosopher Colin McGinn , who claimed not to find religion a particularly stimulating subject .
The lone theist was Denys Turner of Yale , whose “ ascetic ” approach makes him so eager to “ internalize ” atheist critiques that there ’s hardly anything left for him to argue about .
But despite its atmosphere of moderation and tolerance , the event found its way into the pugilism that characterizes today ’s atheism - religion debates .
Even though Richard Dawkins was n’t in the room , and despite the fact that nobody who was had much nice to say about him , his name seemed to have been invoked more than God’s .
This revealed just how much the varieties of unbelief today — when argued about in the public square , at least — define themselves mainly in terms of how and why they agree of disagree with Dawkins ’s 2006 book The God Delusion .
Colin McGinn laid out the clearest set of “ varieties ” : agnosticism ( undecided about God ) , anti-theism ( opposed to belief in God ) , atheism ( do n’t believe in God ) , and post - theism ( God is no longer a live issue ) .
Jacoby , in homage to the 19th - century American orator Robert Ingersoll , argued in turn that the first three actually amount to the same thing — a reasonable denial that a God exists .
The fiercer argument , however , broke out between McGinn and Turner ; despite Niebuhur ’s welcome efforts to turn their attention back to the question at hand , they ventured into a familiar foundationalist dispute : is belief in God properly basic , placing the burden of proof on atheists , or should atheism be our starting point ?
Turner insisted that the God McGinn has in mind is a caricature , not the God of truly rigorous theology .
To prove his point , he repeatedly stated his agreement with the bulk of the atheists ’ convictions , including the coherence of science and the possibility of moral norms without God .
The dispute got heated as they each went after the other ’s straw men , though Niebuhr finally managed to break it up before any headway could be made .
Jacoby , who identified herself as the only non-philosopher of the three , had less abstract starting points .
For her , secularism is fundamentally a way of thinking about the world in terms of human flourishing in this life .
The two others agreed : secularism , as they put it , is a “ methodology ” and not a belief system .
It can be practiced by theists and atheists alike .
But Jacoby says that in recent years , after witnessing her partner ’s decline into Alzheimer ’s disease and eventual passing , she learned that atheism could be something more .
It was , during that difficult time , “ an animating principle involving reason and emotion . ”
She was deeply grateful not to have to think of his suffering as something ordained by a God , but as simply a happenstance of nature .
For her , the problems of evil and suffering are central to all unbelief : “ I think everything who stops believing in God stops believing because of that . ”
At the end , Niebuhr asked the participants to recommend a book or two for further reading .
McGinn , reminding us that this is n’t a subject he cares much about , halfheartedly mentioned Bertrand Russell and Richard Dawkins , though admitting that he finds Dawkins boring .
Jacoby said she would not recommend her “ good friend ” Dawkins , but instead Rebecca Newberger Goldstein ’s Betraying Spinoza ( also noted in Prothero ’s USA Today piece ) .
Turner , in turn , suggested the Oxford Dominican Herbert McCabe ’s God Matters .
For somebody nobody likes much , Richard Dawkins came up constantly .
At one point , McGinn even had a revelation — something he said he ’d never thought about before — which was a nearly verbatim recitation of Dawkins ’s oft - rehearsed reminder that even Christians are atheists about all the other gods , and that he ’s going only one God further .
They supposedly do n’t like the silver - haired biologist , but it is hard to know what would have kept the panelists going without him to define themselves against .
The varieties of unbelief may be richer and more sophisticated than Dawkins lets on , but in the absence of his extreme position , the others might never find expression .

First Try
Using scipy .
weave and SSE2 intrinsics gives a marginal improvement .
The first invocation is a bit slower since the code needs to be loaded from the disk and cached , subsequent invocations are faster :
import numpy import time from os import urandom from scipy import weave SIZE = 2** 20 def faster_slow_xor ( aa , bb ) : b = numpy .
fromstring ( bb , dtype=numpy.uint64 ) numpy.bitwise_xor(numpy.frombuffer(aa,dtype=numpy.uint64 ) , b , b ) return b.tostring ( ) code = " " " const __m128i* pa = ( __m128i* ) a ; const __m128i* pend = ( __m128i* ) ( a + arr_size ) ; __m128i* pb = ( __m128i* ) b ; __m128i xmm1 , xmm2 ; while ( pa < pend ) { xmm1 = _mm_loadu_si128( pa ) ; // must use unaligned access xmm2 = _mm_load_si128( pb ) ; // numpy will align at 16 byte boundaries _mm_store_si128( pb , _mm_xor_si128( xmm1 , xmm2 ) ) ; ++ pa ; ++pb ; } " " " def inline_xor ( aa , bb ) : a = numpy.
frombuffer(aa , dtype=numpy.uint64 ) b = numpy.fromstring ( bb , dtype=numpy.uint64 ) arr_size = a.shape [ 0 ] weave .
inline ( code , [ " a " , " b " , " arr_size " ] , headers = [ ' " emmintrin.h " ' ] ) return b.tostring ( )
Second Try
Taking into account the comments , I revisited the code to find out if the copying could be avoided .
Turns out I read the documentation of the string object wrong , so here goes my second try :
support = " " " # define ALIGNMENT 16 static void memxor ( const char* in1 , const char* in2 , char * out , ssize_t n ) { const char * end = in1 + n ; while ( in1 < end ) { * out = *in1 ^ *in2 ; ++in1 ; ++in2 ; ++out ; } } " " " code2 = " " " PyObject * res = PyString_FromStringAndSize( NULL , real_size ) ; const ssize_t tail = ( ssize_t ) PyString_AS_STRING( res ) % ALIGNMENT ; const ssize_t head = ( ALIGNMENT - tail ) % ALIGNMENT ; memxor ( ( const char * ) a , ( const char * ) b , PyString_AS_STRING( res ) , head ) ; const __m128i* pa = ( __m128i* ) ( ( char * ) a + head ) ; const __m128i* pend = ( __m128i* ) ( ( char * ) a + real_size - tail ) ; const __m128i* pb = ( __m128i* ) ( ( char* ) b + head ) ; __m128i xmm1 , xmm2 ; __m128i* pc = ( __m128i*)( PyString_AS_STRING( res ) + head ) ; while ( pa < pend ) { xmm1 = _mm_loadu_si128( pa ) ; xmm2 = _mm_loadu_si128( pb ) ; _mm_stream_si128(pc , _mm_xor_si128(xmm1 , xmm2 ) ) ; ++ pa ; ++pb ; ++pc ; } memxor ( ( const char* ) pa , ( const char * ) pb , ( char * ) pc , tail ) ; return_val = res ; Py_DECREF ( res ) ; " " " def inline_xor_nocopy ( aa , bb ) : real_size = len ( aa ) a = numpy .
frombuffer(aa , dtype=numpy.uint64 ) b = numpy.frombuffer(bb , dtype=numpy.uint64 ) return weave.inline ( code2 , [ " a " , " b " , " real_size " ] , headers = [ ' " emmintrin.h " ' ] , support_code = support )
The difference is that the string is allocated inside the C code .
It 's impossible to have it aligned at a 16 - byte - boundary as required by the SSE2 instructions , therefore the unaligned memory regions at the beginning and the end are copied using byte - wise access .
The input data is handed in using numpy arrays anyway , because weave insists on copying Python str objects to std:: string s. frombuffer does n't copy , so this is fine , but the memory is not aligned at 16 byte , so we need to use _mm_loadu_si128 instead of the faster _mm_load_si128 .
Instead of using _mm_store_si128 , we use _mm_stream_si128 , which will make sure that any writes are streamed to main memory as soon as possible --- this way , the output array does not use up valuable cache lines .
Timings
As for the timings , the slow_xor entry in the first edit referred to my improved version ( inline bitwise xor , uint64 ) , I removed that confusion .
slow_xor refers to the code from the original questions .
All timings are done for 1000 runs .
slow_xor : 1.85s ( 1 x )
: 1.85s ( 1x ) faster_slow_xor : 1.25s ( 1.48 x )
: 1.25s ( 1.48 x ) inline_xor : 0.95s ( 1.95 x )
: 0.95s ( 1.95 x ) inline_xor_nocopy : 0.32s ( 5.78 x )
The code was compiled using gcc 4.4.3 and I 've verified that the compiler actually uses the SSE instructions .
Ah , Atlus .
For better or worse , you ’re always thinking outside the box .
And yet you still never return my calls .
I mean …anyway , I was wandering about the Atlus website when I came across this little gem .
It ’s like Lego meets Zelda meets Dragon Quest meets … um … parody .
Lots and lots of parody .
Delicious parody .
But apparently , it ’s all pretty well done .
I ’ve looked into some info on the game in Japan , and it ’s well - loved .
Granted , it ’s highly reminiscent of some very familiar games , but it apparently does a good job of standing on its own , as well .
I wish I could tell you more , but details are scarce ; as of this post , there is n’t even a full website for the North American release .
But here are some predictions for 3D Dot Game Heroes :
1. Atlus will only make a limited run of the game .
Then , it will become a collector ’s item .
Atlus is n’t nearly as popular here as it is in Japan .
2 . This game will either be very good or mediocre .
Atlus is usually hit - or - miss .
I ’m not expecting anything in - between .
Here ’s hoping they hit it out of the park .
This game looks pretty good !
I ’ll try to give you some more information as the release date approaches .
And while you ’re waiting for this game , pick up Persona !

Over five - hundred people , armed with banners , signs , and stories of health insurance industry abuse rallied at the Minneapolis United Labor Center Sunday afternoon to demonstrate that people across the country want Congress to deliver on the change people voted for by finishing comprehensive health care right .
The rally ’s keynote was delivered by U.S. Senator Al Franken , who earlier this week , had signed on to a letter asking Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid to use the budget reconciliation process to pass the public option .
Reconciliation would require only fifty Senate votes , plus the Vice - President , and has given many people hope that passage of a public option may still be possible .
In opening remarks , Bill McCarthy , President of the Minneapolis Regional Labor Federation , praised Franken for his leadership on federal health care reform and called the Senator " a fighter and champion of Minnesota ’s working families . "
McCarthy said " workers across the country are at the mercy of insurance companies ’ soaring premiums , denied claims and inflated profits .
It ’s time Washington listened to those that elected them , not corporate insurers . "
Franken took the stage to thunderous applause midway through the rally .
Citing insurance industry profits which continue to rise despite a weak economy , Franken told the packed hall " I think you know why they ’re fighting us . "
He warned that people " ca n’t let the perfect be the enemy of the very , very good " referencing tea party protesters who picketed outside the hall .
Promising to fight to make sure health care costs are lowered and quality goes up for all Americans , Franken concluded saying " All I can tell you is we ’re going to get this done . "
Rally attendees included members of the Minnesota Health Care for America NOW ( HCAN ) coalition , Organizing for America ( OFA ) , MoveOn , ISAIAH , labor and progressive organizations .
Sunday ’s attendees were united in the need for Congress to rein in corporate greed , create more jobs , protect workers ’ rights and achieve comprehensive , affordable health care for all Americans .
The rally was part of a week - long nationwide push insisting Congress act now on health care reform and listen to everyday Americans , and not insurance industry lobbyists who have spent record amounts to block health care reform and protect their profits .
Sharon Sund of MoveOn told the crowd " enough is enough .
Congress has been debating health care reform for over a year .
We voted for change and we want results now . "
The Minneapolis rally precedes a bi-partisan , televised health reform summit scheduled with President Obama on Thursday .
Port - au - Prince , Haiti ( CNN ) --
Ten Americans detained and accused of child trafficking in Haiti after they allegedly tried to bus 33 children into the Dominican Republic insist their effort was an attempt to get the children to a shelter .
But Haiti's prime minister said Sunday that the group was kidnapping the children .
" From what I know until now , this is a kidnapping case , " Jean - Max Bellerive told CNN .
" Who is doing it -- I do n't know .
What are the real objectives or activities -- I do n't know .
But that is kidnapping and it is more serious because it 's involving children , " he said .
" The children certainly were not fully willing to go , because in some cases , from what I heard , they were asking for their parents , they wanted to return to their parents . "
How far should aid workers go ?
U.S. embassy officials visited the Americans over the weekend at a jail near the airport in Port - au - Prince , where they are being detained .
They are being treated well and are holding on to their faith , the Americans said .
" We came into Haiti to help those that really had no other source of help , " Laura Silsby , a member of the Idaho - based charity , New Life Children 's Refuge , told CNN on Saturday .
" We are trusting the truth will be revealed and we are praying for that . "
Full coverage
The group of five men and five women said they were trying to move the children to the Dominican Republic in the aftermath of the January 12 earthquake that devastated parts of Haiti , flattening the capital and killing tens of thousands .
But a Haitian judge has charged the 10 with child trafficking , they said .
The U.S. Embassy in Port - au - Prince said Sunday that the Americans have been detained for " alleged violations of Haitian laws related to immigration . "
" God is our provider and God gives us strength and comfort , " said Carla Thompson , one group member .
" We have our Bibles and we are OK . "
Government approval is needed for any Haitian children to leave the country , and the group acknowledged that the children have no passports .
Jeanne Bernard - Pierre , general director for Haiti's Institute of Social Welfare , said the children will be interviewed in the coming days to determine whether they have living relatives .
Search for the missing
The group said it believed the children were orphaned , and it was going to house them in a converted hotel in the Dominican Republic .
George Willeit of SOS Children 's Villages -- who said that Haitian police and the social ministry brought the children to his group -- said some of the children have living relatives .
" Some of them for sure are not orphans , " he told CNN .
" Immediately after she arrived here , a girl -- she might be 9 years old -- was crying loudly , ' I am not an orphan , I do have my parents , please call my parents , ' " he said .
" And some of the other kids as well , they have their phone numbers , even , with them from their parents , " he said .
He said he believes that at least 10 are not orphans .
Mel Coulter , the father of 23 - year - old Charisa Coulter , who is among those arrested , told CNN affiliate KTVB that the group thought it had all of the necessary documents to transport the children out of the earthquake - ravaged country , but apparently lacked some paperwork .
" They want to bring kids out who have no home , who have no parents , who have no hope -- and this was an attempt to give them the hope that they 've lost in Haiti , " he said Saturday .
The group " went down on Thursday night fully expecting that they had everything they needed , all the documentation that they needed , " he said .
" When they tried to bring some of the kids out [ Friday ] night they were stopped at the border and [ they ] said that there was a paper missing , " he said .
" So they returned to Port - au - Prince , where they went in early [ Saturday ] morning to try and get the last documentation , and apparently were arrested on the spot and jailed . "
He said the group wants " to do everything according to the processes that are required . "
The Rev. Clint Henry , the senior pastor with Central Valley Baptist Church in Meridian , Idaho , where at least some of the group members worship , told KTVB Sunday that the church was hopeful that the group would soon be released .
" We 're waiting ... and hoping and praying that that outcome will be the one that we 're looking for , so the team that has been falsely charged will be vindicated , and that the whole world is going to know that we were n't here doing the kind of things we 're being accused of doing , " he said .
He said the accusations have prompted a number of phone calls to the church that include " obscenities , accusations about those false rumors , things that I do n't care to repeat . "
The children were being rescued from " one or more orphanages " that had been damaged in the quake , a statement on the church 's Web site said .
Henry told CNN affiliate KIVI Saturday that the group had been planning to build an orphanage in the Dominican Republic , but that the earthquake sped up the timetable for transporting the Haitian children there .
" We were n't ready to start this yet , everything was in process , " he said , and the construction on the orphanage has not yet begun .
Many of the children said they are from Fort Jacques , a town about seven miles from Port - au - Prince , according to Bernard - Pierre .

Iptables Limits Connections Per IP
How do I restrict the number of connections used by a single IP address to my server for port 80 and 25 using iptables ?
You need to use the connlimit modules which allows you to restrict the number of parallel TCP connections to a server per client IP address ( or address block ) .
ADVERTISEMENTS
This is useful to protect your server or vps box against flooding , spamming or content scraping .
Syntax
The syntax is as follows :
/sbin/iptables -A INPUT -p tcp -- syn -- dport $ port -m connlimit -- connlimit - above N -j REJECT -- reject - with tcp -reset # save the changes see iptables - save man page , the following is redhat and friends specific command service iptables save
Example : Limit SSH Connections Per IP / Host
Only allow 3 ssg connections per client host :
/sbin/iptables -A INPUT -p tcp -- syn -- dport 22 -m connlimit --connlimit-above 3 -j REJECT
# save the changes see iptables - save man page , the following is redhat and friends specific command service iptables save
Example : Limit HTTP Connections Per IP / Host
Only allow 20 http connections per IP ( MaxClients is set to 60 in httpd.conf ) :
WARNING !
Please note that large proxy servers may legitimately create a large number of connections to your server .
You can skip those ips using Please note that large proxy servers may legitimately create a large number of connections to your server .
You can skip those ips using !
syntax
/sbin/iptables -A INPUT -p tcp -- syn -- dport 80 - m connlimit -- connlimit- above 20 -j REJECT
-- reject - with tcp -reset # save the changes see iptables - save man page , the following is redhat and friends specific command service iptables save
Skip proxy server IP 1.2.3.4 from this kind of limitations :
/sbin/iptables -A INPUT -p tcp -- syn -- dport 80 -d ! 1.2.3.4 -m connlimit --connlimit-above 20 -j REJECT -- reject - with tcp-reset
Example : Class C Limitations
In this example , limit the parallel http requests to 20 per class C sized network ( 24 bit netmask )
/sbin/iptables -A INPUT -p tcp -- syn -- dport 80 - m connlimit --connlimit- above 20 --connlimit-mask 24 -j REJECT
-- reject - with tcp -reset # save the changes see iptables - save man page service iptables save
Example : Limit Connections Per Second
The following example will drop incoming connections if IP make more than 10 connection attempts to port 80 within 100 seconds ( add rules to your iptables shell script )
#!/bin/bash IPT = / sbin / iptables #
Max connection in seconds SECONDS = 100 # Max connections per IP BLOCKCOUNT = 10 # .... # .. # default action can be DROP or REJECT DACTION = " DROP " $ IPT -A INPUT - p tcp -- dport 80 - i eth0 -m state -- state NEW -m recent -- set $ IPT -A INPUT - p tcp -- dport 80 - i eth0 -m state -- state NEW -m recent -- update -- seconds $ {SECONDS} -- hitcount $ {BLOCKCOUNT} -j $ {DACTION} # .... # .. #!/bin/bash IPT=/sbin/iptables #
Max connection in seconds SECONDS=100 # Max connections per IP BLOCKCOUNT=10 # .... # .. # default action can be DROP or REJECT DACTION = " DROP " $ IPT -A INPUT - p tcp -- dport 80 - i eth0 -m state -- state NEW -m recent -- set $ IPT -A INPUT - p tcp -- dport 80 - i eth0 -m state -- state NEW -m recent -- update -- seconds $ {SECONDS} -- hitcount $ {BLOCKCOUNT} -j $ {DACTION} # .... # ..
How Do I Test My Firewall Working ?
Use the following shell script to connect to your web server hosted at 202.1.2.3 :
#!/bin/bash ip = " 202.1.2.3 " port = " 80 " for i in { 1 .. 100 } do # do nothing just connect and exit echo " exit " | nc $ {ip} $ {port} ; done #!/bin/bash ip =" 202.1.2.3 " port = " 80 " for i in { 1..100 } do # do nothing just connect and exit echo " exit " | nc $ {ip} $ {port} ; done

Dubai authorities have released extensive footage from surveillance cameras that allegedly shows the movements of a professional 11 - person assassination team in the hours before and after a top Hamas leader was killed last month in a hotel room .
The footage , taken from cameras at the Dubai airport and several luxury hotels , follows the activities of 10 men and one woman as they arrived in Dubai on various European passports and moved among hotels and a shopping center , changing into disguises at one point , during the hours before Mahmoud al - Mabhouh was killed .
Al - Mabhouh , 48 , was a founder of Hamas ’ military wing .
He was believed to be behind the abduction of two Israeli soldiers in 1989 and said to be a liaison for smuggling weapons from Iran to Gaza .
He had survived several assassination attempts .
He was found dead in room 230 at the Al - Bustan Rotana hotel on January 20 .
The door on al - Mabhouh ’s room was latched and chained from the inside , and there was no blood evidence .
An initial report indicated that he died from sudden high blood pressure in the brain .
Subsequent reports have suggested he was electrocuted or strangled .
An investigation into hotel records and surveillance tapes uncovered the suspicious activities of a group of Westerners , most of them wearing baseball caps .
They staked out al - Mabhouh ’s room on the hotel ’s second floor , met clandestinely in various locations , disguised themselves and left the hotel briskly after the deed was done .
Investigators believe the assassins may have reprogrammed the electronic lock on al - Mabhouh ’s door to gain entry .
Hamas has accused the Mossad , Israel ’s secretive intelligence service , of masterminding the assassination .
In the 27 - minute video , released by Gulf News TV , some of the suspected assassins arrive on separate flights to Dubai early the morning the murder took place .
The footage shows some of them meeting up briefly in a shopping mall and checking into and out of hotels during the setup stage .
One of the suspects , a bald male , enters a hotel and exits wearing a brown wig and glasses .
Later , a woman identified as an Irish national named Gail Folliard , is shown checking into her hotel wearing glasses and a ponytail , then entering the same location where the male suspect changed his appearance .
She exits that location wearing a brunette wig .
When al - Mabhouh arrives at his hotel around 3 p.m. on the 19th , the footage captures two of the suspects , dressed in tennis gear , getting into the same elevator with him to follow him to his hotel room .
The two suspects later checked into the room across the hall from him , according to Dubai police .
Around 8 p.m. , the cameras catch some of the team members in the elevator lobby of al - Mabhouh ’s floor while he is out of the hotel for a bit .
While they ’re standing there keeping watch , another team is apparently trying to gain entry to the victim ’s room .
During this time , a tourist steps off the elevator , putting the operation in jeopardy , until one of the team members distracts the tourist .
A note on the video indicates that , according to the hotel ’s computer logs , someone tried to reprogram al - Mabhouh ’s electronic door lock during this time .
Al - Mabhouh returned to the hotel around 8:25 p.m and passed the female suspect , Folliard , in the hallway on the way to his room .
The killing itself took only 10 minutes around 8:30 p.m. , Dubai Police Chief Lt. Gen. Dhahi Khalfan Tamim told the Israeli newspaper Ha’Aretz .
Four assassins allegedly entered the victim ’s hotel room while he was out , using an electronic device to unlock his door , and waited for him to return .
Hotel staff discovered his body around 1:30 p.m. on the 20th after failing to reach him on the phone .
By then , he ’d been dead about 17 hours , and the alleged assassins were long gone .
Oddly , although there is surveillance tape showing the closed doors of some of the rooms near al - Mahbouh ’s hotel room when he first checked in , there is no tape showing the assassins entering or leaving the room or walking down that hallway at the time of the assassination .
A map of the hotel shown in the video , indicates that the only surveillance camera in that hallway was located one door down from the victim ’s room and pointed away from his door toward what appears to be a stairwell .
Following the assassination , the suspects left the hotel quickly and were tracked scattering to different parts of the globe , including Hong Kong , France , Switzerland , Germany and South Africa .
Authorities say the suspects paid for everything in cash and used special communication devices to avoid surveillance .
They never made direct calls to one another , as far as authorities could determine .
They did , however , make a number of calls to Austria , which authorities believe may have been the location of their command - and - control center .
Within 24 hours after the murder , Dubai investigators reportedly identified the aliases the alleged assassins used on their forged passports .
The nationalities on the documents indicated that six of them are British , three are Irish , one is French and one is German .
Although the videos show a second woman identified as part of the surveillance team , only one woman — Folliard — is listed among the suspects .
British , Irish and French authorities have indicated that the passports used by the alleged assassins showed obvious signs of forgery .
The Irish passport numbers used by suspects Gail Folliard , Evan Dennings and Kevin Daveron , for example , contain no letters and have the wrong number of digits .
At least five Israelis share the same names used by the alleged assassins .
One of the names matches a man living near Jerusalem named Melvyn Adam Mildiner .
Mildiner , a British national , says his identity was stolen and that he had nothing to do with the assassination .
The picture of him that was released by Dubai authorities does not completely match him , Reuters reports .
“ I woke up this morning to a world of fun , ” he told Reuters after Israeli newspapers published the names and photos of the suspects identified by Dubai authorities .
“ I am obviously angry , upset and scared — any number of things .
And I ’m looking into what I can do to try to sort things out and clear my name .
I do n’t know how this happened or who chose my name or why , but hopefully we ’ll find out soon . ”
The Mossad is noted for its stealth assassinations .
The intelligence service was responsible for tracking down and killing Palestinian militants who murdered Israeli athletes at the 1972 Olympics in Munich , as depicted in the Steven Spielberg movie Munich .
The Mossad was also responsible in 1986 for capturing Mordechai Vanunu , a worker at Israel ’s Dimona nuclear plant who had planned to disclose information about Israel ’s secret nuclear weapons program to the Sunday Times newspaper in the United Kingdom .
A female Mossad agent posing as a tourist in the UK lured the shy Vanunu out of London to Rome , where he was drugged and kidnapped and returned to Israel for a secret trial .
He spent 18 years in prison and was released in 2004 .

While past Olympics have been magnets for protests over issues such as aboriginal rights in Australia and oppression in Tibet , the Vancouver Winter Games are preparing to host one of the biggest displays ever of organized opposition to the Olympics themselves .
Building on years of disgruntlement over the increasingly corporate nature of the Games -- and widespread alarm over a projected $ 5.6 - billion price tag -- a resistance network has vowed to post thousands of protesters outside venues , some of whom aim to disrupt the events .
Security analysts have warned that such domestic protesting is as great a threat to the seamless unfolding of the Games as the possibility of a terrorist attack .
Canadian officials , however , have promised to give the demonstrators as much leeway as possible , backing off plans to ban signs , cordon off protesters and use high - tech sonic weapons to disperse unruly crowds .
That open door reflects not only British Columbia ’s tradition of tolerance and commitment to free speech , but also an acknowledgment of Vancouver residents ’ reservations about hosting the Games , the infrastructure for which will probably take years to pay off .
In recent weeks , politicians and small - business owners have been among those raising questions about whether the two - week event , which begins Friday , can possibly be worth the large public expenditures , traffic disruptions and environmental damage .
“ Some people are always going to love the Olympics , but most people just want it to go away , ” said Chris Shaw , an ophthalmology professor at the University of British Columbia who wrote a book arguing that Vancouver ’s bid was an excuse for real estate developers to launch a multibillion - dollar , publicly financed building boom .
“ These games are going to bring out a lot of people who are not your traditional protesters , ” Shaw said .
“ You ’re going to see a lot of ma -and - pa people out there , standing there talking to tourists and passing out leaflets .
That ’s a sea change . ”
The protests , organizers say , are intended to be nonviolent : noisy rallies , street marches and possibly attempts to block spectators and competitors from reaching the venues .
An array of groups with individual agendas will descend on Vancouver , much as they have during other high - profile events like World Trade Organization and G - 20 meetings : North American aboriginal groups that say the games are being hosted on unceded “ stolen land . ”
Conservationists alarmed at the construction of the 62 - mile Sea to Sky Highway connecting the city to the skiing venues at Whistler .
Opponents of tar sands oil development in northern Canada .
Anti-poverty activists who say the Olympics have further marginalized Vancouver ’s poorest residents .
They will join under the umbrella of the Olympic Resistance Network , which has been organizing the effort through its website , olympic resistance .net .
“ The goal is to . . . make clear to the world and to other residents in Canada that the Olympics are not all they ’re hyped up to be -- and to highlight the increasing number of Canadians who believe the Games have a lot more negative impact than positive , ” said Harsha Walia , a spokeswoman for the network .
The protesters are united , Walia said , by the perception that the Olympics “ industry ” is benefiting a few while ignoring the needs of citizens who might have been helped by the money being spent to host the Games .
According to the Vancouver Organizing Committee , the official operating budget is $ 1.65 billion , with a total venue construction cost of $ 542 million .
But that does n’t include the $ 825 - million cost of expanding the Vancouver convention center , which will serve as the media headquarters ; the $ 748 million spent on the Sea to Sky Highway ; and the 11.8 - mile , $ 1.9 - billion new light rail line from Vancouver International Airport , a portion of which was paid for by a private partner .
Those projects , government officials said , were planned anyway and will be long - term resources for the province .
“ Thank goodness that we have such a spectacular facility that will drive economic activity for years into the future , ” British Columbia Premier Gordon Campbell said during the convention center ’s grand reopening in April .
There have been other estimates , including one recently undertaken by the Vancouver Sun newspaper , that put the total Olympic price tag at closer to $ 5.6 billion .
Some say that may be on the optimistic side .
Local boosters also appear to have miscalculated the bonanza they expected to spin off from the Games .
On the eve of Vancouver ’s successful 2003 bid , Campbell predicted that the Olympics would bring $ 10 billion in economic benefits to the province , including 228,000 jobs .
Officials have persisted in predicting at least $ 4 billion in benefits , including tourism .
But a PricewaterhouseCoopers study in November found that , through the end of 2008 , British Columbia had seen at most an $ 884 - million increase to its gross domestic product , including 20,780 jobs .
Still , many insist that the massive expenditures in preparation for the Games helped the region weather the worst effects of the recession .
And , provincial officials say , there are intangible benefits .
“ For us to be . . . welcoming a quarter of a million people to our Lower Mainland -- that ’s very , very exciting , and it ’s good for our economy , ” Mary McNeil , British Columbia minister of state for the Olympics , recently told CBC Radio .
“ But there ’s also the other benefit , and that is having athletes in the community , so your local athletes can see and aspire and be motivated .
You ’ve also got things like people really beginning to feel the Olympic spirit . . . you just need to talk to some of the people .
It ’s exciting . ”
Many of those planning protests say that they would have reservations about the Games even without the cost overruns .
“ One of the main reasons I got involved in the [ resistance ] campaign was to work in support of the indigenous communities in B.C. that had first raised the concern about . . . what that kind of development means on their traditional territories , ” said Harjap Grewal , an activist from the suburb of Burnaby .
“ And everything just fed into it .
You have the . . .
$ 1.1 - billion [ government loan guarantee ] bailout of the Olympic Village that the taxpayers of Vancouver are on the hook for , while at the same time seeing homelessness going from 600 before the bid to 3,000 . ”
According to the resistance network ’s website , activists plan to kick off their “ anti-Olympic convergence ” with a series of workshops Wednesday and Thursday , followed by a “ take back our city ” demonstration on the day of the opening ceremonies .
On Feb. 13 , an ominously titled event : “ Heart Attack : Street March to Clog the Arteries of Capitalism ” is planned .
It promises to “ respect diversity of tactics and . . . disturb ‘ business as unusual ’ on the first day of the Games ! ”
In Whistler , anti-Olympic activists are expected to gather near the site of the skiing medals ceremonies to commemorate the thousands of trees and pristine bluffs that were wiped out to make way for the four - lane Sea to Sky Highway , which replaced a narrow , often hazardous road and a large complex of cross -country ski trails .
A bus terminal was built by the province , over the objections of many local officials , to accommodate the vehicles that will be the sole means of access to Whistler during the Games .
It sits partly on a wooded wetland that is listed as a unique ecological area .
“ It ’s hard for people to grasp , ” said Sara Jennings , a Whistler native who is helping organize the demonstrations there .
“ You grow up with the idea of the Olympics being a wonderful thing , you watch it on TV and you think it ’s all about the athletes and all about the world coming together .
“ But the reality is it ’s become more of a corporate creation whose primary motive is greed .
And the people that need the most support are the people that get trampled on when things like big corporate sporting events come to town . ”

Bolshevism and the avant - garde artists ( 1993 ) — Part 1
By David Walsh
13 February 2010
Part 1 | Part 2 | Part 3
The Great Utopia : The Russian and Soviet Avant - Garde , 1915 – 1932 , at the Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum ( September 25 , 1992 – January 3 , 1993 ) in New York City , was a major artistic and political event .
In response , the Bulletin newspaper , a predecessor of the World Socialist Web Site , published a seven - part article by arts editor David Walsh , devoted to the issues raised by the exhibition , in February - March 1993 .
The piece was later republished in the Fourth International magazine , Volume 20 , Number 1 , Winter - Spring 1994 .
As the article indicates , the show was originally planned in 1988 when Mikhail Gorbachev was still in power in the USSR .
By the time the massive exhibition went on display in New York and other cities , the Soviet Union had collapsed and the organizers made a concerted effort to use the occasion as a means of discrediting or marginalizing the Russian Revolution of 1917 .
The 800 items on show , however , told a very different story , of the vibrancy of post - Revolutionary intellectual and artistic life , and the great impetus to creative activity provided by the first seizure of power by the working class in history .
The show created considerable interest in the general public , attracting more than a quarter of a million visitors .
We are posting the original series in three parts beginning today .
The massive exhibit of Russian and Soviet avant - garde artistic work on display from September 25 to January 3 , 1992 , at the Guggenheim Museum in New York City , The Great Utopia : The Russian and Soviet Avant - Garde , 1915 - 1932 , deserves considerable attention and study .
It is of great interest both for the aesthetic quality of the work itself and from the standpoint of the innumerable historical and intellectual questions it raises .
The purpose of this article is not to review the formal qualities of the art as such , but to consider the relationship of those artists generally identified with Russian Futurism and Constructivism to the revolutionary workers state and the tasks it confronted , and the implications of that relationship for the artists ’ work . [ 1 ]
The aim is to address a number of questions :
What was the reaction of the left artists to the taking of power by the working class ?
What was the attitude of the new revolutionary regime to the artists ?
Was there a “ Bolshevik ” tendency in art ?
How was the role of art in the construction of socialism conceived of by the artists and by the revolutionaries ?
What is the significance of this history for the present period ?
The attempt to answer these questions involves , in part , an examination of the unavoidable contradictions and conflicts that arose as artists from the petty - bourgeois bohemia attempted to grapple with the reality of a social revolution , and disciplined , highly - trained proletarian revolutionaries attempted to grapple with the artistic process , in which the unconscious and the irrational play such a significant role .
Leon Trotsky
One figure , more than any other , was able to grasp and master the contradictions of both fields of activity : Leon Trotsky .
In considering the artists and art of this period and their relation to the October Revolution , one is reminded forcefully that penetrating answers to some of the most difficult problems were advanced nearly 70 years ago in Trotsky ’s writings and remarks .
As we shall see when we examine the contents of the Guggenheim catalog , it was impossible to mount such an exhibit , even in the present political atmosphere , without confronting as a central question the role of Trotsky and his appreciation and critique of early Soviet art .
How that confrontation actually took place is a matter that will have to be considered .
The exhibit consisted of some 800 paintings , sculptures , architectural models , stage designs , photographs and posters .
Dozens of the artists whose work was included merit and in many cases have received their own individual exhibitions and been the subjects of specialized studies .
This is some of the most influential work carried out this century .
The show was originally planned in 1988 at a time when Mikhail Gorbachev was in power and glasnost was on the lips of every bourgeois commentator .
The exhibit was organized by the Guggenheim in conjunction with the State Tret’iakov Gallery in Moscow , the State Russian Museum in St. Petersburg and the Schirn Kunsthalle of Frankfurt .
The very title of the exhibit , The Great Utopia , is indicative of the general attitude of the exhibitors to the artists and their work .
In their preface to the show ’s catalog , the Guggenheim ’s director and deputy director write : “ The term ‘ utopia ’ carries with it the spirit of the avant - garde ’s project to place art at the service of greater social objectives and to create harmony and order in the chaotic world around them .
Given the course history has taken in Russia in the twentieth century , ‘ utopia ’ also has connotations of impracticality ; idealism is good in theory , but not in practice ” ( preface in the exhibit ’s catalog , The Great Utopia : The Russian and Soviet Avant - Garde , 1915 - 1932 [ New York : Guggenheim Museum , 1992 ] , p. x ) .
Officials at the Russian museums , in their introductory comments , strenuously attempt to distinguish the art from the revolution and its political and social implications .
They write : “ In a political sense , this exhibition comes perhaps too late .
Since the early 1980s , the idea of romantic underpinnings to the revolution has lost popularity .
Yet the artistic might of this era , with its gathering of creative energies and investigations , has continued to hold its ground against more short - lived political ideologies and economies .
It is therefore that much more important for the public to be able to see for the first time the breadth of Russian avant - garde art without a background of political fervor — to see it in peace and to be able to measure fully its place in the development of art in our world ” ( preface in the catalog , p. xiii ) .
These two arguments — ( 1 ) that the very notion of art contributing to the changing of reality ( or the very notion of changing reality in a progressive fashion at all ) was utopian , and ( 2 ) that there was no connection between the revolution and the burst of creative energy which took place in the 1910s and 1920s — are best refuted by the exhibition itself .
In the first place , it documents the extraordinary , almost superhuman , and eminently “ practical ” achievements of the October Revolution in a number of spheres of human activity .
If there were no heritage of the revolution other than the accomplishments of the period 1917 - 1923 in the fields of culture , education and social planning , it would stand vindicated by history .
Practical contributions of the revolution in the field of art included , among many others , the establishment of the State Free Art Workshops in the autumn of 1918 .
According to a Russian art historian , this meant that “ for the first time in its history art education in Russia was based on the principles of freedom and democracy ” ( Natal ’ia Adaskina , “ The Place of Vkhutemas in the Russian Avant - Garde , ” an essay in the catalog , p. 284 ) .
There were as well the activities of Izo Narkompros ( the Department of Fine Arts of the People ’s Commissariat of Enlightenment ) , the creation of Obmokhu ( the Society of Young Artists ) in 1919 and its exhibitions , the creation of the Vkhutemas ( Higher Artistic - Technical Workshops ) in 1920 , out of which much of the most experimental work evolved , the work of Kazimir Malevich ’s Unovis ( the Affirmers of the New Art ) group in Vitebsk , the establishment of the ground - breaking Museum of Painterly Culture in Moscow , the work of the Constructivists and the Production artists , and the efforts by a great variety of artists to contribute to the cultural and intellectual uplifting of the working class and Soviet masses .
But the opposite of “ utopianism ” is not simply “ practical ” achievement .
In addition to their paintings , poems and sculptures , the Soviet artists contributed , through their theoretical work , to an understanding of objective reality and how its truth might be uncovered .
However misguided some of the conclusions which they drew might have been , there is no question that the work carried out in the field of aesthetics in the early years of the October Revolution represents an extremely rich body of knowledge .
Much of that work , of course , lay buried for decades as a result of the crimes of Stalinism .
The second argument — that political life and the revolution itself were incidental to the artists ’ work — is so intellectually shallow and dishonest that it almost defies a response .
In the first place , the artists involved , of the most varied predilections and temperaments , embraced the cause of social revolution and communism .
They did so with many initial equivocations and difficulties ( we will discuss that question below ) , but the fact is they identified themselves with the revolutionary workers state .
An anticommunist Russian art critic , Igor Golomshtok ( Totalitarian Art in the Soviet Union , the Third Reich , Fascist Italy and the People ’s Republic of China [ New York : Icon Editions , 1990 ] ) , notes that the list of Soviet émigrés “ does not include even one of the champions of the radical transformation of the world through art ” ( p. 20 ) .
Spatial Construction - Aleksandr Rodchenko 1920
When one encounters such works as Pavel Filonov ’s Formula of the Petrograd Proletariat , Boris Ender ’s Portrait of Karl Liebknecht , Natan Al’tman ’s Petrocommune , Gustav Klutsis ’s Project for a Construction for the Fifth Anniversary of the October Revolution , El Lissitzky ’s Untitled ( Rosa Luxemburg ) , Aleksandr Vesnin ’s Proposal for a Monument to the Third Congress of the Communist International — all nonrepresentational works — one is confronted with a process that surely cannot be ascribed to “ coercion . ”
The Pianist - Liubov’ Popova 1914
It is perfectly true , of course , that the first work of artists such as Malevich , Vladimir Tatlin , Aleksandr Rodchenko and Liubov’ Popova predates the October Revolution itself .
This is advanced as an argument against considering the 1917 revolutionary overthrow as a decisive event in their careers .
This superficial view ignores the complex relationship of culture and political life that had developed internationally over an entire historical epoch .
The Russian Revolution was not merely a product of a spontaneous upsurge of the working class onto which were grafted a few Bolshevik slogans .
Nor did the work of the Russian Futurists , Suprematists and Constructivists emerge simply because these artists had the opportunity to view a few canvases by Picasso , Braque , Matisse and others . [ 2 ]
The October Revolution was itself the product of an international struggle for the highest principles and ideals , which took place over a period of decades , including a struggle on the cultural and aesthetic fronts .
Conversely , the turning inside out of artistic forms in the first decades of the century would have been inconceivable without the challenge thrown down to capitalist society , intellectually and practically , by socialism and the working class .
That the revolution itself provided an impetus for artistic experimentation is hardly an issue for debate .
Much of the work in the exhibit was stunning .
The greater part of the exhibit was devoted to nonrepresentational painting of the Futurist , Cubo - Futurist , Suprematist and related schools .
The artists involved , influenced by a combination of artistic , social and scientific revolutions , attempted to make a decisive break with previous trends .
There was an awareness , at the center of their work , that it was necessary to reconsider society , man and art in the face of vast , rapid and global changes .
It is not possible within the scope of this article to review the exhibit in any detail , but certain pieces , artists and entire tendencies stand out .
Self portrait - Kazimir Malevich 1908 -11
Any consideration of Russian and Soviet art has to recognize the contribution of Malevich ( 1878 - 1935 ) and the Unovis group , including Lissitzky ( 1890 - 1941 ) , Il ’ia Chashnik , Nikolai Suetin and others .
After working through all the major European and Russian trends , Malevich , in the midst of World War I , abandoned completely figurative , representational painting for “ non-objective ” work .
At the O.10 exhibition in 1915 , he dismayed critics with his Suprematist Black Square — a painted black square in a painted white frame .
According to Malevich “ ‘ reality ’ lay concealed behind the world ’s objective envelope , and this envelope had to be torn open and the shackles of predmetnost ’ ( objectivity ) and razum ( reason ) broken in order to ensure the appearance of a new ‘ Realism ’ ... ” ( quoted in Aleksandra Shatskikh , “ Unovis : Epicenter of a New World , ” an essay in the catalog , p. 59 ) .
The Seventh Dimension : Suprematist and
his Color Lines in Vertical Motion - Il ’ia Chashnik
Chashnik ’s The Seventh Dimension : Suprematist and his Color Lines in Vertical Motion demonstrate an enormous talent .
His Cosmos — Red Circle on Black Surface ( 1925 ) , for example , is an extraordinary work .
A giant red circle ( sun , planet ) hovers in blackness ( sky , atmosphere ) .
Under it on the painting ’s surface floats a Suprematist - like structure ( space station ) , lines and rectangles arranged horizontally across a central bar .
The Suprematist craft — delicate , outweighed , pale in color — is seemingly directed toward the gigantic , perfect red sphere .
The enormity of the task , the terrifying emptiness of the universe , the flimsiness of the vessel , are clear to the viewer .
The work of Rodchenko ( 1891 - 1956 ) — painter , Constructivist , designer , photographer — was also prominent in the exhibition .
His paintings from the 5 X 5= 25 exhibition in 1921 stood out in particular .
Rodchenko also took the path of “ non-objective ” work .
The exhibition includes his “ black on black ” paintings from 1918 ; Hanging Spatial Construction ( 1921 ) — one of the first Constructivist works ; an advertising poster : “ Should n’t We Produce Pencils We Can Use ? ” ( 1923 ) ; book covers ; film posters ; textile designs and a number of extraordinary photographs from the late 1920s .
Aleksandr Rodchenko and Varvara Stepanova
The Great Utopia included the body of work produced by a remarkable group of women artists , a powerful indication of the social revolution ’s liberating effect , including Popova ( 1889 - 1924 ) , Olga Rozanova ( 1886-1918 ) , Varvara Stepanova ( 1894-1958 ) , Nadezhda Udal’tsova ( 1886-1961 ) , Sofia Dymshits - Tolstaia ( 1888 - 1963 ) , Antonina Sofronova ( 1892-1966 ) , Vera Ermolaeva ( 1893-1938 ) , Nina Kogan ( 1889 - 1942 ) and Ksenia Ender ( 1894-1953 ) .
Rozanova ’s Non-objective Composition ( 1916 ) and Popova ’s Space - Force Construction ( 1920 - 1921 ) were particularly striking .
The brilliant Tatlin was represented by his “ reliefs , ” sculptures composed of iron , copper , wood , rope , aluminum , zinc — Cubism ( although he publicly rejected the trend ) in three dimensions .
Unfortunately , none of Tatlin ’s paintings was displayed at the Guggenheim because he had already given up painting by 1915 .
In addition to his reliefs , his costume and set designs for the theater , his prototypes of men’s and women ’s clothing and sketches for teapots and creamers were on display .
Axonometric Art - Gustav Klutsis 1920
Also prominent was the work of the relatively unknown Klutsis ( 1895 - 1938 ) .
His art was represented in a variety of fields : painting , designs for screens , stands and “ Radio - Orator No. 5 , ” posters , book covers and window designs .
In addition , the exhibition contained several remarkable paintings of Filonov ( 1882 -1941 ) , which , in their tribute to natural form , opposed the geometries of the Suprematists and Constructivists .
The film posters of the Stenberg brothers , Vladimir ( 1899 - 1982 ) and Georgii ( 1900 - 1933 ) , stood out , as did the work of Ivan Kliun ( 1873 - 1943 ) , a painter from a slightly older generation , and the work of the Projectionists , a group of younger artists who came of age in the mid-20s .
The Great Utopia also contained sections devoted to Soviet architecture , textile design , porcelain , graphic design and photography .
Long Live the Universal October ! - Gustav
Klutsis 1933
The exhibitors did their best to portray the first years of the consolidated Stalin regime as a direct continuation and natural outgrowth of the early years of the revolutionary regime , but the art speaks for itself .
There is a world of difference between the unforced , almost anarchic quality of the work from 1918 - 1923 and the posters , for example , that begin to appear in the late 1920s , exhorting workers or collective farm members to fulfill industrial or agricultural plans .
Particularly ominous is Gustav Klutsis ’s poster For the Building of Socialism under Lenin ’s Banner ( 1930 ) in which an unintentionally sinister Stalin looms behind Lenin ’s head .
Stalin also appears , on his own , in Klutsis ’s The Victory of Socialism in Our Country Is Guaranteed ( 1932 ) .
A simple endorsement of the work on display and the acknowledgement of its beauty and intellectual force are surely not adequate at this point in history .
The artists themselves would certainly not have proceeded in such a manner .
They were divided into tendencies that disputed furiously among themselves on an entire range of aesthetic and social questions .
There has been a predilection to adopt an uncritical attitude toward the Soviet artists and their work .
There are a number of reasons for this .
First , their fate , for the most part tragic , produced for an entire historical period a natural ( and correct ) tendency to defend them retroactively against the denunciations of the Stalinist bureaucracy .
Klutsis died in the purges .
Left art critic Nikolai Punin , the husband of poet Anna Akhmatova , was sent to a labor camp in the late 1930s .
Roy Medvedev writes : “ It would be hard to list all the writers arrested and destroyed in 1936 - 39 ” ( Let History Judge [ New York : Columbia University Press , 1989 ] , p. 446 ) .
Malevich died in 1935 , after years in which his work was either ignored or reviled as “ formalist ” and “ decadent . ”
Lissitzky attempted to become a loyal Stalinist , but his artistic conscience prevented him from joining the school of “ Socialist Realism . ”
He simply faded away .
Rodchenko ceased serious work after the early 1930s , at one point turning on his own work and destroying 10 canvases .
Tatlin , one of the most extraordinary creators of the twentieth century , worked almost exclusively in theater design after 1934 .
According to a biographer , “ The end of his life was very hard .
And when he died there were only seven or eight of us at his funeral ” ( Larissa Alekseevna Zhadova [ ed . ] , Tatlin [ New York : Rizzoli , 1988 ] p. 439 ) .
Second , Stalinist repression and Western indifference or hostility to these artists , under international conditions of political reaction , shrouded their work in obscurity to a large extent , thereby making any examination , critical or otherwise , a difficult task .
Under the very contradictory conditions of the disintegration of the Soviet Union and the breakup of the postwar order , the artists and their work have emerged in recent years from that obscurity .
Paul Wood ’s “ The Politics of the Avant - Garde ”
Broad and far - reaching issues are raised by a number of the essays which appear in the exhibit ’s catalog and which , in one way or another , contribute to a critical approach .
The first essay in the catalog , “ The Politics of the Avant - Garde ” by Paul Wood , attempts to address a problem which is of great interest to Marxists : the relation between the artistic work of the avant - garde and their politics and , more specifically , the possible correlation between the artistic avant - garde and the Trotskyist Left Opposition .
Judging from the sources he quotes approvingly , Wood travels in state capitalist ( the British Socialist Workers Party ) and Pabloite circles .
His essay , which contains some valuable material , is nevertheless informed by the outlook and imbued with the atmosphere of petty - bourgeois radicalism .
Wood speaks of the apparent irony that the recent and sudden availability of the art of the Russian avant - garde coincides with the collapse of the Soviet Union .
Characteristically , he addresses himself to the “ academic researcher ” and suggests that he or she “ would do well to remember that Aleksandr Rodchenko , El Lissitzky , Varvara Stepanova , Vladimir Maiakovskii , Dziga Vertov , Gustav Klutsis , and the rest , working in conditions of privation to begin with and harsh censorship later , were all , without exception , explicitly committed to working class revolution — out of which a new order of international socialism would arise ” ( ibid. , pp. 12 ) .
He continues , “ One should not overlook the paradox that the very research which progressively reveals the contours of the Soviet avant - garde is predicated on the historic defeat of the avant - garde ’s social vision ” ( ibid. , p. 2 ) .
It is revealing that Wood identifies the collapse of the Soviet state with the historic ( perhaps final ) defeat of the perspective of “ working class revolution ” and “ international socialism . ”
He then discusses the different approaches art historians and critics have traditionally taken toward the Soviet artists and their politics , dividing the former into three general categories .
First ,
Wood describes those who subscribe to the “ severance ” theory — i.e. , critics who simply dissociate the avant - garde from revolutionary politics .
He quotes the well - known art historian John Bowlt , who wrote in 1984 : “ Perhaps the most dangerous rumor concerning the Russian avant - garde has to do with its alleged support of radical politics , and radical political philosophy in general ” ( ibid . ) .
This piece of bourgeois wishful thinking is disputed by historic fact , including the declarations of the artists concerned .
The second approach , which Wood terms “ revisionist , ” developed in the late 1970s and the 1980s under the general heading of a critique of Modernism and a new social history of art .
Christina Lodder in her Russian Constructivism ( New Haven : Yale University Press , 1983 ) , a groundbreaking work in many ways , attributed the failure of the Russian avant - garde to the “ success ” of the revolution .
She takes as her premises the existence of a repressive party and its preference for a Realist art , Realist art ’s supposed popularity and accessibility to the uneducated masses and the harsh material circumstances that aborted artistic experimentation .
Both of these approaches take as their starting point the greatest lie of the twentieth century : that Stalinism was the inevitable outgrowth and continuity of Bolshevism .
The first approach regards the revolution as an incidental ( and tragic ) event , which represented an interruption in the evolution of the artists ’ work .
It takes for granted that Leninism and Stalinism form one nightmarish continuum .
The second , more sophisticated approach attempts to draw connections between the aims of the social revolution and the artists , but considers the entire enterprise , somewhat regretfully , a failure .
It suggests that the “ masses ” are inherently philistine and their rise to power is incompatible with experimental art .
Stalinism , the implication goes , is what the population either desired or deserved .
The third argument also advances the falsehood that Stalinism equals Bolshevism , but in an even more sinister form .
The new approach , manifested in the work of figures like Boris Groys and Igor Golomshtok , essentially accuses the avant - garde artists of complicity with Stalinism or responsibility for its repulsive offspring in the field of culture , Socialist Realism .
Groys , in The Culture of the Stalin Period ( New York : St. Martin ’s Press , 1990 ) , asserts Socialist Realism ’s “ identity with the avant - garde era ” ( p. 125 ) and “ the unity of their fundamental artistic aim ” ( p. 126 ) .
The reactionary émigré Golomshtok , in his Totalitarian Art ( London : Collins Harvill , 1990 ) , writes : “ If the principal characteristic of totalitarianism is that it proclaims its ideological doctrine as both uniquely true and universally obligatory , then it is the artistic avant - garde of the 1910s and 1920s who first elaborated a totalitarian ideology of culture ” ( p. 21 ) .
Unraveling this piece of reactionary idiocy would take more time than it ’s worth , but a few things can be pointed out .
Golomshtok has adopted the view , first propounded in the 1930s by ultra-lefts , of the identity of Stalinism and fascism and taken it one step further .
He has apparently managed to identify an ideological doctrine that produces totalitarianism .
Taking the sweeping and occasionally monomaniacal declarations of the Futurist artists at face value , he draws a direct connection between them and the brutal Stalinist system of authoritarian dictates .
To utilize the artists ’ excesses in the immediately postrevolutionary years , against which Lenin and Trotsky strenuously fought , as proof of their responsibility for the crimes of the 1930s is the height of dishonesty .
That some of the “ left ” arguments were utilized by spokesmen for the bureaucracy at a later period and for different purposes is a separate matter , which we will consider below .
Golomshtok ’s real intent is to vilify any outlook that claims it is possible to cognize objective truth , suggests that the world can and should be altered and insists that art has a role to play in that process .
He , unlike the more liberal - minded critics , has no intention of forgiving Mayakovsky , [ 3 ]
Tatlin and others for their support of the revolution .
Nor will he dismiss their declarations of support for Communism and world revolution as incidental or accidental .
In the second part of his essay , Wood points to the “ decline ” of the avant - garde after the end of War Communism — the revolution ’s “ heroic ” phase — and the introduction of the New Economic Policy in 1921 , reports on its dissatisfaction with the rising bureaucracy and attempts to correlate the activities of this variegated artistic tendency with those of the Trotskyist Left Opposition .
Specifically ,
Wood links the renewed “ left ” activity in the arts with two “ waves ” of opposition to the bureaucracy , 1923 - 1924 ( the formation of the Left Opposition ) and 1926 - 1927 ( the creation of the Joint Opposition ) .
He points legitimately , for example , to two reports given by Tatlin in November 1924 on the work of his Section for Material Culture at the Ginkhuk ( State Institute of Artistic Culture ) in Petrograd .
In these reports , Tatlin “ set his defense of a planned approach to the design of material culture in a context of ‘ anarchy ’ reigning in production ” ( Wood , p. 13 ) .
Wood suggests that there was a “ natural ” affinity of the avant - garde artists for the Opposition at this time because of the latter ’s insistence on economic planning .
After declaring that he does n’t want to suggest that “ Lef was in any simple sense a cultural ‘ reflection ’ of the Left Opposition , ” Wood proceeds to do precisely that , only not “ simply . ”
( Lef , an acronym for “ Left Front of the Arts , ” was the name of the journal published by the group , founded in 1923 , which represented the general outlook of the Futurists . )
Wood states that the “ avant - garde , the left front , is thus related to the Left Opposition .
It is so , however , not as a reflection but as kind of relatively autonomous equivalent ... it was its ‘ historically logical aesthetic correlative ’ ” ( ibid. , p. 17 ) .
Wood asserts that “ on at least four grounds the left front of the arts can be read as the cultural correlative of the predominantly Trotskyist Left Opposition : in terms of hostility to NEP ; in terms of a commitment to planning ; in terms of a requirement for a level of working class prosperity to consume the goods produced ; and in terms of a requirement for industrial democracy to provide an environment in which the artistic - constructor / engineer might function ” ( ibid . ) .
There is truth to the proposition that the left artists in general were hostile to the growth of the bureaucracy .
And there is no lack of evidence of the sympathy of individual artists for Trotsky personally .
Both before and after the revolution , his writings on literature and politics carried enormous weight in intellectual circles .
Much of this history has been suppressed by Stalinist and bourgeois historians .
We know , for example , that the experimental theater director , Vsevolod Meyerhold , was very close to Trotsky , that Sergei Esenin , the imagist poet who committed suicide in 1925 , admired him highly , that poet Osip Mandelstam made warm comments about Trotsky which were suppressed , etc .
Nevertheless , one must reject Wood ’s basic thesis .
It has two fundamental problems .
In the first place , the identification of a particular artistic - literary current with the Left Opposition equates art and politics in a thoroughly incorrect manner .
The Left Opposition was not simply a group of like - minded individuals who were disturbed by the growth of inequality and the suppression of inner-party democracy .
The Opposition was the continuator of genuine Bolshevism and Marxism , the representative of the interests of the international working class .
Wood ignores Lenin and Trotsky ’s oft - stated rejection of all efforts by literary groups to be named the officially sanctioned “ Communist art . ”
Trotsky wrote : “ And at any rate , the Party cannot and will not take the position of a literary circle which is struggling and merely competing with other literary circles ....
If it is not possible to determine the place of any given group today , then the Party as a Party will wait patiently and gracefully .
Individual critics or readers may sympathize with one group or another in advance .
The Party , as a whole , protects the historic interests of the working class and must be more objective and wise ” ( Literature and Revolution [ New York : Russell and Russell ] , pp. 218-219 ) .
This is a question we will return to more than once .
Furthermore , Wood , by “ lining up ” the left artists with the Opposition in this schematic fashion , ignores the difference , even conflict , between two methods of cognizing the world : the Marxist - scientific and the artistic .
That the sympathy of the artists for the revolution was not automatically translated into participation in the activities of the Opposition does not indicate , for example , approval of Stalinism or its dogma of “ socialism in one country . ”
The very process by which the artist cognizes the world , through images ; the close link of his or her realm to sense perception , immediate impressions and emotions ; and the greater role of intuition and the unconscious in artistic work — this almost guarantees that the artist “ lags behind ” the politics of the day .
The “ reward ” is that the extraordinary artist divines and reveals truth that goes beyond the immediate struggles .
A question occurs to Wood : “ If indeed Lef was a kind of correlate to ... the Left Opposition [ which we have just suggested is a false premise ] , why did not the latter embrace it ? ” ( Wood , p. 17 ) .
He concludes , through a brief examination of Trotsky ’s Literature and Revolution and Nikolai Gorlov ’s Futurism and Revolution , that “ what could have been a constructive dialogue ” ( ibid. , p. 19 ) between the avant - garde and the Opposition had , in fact , begun .
It is in the course of his consideration of Literature and Revolution that Wood ’s ignorance and the “ asses ’ ears ” of his petty - bourgeois world outlook truly emerge .
He describes Trotsky ’s work , in the jargon of the postmodern critic , as the “ main site ” of the “ historical confrontation between the avant - garde and the Left Opposition . ”
Portrait of Mayakovsky by Rodchenko
Trotsky devoted 60 dense and thoughtful pages to the problems raised by Futurism and Formalism .
Prefacing a reference to Trotsky ’s critical remarks on Vladimir Mayakovsky ’s poem 150 Million and Tatlin ’s Monument to the Third International , Wood remarks condescendingly , “ It has to be remembered that Trotskii was not an art critic and , at this date , was not overly familiar with the products of the European avant - garde ....
Given the unfamiliarity of that avant - garde ’s devices and the threat these must have posed to a consciousness raised on the norms of Enlightenment / classical culture , it is Trotskii ’s bias in favor of toleration rather than dismissiveness that deserves our attention ” ( ibid. , p. 18 ) .
Clearly , Literature and Revolution and its “ tolerant , ” but critical , bias does not satisfy Wood .
He is particularly unsettled , one senses , by Trotsky ’s remark that Futurism is “ in some respects , a Bohemian revolutionary offshoot of the old art .... ” ( Literature and Revolution , p. 13 ) .
Searching for more uncritical admirers , Wood happens on the writings of Nikolai Gorlov , an Old Bolshevik , who wrote a pamphlet in 1924 entitled Futurism and Revolution .
Wood asserts that Gorlov “ is more perspicacious than Trotskii about the relations of existing art with bourgeois society .
In particular , his technical grasp of the avant - garde ’s innovations exceeds Trotskii’s .... ” ( Wood , p. 18 ) .
Trotsky refers to Gorlov ’s work in Literature and Revolution , stating that it “ violates a historic perspective and identifies Futurism with proletarian poetry ” ( p. 144 ) .
At the same time , he praises the pamphlet for “ thoughtfully and weightily ” summarizing the achievements of Futurism in art and form .
Gorlov ’s work ( included in The Futurists , the Formalists and the Marxist Critique , [ London : Ink Links , 1979 ] ) is valuable in regard to its analysis of Mayakovsky ’s poetry in particular .
It suffers , however , from an oversimplified and uncritical identification of Futurism with Bolshevism .
Gorlov , in a typical effusive comment , states : “ The futurists struck against the taste ( and therefore , the life - style ) of the bourgeoisie , while we Bolsheviks struck against their order ” ( ibid. , p. 191 ) .
Again : “ The futurists , as I ’ve already said , made the same revolution as we Bolsheviks , but made it from the other end ” ( ibid. p. 194 ) .
The actual relation between Futurism , and the avant - garde in general , and the October Revolution is very much an issue in Trotsky ’s work .
The complex social and artistic issues involved , and their profound treatment by Trotsky , were not grasped by Gorlov , and Wood is incapable of even referring to them .
In Literature and Revolution , Trotsky provided his readers with a detailed and critical overview of Futurism , not simply taking the often extravagant , if entertaining , claims of Mayakovsky and his colleagues at face value .
He explained that Futurism was a European phenomenon that reflected , from a sociological point of view , the contradictory development of capitalist society beginning in the mid-1890s .
While Europe experienced two decades of unparalleled prosperity , elaborating “ new standards , new criteria of the possible and impossible , ” and urging “ people towards new exploits ” ( Literature and Revolution , p. 126 ) , official society continued to move in the same stagnant channels .
“ The armed peace ... the hollow parliamentary system , the external and internal politics based on the system of safety valves and brakes , all this weighed heavily on poetry at a time when the air , charged with accumulated electricity , gave signs of impending social explosions .
Futurism was the ‘ foreboding ’ of all this in art , ” he wrote ( ibid . ) .

Footnotes :
[ 1 ] Futurism :
An artistic tendency that obtained its fullest expression in Italy and Russia .
Filippo Tommaso Marinetti ( 1876-1944 ) , a poet - editor and subsequent Mussolini supporter , published the Manifesto of Futurist Painters in 1909 .
The Futurists invoked a Utopian vision of humanity invigorated by technical progress , particularly the new potentials for speed and harnessed energy .
Motion itself was one of their chief subjects .

Constructivism :
An artistic tendency that emerged in the Soviet Union in 1920 - 1921 .
It stressed construction ( technology , maximum utility , “ scientific principles ” ) versus composition ( self - expression , intuition , individualism ) .
One of its proponents declared that “ real construction is utilitarian necessity . ”
[ 2 ] Suprematism :
One of the first purely abstract trends in painting , identified with Kazimir Severinovich Malevich ( 1878-1935 ) .
The first Suprematist works were exhibited in 1915 .
Malevich reduced his Suprematist “ figures ” to the pure plane , the square , circle and cross ; he meant them to form the basis of a new artistic language that could express what he called an “ entire system of world - building . ” [ back ]

These are notes taken from a discussion meeting at Oxford University on 26th February 2010 and sent to me by reader , Simon Anthony .
I think they are extremely interesting .
Question and answer format featuring environmental correspondents Richard Black ( BBC ) , Fiona Harvey ( FT ) , David Adam ( Guardian ) and Ben Jackson ( Sun ) and chaired by Fiona Fox , director of the Science Media Centre .
( Abbreviations : CG = Climategate ; CC = Climate change ; CH = Copenhagen meeting )
FF : Has the press done a disservice to the public in reporting CG ?
Has media a responsibility to make the public “ think the right way ” ?
DA : I do n’t feel I have to tell the public “ how to think ” .
We ask questions of experts , report their answers and the evidence .
On balance MMGW is correct ; the remaining issues concern which policies are right in response .
People often confuse the reality of the science with policy choices .
RB : Most media have to follow their audience or go bust , the BBC less so , but still constrained .
We present things as they are , with all their complexity and diversity .
We do n’t tell people how to think .
FH : I do n’t feel responsible to public opinion but only to our readers .
We present facts objectively to inform readers for eg investment decisions .
We aim for rock solid accuracy and present all sides of the argument with no spin .
People have taken advantage of CG to present a sceptical p-o-v .
We have to record that sceptical p-o-v but be careful to stick to the mainstream .
BJ : Twenty years ago the Sun would have been sceptical because CC is hard to prove ; nowadays we let people have the benefit of the doubt because we ’re more interested in where it ’s all going .
The Sun will channel both sides of the argument .
We have little expertise and we are n’t authoritative .
It ’s not only consensus scientists but sceptics who unhappy with media .
FF : So it was n’t the media ’s fault …
Was the media slow to respond to the various … gates ?
DA : We had a baby just after release of emails so I was on parental leave through December .
I got a phone call about potential big story with sceptics claiming there was trick to hide the decline in temperature .
We had to be careful before reporting ; I knew about the on - going Climate Audit – UEA “ spat ” .
The following week while the blogosphere was jumping and down we discussed what to do .
It ’s lonely waiting while the rest of media is doing a story and you ’re not ( only lonelier the other way round ) .
We could n’t pretend it was n’t happening but there was a danger in concentrating on only some of emails as this would create the illusion of controversy .
I used to think sceptics were bad and mad but now the bad people ( lobbyists for fossil fuel industries ) had gone , leaving only the mad .
We published a string of articles in late Jan , early Feb showing that people had misinterpreted the emails as casting doubt on CC .
The collapse of CH was the perfect time for the emails to get coverage .
RH : We ’d have needed a serious amount of time to properly analyse the emails .
It happened at a busy time ( CH ) .
The people who responded quickly had only read three emails and decided to label the event CG .
In retrospect we should have got stuck into the emails right away ( in passing , we should also have checked the last IPCC report ) but our editor would n’t have given staff the time needed .
The BBC was attacked on CG coverage because it ’s thought to have a political agenda .
Nonetheless I had a Glaciergate article on 5th Dec .
FH : We had no time to authenticate the emails before our deadlines .
We waited a few days , then the glacier stuff came along .
Editors asked why there was no FT coverage .
I wrote pieces but editors would n’t give space , or spiked articles .
We were also busy with CH … it does sound like excuses for weak coverage but newspapers are dysfunctional .
BJ : The Sun covered CG on 21/11 .
Everyone was looking at CH but the story would n’t die and we were caught napping by the emails .
Analysis needed a lot of time and the Sun was n’t going to do it .
We decided CH was more important .
We were worried during the first days of CH that the emails would take over the conference .
Pachauri was asked questions , there was a press conference with Stern in which journalists were told there were to be no CG questions , so of course all the questions were about the emails .
The attempted blocking of awkward questions indicates the approach of the climate lobby to problems .
FF : John Beddington and Mike Hulme say the media has been too hard on sceptics .
Has the media attitude contributed to the sceptical backlash ?
What should scientists do differently ?
I was shocked that scientists stuck to their previous stories despite the email evidence and then would n’t answer specific questions .
And DA has said that scientists have to “ go further than the science ” to win people over .
BJ : Sceptics are n’t mad people , they ’re people in general – taxi drivers , not Monckton or Booker .
People are yet to be persuaded .
They are n’t stupid and respond to evidence around them – they see a cold winter and ask where is AGW ?
People do n’t talk to scientists – journalists have that privilege .
But scientists do get things wrong and sometimes duck questions .
We need to present the sceptical p-o-v .
Last year we just printed press releases on AGW if they came from people with the right credentials ; that wo n’t do any longer .
People listen to Jeremy Clarkson who ’s sceptical ( although eventually Jeremy will come round ) .
FH : Scientists at first reacted disastrously to the emails , claiming the important thing was that they ’d been stolen .
They did n’t understand that no one cared whether they ’d been stolen or not , just as with MPs ’ expenses .
I have sympathy for the scientists who could n’t say that , say , Pachauri should resign or Phil Jones had acted badly .
Now permission has been granted to be sceptical .
People think it ’s clever to be sceptical as the opposite is to be climate - gullible .
RB : I ’m not surprised at the level of UK scepticism as the main impacts of CC are decades away and in other places .
The problem is poor science awareness .
We need to improve science education so people properly understand climate science .
There was some comfort in the BBC poll showing that scepticism has increased – half the respondents were aware of CG and of those , most had become less critical of CC ( although this does seem a little strange , it was a small sample and might not be right ) .
DA : The meaning of sceptic is very specific .
It ’s not taxi drivers or people who do n’t want to pay higher electricity bills .
It ’s someone who knows better and takes a contrary view for pathological reasons .
No journalists believe that climate science was undermined by the emails .
Audience Qs :
Q : I ’m disturbed by the panel ’s attitude .
Scepticism is legitimate , denialism not .
The events should n’t be called anything - Gate as that implied conspiracy and there was none .
Why have n’t the media found out who stole the emails and was n’t the timing of their release interesting ?
DA : We can no longer call people deniers .
We need a new term .
Some people have suggested “ climate creationists ” .
FH : Sceptics were clever in choosing their name .
We do need a new name , denier wo n’t work because of Holocaust associations .
Q : What was the influence of the blogosphere ?
RB : probably bad .
FH : I ’m astonished by the viciousness of anonymous people on the internet .
Q : Did anything good come from CG ?
How to move forward ?
BJ : The other day a Sun driver talked to me about the Medieval Warm Period .
That would n’t have happened 6 months ago .
All climate science will now be tested and people will ask how strong the science really is .
There ’s been a perfect storm of things going wrong – CG , CH , Met Office predictions – it could only be worse if David Attenborough had been caught in bed with Lord Monckton .
Q : How to report uncertainty in , for example , Met Office forecasts ?
What will persuade sceptics and deniers ?
BJ : It ’s curious how Met Office and WMO predictions on AGW came out in the week of CH ( some audience disagreement as to whether there had been a change from their normal timetable ) .
It was at least bad timing for organisations that value integrity .
They should distance themselves from advocacy .
The Met Office is ahead of the science .
FH : FT readers are versed in risk and probability which are difficult to communicate in the rest of the media .
Climate scientists are n’t generally newsworthy ; sceptics , IPCC problems and emails are making the news .
“ Climate – guess what ?
Still changing ” is an unlikely headline .
A short - term disaster is needed to guarantee coverage as people are n’t good at processing information about there being no ice at the poles in 30 years .
Or get David Attenborough as the front man because everyone trusts him .
RB : I agree that a short term disaster would be effective in persuading people .
DA : Essentially no one read the IPCC report .
Climate scientists need to fight on territory the media are interested in .
Get the Royal Society to speak out or 2000 scientists to sign a petition protesting at media coverage .
BJ : A disaster wo n’t do it .
It needs businesses , eg Tesco , Nike , to make a big thing about going zero / low carbon .

- A video will be put on RI / ESI websites .
At the box - office the major movie studios are raking in record profits , but their continuing refusal to widely adopt online business opportunities are hindering progress .
According to the head of the Blockbuster video chain , the movie industry 's greed is to blame for holding back innovation .
First off , we have to make it clear that the major movie studios are doing great at the box - office , despite movie piracy riding at an all - time high .
Other parts of the movie industry , such as video rental outlets , do seem to struggle and they have the studios to thank for this , not piracy .
In January of this year Warner Bros. announced that new DVDs will not be available at online rental outlet Netflix for the first month after they are released in stores .
Warner Bros. hoped that this would increase DVD sales .
However , the most likely side effect is an increase in piracy and a loss of income to Netflix .
It is a step back in a time where consumers are screaming for on - demand access and the flexibility to choose the option they want for their video consumption .
The studios are clearly skeptical of all these ‘ new ’ technologies and are frantically adding restrictions to maximize their revenues , ignoring all market signals .
The greed of the music studios has n’t gone unnoticed by Paul Uniacke , head of the Video Ezy and Blockbuster video rental chains .
“ Studio greed is what ’s holding back video - on - demand , ” he said in response to the studios demands to pay huge sums of money upfront if they want to offer on - demand streams .
“ Movie studios are still as arrogant as the music moguls were before digital downloads and piracy destroyed them .
The only thing that ’s protecting the movie studios ( from more widespread illegal downloading ) now is file size , ” Uniacke added .
Much like the big music labels , the studios are trying to control how people consume media to an extent where it becomes impossible for innovative retailers to offer a product that can compete with piracy .
By this process they are killing their own business and that of many retailers , while blaming piracy for the damages .
Consumers demand convenience , availability and a high quality product for a fair price .
Still , the decisions of the music labels and movie studios are mostly heading in the opposite direction as they cling to their old business of trying to safeguard their monopolies .
Customer : “ Excuse me , I sent a letter last week but it came back .
Can you tell me why ? ”

Me : “ Oh , okay .
You ’re going to need a valid house address to have it sent . ”
Customer : “ I did put the address ! ”

Redding , California gun dealer Patrick Jones — who happens to also be mayor of the town — refuses to do business with known medical marijuana patients .
“ There is nothing in state law that says I can not own or possess a firearm , ” Merritt said at a recent city council meeting .
And to be told as such is branding me as a severe mental patient or a felon .
I am neither . ”
That refusal has drawn lots of criticism from patients such as Army Spc. Sean Merritt , an honorably discharged and disabled veteran .
The patients , who have twice gone to Redding City Council chambers to denounce Jones , say he is violating patients ’ rights , reports Scott Mobley at the Redding
​ Jones claims he is merely following the law , citing a federal law that forbids gun dealers from selling firearms to anyone who is “ an unlawful user of , or addicted to , marijuana . ”
Prospective gun owners must fill out a federal Bureau of Alcohol , Tobacco , Firearms and Explosives ( ATF ) form that quizzes the buyer about criminal history , mental health , citizenship and “ drug use . ”
Question 11e on the ATF form asks about marijuana , along with “ any depressant , stimulant , narcotic drug , or any other controlled substance . ”
If a buyer marks “ Yes ” to 11e , the sale cannot go forward , Jones claimed .
Merritt , who uses marijuana to treat pain and spasms in his groin and thigh .
He ’s suffered since a military doctor performing a hernia operation accidentally cut a nerve , and said the harsh pharmaceuticals prescribed him by the Veterans Administration left him feeling “ like a zombie . ”
Merritt credits cannabis with helping him live a better life ; he said he came to California so that he could lawfully use the herb medicinally .
Christine Gasparac , press secretary for the California Department of Justice , said nothing in state law would prevent a medical marijuana user from buying or owning a gun .
“ But the ATF is a federal form , ” Gasparac said , adding that she is unaware of any case law which could clarify the issue .
Rich Howell , general manager at Olde West Gun & Loan Company in Redding , said he does n’t coach people on how to answer Question 11e .
“ That ’s a determination as to what is unlawful , and we do n’t interpret the law , ” Howell said .
“ We just have to make sure when someone comes in to purchase , it is done in an acceptable , legal manner . ”
While gun ownership obviously would n’t be illegal under Proposition 215 , under which California voters legalized medical marijuana in 1996 , things are n’t so clear under federal law , Howell said .
People who use medical marijuana are n’t necessarily “ addicts , ” any more than those who use Vicodin or OxyContin medically are addicts , Howell said .
“ We do need clarification , and it has to come from the ATF , ” Howell said .
“ Until that direction comes , I say , ‘ Legally , I ca n’t tell you . ’ “
Drew Wade , an ATF spokesman in Washington , D.C. , could not say off the top of his head whether federal law trumped state law on the question of whether medical marijuana patients can buy firearms .
But gun dealer Mayor Jones claimed the law is clear .
“ I have called the ATF and they have told me the law , ” Jones said , claiming that he has spoken with two different field officers on two separate occasions to make sure .
“ It ’s not up for interpretation , it ’s not a debatable issue , ” he said .
“ If a person is declaring they are a medical marijuana patient , I can not sell to them . ”
Merritt called Jones Fort , the mayor ’s gun store in Redding , after hearing of other medical marijuana patients who had been denied a gun purchase there ( Jones claims he has turned away only two potential customers for being pot patients ) .
Merritt said he asked the clerk if he could buy a gun , even if he was using morphine .
The clerk said yes .
Merritt then asked if he could buy a gun if he was using Klonopin .
Again , the clerk said yes .
Then Merritt asked about medical marijuana , and clerk told him no .

WASHINGTON  Senator Christopher J. Dodd , the embattled Connecticut Democrat who was facing an increasingly tough bid for a sixth term in the United States Senate , has decided not to seek re-election this year , Democrats familiar with his plans said Wednesday .
Mr. Dodd , 65 , a pivotal figure in the major debates now confronting Congress , is to announce his decision at a news conference Wednesday afternoon in Connecticut .
The decision came hours after another Democratic senator , Byron L. Dorgan of North Dakota , also announced that he would not seek re-election this November .
The developments underscored the fragility of the Democrats ’ 60 - vote Senate majority , which is just enough to block Republican filibusters .
Democratic incumbents also face serious challenges in Arkansas , Colorado , Nevada and Pennsylvania among other states .
In this case , Mr. Dodd was already considered one of the most vulnerable Democrats facing re-election this November , and party officials had been privately hoping he would step aside .
His move opens the way for the state ’s highly popular attorney general , Richard Blumenthal , a Democrat , to run .
Democrats and Republicans said he would be a much stronger candidate in what is a Democratic state .

Man Attempts to Set Off Explosives on Detroit - Bound Airplane Suspect claims al Qaeda terrorism link , but feds are suspicious .
Dec. 25 , 2009  --
Federal officials and police are interviewing a Nigerian man , who allegedly tried to " explode " a powdery substance aboard a Northwest flight from Amsterdam to Detroit , injuring himself and two other passengers , law enforcement officials said .
The man said he was directed by al Qaeda to explode a small device in flight , over U.S. soil , ABC News has learned .
Authorities have no corroboration of that information , and the credibility of the suspect 's statements are being questioned , officials said .
The suspect was identified as Abdul Farouk Abdulmutallab , 23 , who according to federal documents is an engineering student at University College of London .
He was flying from Nigeria to the United States for a religious seminar , according to his entry visa , which was issued June 16 , 2008 and was good until June 12 , 2010 .
The government had no immediate plans after the incident to raise the threat level , a federal government source said .
The threat level has been at " orange " since 2006 .
The suspect had been in a law enforcement - intelligence database but was not on the government 's no-fly list , according to a law enforcement official .
" The subject is claiming to have extremist affiliation and that the device was acquired in Yemen along with instructions as to when it should be used , " a federal situational awareness bulletin stated .

Delta spokeswoman Susan Chana Elliott said that " as the plane was getting ready to land " in Detroit " a passenger caused a disturbance " by trying to ignite what was initially reported to be firecrackers .
The man was " subdued immediately , " Elliott said .
Northwest is a wholly owned subsidiary of Delta .
" There was one guy , who sat on the other side , the right side of the wing because this was on the left side of the wing , and he jumped over the other people and he took care of it , " said passenger Peter Smith .
The suspect told authorities that he had explosive powder taped to his leg and used a syringe of chemicals to mix with the powder that was to cause explosion .
This is of concert because it is a method of mixing that is consistent with terror techniques .
Northwest Airlines flight 253 -- operated on a Delta airplane -- landed safely in Detroit at 11:53 a.m .
The man , who flew from Nigeria to Amsterdam and then Detroit , was taken into custody at the Detroit airport and was interviewed by authorities there .
He was then taken to an area hospital to be treated for burns .
An in - flight emergency was declared when a fire indicator light when on in the cockpit , according to the Federal Aviation Administration .
The pilot asked for airport rescue and firefighting services , and for law enforcement to meet the flight at gate , the TSA said .
It is unclear how powerful the explosive could have been and what the man 's intentions were .
Initial reports were that fireworks or firecrackers had gone off on the plane .
The man suffered second - degree burns , which is consistent with a small fireworks device , police sources said .
One of the passengers is being treated at the University of Michigan Medical Center in Ann Arbor , according to hospital spokeswoman Tracy Justice , who was not sure if it was the suspect or one of the other passengers .
Man Tried to Ignite Explosives on Plane , Law Enforcement Says
Federal Bureau of Investigation Special Agent Sandra R. Berchtold from the Detroit office confirmed that the FBI was at the airport , but she would not comment further .
" All passengers have deplaned and out of an abundance of caution , the plane was moved to a remote area where the plane and all baggage are currently being rescreened , " the Transportation Security Administration , which handles aircraft and airplane safety , said in a statement .
" A passenger is in custody and passengers are being interviewed . "
The aircraft was an Airbus A330 - 300 , twin - engine jet carrying 278 passengers .
President Obama was notified of the incident by his military aide between 2 p.m. and 2:30 p.m. Detroit time or 9 a.m. in Hawaii , where the Obamas are vacationing , according to White House spokesman Bill Burton .
The president subsequently convened a secure conference call with John Brennan , his Homeland Security and Counter - terrorism adviser , and Denis McDonough , acting chief of staff for the National Security Council .
Obama then instructed that " all appropriate measures be taken to increase security for air travel . "
" The President is actively monitoring the situation and receiving regular updates .
There is currently no change to his schedule , " Burton said in a statement .
TSA has a layered approach to security that the agency says allows it to surge resources as needed on a daily basis .
It would not give specifics except that it has the ability to quickly implement additional screening measures including explosive detection canine teams , gate screening , behavior detection and other measures " both seen and unseen . "
The TSA said these measures are designed to be unpredictable , so passenger should not expect to see the same thing at every airport .
The Department of Homeland Security said Secretary Janet Napolitano has been briefed on the incident and is closely monitoring the situation .
The agency , which includes the TSA , said passengers may notice additional screening measures put into place to ensure the safety of the traveling public on domestic and international flights .
" As always we encourage the traveling public to be observant and aware of their surroundings and report any suspicious behavior or activity to law enforcement officials , " the agency said in a statement .
Shortly after the 9/11 terrorist attacks , Richard Reid , a British citizen and al Qaeda operative , tried to blow up an American Airlines flight from Paris to Miami with explosives hidden in his shoe .
Passengers on the flight complained of smelling smoke shortly after the meal service , and Reid was found trying to light a match .
He was subdued by other passengers on the plane and the flight was diverted to Boston 's Logan International Airport .
Reid , the so - called shoe bomber , pleaded guilty to terrorism charges in January 2003 and is serving a life sentence at a federal prison in Florence , Colo .
His actions , in part , are why we must all now take off our shoes as part of the airport security screening process .
" Eight years after Richard Reid attempted to blow up an airliner with explosives hidden in his shoe , today 's incident , on Christmas Day , is a disturbing reminder that the terrorist threat is still very real and that we must continue to be vigilant and alert , " U.S. Sen .
Susan Collins , R - Maine , the ranking member of the Senate Homeland Security Committee said in a statement .
" The White House is calling this an attempted terrorist attack , " Collins added .
" It raises some serious questions , such as how was this person able to bring an explosive substance aboard a commercial airliner ?
And what is the Transportation Security Administration doing to address this type of threat ? "
With reports from Matt Hosford , Pierre Thomas and Steven Portnoy .
Oversized neon Olympic rings illuminate Vancouver harbour while a giant mural of a snowboarder mid-trick welcomes visitors to the airport .
In the city centre , a sleek steel - and - glass Olympic clock is counting down to next month 's winter games .
But for 51 - year - old Wayne , a homeless drug addict , looking up at the snowcapped mountains where the downhill competition runs will be fills him with dread .
" We 're all going to be cleared out of here before the Olympics , " he said , wrapped in a flimsy sleeping bag and clutching a bag of bottles plucked from street bins which he will exchange for money .
" The clean - up will happen – they all want to hide the city 's black eye , right ? "
That black eye is the Downtown Eastside ( DTES ) , one of the most highly visible and divisive parts of the Canadian city 's involvement with the Olympics .
The area is both ghetto and historic community .
It boasts a high concentration of single - room accommodation and cardboard - and - shopping - trolley " homes " for Wayne and many of the region 's other 2,660 homeless people .
With Canada 's poorest postcode sitting within a city regularly ranked as the most livable in the world , the city 's leaders know Vancouver is preparing for a barrage of scrutiny : yards down the street , the British Columbia provincial government has even set up an information centre , DTES Connect , to try to showcase its work in the area to the world 's media .
Ever since the games were awarded to Vancouver , population 611,000 , and the nearby resort of Whistler in 2003 , resistance has focused on housing .
Ceremonies have been disrupted , and officials of the Vancouver games organising committee ( Vanoc ) have been threatened with symbolical " evictions " from their homes by Anti-Poverty Committee protesters .
Before Christmas , more than 100 campaigners blocked rush - hour traffic , shouting and waving banners saying " Do n't kidnap the homeless for the Olympics " .
The anxiety stems from a recent provincial government law empowering the police to force rough sleepers into shelters in extreme weather , a move which homeless groups appear to view as an Orwellian effort at civic image control .
Police officers have been told to use only " non-forceful touching " in implementing the Assistance to Shelter Act , but that has not stopped critics calling it the Olympic Kidnapping Act .
" Word on the street holds that this is a way to clean - up during the Olympics , " said Tracey Axelsson , project manager for Home for the Games , a non-profit organisation for residents to host visitors for the Olympics and split the rental income with homeless groups .
David Eby , the executive director of the BC Civil Liberties Association , said : " I do n't feel that there is any question among most people who have been following the homeless issue in Vancouver that this act is targeted at giving police a tool to remove homeless people from high - visibility tourist areas . "
Although proposed bylaws against sitting or lying on the pavement were rejected , he thought there would be further attempts to displace the homeless .
For three decades , the port has been a magnet for sex workers driven out of wealthier neighbourhoods , addicts and people released from mental wards shut in the 1990s .
Methamphetamine and crack - cocaine users shoot up on the street yards from a police station .
A relatively moderate climate and the concentration of needle exchange , safe injection sites and sex worker drop - in centres are further draws .
Where Vancouverites are most divided is whether there is any connection between spending more than £ 3.5bn on the Olympics and the city 's homelessness problem : according to the most recent official homeless count , numbers soared 137 % between 2002 and 2008 .
" There are those who argue , " Eby said , " that we should n't be spending billions on a two - week party until we 've dealt with the fact that people are freezing and starving in our streets . "
Chris Shaw is a professor of ophthalmology at the University of British Columbia , and a spokesman for 2010 Games Watch , part of the Olympic Resistance Network .
He thinks the benefits of the games are nothing more than empty promises .
" There are just greater attempts to ' solve ' the problem with more policing and expelling the homeless , " he says .
All the main partners involved in the games deny this , pointing instead to the planned affordable housing in the athletes ' village , residents being hired to collect rubbish for recycling during the games , and multi- million - dollar revitalisation plans for the area .
" We are not going to try to ' cleanse ' our streets , " Kerry Jang , a local councillor , said .
" We 're investing in the community , and we feel very strongly that things are getting better .
But it 's not going to happen overnight . "
Some homeless groups have seen the games as a catalyst for action .
" I can't say for sure if the same level of government support towards reducing homelessness would have occurred without the Olympics , " said Michelle Clausius of Covenant House , a group that supports homeless youngsters , " but I know that the issue is much more in the spotlight than it was prior to the awarding of the games . "
As for Wayne , after six years of sleeping rough he has his own opinion on the long - term solution : " I despise the Olympics , but you know what the answer is ?
Just pull down the whole of the Downtown Eastside , with its bedbugs and cockroaches .
Just destroy it all . "
The straw poll victory of Rep. Ron Paul ( R - Texas ) at the Conservative Political Action Conference ( CPAC ) last week , with a plurality of 31 percent , spurred a wide range of reaction and emotions .
If you were n't already a fan of the radically libertarian Republican congressmen , his victory was n't the thing to make you start taking him seriously .
Many agreed that Paul 's win , if meaningful , could only bode ill for the Republican Party 's prospects .
David A. Harris at TalkingPoints Memo thinks
Paul 's ascendance means the GOP is determined to give up on the Jews ( since Paul has suggested that certain U.S. foreign policy decisions benefit Israel more than they benefit the U.S. ) .
Earl Ofari Hutchinson at Huffington
Post thinks
Paul 's win means racism and nativism is on the rise in the GOP , as he fantasizes about non-existent race - based jibes in Paul 's CPAC speech .
In the real world , Paul 's speech was mostly about fiscal probity and saving the U.S. from a debt - driven dollar collapse .
Paul applied principles of limited government and restrained spending to a place where most Republicans fear to tread : foreign policy .
He stressed the vital importance of the free exchange of ideas , including a long shout - out to Eugene Debs , the socialist leader jailed by Democratic god Woodrow Wilson for saying the wrong things , and freed by Republican President Warren Harding .
Paul talked to the assembled activists of the unity of liberty , including the liberty to eat and smoke what you want .
He harkened back to old Republican icons ( such as President Dwight D. Eisenhower with his military - industrial complex warnings ) to give his constitutionalist libertarian version of conservatism a usable past .
His talk was rambly , perhaps not ready for prime time , but united by a bracing vision of a government that did only what its Constitution intended it to do .
This makes him radical indeed .
That radicalism makes it unsurprising that the Republican assault on Paul in America 's most prominent print outlets had actually ramped up in the week before the CPAC victory .
Coincidence , or a subterranean sign that the forces of respectable Republicanism were feeling the pre-shocks of the CPAC Paulquake ?
In The Washington Post , former Bush speechwriter ( now there 's a pedigree that should give you free rein to lecture conservatives about strategy ) Michael Gerson openly called for an old - fashioned purge of Paulites ( along with " racists and conspiracy theorists " and " acolytes of …Tom Tancredo and Lyndon LaRouche " — neither of them polled double digits at CPAC ) .
Dorothy Rabinowitz in the Wall Street Journal pre-emptively referred to Paul 's squad of dedicated activists for small government as " assorted other cadres of the obsessed and deranged " in the week prior to the surprise CPAC win .
Those who tend to agree with Paul were delighted by his victory , more excited than Paul was himself .
Paul told me earlier this week that " I see [ the CPAC win ] as making progress , but I would n't overblow it .
I try to put it into perspective .
I probably get more excited about what 's happening when I go to a college campus and get 1,500 students excited about what I 'm doing .
If they did a national poll of all Republican voters , I mean obviously I 'm not going to be running the show . "
( Paul still insists he is " firmly undecided " about another presidential run . )
The standard bastions of the right - wing were not amused by the shenanigans of the crazy kids at CPAC , and many noted that Paul 's victory should not be seen as a sign the Republican Party is his for the grabbing .
Former presidential candidate and TV talk show host Mike Huckabee wrote off CPAC — that is , many thousands of the most dedicated and engaged political junkies and activists available to the GOP — as being too libertarian and thus irrelevant to his Republican Party .
Neocon intellectual chieftain Bill Kristol thinks
Paul 's win means nothing ; why , Kristol pointed out on Fox News , the majority of those CPAC kids are under 25 !
Surely , crazy fads sweeping the young and politically motivated have no significance for a political party 's future , right ?
The lefties at Daily Kos noted that Fox News , the definers of the GOP as a media brand , were not too thrilled about Paul 's victory and dismissed its importance .
The American Conservative recognized that while " Ron Paul people " may have had the plurality at CPAC , the widespread boos that accompanied the announcement of his win shows that he was probably widely reviled by the 69 percent who did n't pick him .
Political analyst Patrick Ruffini at The Next Right has a balanced , non -fan 's perspective that I think gets it about right , explaining what the standard bastions of conservatism should both fear and credit Paul and his fans for :
In 2007 , the Paulites were an oppositional force trying to submarine the GOP 's commitment to the war on terror , thus threatening traditional conservatives .
Today , libertarians and conservatives have come together against Obama 's endless expansion of the State , with Ron Paul supporters supplying creative organizing tactics and boots on the ground .
…. in terms of grassroots organization , Paul supporters are some of the best — if not the best — that we have .
The iconography of the tea party movement is heavily libertarian ( think the Gadsden Flag ) and that 's no coincidence .
If you broke down the organizers and even those in attendance [ at CPAC ] , you 'd find more than your fair share of Ron Paul supporters .
This is a categorical shift that 's happened in the last year .
Victory in a CPAC straw poll ( which belonged to Mitt Romney the past three years , smacked down this time with 22 percent to Paul 's 31 ) does not mean national leadership , the nomination , or the presidency .
But beyond their affection for Paul himself — the most consistently and radically pro-liberty political figure of any significance on the Republican scene — a poll of CPAC attendees reveals encouraging facts about their general political attitudes : 80 percent claimed their " most important goal is to promote individual freedom by reducing the size and scope of government and its intrusion into the lives of its citizens " versus a mere 9 percent whose most important goal was to " promote traditional values " and 7 percent to " guarantee American safety at home and abroad regardless of the cost or the size of government . "
I predicted last September that Ron Paul could well be playing a Goldwater in 1960 role — the first stirrings of a strongly anti-government coalition whose electoral effectiveness wo n't become manifest for a while — and the CPAC victory is an encouraging sign in that direction .
The usual caveats apply about the unknowability of the future , and the generally predictable pusillanimity when it comes to liberty of both the voters and politicians who have tended to decide the Republican Party 's direction .
Still , it does feel like something is happening , and we do n't know what it is , do we Dr. Paul ?
I 've been following Ron Paul 's career since 1988 , when my buddies in the University of Florida College Libertarians brought him — then the Libertarian Party 's presidential candidate — to our campus to speak .
He drew 100 or so people , copped a front page story in the college paper , and fed into my and my comrade 's youthful sense of a subterranean liveliness in ideas and politics that it was still possible to dredge , at least for a moment , to the surface .
Swaying masses in that libertarian direction seemed … well , I suppose it was the goal , but in the same sense that interstellar travel might be seen as the " goal " of reading and thinking about science fiction .
Libertarian Party politics seemed at best an entertaining vehicle toward the semi-actualization of some wild , hopeful imaginings .
I was pleasantly surprised when Paul won his way through opposition from both Republicans and Democrats back to his Texas House seat in 1996 .
I first wrote about him as a profile of an entertaining GOP curiosity for the American Spectator in 1999 .
His political colleagues were alternately confused or amused by him , often good for a pro forma expression of respect for his steadfast refusal to compromise , but he was clearly the sort of anomaly that would just drive party leaders crazy if he multiplied .
By the time I was writing my book on the history of the libertarian movement , Radicals for Capitalism , which I completed in early 2006 , Paul had settled into seeming like just a cute libertarian blip in the world of standard politics .
I interviewed him for the book again , but did not give him nearly the play that events since then have proven he deserved .
I was one of the first journalists to note his candidacy in January 2007 , and followed him on the campaign trail for Reason in late 2007 .
I watched in amazement as his money bombs exploded and he forged a mass , youth - oriented movement , one that survived his campaign , and saw his oldest hobbyhorse , attacking the Federal Reserve , become almost mainstream .
Still , exciting as that disturbingly exhilarating feeling of having been , just maybe , on top of history can be , Paul 's rise to prominence is also , I confess , unnerving .
Various high - end libertarian luminaries — from Milton Friedman to Murray Rothbard — predicted that the appearance of crises for which libertarians had provided prescriptions and solutions would likely be key to public acceptance of libertarian governing principles .
And indeed , in his CPAC talk Paul directly credited what public respect and attention he 's won since his failed presidential campaign to the fact that he predicted the current economic crisis , based on his understanding of Austrian business cycle theory and the dangers of low interest rates in causing boom - bust cycles .
Despite Paul 's cheery statement in the CPAC speech that he thinks the country could be a lot better off a year from now , the Paulite vision , if taken seriously , is pretty goddamn scary .
It 's not scary because he 's scary , or because his ideas in application are inherently scary , but because he predicts very scary results from decades of government mistakes , overreach , and hubris .
So much inflation , so much fiscal mismanagement , so much debt , so much imperial overreach , will , Paul regularly predicts , lead to a total collapse in the value of the dollar — a prospect that will have very dire effects for nearly all of us , nationally and internationally .
Despite his CPAC optimism , Paul told me earlier this week that " if we came to our senses , " avoiding collapse is " not difficult at all .
You just allow a correction to occur , let bankruptcies and liquidation of debt happen , then we go back to work and produce and build a sound money and within a year or so everyone will be doing quite well . "
But he then admits that he does n't see the political possibility of that kind of hard , frugal sense coming to bear before it all comes down .
More likely we 'll see " the catastrophic event that will come in the next several years because we are on the verge of it now .
We ca n't sustain this kind of deficit financing through the Federal Reserve . "
A sovereign debt crisis awaits for the United States .
As Paul notes ( and as I tried to explain to Glenn Beck 's audience the other week ) , this does not mean the end of our ability to meet the economic needs of humans on Earth through production and trade .
Not the end of the world per se ; still , the collapse of the reigning system of money by which we exchange our title to wealth will be ugly and harm anyone who has tried to save in anything denominated in dollars .
So there 's a very good reason anyone with any skin in the game of the status quo—politician , commentator , or citizen — has to find it very difficult to take Paul seriously .
That so many citizens and activists in the Tea Party movement are taking him seriously is scaring the establishment for good reason .
Paul does n't just represent an opposition politician , he represents an absolute denial that " the system " makes any sense , has any justice , or is sustainable .
It is this radical oppositionism that makes it so easy for standard issue pundits to just write his fans off as nuts and a bit scary .
Newsweek started to get at this important aspect of the Paul phenomenon , noting that " tea- partiers , Paulites , etc. ? seem less interested in finding practical solutions to Washington 's endemic problems than in tearing down Washington itself .
As the 2010 elections approach , this nihilistic feeling will only grow stronger . "
That 's because the radical solutions that the Paul worldview demands — an end to overseas military adventurism , ending government 's ability to manipulate paper currency , severe cuts in spending on all the myriad income - shifting promises Washington has made the past 80 years — do n't register as " practical solutions " to ( for lack of a better word ) the establishment .
They seem like nihilism , though they are actually a belief in the American Constitution .
Any standard Republican or movement conservative really can't take Paul seriously without massive cognitive dissonance .
You mean , we really really have to obey the Constitution , we really can't keep borrowing and inflating forever ?
Signs like the CPAC vote of a significant number of politically active youngsters believing in Ron Paul are indeed a sign of an apocalypse of sorts for the world that most politicians and pundits know .
If Ron Paul is right , then everything they know is wrong .

Harrisburg wo n’t be banning hand - held cell phones and texting while driving — at least not yet .
A proposal that would ban the practice in the city was amended at Tuesday night ’s City Council meeting .
Councilwoman Gloria Martin- Roberts , the bill ’s sponsor , originally proposed hefty penalties that included jail time on a third offense .
She has since reconsidered after soliciting recommendations from council members .
“ The use of cell phones has almost created an epidemic of accidents , ” Martin - Roberts said , adding that the penalties do not diminish the seriousness of the issue .
The amended bill calls for slapping offenders on a first offense with a $ 100 fine , a $ 250 fine for a second offense , a $ 500 fine for the third offense and $ 1,000 fine for the fourth and subsequent offenses .
People caught texting or talking on a hand - held phone while driving near or a school or a construction zone would face double fines .
No fine can exceed $ 1,000 .
The bill is expected to come up for a vote Dec. 8 .
If it passes , Mayor Stephen R. Reed would have to sign off on it .
Matthew Coulter , the mayor ’s spokesman , responded in an e-mail that he had not had a chance to speak to Reed about his position .
The bill would go into effect 60 days after its passage , Martin - Roberts said .

( CNN ) -- Yahoo ! and the micro-blogging site Twitter have struck a content - sharing deal , they announced Wednesday -- a plan that will share real - time tweets with the 600 million users in Yahoo 's global network .
The partnership will let people access their Twitter feeds on Yahoo !
properties including their home pages , Yahoo !
Mail , Yahoo !
Sports and others -- making it easier to tweet or check on the people they follow .
Users will be able to update their Twitter status from Yahoo ! sites and share content from Yahoo ! in their Twitter stream .
Yahoo !
Search also will be including real - time Twitter updates .
" Let me try to capture the enormity of this integration in 140 characters or less , " Yahoo !
Vice President Bryan Lamkin said in a written release , referring to Twitter 's ultra - tight limit on tweets .
" We 're turning the key to the online social universe -- you will find the most personally relevant experiences through Yahoo ! "
The move comes as established Internet players are making moves to plug into the social - media movement spearheaded by sites like Facebook and Twitter .
Most notably , Google last month created Google Buzz -- its own networking feature that uses elements similar to both of those sites .
In a blog post Wednesday , Twitter said the Yahoo ! deal is similar to its other partnerships with sites like the search engines Google and Bing .
" From our perspective , this partnership represents a big opportunity , " reads the post .
" Tweets may be short , but they have proven over and over again to contain valuable information . "
How does it feel to discover the person you married is gay ?
Or , after years with a man , that you 're attracted to other women ?
Amy Bloom introduces the stories of partners who had a change of heart
I 'm not sure why we should be shocked when someone ends a marriage and comes out of the closet .
A quick browse on the internet will reveal plenty of websites with names such as My Husband Is Gay and Gay Husbands / Straight Wives , with checklists for worried wives .
The top warning signs ?
Possession of homosexual pornography and evidence of visits to homosexual porn websites .
( You would not think a lot of men , confronted with a log of their hours spent on sexynakedmen.com , succeed in convincing their wives that this is a common , heterosexual male way to spend an after­noon , but apparently they do . )
There are n't as many websites for men left by gay wives .
Perhaps they are n't as ready to share their hurt .
Perhaps it 's their wounded pride .
Whatever the reason , it 's certainly not because it 's not happening .
But why should we have such illusions about marriage anyway ?
There are many things spouses choose to keep secret , and homosexuality is just one of them .
No man says : I do , mostly because your money will allow me to become a successful businessman .
No woman says : I want to have children soon and I am too conventional / cautious / career - oriented to do it by myself .
Weekly sex will be OK , as long as passion is not required .
There are three powerful bonds between people and , for better and for worse , they often operate separately , rather than together : sexual attraction , long - term attachment and romantic yearning .
Sexual attraction can bring together two people who have almost nothing in common except what takes place between the sheets ; see most young marriages .
Then there are people whom you just love – deeply , permanently and not necessarily sexually .
These people are described as your best friend and you would willingly raise their kids and , if you had to , give them a kidney .
( A lot of gay men who marry women feel this way towards their wives ; there may be a lot of women who would n't mind a husband like that , espec­i­ally if they knew – before the wedding – that there would n't be much sex . )
There is also the bond of romantic attachment ; these are people with whom all the accoutrements of romance feel so right : the cosy table in the corner , the sweet text message as you sit through a dull meeting .
This is a lovely bond between people ; it does n't require sexual attraction and it neither precludes nor requires long - term attachment .
I have two gay men in my life with official titles .
My Gay Husband : a distinguished gentleman , a little older than me and capable of not only making me laugh myself sick , but also of helping me choose a dress and fix a paragraph .
On a few occasions , he has acted the part of my husband so convincingly , we were both a little surprised .
I also have a Gay Boyfriend : handsome , charming , brilliant on my hair colour and my essays , a little younger than me .
We have walked through a lot of places hand - in - hand and happily .
I can imagine that a woman might want to marry either of these men .
It 's the world we live in that makes it hard for gay men and women to face their homosexuality and to hope that , in marrying their best friend , they have vanquished their other desires .
( In an ideal world , it should n't be hard to give ­prospective husbands and wives heads up about ourselves .
When I started dating again after the end of my first marriage , the person sitting across the table from me always knew – Jew , writer , bisexual , near - sighted mother of three – by the second date . )
In our modern silliness , boxing , rugby - playing , good - with - a - hammer guys have to hide their gayness ; women have to conform to a certain myster­ious ideal that allows them to succeed , but not with­out some required simpering .
We want our daughters to be comfortable with themselves , their intelli­g­ence and their bodies , but not so comfortable that no boy asks them out on a date .
We want sons who are kind and honourable , but not so much so that they 'll be mocked .
We 're not ready for the bouquet of humanity – for now , we can stand only two dismal flowers : one blue , one pink .

Rebecca Jayne , 38 , ­realised that she was gay after her second ­marriage ended
‘ I ’ve never had a type of man – because I did n’t fancy any . '
Photograph : Steve Schofield
I got married young , at 20 , to a friend , because that 's what everyone did .
I knew I was n't attract­ed to him , but I thought it was normal not to feel anything .
I remem­ber walking down the aisle thinking , it 's OK , I can always get a divorce .
I think deep down I realised I was gay when I was about six .
I had very close friendships with girls and it never entered my head to want a relationship with a man – I thought it was because my parents ' relation­ship was n't very good .
As a teenager , boys approached me and I 'd think , go on then .
It was n't something I was into at all , but I did n't know there was any other option .
I grew up in rural Wales .
I did n't know anyone who was gay .
I thought you had to have a skinhead and dungarees .
Then I went to university and there was a massive gay population , but it freaked the life out of me .
London was a mad place and I did n't know what to do with myself .
I did n't stay there very long .
Instead , I got married and moved to Cornwall .
At first , it was the ideal relation­ship .
He was in the navy , so away all the time .
We had a baby , but things soon turned volatile .
I think we both knew something was n't right .
We split up after five years and a few months later I got together with another good friend , back in Wales .
My parents had split up and I did n't want to be a single mum .
I wanted my son to have brothers and sisters .
When I married my second husband , it was because I knew he'd be a good dad .
I was n't looking for a soul mate , but we were friends and companions .
And we still are .
We had two children together , and they were five and seven when we got divorced .
It was a shock to my husband , that it was n't enough for me .
I could n't give him a reason , I just knew it was n't right .
I started having counselling and it was then that I finally faced up to who I was – what I was .
Suddenly , everything fell into place .
I kept thinking , oh my God , I 'm a lesbian .
That 's why I 've never had any interest in men , never had a type – because I did n't fancy any of them .
It was six months before I told anyone else .
I did n't want to lose my friends .
I felt massive guilt about the children .
There 's this torment inside you : do you actually value what you feel enough to put everything on the line ?
My self - esteem was very low .
For so many years , I 'd just gone along with what everyone else wanted .
I came out to a few close friends first , then my oldest son , who was 15 at the time .
I wanted to make sure the kids were OK with it .
But he was fantastic .
Then I told the younger two , who were 11 and nine .
They were more confused and upset .
They were worried about how it would affect them : what will my friends think ?
What if I get bullied ?
I do n't want two mums , that 's weird .
But the oldest went into school wearing a T - shirt that said , " Some people are gay , get over it . "
And because he was so supportive , and all his friends were cool with it , they saw it would be OK .
I had a couple of flings with women , which the children did n't know about , but I waited until the younger two were comfortable before I brought my current partner home .
They thought she was great straight off , but they have n't told their friends what our relationship is , and though she has moved in and we are engaged , we 're careful not to act like a couple in public , for their sake .
I 'm not in touch with my first husband , but when I told my second , I was worried he'd think it was a slur on his manhood , or that I 'd lied to him .
In fact I think it was a relief .
He said it answered a lot of questions .
The most important thing was the children .
For a while , I was concerned my daughter might think she has to be a lesbian , because I am .
Or that I fancy her , which is ridiculous because I do n't fancy my sons , but people think that kind of thing .
But recently she said , " I 'm so pleased you 're gay , Mum , because you 're much happier than you 've ever been . "
It 's true .
When I got together with my partner , it felt like I 'd come home .
It just felt right .
I 'm finally being who I want to be .
Dean , 34 , came out to his wife after nine years together
The crisis point came four years ago , when my wife and I both went away for work .
Back home she said , " Have you missed me ? " I thought , " No , not at all . "
I 'd just turned 30 , and it hit me that I 'd been living a lie for years .
I 'd always thought I was bisexual .
I 'd had a few flings with other boys , but I just wanted to conform .
I met my wife at 20 and we got married when I was 23 .
We were together for nine years and I was always faithful , but on holiday on a beach , I 'd eye up men from behind my sunglasses .
When I told my wife I thought I was gay , she would n't believe it .
She suggested having an open marriage – I think she just wanted to keep the relationship going .
After I left , I went off the rails ; I lost my company , house , car .
I moved to London , went out on the gay scene .
I spent my early 30s doing things I should have done a decade earlier .
I 'm not in touch with my ex-wife now .
She told my grandparents I was gay , and that meant I had to tell my whole family .
My parents have been quite good about it .
I still speak to them .
My sister 's reaction was , " I could have told you that years ago ! "
I distanced myself from people in my 20s because I could n't cope .
But I 'm more honest now .
I 'd like to have a relation­ship – I 'm always hoping the next one will be Mr Right .
David and Julie , both 24 , had been together for four years when he told her he was gay
‘ The number of times he watched High School Musical should have been a sign . ’

David
We met at university , and saw each other every day for four years .
I became part of her family .
I think we all thought we would be together for ever .
I 'd had thoughts about men when I was younger , but I 'd found them easy to ignore .
Then we made a new friend and I felt overwhelmed by feelings for him .
I realised I had to get out of the relationship , so I started pushing Julie away .
It was painful because we were so close – I still love her – but eventually we split up .
Then I got really depressed .
I had left university and was working by that point , but I could hardly function .
I was having suicidal thoughts , I did n't want to speak to anyone .
Eventually I rang a counselling helpline and said that I was gay out loud for the first time .
I was terrified that if Julie found out , it would destroy her somehow – that she 'd never be able to trust a man again .
But one day , on the train back from a meeting in London , Julie 's mum called me and it all came out .
I found myself hysterical , saying , " I do n't understand why you 're being so kind . "
Julie and I had a long , emotional conversation the next day .
She was surprised and upset , but she said she still loved me , and was proud of me .
That was almost a year ago .
I have not had a relationship since , but I have seen a couple of men , and Julie and I are still really good friends .
My perspective on life has completely changed .
It 's not that I 've become hedonistic now , but I appreciate the joy of living .
I realise now that every day counts .
Julie David and I were very happy together .
I felt so lucky to have met someone who was my best friend , who I fancied and who fancied me .
We were very passionate about each other .
He was thoughtful and romantic , and I really did think that we had a future together – we had even picked out children 's names .
Then he stopped being as affection­ate , stopped making romantic gestures .
I thought he was just stressed , or depressed , so I stuck it out for a long time , hoping we could find a way back .
It was very strange because I knew how much he loved me , but he kept distancing himself from me .
It 's not as though him being gay never crossed my mind .
The fact that he was so sensitive , had lots of female friends and was into the same TV shows and music as me – all the things that made us fit together so well – raised doubts in my mind .
He was n't exactly a manly man .
But I knew how much he loved and fancied me , so it was a genuine shock when my mum rang to say he'd come out .
I cried for a long time – but then I found myself laughing .
Everything was falling into place .
It made total sense of his behaviour and I just felt terrible for him , that he had lived with this and felt he could n't tell me .
The next day we talked about every­thing : when he'd realised he was gay , who he was attracted to .
We even joked about him fancying Zac Efron , and the number of times he'd made me watch High School Musical – perhaps that should have been a sign !
Afterwards , I felt relieved .
I was angry he'd put me through all that heartache , but I understood why he did n't tell me sooner .
The last year of our relation­ship , hard as it was , gave us time to come to terms with it .
I 'm now in a very happy relationship .
It 's only been a year since David came out , so there are still some raw emotions , but it 's always hard to completely give your love and trust to someone .
Recently I heard [ rugby player ]
Gareth Thomas 's ex talking about how she felt when he came out and I found myself crying .
I could identify with everything she said and it was wonderful that she was so open .
David is one of my best friends .
We 've been through so much together and care so much about one another that we know we will always be there for each other .
And at least I wo n't have to get jealous about him dating another girl .
Both names have been changed .
Jane , 55 , has been married to her husband for 30 years but has relationships with other women
I realised I was attracted to women at 16 .
I had a few crushes on other girls , but I always knew I wanted to have a family and a " normal " life .
In my early 20s I had a relation­ship with a girl , but in the late 70s , even in a liberal household , it just was n't something anybody talked about .
Then I met my husband , in my early 20s .
I thought he would make a wonderful husband and father , and that has proved absolutely true .
We 're still together 30 years later .
I told him I 'd had this relationship with a girl , and for 15 years I did nothing about those feelings .
But they became harder to suppress , like a jack - in - the - box I had to keep slam­ming the lid on .
Eventually I told my husband and he was very generous about it and said , well , if that 's what you need to find out , go ahead .
Our children were eight and 10 , and I was in my late 30s .
I answered an ad in Time Out , saying I was married , with children , and had no intention of leaving my husband .
It was difficult to have a relation­ship .
It was hard to find time , and I can't say it did n't produce tensions with my husband .
I think he was afraid I 'd leave him , but he knew it was something I needed to do .
We did n't discuss details ; he just gave me the space I needed .
That relationship became too complicated and I had to end it .
A few months later I started another , with a friend who was also married ; it lasted a year .
Since then I 've had two flings , but nothing for eight years .
I prefer women 's bodies ; it 's as simple as that .
But I do n't think life is all about sex .
It 's wonderful when it happens , but it 's not enough to give up the life I 've got .
I have a very good relation­ship with my husband .
I would n't say the sex is great , because my heart is n't in it – actually , when I 've been involved with a woman , the sex with him has been better – but when you weigh it up against everything else …
We 're great friends and we love each other .
I feel we have a responsibility to our children as well .
They 're grown up and have left home , but I think it 's unsettling when parents get divorced at any stage .
One of my daughters is also gay , and when she was about 18 and questioning her own sexuality , I told her about my experiences .
I thought it would help , but I regretted it afterwards because she was quite upset and shocked .
I do n't know if I 'm bisexual , or gay , or what .
If anything ever happened to my husband , I could n't imagine being with another man .
I 'd probably end up with another woman .
I do n't rule out having another relationship at some point in the future .
I 'm not going to go out looking for it , but if it presents itself , I will be open to it .
Jane 's name has been changed .
Rosie Johnson , 31 , was 11 when her parents separated .
They have both since come out
My parents separated , and my mother 's partner moved in when I was 11 .
I remember the exact date my parents told me : it was the only year I kept a diary , and there 's a big , black scribble on 11 February .
They sat me and my brothers down in the morning , before school , and said , " We 're going to split up . "
This was a surprise but , from my point of view , not a disaster .
I loved Judy Blume and Paula Danziger books , which were full of heroines going through a family break - up .
Having no idea of the reality , I secretly thought it might be quite exciting to have divorced parents .
" We might have to move to Bristol , " they said .
This was not good .
" Dad 's going to move out , and Sue is going to move in to help out , " they said .
Sue had been our lodger in our old house , so this bit of news did n't really register .
I did n't care .
As long as I did n't have to move to Bristol .
In the end , Dad got a new house , five minutes ' walk away , and my brothers and I spent half the week with him , and half the week with Mum and Sue .
I do n't remember there being a moment when I thought , " Aha , Mum and Sue are girlfriends . "
They were friends with other lesbian couples , some of whom had children , so perhaps it did n't seem that unusual .
We kids were more interested in our own lives than what the adults were up to .
For me , the real worry was what other people were thinking .
Only one girl ever asked me outright .
" My mum says your mum 's a lesbian , " she said .
I went red .
" Your mum 's wrong , " I replied .
" So why are there only three bedrooms in your house ? " she asked , with a predatory smile .
I think I made some excuse about not being able to afford a bigger house , and someone sleeping on the sofa , fooling no one .
After that , I was always aware of a need to defend my family .
Things became much easier when I moved to a big sixth - form college , then on to university .
Then , in my third year , my dad called me a couple of days before I was due to visit him .
" Are you sitting down ? " he said .
" Why ? "
" How would you feel about having two gay parents ? "
My response was along the lines of , " Do n't be ridiculous . "
Dad explained that he'd met someone called Richard , who was a writer , and very nice , and I 'd meet him on Sunday .
It took the best part of a bottle of vodka that evening to get me over my initial disbelief .
I had always assumed he'd been single because he had never met the right woman .
I was happy for him , but he went from being the dad I 'd grown up with to someone with a whole new dimension to his life , that I was n't really party to .
It felt surreal , more than anything .
I was full of questions – but not as many as some of my well - meaning university friends .
" So does that mean they never loved each other ? " one friend asked .
" Are you like a freak of nature or something ? "
I did n't know what I was , but it genuinely never crossed my mind to ask either of my parents whether they had ever been in love .
I was just certain of it , as certain as I was that I had always been straight ( another question I began to get asked with disheartening regularity ) .
It 's possible that , had my mother fallen in love with another man , I 'd have more questions about my parents ' marriage .
Falling in love with another woman does tend to make people focus on sexuality and gender , rather than the individual personalities of the people involved ( I know it 's not as simple as that , but if you 're looking for a convenient way to explain it , it helps ) .
In my case , there 's one definite advantage to having gay parents ( apart from giving me an ace card in conversations with strangers ) .
Sue was never a stepmother to any of us kids in the traditional sense , but she has been a strong and supportive presence for almost my entire life .
The day before my wedding , she was in the kitchen making canapés for almost 15 hours straight , and announced at 1 am that she'd had the most marvellous day – completely typical .
I suspect she has no idea how much we love her .
I could see now that mum being gay had never been a shock because all three of them mum , dad , Sue had tried so hard to make things normal for us .
In retrospect perhaps we should have discussed things more but then it would have emphasised our differences to other families .

HOUSTON ( Reuters ) - Former U.S. Representative Charlie Wilson , the swashbuckling Texan chronicled in film for helping secure billions of dollars to fund covert U.S. operations against the Soviets in Afghanistan in the 1980s , died on Wednesday of cardiac arrest .
He was 76 .
Wilson , a Democrat , was portrayed in the 2007 movie “ Charlie Wilson ’s War ” by actor Tom Hanks as a boozy womanizer who found his life ’s cause in helping mujahedeen freedom fighters in Afghanistan fight and eventually repel occupying Soviet forces .
On a less flattering side , the movie opens with Wilson in a hot tub in a Las Vegas hotel , flanked by two strippers who are high on cocaine .
The U.S. Justice Department in 1980 investigated Wilson for possible drug use , but the probe came up empty .
Wilson served 12 consecutive terms in the House of Representatives , and was known as the “ Liberal from Lufkin , ” the town in mostly conservative east Texas where he lived .
He had complained of chest pains on Wednesday and was pronounced dead when he arrived at Memorial Health System of East Texas in Lufkin , the hospital said in a statement .
As a long - time member of the House Appropriations Committee , Wilson quietly helped steer billions of dollars to the U.S. Central Intelligence Agency , which distributed the funds to buy Afghan fighters high - tech weapons like Stinger missiles used to shoot down Soviet helicopter gunships .
“ I just saw the opportunity to grab the sons o’bitches by the throat , ” the fiercely anti-communist Wilson told the Dallas Morning News in a 2007 interview .
After the Soviet withdrawal , Wilson expressed reservations about U.S. lawmakers ’ decisions to cut funds to Afghanistan , blamed for creating a void that led to the rising influence of Osama bin Laden and al Qaeda , the Islamic militant group accused of the September 11 , 2001 , terror attacks .
Grsync : Home
What ?
Brief : Grsync is used to synchronize folders , files and make backups .
Detailed : Grsync is a rsync GUI ( Graphical User Interface ) .
Rsync is the well - known and powerful command line directory and file synchronization tool .
Grsync makes use of the GTK libraries and is released under the GPL license , so it is opensource .
It does n't need the gnome libraries to run , but can of course run under gnome , kde or unity pretty fine .
It can be effectively used to synchronize local directories and it supports remote targets as well ( even though it does n't support browsing the remote folder ) .
Sample uses of grsync include : synchronize a music collection with removable devices , backup personal files to a networked drive , replication of a partition to another one , mirroring of files , etc .
See features , resources , screenshot and online backup sections for more information .
How ?
Brief : Grsync is available on some linux flavors like Ubuntu ( see their respective application managers ) , Windows and Mac OS X
Detailed :
Only sources are directly available in this home page ; they can be compiled on various flavors of unix , like linux and freebsd , having gtk and autotools , but it has been compiled under windows as well and there is a Macintosh OS X port available .
Some ready - made packages for linux distributions have been made by third parties , so if you want to run grsync , check your standard package tool first ; if you want to compile it yourself or want to see other sources of precompiled packages , see the download page .
You need the rsync command line tool installed in your system in order to make something useful with this rsync frontend , but do n't worry because most distributions come with it preinstalled .

Since there is a lot of meat ( I had to rewrite part of the rsync process controlling code ) , I decided to skip to 1.1 directly , instead of going for 1.0.1 .
Let me know of any anomalies you will find , including behaviors which are different from the previous version .

It is about control , not murder .
Control of women .
Punishment of women .
Punishment of women who dare have sex out of their strict boundaries , who dare have it for reasons other than procreation , who dare practice autonomy of their bodies , who dare claim ownership of their sexuality .
Punishment for those Jezabels and whores .
Punishment of women who will not become mere breeders for God 's Army .
I ’m sure many of us have heard of the Quiverfull movement ( which quite frankly makes my skin crawl ) , which is just one extreme example what many are taught in the corrupted evangelical churches , women were created to birth , sex was created for procreation .
I have been told outright by evangelicals that women do not own their wombs , God does .
In fact I know some people that frankly do n’t care if a birth is risky , or the product of a rape , if a baby could be stillborn or a mother ’s life put in danger .
They believe if God wills it , the birth will be okay ; if it is not God is punishing the woman and she obviously then deserves it .
I will never , ever understand anti-choice women who believe or swallow this crap ; I often wonder who in their lives made them feel like they have no rights , that they 're so worthless .
Punishment .
And Control .
Do n't ever let them fool you that it 's about the babies .
That 's why they do n't give a crap about a child after it 's born , or already - born suffering children ; all that matters is the womb and it being used for thier will .
Not pro-life .
Pro-control .
Anti-choice .
Anti-women .
Frank Luntz is above all else a practical man .
Everything he does has been carefully calculated , weighed , and measured , be it his focus groups , his questionable " fair and balanced " polling , or his Instant Response dial sessions .
And there are words .
Words that influence political campaigns ; words that sway public opinion ; words that confuse ; words that deceive .
Most of all , words that win .
If you 're looking for poetry do not come knocking of Luntz 's door .
If you 're looking for color , you 'll not discover a Luntzian rainbow .
What you will find these days , however , is his Mighty Wurlitzer of words cranked up to full blast .
If Luntz has his druthers , he will help turn the battle over regulatory reform into a repeat of the fight over healthcare reform ; a knock - down , dragged - out process that in the end will lead to more confusion , more cynicism , and more stasis .
( Luntz instructs clients to use the word " more " as often as possible . )
In a new 17 - page memo dated January 2010 , titled " The Language of Financial Reform " -- obtained by the Huffington Post 's Sam Stein - Luntz provided a blueprint for a Republican Party committed to hanging on to its " Just say No " until at least the votes are counted in November .
There is no doubting that Luntz is a pro's pro when it comes to political strategizing , polling and messaging .
Over the years , he has taken some pretty good shots , from being reprimanded in 1997 by the American Association for Public Opinion Research and censored in 2000 for mischaracterizing poll results by the National Council on Public Polls , to being called an " moron " by Bill McInturff , the chief pollster for John McCain 's presidential campaign , at a National Journal event shortly after the 2008 election .
Nevertheless , for nearly two decades he has 's been reasonably successful at framing and re-framing messages for the Republican Party -- and a sub-set of related conservative organizations and corporate entities -- going back to 1994's " Contract with America " - co-authored with Newt Gingrich - which led to the party 's take over of Congress for the first time in a generation .
Over the past nearly two decades , Luntz , the author of " Words That Work : It 's Not What You Say , It 's What People Hear , " has not only helped the Republican Party develop its messaging , but he has also kind of developed his persona .
Where once he seemed a generally insufferable smarty - pants during appearances on cable news programs ( especially the Fox News Channel ) , he has now somewhat modified that affect , at least in other venues .
On an appearance with Bill Maher 's HBO program " Real Time " - Maher introduced him by calling him " the guru of politics " -- Luntz displayed an unexpected affability and sense of humor , which included being able to laugh at himself .
Now , after a brief falling out with GOP congressional leadership , Luntz is back in the party 's good graces , bringing it new ideas about how it can continue to pounce on the Obama Administration 's every move and turn its " Just Say No " mantra into concrete victories in November 's mid-term elections .
Luntz is a serious man with a set of serious tasks ; he has done his best to help stymie healthcare reform , and now he hopes to do the same for any Obama Administration proposals related to financial accountability .
The methodology is fairly simple : Openly recognize that there is a problem , a crisis if you will , and then advocate on behalf of the interests that caused the problem in the first place .
In " The Language of Financial Reform , " Luntz makes it clear that Republicans must acknowledge the financial " crisis , " and " Above all else , never EVER minimize the pain " that people are suffering .
With that in mind , Luntz pointed out that it 's important to set the crisis in context , because while Americans agree there is a crisis , they are " divided " on its cause .
According to Luntz 's polling , 36 % of Americans blame the crisis on " individuals who took out loans they could not afford " ; 34 % blame " Washington " ; and , 30 % blame " Wall Street . "
Luntz asks : " What industries bear the brunt of the blame ? " 33 % say home mortgage companies and 31 % say banks .
In addition to recognizing that Americans are divided on the cause of the crisis , Luntz 's memo offers 19 additional points , along with the specialty of the house ; " Words That Work " :
2 ) " You must acknowledge the need for reform that ensures this NEVER happens again " ;
3 ) " Now , more than ever , the American people question the government 's ability to effectively address the issue " - " Washington 's incompetence is the common ground on which you can build support " ;
4 ) " Public outrage about the bailout of banks and Wall Street is a simmering time bomb set to go off on Election Day " ;
5 ) " The public is angriest about lobbyist loopholes " ;
6 ) " You must be an agent of change " ;
7 ) " Demand accountability - government accountability " ;
8 ) " More bloated government bureaucracy is not the solution " ;
9 ) " Devil is in the details " - Americans want to know " what is in the fine print " of any proposed legislation ;
10 ) " Caution : unintended consequences ahead " - " What will be the effects and impact of the CFPA [ Consumer Financial Protection Act ] ? " ;
11 ) " Enforcement of current law trumps creation of new laws " ;
12 ) " The bailout provisions get the most visceral reaction " ;
13 ) " ' Bureaucrats ' are worse than ' bureaucracies ' " ;
14 ) " Americans want to end the legalese and confusion in contracts " ;
15 ) " Just the facts ma'am " ;
16 ) " Personalize the impact " ;
17 ) " It 's not reform " - " This is not a reform bill .
It is the ' Stop the Big Bank Bailout bill . '
This is important , " Luntz points out . ;
18 ) " Small business ownership is about the American Dream " ;
19 ) " No Surprise here " - " The strongest image ad we tested pertained to the bailout provisions and the ' lobbyist loopholes ' for the casino industry . " ;
20 ) " The Final Word " - " The department store Syms used the slogan 'an educated customer is out best customer . '
We could easily say an educated citizen is the biggest opponent or , your biggest ally against the creation of the Financial Reform bill and the CFPA . "
Think Progress recently pointed out that Luntz 's " client list reveals that he is in fact being paid by the finance industry " :
- " Luntz client Ameriquest Mortgages : The proposed Consumer Financial Protection Agency ( CFPA ) would eliminate predatory mortgages .
Ameriquest , America's ' sub - prime leader , ' has been prosecuted by Attorney General Richard Blumenthal for inflating property values so borrowers could get bigger loans , imposing upfront fees without reducing interest rates as promised , and intentionally deceiving lenders with hidden penalties and interest rates on final loan documents . "
" Luntz clients Merrill Lynch and Bear Stearns : Under proposed financial reform , big banks , like Luntz clients Merrill Lynch and Bear Stearns , would face a new structure designed to police financial products , prohibit predatory ones , and require clear forms and disclosures .
The CFPA would also help regulate hidden bank fees and other bank abuses . "
-
" Luntz client American Express :
The CFPA would regulate the credit card industry , preventing predatory interest rates and fees .
Deja vu all over again
If much of this sounds familiar , that 's because it is consistent with the Luntz playbook for defeating healthcare reform .
In his 28 - page report titled " The Language of Health Care 2009 , " Luntz laid out " The 10 Rules for Stopping the ' Washington Takeover ' of Health Care . "
Anyone that has followed the health care reform from debate from the very beginning will not only recognize a number of the following talking points , but will likely think to themselves , " Hey , I 've heard those lines before . "
In June of last year , Media Matters for America pointed out that in a press release issued by House Minority Leader John Boehner " criticizing a health care report by President Obama 's Council of Economic Advisers , " Rep .
Boehner use five Luntz - created talking points in one sentence .
After laying out his talking points , Luntz emphatically states that Republicans " MUST be vocally and passionately on the side of reform . "
The talking points :
1 ) " Humanize your approach " by talking only about individuals and not the " healthcare system " ;
2 ) " Acknowledge the ' crisis ' or suffer the consequences " - reframe the meaning of " crisis . "
The script : " If you 're one of the millions who ca n't afford healthcare , it is a crisis . "
" Or better yet " suggests Luntz : " If some bureaucrat puts himself between you and your doctor , denying you exactly what you need , that 's a crisis " ;
3 ) " ' Time ' is the government healthcare killer " - " Delayed care is denied care . "
The script : " Waiting to buy a car or even a house wo n't kill you .
But waiting for the healthcare you need - could .
Delayed healthcare is denied care . " ;
4 ) " The arguments against the Democrats ' healthcare plan must center around ' politicians , ' ' bureaucrats , ' and ' Washington . ' ... not the free market , tax incentives , or competition " ;
5 ) " The healthcare denial horror stories from Canada & Co. do resonate , but you have to humanize them . "
Luntz recommends using the term " government takeover " rather than " government run " or " government controlled . "
The script : " In countries with government run healthcare , politicians make YOUR healthcare decisions .
THEY decide if you 'll get the procedure you need , or if you are disqualified because the treatment is too expensive or because you are too old .
We can't have that in America . " ;
6 ) " Healthcare quality = ' getting the treatment you need , when you need it . "
The script : " The plan put forward by the Democrats will deny people the treatments they need and make them wait to get the treatments they are allowed to receive . " ;
7 ) " One - six - does - NOT - fit - all . "
The script : Call for " the protection of the personalized doctor - patient relationship . " ;
8 ) " WASTE , FRAUD , and ABUSE are your best targets for how to bring down costs " ;
9 ) " Americans will expect the government to look out for those who truly can't afford healthcare . "
The script : " A balanced , common - sense approach that provides assistance to those who truly need it and keeps healthcare patient - centered rather than government - centered for everyone . " ;
10 ) " It 's not enough to just say what you 're against .
You have to tell them what you 're for . "
The script :
When describing what you 're proposing , use the word " more " as often as possible - There will be " more access to more treatments and more doctors ... will less interference from insurance companies and Washington politicians and special interests . "
" The document , " Luntz pointed out , was " based on polling results and Instant Response dial sessions conducted in April 2009 . "
And he noted that because " more than one quarter of the population will back significant government involvement in healthcare and a third support ' universal ' care , " the primary target is the " persuadables and generate support among wayward Republicans and conservatives . "
The unexpected rise of the Tea Party movement and the Town Hall anti-healthcare reform shout - downs , the difficulty that Democratic Party leadership has had in corralling un-persuaded Democratic legislators , the Administration 's inability to turn healthcare reform into the " cause of this generation , " and the Luntz memo -- which provided the salient and oft - repeated talking points for the opposition , have led to healthcare reform 's " who - knows - what 's - going - to - happen " current status .
Does Luntz really believe that he 's " all that . "
One can only say " you betcha !
After checking out the promotional video titled " This is Frank Luntz " at his The Word Doctors website where " It 's not what you say , it 's what people hear .
The Word Doctors is a powerhouse in the profession of message creation and image management .
We have counseled Presidents and Prime Ministers , Fortune 100 CEOs and Hollywood creative teams in harnessing the power of language and visuals to change hearts , change minds and change behaviors .
We have become a hyper - attentive nation that is quick to judge .
The words and visuals you use are more important than ever in determining whether you win or lose at the ballot box , the checkout line , and the court of public opinion .
We know the words that work .
Do you ?
Our confidence comes from decades of research , polling , and consulting to the opinion elite worldwide , with proven results that withstand the test of time .
Remember : " It 's not what you say .
It 's what people hear . "
Even the president took a little time out from exchanging thoughts with congressional Republicans to recognize Luntz in the audience : " I see Frank Luntz up here sitting in the front , " he said .
" He 's already polled it , and he said ...
I 've done a focus group and the way we 're going to really box in Obama on this one or make Pelosi look bad on that one . "
" But that 's how we operate .
It 's all tactics , and it 's not solving problems . "
Luntz 's world of word - craft has never been about " solving problems . "
It 's always been about winning , and over the years , he 's done pretty well in that regard .

The patrol says state law allows only a spouse or eligible dependent to claim an officer 's pension .
Cpl .
Engelhard , a 49 - year - old Missouri State Highway patrolman , was hit and killed by a vehicle on Christmas Day while he investigated an accident on Interstate 44 in Eureka .
Glossip , 43 , has no legal right to Engelhard 's pension , though he was named as beneficiary on other assets .
But in a state that does n't recognize gay marriage , the two men did n't have a legal document that may have entitled Glossip to Engelhard 's state pension .
Kelly Glossip and Dennis Engelhard shared love , a life together for 15 years and a modest ranch home in Robertsville .
" He was a great officer and doing his job and protecting the citizens of Missouri up to the day he was struck and killed , " Lt. John Hotz said Friday .
" Missouri statute spells out who will benefit from retirement .
It 's not determined by the Highway Patrol . "
Glossip is no activist , but he says he and Engelhard were upfront about their relationship because it was important to show they were " regular , everyday people . "
And Missouri , he says , needs a civil union law that would confer to gay couples the same rights enjoyed by married heterosexual couples .
" It 's so unfair not to have equal rights , " he said Friday .
Not only is the pension out of reach , but so is the status of the couple 's home .
While they co-owned the home , his parents are considered co-owners at this point .
Missouri passed a constitutional amendment during the Bush anti gay insanity of 2004 .
Missouri still suffers the conservatism of the South and it is unlikely they will pass a constitutional amendment recognizing same sex marriage .
It will take federal intervention , like so many other states to create change .
The right wing is using this opportunity to be jerks :
Kerry Messer , founder and president of conservative Missouri Family Network , said that even in the case of unmarried heterosexual couples , rights defer to blood relatives first .
" Common law marriage does n't exist in Missouri for a very good reason , " he said .
" It throws other laws into a tailspin and muddies every other policy .
The state says ' get married or live with the status quo . '
That 's true for gays and heterosexuals . "
The obvious difference Kerry Messer is purposefully neglecting to point out , heterosexuals have legal protections at their disposal .
Glossip and Engelhard did not have such a luxury .
Their peers a few hours to the north in Iowa certainly do , but not in Missouri .
Of coarse Messer probably knew that , but the right wing never misses an opportunity to pour acid in our wounds .
The couple 's church , Christ Church Cathedral in St. Louis has set up a fund at US Bank to help Glossip .
WordPress is getting more and more popular each day , nobody can guarantee that your WordPress installation is 100 % secure .
Securing your WordPress blog is the most important thing that you must do after you have set it up on your server .
Before you read on , you need to know about Checklist to Improve WordPress Security
Encrypt your login
Stop brute force attack Use a strong password Protect your wp-admin folder Remove WordPress version info , WordPress Error - Messages
Hide your plugins folder Change your login name Upgrade to the latest version of WordPress and plugins
Do a regular security scan Backup your WordPress database Define user privilege
There are many WordPress Plugins which help you in securing your Blogs , I will share some tips , tricks and resources which will surely help you to secure and lock down your WordPress site and to fortify it from unwarranted attacks .
Scan security holes
The way to determine if your site is at risk is to use a plugin which can scans for weaknesses in your WordPress blog .
WP Security Scan is very easy to use plugin will sort out some of the basic security issues with WordPress – it ’ll change your database ’s name and alert you to flaws in your installation ’s security , among other features .
InspectorWordpress : Prevent possible attacks on your wordpress blog by monitoring each request to your wordpress blog and based on conditions you defined in the options panel it interrupts the attacker ’s action and logs it .
SecurePress Website Security Analyzer : SecurePress is a “ Live ” patent pending security system for WordPress .

TTC WordPress Tripwire Tool :
This is not a very useful security plugin indeed as it will only provide you with a list of all files changed on your WordPress site in the last 1 - 99 days .
You need to choose how many days back in time you wish to go and it will list all files changed in that time frame for you .
TAC ( Theme Authenticity Checker )
This security plugin will scan all of your theme files for potentially malicious or unwanted code .
Currently , TAC searches the source files of every installed theme for signs of malicious code .
If such code is found , TAC displays the path to the theme file , the line number , and a small snippet of the suspect code .
Very useful if your site is hacked with hidden iFrame injection attack ( Trojan Infection ) .
Safer Cookies : Normally when you login to your blog WordPress will create a session cookie that is used to authenticate you .
If someone was to steal the cookie they would be able to use it to get full access to your blog without having to know your password .
This plugin prevents that from happening – it makes the cookie specific to your IP address , so it wo n’t be usable from a different computer .
Back up your MySQL database regularly
Taking backup of database is always advisable .
In the event of crash either by your fault or from hackers , you can restore your WordPress blog from the backup file .
Perhaps for some of you , backing up a database could mean a troublesome technical chore but you can do it easily .
“ Make backups , and made it often ”
WP - DBManager allows you to optimize database , repair database , backup database , restore database , delete backup database , drop / empty tables and run selected queries .
Supports automatic scheduling of backing up and optimizing of database .
Limit login attempts to revert brute force attacks
Making smart choices that effectively lower the possible entry points available to a malicious person .
WordPress passwords can be cracked with brute force password discovery method .
To prevent that from happening , you can install the login lockdown plugin .
This plugin records the IP address and timestamp of every failed WordPress login attempt .
Once a certain number of failed attempts are detected , it will disable the login function for all requests from that range .
The Login LockDown plugin will lock out users if they enter their password wrong too many times .
You can choose how many times users can enter their password and how long they ’re locked out for via a neat options page .
It ’s obvious that if your password is the name of your blog or something like “ secret ” , brute force can easily find your password .
The first thing to do is to use a very strong password , with tiny , capital letters , numbers and special characters .
You can also rely on the generator password included in WP Security Scan .
Limit Login Attempts blocks an Internet address from making further attempts after a specified limit on retried is reached , making a brute - force attack difficult or impossible .
User Locker locks user account after given number of incorrect login attempts , and can be unlocked only by requesting new password ( using Lost Password option ) or asking Admin for help ( he / she can do it too ) .
This makes brute force and dictionary attacks nearly impossible .
Add a 2nd layer of security to your Dashboard
You can greatly enhance the security of your blog by adding more access control to your / wp - admin / folder .
This forces an attacker or bot to attack this 2nd layer of protection instead of your real admin files .
Most of the time WordPress attacks are carried out autonomously by a malicious software bot .
AskApache Password Protect adds some serious password protection to your WordPress Blog .
Not only does it protect your wp - admin directory , but also your wp- includes , wp - content , plugins , etc. plugins as well .
Imagine a HUGE brick wall protecting your frail . php scripts from the endless attacks of automated web robots and password - guessing exploit - serving virii .
Forget spam , these millions of zombie bots are too outrageous to ignore , they are attempting known ( but strangely outdated ) exploits looking for known vulnerabilities against blogs and other Internet software .
Sooner or later some poor blogger is going to miss an upgrade and become a victim to this type of video - game - like - attack .
Restricted Site Access plugin limit access your site to visitors who are logged in or accessing the site from a set of specific IP addresses .
Send restricted visitors to the log in page , redirect them , or display a message .
A great solution for Extranets , publicly hosted Intranets , or parallel development sites .
HTTP Authentication plugin allows you to use existing means of authenticating people to WordPress .
This includes Apache ’s basic HTTP authentication module and many others .
Define user privilege for multi-authors blog
This will give you , the blog owner , the ability to control what users can and cannot do in the blog .
If there is more than one author for your blog , you can install the Capability Manager plugin to define the capabilities for each user group .
The Capability Manager plugin provides a simple way to manage role capabilities .
Using it , you will be able to change the capabilities of any role , add new roles , copy existing roles into new ones , and add new capabilities to existing roles .
You can also delegate capabilities management to other users .
In this case , some restrictions apply to this users , as them can only set / unset the capabilities they have .
WP Sentry allows WordPress authors to grant access to individual private posts to users and groups of users .
With User Access
Manager you can manage the access to your posts , pages and files .
You only create a user group , put registered users to this and set up the rights for this group .
From now on the post / page is only accessible and writable for the specified group .
This plugin is useful if you need a member area or a private section at your blog or you want that other people can write at your blog but not everywhere .
Keep your WordPress and plugins updated
The WordPress developers do not maintain security patches for older WordPress versions .
Once a new version has been released or the vulnerability has been fixed then the information required to exploit the vulnerability is almost certainly in the public domain making any old versions more open to attack by a simple script kiddie .
Upgrading your plugins is nearly as important as upgrading WordPress itself , because just like WordPress , plugins are susceptible to their code being exploited for malicious purposes .
Now , upgrading WordPress plugins is dead simple out of the box , but what if you could make somehow even simpler ?
That ’s where One Click Plugin Updater comes in handy .
Update Notifier :
If you do n’t check your admin panel on your WordPress install very often ( maybe because you prefer to use remote publishing ) or you want to make sure that your clients ’
WordPress installations are updated , then this is the plugin for you .
You do n’t have to login to your admin panel regularly , subscribe to an RSS feed , or do anything apart from installing this plugin will notified when an update to WordPress is released .
WordPress / Plugin Upgrade Time
Out Plugin allows you to change the files download time out value ( mainly used for upgrade of WordPress and Plugins ) .
No more requiring to change after every WordPress upgrade .
Install WordPress Security Suites Plugins
WordPress Security Suites is a collection of various administration , SEO , maintenance , backup and security related tools .
Secure WordPress Little help to secure your WordPress installation : Remove Error information on login page ; adds index.html to plugin directory ; removes the wp-version , except in admin area .
GD Press Tools :
This tools can be integrated into the various WordPress admin panels , can perform maintenance operations , change some aspects of WordPress , see detailed server settings and information .
Plugin can also track posts and pages views for various popularity lists .
Some of the features do n’t work with every version of the WordPress .
If you have some suggestion about potential features for this plugin , please leave a message .
WordPress Firewall plugin investigates web requests with simple WordPress - specific heuristics to identify and stop most obvious attacks .
There exist a few powerful generic modules that do this ; but they ’re not always installed on web servers , and difficult to configure .
It intelligently white - list and blacklists pathological - looking phrases based on which field they appear within in a page request ( unknown / numeric parameters vs. known post bodies , comment bodies , etc. ) .
Its purpose is not to replace prompt and responsible upgrading , but rather to mitigate 0 - day attacks and let bloggers sleep better at night .
AntiVirus for WordPress is a smart and effective solution to protect your blog against exploits and spam injections .
Protects registration , login , cookies and comment forms
Invisible Defender :
The idea behind this plugin is simple : SPAMBOTs either fill every form field they find ( generic spam bots ) or fill WordPress - specific fields only ( spam bots which will recognise WP or are targeting WP only ) .
Therefore it is sufficient to add two extra text fields to form ( one empty and one with predefined value ) , and check theirs values after form is submitted .
1st field ( empty one ) will be filled by generic spam bots , and 2nd one will not be filled by spam bots targeting WP only .
With these two simple checks probably all spam bots can be easily detected , so WP can return error “ 403 Forbidden ” for them .
Absolute Privacy turns your WordPress blog into a fully private site where you control who has access .
It ’s perfect for family blogs , private communities , and personal websites .
No Disposable Email :
This plugin prevent people from registering with a disposable email addresses like the ones provided by Mailinator .
It protects your most important asset , your registered user base , by preventing contamination by fake accounts .
This plugin working principle is similar to spam blacklists .
WP - Dephorm protects your users from the prying eyes of phorm .
This is achieved by setting a cookie to opt out of the phorm information mining .
Your blog viewers will not have their information stored and used in marketing campaigns whilst viewing your site .
The idea is based upon a system devised by Dephormation .
Encrypt your login information or Forces an HTTPS connection for security purposes
You can login to the WordPress Admin Panel through encrypted SSL connections .
You need to see if your web host service gives you access to an SSL certificate first .
Most likely , you wo n’t , but they ’re cheap enough to have and worth spending a few bucks on .
Admin SSL , and Force SSL secures login page , admin area , posts , pages – whatever you want – using Private or Shared SSL .
Those is useful for those who with to enforce a higher level of security regarding the delivery of WordPress content to the browser .
Semisecure Login Reimagined increases the security of the login process by using a combination of public and secret - key encryption to encrypt the password on the client - side when a user logs in .
JavaScript is required to enable encryption .
It is most useful for situations where SSL is not available , but the administrator wishes to have some additional security measures in place without sacrificing convenience .
Chap Secure Login :
Whenever you try to login into your website , you can use this plugin to trasmit your password encrypted .
The encryption process is done by the Chap protocol ; this is particularly useful when you ca n’t use ssl or other kinds of secure protocols .
By activating the ChapSecureLogin plugin , the only information transmitted unencrypted is the username ; password is hided with a random number ( nonce ) generated by the session – and opportunely transformed by the md5 algorithm .
Hot dogs need to be redesigned so they are n’t potentially lethal to small children , American pediatricians said Monday in a new policy statement .
“ We have laws and regulations that require warning labels on toys that pose choking hazards , ” said Dr. Gary Smith of Nationwide Children ’s Hospital , the lead author of the policy published in the current issue of Pediatrics .
“ There are no such regulations on high risk foods , and children are much more likely to put food in their mouths than a toy . ”
The highest risk food is the hot dog , Smith said .
Its size and shape means it can wedge itself tightly into a child ’s throat , entirely blocking air passages .
“ If you were to design the perfect plug for a child 's airway , you could n't do much better than a hot dog , ” he told the Star .
And unlike other risk foods such as grapes and popcorn , however , hot dogs are man-made and manufacturers can easily change their shape , he said .
Other risky foods for small children include grapes , popcorn , hard candy , carrots , pears , apples and celery .
In Canada , about 44 children age 14 and under die every year from choking and another 380 are hospitalized , according to SafeKids Canada .
Almost half of those cases are from choking on food .
SafeKids concurs with the American Academy of Pediatrics ’ recommendation to slice hot dogs lengthwise .
The pediatricians go one step further , calling for a new shape for the dogs .
“ No parents can watch all of their kids 100 per cent of the time , ” Smith says .
“ The best way to protect kids is to design these risks out of existence .
There is nothing to stop you from redesigning the hot dog .
Safety sells .
Someone can create a safety dog that is n’t round and airways - sized . ”
Sweden has had age - labelling on foods for infants and young children since 1979 and warning labels on prepackaged shelled peanuts since 1981 , Smith noted .
Janet Riley , president of the U.S. National Hot Dog & Sausage Council , told The Associated Press she agrees with the need for education , and points out more than half the hot dogs sold in the United States have warnings to parents to cut them into small pieces .
“ As a mother who has fed toddlers cylindrical foods like grapes , bananas , hot dogs and carrots , I ' redesigned ' them in my kitchen by cutting them with a paring knife until my children were old enough to manage on their own , ” Riley says .
Smith disagreed .
“ Just telling people to be careful or blaming the parents is an uninformed approach . ”
The pediatricians are calling for :
• Warning labels on foods that pose a high choking risk
• A recall of food products that pose a significant choking hazard
• The establishment of a nationwide food - related choking - incident surveillance and reporting system
• A commitment from food manufacturers to design new food and redesign existing food to minimize choking risk , to the extent possible
In the meantime , the policy recommends parents and caregivers :
• Do not give children younger than 4 any round , firm foods unless they have been cut into very small pieces .
Cut hot dogs lengthwise and cut grapes into quarters .

Below is a link to a recent Washington Post article about 11 - year - old Dayton Webber .
He may lack arms and legs , but he exhibits as much heart as anyone .
Amputee Dayton Webber , 11 , excels at wrestling
At 11 months old , Dayton ’s limbs were amputated because of a life - threatening bacterial infection .
Dayton was not expected to live .
Family gathered as he was administered his last rites .
Fortunately , it ’s been over ten years since his limbs were amputated and he ’s still going strong .
He ’s been an active wrestler for four years .
He also gets outside to play football , ice skate , ride go - karts , and more .
He is as active as any of his peers .
In Dayton ’s own words ,
“ I just like to do sports .
I feel like I can play sports and kind of show people what I can do — that I can do sports just as good as them .
I feel like I can do anything if I just put my mind to it . ”
He went on to say ,
“ Anything they say I ca n’t do , I try to show them I can do it . ”
If Dayton can live with such determination despite his unfortunate circumstances , it is safe to say that we can all live with such conviction .
There are no excuses .
I honestly do n’t know what I would do if one of my own children had to go through what Dayton has endured .
I never would have thought that an 11 - year - old could be such an inspiration to me .
His story has certainly struck a chord .
We can all learn and benefit from the way Dayton lives his life .
I wish him the best of luck in his future endeavors .
Scientists Sucessfully Test World ’s First Laser - Guided Wind Turbine
The Danish National Laboratory for Sustainable Energy has successfully tested the world ’s first wind turbine with a built - in laser - based anemometer .
A laser - based anemometer allows the wind turbine to “ see ” the wind before it touches the blades .
With this information , the turbine can optimize both its position and the blades to use the wind more efficiently .
It also increases the longevity of the turbine .

“ The LIDAR system can be used to increase blade reliability by making the blades cope better with the irregularities of the wind .
Subsequently it is possible to produce larger blades .
This increases energy production , and power from wind energy becomes more competitive , says Lars Fuglsang , Global Research Director of LM Glasfiber
Laser - based anemometers split the laser in to two beams .
One beam propagates out of the anemometer to measure particulates flowing along with the air molecules .
That beam is then reflected back into a detector where it ’s measured in relation to a second beam , which is used to calculate the speed of the particles .
“ So we estimate that future wind turbines can increase energy production while reducing extreme loads by using this laser system ” says Torben Mikkelsen , professor at Risoe DTU .
“ The LIDAR systems allows a paradigm shift in the way of controlling wind turbines ” , says Jakob Dahlgren Skov , CEO of NKT Photonics A/S .
These smart wind turbines can increase electricity production up to 5 - percent .
Since the system can adjust itself to gusts of wind and turbulence , the turbines benefit from using much longer blades .
The increase roughly translates to increased revenue of about $ 39,000 per year for a 4MW wind turbine .
This advancement could cut CO2 emissions by 25,000 tons by 2025 , if every 10th turbine was equipped with the technology .

Disagreements about the lack of certain features aside , Apple clearly had casual computer users in mind when building the iPad .
Still , that does n't mean Apple will ignore enterprise users , which have been adopting the iPhone in growing numbers .
i Work is a nod to users who need to get work done using an iPad .
Pages , Numbers , and Keynote cover word processing , spreadsheet , and presentation tasks .
The iPad can also be attached to a projector to give a presentation directly from the device .
You can still import and export files compatible with Microsoft 's Word , Excel , and Powerpoint , just like you can with the desktop versions .
If for some reason iWork wo n't serve your productivity needs , at the very least it serves as a proof of concept .
Microsoft could develop iPad versions of Office apps if it determines that the demand was there .
And , while Office is pervasive in the corporate world , the potential for productivity apps from other vendors is there as well —
Omni is already talking about porting OmniGraffle to the iPad , for instance .
The iPad still retains the enterprise features of iPhone OS , including Exchange ActiveSync support for e-mail , contacts , and calendars .
But according to AppleInsider 's sources , Apple has some enterprise - friendly features planned for the iPad that have n't yet been publicly announced .
One feature is a planned ability to access standard file servers on a local network .
The other is the ability to print to networked printers .
Combined with Office - compatible iWork apps , an iPad could be useful for many routine business tasks .
These features wo n't make the iPad appealing for every business .
Especially in larger corporate environments , admins still need better management tools than Apple currently offers for its mobile devices .
And security must remain a priority , since many corporations have legal responsibilities to protect certain kinds of data .
Still , its good to see Apple is thinking about some of the business use cases for the iPad , since its size and weight will likely appeal to some enterprise users .
As a group of Labour MPs brings Parliament into yet more disrepute by claiming immunity from prosecution for fiddling their expenses , we are at risk of forgetting altogether the good work which many backbench MPs do , work which is buried in obscurity even at the best of times .
Yesterday , for example , the Science and Technology committee of the House of Commons met to conclude its inquiry into Alternative Medicine .
Its members were courteous , polite even to a fault , a far cry from the aggressive made - for - TV grandstanding of the equivalent Congressional bodies in the US ; but by the end of a few brief sessions , they had reduced to intellectual rubble the multi-million pound pseudo - medical lobby known as homeopathy – and left equally ragged the regulators and ministers who connive in its skilful mystifications of the public .
In the 18th - century , when Samuel Hahnemann developed the principles of homeopathy , it had one outstanding merit .
At a time when doctors readily prescribed mercury as a cure - all , and leeching was standard practice – the days before penicillin , before antibiotics , before streptomycin – a form of medicine which consisted of nothing more than the ingestion of small amounts of water ( ceremonially " treated " ) was much better for the patient than most of the alternatives .
For this to be true it was not necessary to believe Hahnemann 's theory : that most illnesses were the manifestations of a suppressed " itch " ( a kind of miasma or evil spirit ) and that one cured this by somehow finding the substance which caused the " itch " and then diluting it in water .
Nor was it necessary to believe , as homeopaths claim to do , that the more you dilute this substance in the water , the more effective the treatment ( " the law of infinitesimals " ) – that , in fact , the appropriate dose is water which has not one molecule of active ingredient in it , but simply " the memory " of it .
Sorry , did I forget to mention the shaking ?
Yes , the key to this remedy , according to its practitioners , is to shake the water in such a way as to make it better remember the active ingredient that might once have been contained in it .
There was a wonderful exchange about this between the Liberal Democrat MP Dr Evan Harris and Dr Peter Fisher , clinical director of the Royal London Homeopathic Hospital and Homeopath to Her Majesty the Queen , no less :
Dr Harris :
The shaking is important ?
Dr Fisher :
The shaking is important .
Dr Harris : I would have thought ( the water ) would have less memory if you shook it .
I can understand that if you left it alone it might form a memory .
Dr Fisher :
This has been looked at and the answer is that it does not induce the same structural effects .
You are inducing structural effects which may involve silica and which may involve dissolved oxygen molecules – it is not quite certain that you can show this water is different from water that is shaken without the stuff being in it .
Dr Harris :
How much do you have to shake it ?
Dr Fisher :
That has not been fully investigated .
Dr Harris : A random amount of shaking ?
Dr Fisher :
You have to shake it vigorously but exactly how much you have to shake it , no .
If you just gently stir it , it does not work .
Dr Harris : Does the Medicine and Healthcare Products Agency check how much it has been shaken before it approves it for treatment ?
Dr Fisher :
You would have to ask the MHRA , I do not know . "
Evan Harris 's reference to the MHRA is the sting in the tail of his satirical questioning .
Why does this organisation , which is meant to guarantee the efficacy of the medicines it licenses , give its imprimatur to products which no double - blind test has ever validated ?
This is particularly relevant because about £ 10 m a year is spent by the Government on such so - called medicines , via four NHS homeopathic hospitals .
Normally , when there is some controversy about the efficacy of a form of medicine using public money , the National Institute for Clinical Excellence would investigate – but , strangely , it has n't .
Still stranger was the reaction of the Health Minister , Mike O'Brien , when questioned by the Committee .
He seemed to accept that the only provable benefit from homeopathic " remedies " was the placebo effect ; but when asked if he personally approved of the idea of people being prescribed medicines which were known only to have that effect , he said " No " .
Invited then to reject outright the idea of NHS funds being diverted into such " remedies " the Minister replied , " There is a level of public interest and controversy , and there is a strong medical lobby in favour of homeopathy and there is also government funding . "
Which , as an argument , is at best circular and at worst an admission that this is nothing to do with best medical practice and everything to do with lobbying power and politics .
Perhaps the Health Minister was especially thinking of The Prince of Wales , homeopathy 's fervent supporter , who would undoubtedly be sending one of his handwritten letters with multiple underlinings to Mr O'Brien , should the minister have given the slightest sign that the Government was prepared to reconsider its support for this practice within the NHS .
It 's true that even were such a decision to be made , and the public funds saved to be reallocated to – hip replacements ?
Herceptin for breast cancer sufferers ?
you choose – Boots would still be merrily selling the stuff to the worried well with money to waste .
The man with the impressive title of " Professional Standards Director and Superintendent " at Boots was questioned by this assiduous band of MPs .
He delivered himself of a Ratner moment , when asked if there was any known benefit to homeopathic remedies , beyond the placebo effect ( otherwise known as gullibility ) .
Mr Paul Bennett replied : " I have no evidence to suggest they are efficacious .
It is about consumer choice for us and a large number of our customers actually do believe they are efficacious " .
I love that " actually " .
They actually do !
The dear , dozy customers actually do !
There is a perfectly sound commercial argument here , and also one based on freedom of choice .
Why should n't Boots make large profits selling high - priced , impressively - labelled , water tablets to hypochondriacs ?
The counter to this is powerfully put by David Colquhoun , Professor of Pharmacology at University College , London .
He has frequently carried out this experiment : he goes into chemists – not just Boots – and asks the pharmacist what " natural remedy " they would recommend for his sickly grandchild , who has suffered from " terrible diarrhoea for days " .
Just one in 10 chemists advises him to choose a conventional rehydration treatment , or to take the child to a doctor straightaway .
Colquhoun says it 's terrifying that " any sensible parent would be searching out for Dioralyte , but nine out of 10 pharmacists will start rummaging through their homeopathic shelves . "
Terrifying , yes ; but not surprising , given that a BBC Newsnight investigation three years ago revealed that high - street homeopaths routinely recommended their water - with - a- memory as a prophylactic against malaria .
When showing off cool features of Ruby to the uninitiated ( or to a language sparring partner ) , the excited Rubyist often shows off Ruby 's " powerful block syntax " .
Unfortunately , the Rubyist uses " powerful block syntax " as shorthand for a number of features that the Pythonista or Javaist simply has no context for .
To start , we usually point at Rake , Rspec or Sinatra as examples of awesome usage of block syntax :
get " / hello " do " Hello World " end
In response , Pythonistas usually point to these syntaxes as roughly equivalent :
@get ( '/ hi') def hello( ) : return " Hello World " def hello ( ) -> " / hi " : return " Hello World "
While the Python version may not be quite as pretty , nothing about them screams " Ruby has much stronger capabilities here " .
Instead , by using examples like Sinatra , Rubyists trade in an argument about great semantic power for one about superficial beauty .
Rubyists , Pythonistas and others working on web development share a common language in JavaScript .
When describing blocks to " outsiders " who share a common knowledge of JavaScript , we tend to point at JavaScript functions as a close analogue .
Unfortunately , this only furthers the confusion .
On the Ruby side , when PHP or Java announces that they 're " adding closures " , many of us do n't stop to ask " what kind of closures ? "
Cut to the Chase
Let 's cut to the chase and use a better example of the utility of Ruby blocks .
def append ( location , data ) path = Pathname.new ( location ) raise " Location does not exist " unless path.exist ?
File.open ( path , " a " ) do |file| file .puts YAML.dump( data ) end return data end
Here , the File.open method takes a block .
It then opens a new file ( in " append " mode ) , and yields the open file into the block .
When the block completes , Ruby closes the file .
Except that Ruby does n't just close the file when the block completes ; it guarantees that the File will be closed , even if executing the block results in a raise .
Let 's take a look at the implementation of File in Rubinius :
def self .open ( *args ) io = new * args return io unless block_given ?
begin yield io ensure begin io .
close unless io .closed ?
rescue StandardError # nothing , just swallow them .
end end end
This means that you can wrap up idioms like pervasive try / catch / finally in methods .
# Without blocks def append ( location , data ) path = Pathname.new ( location ) raise " Location does not exist " unless path.exist ?
begin file = File.open ( path , " a " ) file.puts YAML.dump( data ) ensure file .
close end return data end
Because Ruby runs ensure clauses even when the exception happened in a block , programmers can reliably ensure that Ruby executes teardown logic hidden away in abstractions .
This example only demonstrates the power of well - designed lambdas .
With the addition of one small additional feature , Ruby 's blocks become something altogether different .
def write ( location , data ) path = Pathname.new ( location ) raise " Location does not exist " unless path.exist ?
File.open ( path , " w " ) do |file| return false if Digest : : MD5.hexdigest(file.read ) == data.hash file.puts YAML.dump( data ) end return true end
In the above case , imagine that writing the data to disk is quite expensive , and we can skip writing if the MD5 hash of the file 's contents match a hash method on the data .
Here , we 'll return false if the method did not write to disk , and true if the method did .
Ruby 's blocks support non-local - return ( some references ) , which means that a return from the block behaves identically to returning from the block 's original context .
In this case , returning from inside the block returns from the write method , but Ruby will still run the ensure block closing the file .
You can think of non-local - return as behaving something like :
def write ( location , data ) path = Pathname.new ( location ) raise " Location does not exist " unless path.exist ?
File.open ( path , " w " ) do | file| raise Return.new ( false ) if Digest : : MD5.hexdigest(file.read ) == data.hash file.puts YAML.dump( data ) end return true rescue Return => e return e.object end
where Return is Return = Struct.new ( : object ) .
Of course , any reasonable lambda implementation will support this , but Ruby 's version has the benefit of feeling just like a normal return , and requiring much less chrome to achieve it .
It also behaves well in scenarios that already use rescue or ensure , avoiding mind - warping combinations .
Further , Ruby also supports super inside of blocks .
Imagine the write method was defined on a subclass of a simpler class whose write method took the raw data from the file and printed it to a log .
def write ( location , data ) path = Pathname.new ( location ) raise " Location does not exist " unless path.exist ?
File.open ( path , " w " ) do |file| file_data = file . read super( location , file_data ) return false if Digest : : MD5.hexdigest( file_data ) == data.hash file.puts YAML.dump( data ) end return true end
In a purer lambda scenario , we would need to store off a reference to the self , then use that reference inside the lambda :
def write ( location , data ) path = Pathname.new ( location ) raise " Location does not exist " unless path.exist ?
this = self File.open ( path , " w " ) do |file| file_data = file .
read # imaginary Ruby construct that would be needed without # non-local - super this.super.write(location , file_data ) raise Return.new ( false ) if Digest :: MD5.hexdigest( file_data ) == data.hash file.puts YAML.dump( data ) end return true rescue Return => e return e.object end
You can also yield to a method 's block inside a block .
Imagine that the write method is called with a block that chooses the correct data to use based on whether the file is executable :
def write ( location ) path = Pathname.new ( location ) raise " Location does not exist " unless path.exist ?
File.open ( path , " w " ) do | file| file_data = file . read super( location ) data = yield file return false if Digest : : MD5.hexdigest( file_data ) == data.hash file.puts YAML.dump( data ) end return true end
This would be called via :
write ( " / path / to/file " ) do |file| if file .
executable ?
" #!/usr/bin/env ruby
puts ' Hello World ! ' " else " Hello World ! " end end
In a pure - lambda language , we would take the block in as a normal argument to the function , then call it inside the closure :
def write ( location , block ) path = Pathname.new ( location ) raise " Location does not exist " unless path.exist ?
this = self File.open ( path , " w " ) do |file| file_data = file .
read # imaginary Ruby construct that would be needed without # non-local - super this.super.write(location , file_data ) data = block.call ( file ) raise Return.new ( false ) if Digest :: MD5.hexdigest( file_data ) == data.hash file.puts YAML.dump( data ) end return true rescue Return => e return e.object end
The real benefit of Ruby 's approach comes from the fact that the code inside the block would be identical if the method did not take a block .
Consider the identical method , except taking a File instead of a location :
def write ( file ) file_data = file . read super ( file ) data = yield file return false if Digest : : MD5.hexdigest( file_data ) == data.hash file.puts YAML.dump( data ) return true end
Without the block , the Ruby code looks exactly the same .
This means that Ruby programmers can more easily abstract out repeated patterns into methods that take blocks without having to rewrite a bunch of code .
It also means that using a block does not interrupt the normal flow of code , and it 's possible to create new " control flow " constructs that behave almost identically to built - in control flow constructs like if and while .
Rails uses this to good effect with respond_to , which provides convenient syntax for declaring content negotiation :
def index @people = Person. find ( : all ) respond_to do |format| format .
html # default action is render format.xml { render :xml => @people.xml } end end
Because of the way Ruby blocks work , you can also return from any of the format blocks :
def index @people = Person.find ( : all ) respond_to do | format| format.html { redirect_to( person_path( @people.first ) ) and return } format.xml { render :xml => @people.xml } format.json { render : json => @people .json } end session [ : web_service ] = true end
Here , we returned from the HTML format after redirecting , allowing us to take additional action ( setting a : web_service key on the session ) for other cases ( XML and JSON mime types ) .
Keep in mind that the code above is a demonstration of a number of features of Ruby 's blocks .
It 's very rare to see return , yield and super all used in a single block .
That said , Ruby programmers commonly use one or more of these constructs inside blocks , because their usage is seamless .
So Why Are Ruby 's Blocks Better ?
If you made it this far , let 's take a look at another use of blocks in Ruby : mutex synchronization .
Java supports synchronization via a special synchronized keyword :
class Example { final Lock lock = new Lock ( ) ; void example ( ) { synchronized ( lock ) { // do dangerous stuff here } } }
Essentially , Java provides a special construct for expressing the idea that it should run a block of code once at a time for a given instance of the synchronization object .
Because Java provides a special construct , you can return from inside the synchronization block , and the Java runtime does the appropriate things .
Similarly , Python required the use of try / finally until Python 2.5 , when they added a special language feature to handle the try / finally idiom :
class Example : # old def example ( self ) : lock.acquire ( ) try : ... access shared resource finally : lock .release ( ) # release lock , no matter what # new def example ( self ) : with lock : ... access shared resource
In Python 's 2.5's case , the object passed to with must implement a special protocol ( including enter and exit methods ) , so the with statement cannot be used like Ruby 's general - purpose , lightweight blocks .
Ruby represents the same concept using a method that takes a block :
class Example @@lock = Mutex.new def example @@lock.synchronize do # do dangerous stuff here end end end
Importantly , synchronize is a normal Ruby method .
The original version , written in pure Ruby , looks like this :
def synchronize lock begin yield ensure unlock end end
It has all the hallmarks of what we 've discussed so far .
It locks , yields to the block , and ensures that the lock will be released .
This means that if a Ruby programmer returns from inside the block , synchronize will behave correctly .
This example demonstrates the key power of Ruby 's blocks : they can easily replace language constructs .
In this case , a Ruby programmer can take unsafe code , plop it inside a synchronization block , and it will continue to work .

I 've historically written my posts without very many links , mostly out of a fear of links going out of date .

The opening night speaker at the Tea Party convention suggested a return to a “ literacy test ” to protect America from presidents like Obama — a segregation - era method employed by southern US states to keep blacks from voting .
In his speech Thursday to attendees , former Republican congressman Tom Tancredo invoked the loaded pre-civil rights era buzzword , saying that President Barack Obama was elected because “ we do not have a civics , literacy test before people can vote in this country . ”

Southern states used literacy tests as part of an effort to deny suffrage to African American voters prior to Johnson - era civil rights laws .
“ Prior to passage of the federal Voting Rights Act in 1965 , Southern ( and some Western ) states maintained elaborate voter registration procedures whose primary purpose was to deny the vote to those who were not white , ” a website for civil rights veterans explains .
“ In the South , this process was often called the ‘ literacy test . ’
In fact , it was much more than a simple test , it was an entire complex system devoted to denying African - Americans ( and in some regions , Latinos ) the right to vote . ”
“ Because the Freedom Movement was running “ Citizenship Schools ” to help people learn how to fill out the forms and pass the test , Alabama changed the test 4 times in less than two years ( 1964 - 1965 ) , ” the site adds .
“ At the time of the Selma Voting Rights campaign there were actually 100 different tests in use across the state .
In theory , each applicant was supposed to be given one at random from a big loose - leaf binder .
In real life , some individual tests were easier than others and the registrar made sure that Black applicants got the hardest ones . ”
White applicants could be approved even if they did n’t pass the test .
“ Your application was then reviewed by the three - member Board of Registrars — often in secret at a later date , ” the site continues .
“ They voted on whether or not you passed .
It was entirely up to the judgment of the Board whether you passed or failed .
If you were white and missed every single question they could still pass you if — in their sole judgment — you were ‘ qualified . ’
If you were Black and got every one correct , they could still flunk you if they considered you ‘ unqualified . ' ”

Tancredo , who is known for his sharp anti-immigrant rhetoric , also attacked what he called the United States ’ “ cult of multiculturalism , ” and tore into 2008 Republican Presidential nominee Sen. John McCain ( R - AZ ) .
“ Thank God John McCain lost the election , ” Tancredo told the Tea Party crowd , citing his positions on government spending and immigration .
“ This is our country , ” he added .
“ Let ’s take it back . ”

Southern voting registrars could employ literacy tests arbitrarily .
They included dauntingly difficult questions , aimed at keeping those they did n’t want enfranchised from voting .
For example , an Alabama literacy test required would - be voters to know esoteric facts about the US political and legal system ( one of the literacy tests can be read here in PDF form ) .

Among the questions :
“ If a person charged with treason denies his guilt , how many persons must testify against him before he can be convicted ? ”
“ If a president does not wish to sign a bill , how many days is he allowed in which to return it to Congress for consideration ? ”
“ If the United States wishes to purchase land for an arsenal and have exclusive legislative authority over it , consent is required from [ fill in the blank ] . ”
The answers to the above questions are two , ten and the legislature , respectively .
Tancredo called Obama a “ committed socialist ideologue , ” and referred to him by his full name , Barack Hussein Obama .

ABC News reported that the former Colorado representative ’s speech “ received enthusiastic applause at times , ” but said the crowd did not fill the ballroom in which the event was held .
Correction : Tancredo represented Colorado in Congress , not California .
I would normally post something like this on my tech blog , but I feel like this is more of a writer issue than a tech issue , though tech is a big part of why I ’m writing this post .
I ’ve been pondering this for a long time — and a few inklings have come out in past posts — but the recent resurgence of Amazon Fail and the reactions to it made me think it was a good time to share my thoughts on this .
As many of you know , I work for a technology magazine and part of my job is to keep up on news about gadgets and another part is actually reviewing them .
Because I have interest in books and am a fiction writer besides , I ended up as the go - to person for eReaders .
Last month I covered eReaders at the Consumer Electronics Show and got to see several devices that will be on the market in the next few weeks and months .
I must say , there are a LOT of eReaders out there , folks .
To go along with these eReaders , many companies are also setting up online bookstores , kind of like Sony did back in the day .
However , there are some differences in the way things are now .
First , almost every device coming to market will have the ability to read EPUB books .
EPUB is becoming the standard eBook format ( spearheaded by Sony ) , thus the books you want should be readable on the Nook or the iRiver Story or the Alex eReader regardless of where you buy them .
In theory .
The logistics of this are a bit gray right now — for instance , it ’s not clear if you can buy a book from Sony then load it on the Nook , or buy a book from Barnes & Noble then load it on the Alex .
I chalk this up to the general messiness in the eBook area at the moment .
Eventually these issues are going to have to be sorted out .
In the meantime , a lot of the smaller eReader vendors / eBook sellers are touting that the titles you buy from them can be read on any device , though they ’d be happy to sell you their own .
Contrast this with Amazon , whose eBook format is proprietary and therefore can only be read by Kindles and Kindle apps for smartphones and computers .
If a Kindle owner decides they like the Nook better , they can say goodbye to their eBook collection .
To be fair to Amazon ( I know , I know , but bear with me ) this was status quo for a long time in the eBook world .
Sony only recently started selling EPUB books — before they had their own format for their own readers .
And the EPUB as universal format is a fairly new movement .
So naturally newer eReaders are poised to take advantage of it .
Regardless of what Amazon is doing , the rest of the industry , including Apple , is going with EPUB and building their own online eBookstores to sell them .
Will all of these individual stores survive ?
Most likely not , especially if the devices they ’re attached to do n’t do well .
It also depends on what the DRM situation is with books bought from bigger players like B&N .
But I ’m sure eventually some eBook selling entity will arise from all of this and become the default store multiple devices attach themselves to .
iBook might be that store , or something scrappier will come along .
So , why is all of this important to you , the folks reading this who are likely to be writers and / or book industry professionals ?
It ’s important because a big part of the future of eBooks is n’t being shaped by publishers and booksellers wrangling with each other over percentages , it ’s going to be driven by the devices consumers choose to consume the books .
While I do not agree that the iPad will CHANGE EVERYTHING ZOMG and that it will destroy all stupid eReaders , there are plenty of devices and technologies on the horizon that could change the landscape drastically within the next year or two .
I ’m talking way cooler than the iPad ( and much more useful ) .
Here ’s a really brief overview :
Alex eReader —
I only got a little bit of time to play with this device at CES but I liked what I saw a lot .
( I should be getting a review unit soon . )
This eReader has two screens — a 6 - inch eInk display and an LCD display below it .
It ’s kind of like the Nook except the LCD screen is bigger like the kind you ’d find on a smartphone .
It runs Android like the Nook , but not locked down .
So you can use it just like an Android phone — load apps , surf the web , email , IM , whatever — except without the phone part .
Android is on everything these days , so it ’s not unusual .
The makers of the Alex hooked up with Borders recently , so that will be the default store .
Entourage eDGe —
This is another dual - screen device , but it ’s more of a combo tablet and eReader than a handheld device .
A little smaller than most netbooks , the eDGe ( no , that is not a typo ) has a 9.7 - inch electronic paper display on one side and a 10.1 - inch LCD on the other .
It also runs Android , and the two screens interact , so users can choose books or documents on the LCD , read them on the EPD , make notes or scribbles , click links in books or documents and have them load on the LCD , and much more .
The eDGe is aimed mainly at the education market right now , but has some appeal to non-education and non-business users as well .
Look for this to be a really excellent magazine platform .
Notion Ink Adam tablet —
Remember how I talked about technologies that can change the landscape drastically ?
This device incorporates one of them .
The Adam tablet is yet another Android device but it ’s designed to be a multitasking tablet rather than just an eReader .
How is that different from the iPad , you might ask ?
The difference is in the screen .
It utilizes Pixel Qi’s dual mode display that goes from ePaper to full color at the touch of a button .
Yep .
Click the link , there ’s video .
This right here solves the problem most basic eReaders face — unitasking — and the problem tablets that want to be eReaders face — LCD eye burn out .
It also runs Android , which means it can multitask .
And it has a powerful chip inside so it can play hi-res video and complex games without breaking a sweat .
Qualcomm mirasol —
This is n’t a device but rather a technology .
Qualcomm has developed a type of display that uses ambient light to create color based on the mechanics of how butterfly wings work .
This means they can create LCD - like displays that do n’t strain the eye yet offer the same depth of color and clarity as LCD .
In some cases , even better .
They told me the first eReader with this display would be out by the fall , but I ’m betting that the future of mirasol lies in tablets , and maybe one day in laptops .
This is another game - changer .
These four devices and technologies only represent a slice of what ’s coming and what ’s out there .
There are a slew of eReaders either out or coming soon — Nook , iRiver Story , iRex DG 800 , Plastic Logic Que , Skiff , PocketBook 360 , Sony Readers ( Pocket , Touch , Daily ) — and a slew of tablets on the horizon — Lenovo IdeaPad U1 , Eee Pad , MSI dual - screen , Archos 5 , Dell Mini 5 — I seriously can’t name them all without getting boring .
The point is , the landscape is rich right now .
And it ’s a really exciting time for writers and publishers , especially indie publishers and writers with some control over their own eBook rights , but only if you pay attention and starting thinking right now about ways to take advantage .
You do n’t have to know the intricacies of it all nor obsessively follow tech blogs for the next new thing .
Just take the time to be aware of what ’s out there and what options it opens up for you in terms of publishing or offering your content .
Writers , know where your publisher is putting your eBooks .
Is it just Amazon ?
Just Amazon and B&N ?
Will people with any kind of EPUB reading devices be able to access them ?
Let your readers know .
If you ’re with a smaller press that gives more individual attention , ask them to look in to the smaller bookstores and devices you find .
It may not be the right move for them , but at least you ’ll know that options have been explored .
If you ’ve got the e-rights to your backlist titles or other eBook - able material , investigate these places for yourself .
They may give you a far better rate than Amazon ’s DTP .
I cannot stress enough how much I hope that SF magazines are paying attention to all of this .
Being online is n’t enough .
Hell , just having an iPhone app is n’t enough .
You want a wider audience for your fiction , want to get more people reading the awesome stories you publish ?
Make it easy for them to get it .
I would pay money for a free online magazine if it had an eBook version that downloaded directly to my eReader every week or month .
I am not alone in this .
Plus , there are about to be a lot of people with new , cool devices that are going to go to the eMagazine “ shelves ” on their devices to look for new things to read .
Do you know how many eMagazines are in the B&N eBook store right now ?
Eleven .
Yes .
More are coming soon as more content partners get involved , but still , this is a good opportunity for standing out and getting noticed .
Also check out non-proprietary outfits like PressDisplay .
Publishers , there is a world out there outside of Amazon .
Yes , they ’re a huge online bookstore and you absolutely can’t ignore them .
Just do n’t ignore everyone else , either .
I do n’t think Amazon owns the future of eBooks , and they certainly do n’t own the future on eReaders .
Not yet , at least .
This got very long , sorry , so I ’ll end by saying this : I ’m really lucky that I have a job that allows me to combine my interest in the future of reading and publishing with my love of cool gadgets .
The stuff I ’m seeing is so amazing , and I ’m really excited about how it has the potential to get people reading more or reading at all .
I hope you are , too .
One of the reason I wrote this post is because I was starting to be afraid that people did n’t know how wide and exciting the landscape was .
The iPad is only so - so compared to the other stuff out there , and the Kindle ’s limitations are about to bite Amazon in the butt .
I hope you ’re excited for the future — hell , the present — as much as I am and choose to engage with and become part of it .
Editor 's note : Theodore Beauchaine is the Robert Bolles and Yasuko Endo Associate Professor of Psychology at the University of Washington , where he is also director of the Child and Adolescent Adjustment Project .
He is editor of " Child and Adolescent Psychopathology , " associate editor of the journal " Psychophysiology " and a contributing author to the upcoming " Oxford Handbook of Suicide and Self - injury . "
Seattle , Washington ( CNN ) --
They come from all walks of life .
One teenage girl cuts her thighs after piano lessons to avoid the crushing pressure for perfection .
She sees a therapist twice a week , but she never gets better .
Another young woman makes dangerous cuts to her arms and wrists when she is anxious .
She is on her fourth foster placement because no one can handle her behavior .
Another burns her fingers with a cigarette lighter when she hears her parents fight .
She 's been hospitalized twice in the past year .
Stories such as these are heard daily by those of us who study and treat self - injury -- that is , any activity resulting in intentional bodily damage to oneself .
It is a syndrome found across cultures and socioeconomic classes ( although it tends to be a bit more common among the more well - off ) , and it appears to be on the rise .
Though cutting the skin with sharp objects is the most common method used , especially by girls , other means of self - injury including head banging , overdosing , burning , hanging , drowning and shooting .
Given its potential for death and serious injury , this phenomenon has received increasing media attention , with a number of movies , such as " Secretary " in 2002 , portraying the phenomenon .
From my perspective , this is an urgent public health issue , yet funding for research and treatment lags well behind funding for other behavioral disorders , such as autism .
Self - injury is troubling for several reasons .
First of all , almost 400,000 adolescents and young adults were treated medically for self - inflicted injuries in 2006 , the most recent year for which these injuries were counted .
One recent study revealed that the number of children and adolescents in the U.S. who were hospitalized for depression , which is sometimes accompanied by self - injury among youth , increased by 27 percent between 1997 and 2007 .
Second , self - injury is associated with crippling psychiatric distress .
Girls who engage in such behaviors score lower than their peers on almost all measures of positive psychological adjustment , such as sociability , and higher than their peers on almost all measures of negative psychological adjustment , such as depression and delinquency .
Third , adolescent self - injury is linked to adult borderline personality disorder -- a chronic and difficult to treat mental health condition characterized by impulsive behaviors , difficulties self - regulating emotions , mood instability and high rates of suicide .
Finally , self - injury is the single best predictor of suicide .
Intentional self - injurers are about 75 times more likely to kill themselves than others in the population , an especially alarming statistic .
Scientists are not sure why rates of self - injury appear to be on the rise , or how to stop the trend .
When teens who self - injure are asked why they do it , most say the behaviors help them regulate overwhelming negative emotions , including anger , sadness and rejection .
This emotion - regulating function may occur because injuries trigger the release of endogenous opioids , chemicals produced by the body that relieve pain .
Over repeated episodes of self - harm , the endogenous opioid system may become more efficient at reducing physical and psychological pain .
Recent studies conducted at high schools and universities reveal that almost 20 percent of individuals self - injure at least once , and about 11 percent self - injure repeatedly .
Given how common the behavior is -- and the alarmingly high risk of eventual suicide -- one might expect self - injury to be a major public health priority .
One might also expect considerable investment into basic science aimed at understanding the brain mechanisms involved and treatment - outcome research aimed at developing effective interventions .
Unfortunately , this has not been the case .
Little is known about the brain mechanisms of self - injury , particularly in adolescence , and traditional approaches to treatment usually involve inpatient hospitalization , which is more cost - effective than individual care .
However , when treated in groups , as is often the case in hospitalization , self - injuring girls often become worse , not better , an effect known as contagion .
( Note that this can also occur through access to Web sites and Web postings in which self - injurers share strategies . )
Nevertheless , there has been some progress toward understanding and treating adolescent self - injury .
On the basic research side , Christina Derbidge , a graduate student in my lab , is conducting a study in which the brains of adolescent girls who engage in self - injury are imaged as they cope with negative emotions .
On the treatment side , Dr. Marsha Linehan 's Dialectical Behavior Therapy at the University of Washington is signs of hope .
The therapy is a variant of cognitive therapy and an effective treatment for adults with borderline personality disorder .
It has been adapted to adolescent patients with encouraging results .
Despite these positive developments , a much greater investment is needed .
For fiscal year 2010 , the National Institutes of Health -- far and away the primary source of funding for health research in the world -- projects spending $ 41 million on suicide and suicide prevention ( NIH does not report specific funding figures for self - injury ) .
In contrast , NIH expenditures for autism are expected to be $ 141 million in 2010 .
Corrected for the higher prevalence rate of suicide , this translates into a six - fold greater investment per person with autism .
Indeed , across the past five years , NIH has spent more than $ 700 million on autism research , with impressive results in terms of treatment effectiveness and our understanding of the genetic and neural underpinnings of the disorder .
Given the urgency of preventing suicide among our youth , a similar investment is needed in self - injury research .
Those who know me in real life are often surprised to learn that I love Las Vegas .
The absolute , over - the - top , all - or - nothing atmosphere may be a blast , but the shiny patina of the city vanishes when you know how the odds actually work — as my father said , " The casinos and hotels are very fancy and elegant for a reason . "
The odds are stacked against anyone who can't put up more cash than the casinos , since , even in a fair game of flipping a coin , the player who starts with more money will eventually bankrupt his opponent .
This is one of the reasons I prefer poker , since that involves playing against a small group of other individuals who can't simply rely on a large bank .
But as online poker sites have exploded in popularity , they 've removed the human element and turned poker into a strict numbers game .
But even though it 's possible to calculate the odds of victory for a given hand , new research suggests that players have difficulty gauging how well they are doing in the long run .
It seems that strings of small victories inflate one 's sense of skill to the point where the occasional big loss does n't faze a player 's psyche as much as it does their wallets .
The work , carried out by a graduate student at Cornell University , examined the outcomes of 27 million hands of poker in a six - seat , no - limit Texas hold 'em game .
Set to be published in an upcoming edition of the Journal of Gambling Studies , the work found that positive reinforcements from a streak of small wins led individuals to have difficulty comprehending how ruinous a large loss truly is , even though the sum total of the small winnings was more than wiped away by the big losses .
Interestingly enough , the work also found that , for small - stakes players , low - value pairs ( twos through sevens ) were actually more profitable than mid-number pairs ( eights through jacks ) .
" This is because small pairs have a less ambiguous value , and medium pairs are better hands , but have more ambiguous values that small - stakes players apparently have trouble understanding , " said Siler , the study 's lead author .
With that in mind , I am going to take my bankroll and go do some online research .

Customs Officer Jessie Cobb monitors video feeds last month in the control room at the border crossing in Blaine , Wash .
The Vancouver Games are the closest to the U.S. since 2002 .
VEHICLE TRAFFIC AT THE NORTHERN BORDER VEHICLE TRAFFIC AT THE NORTHERN BORDER Enlarge By Mark Malijan for USA TODAY U.S. Customs Officer Kaely Wilson checks Canadian Gilda Ingco's passport last month at the Peace Arch Crossing in Blaine , Wash .
Nearly 300,000 people could cross the border to attend the Games .
Olympic security does n't stop at Canadian border BELLINGHAM , Wash . 
A few days before the opening ceremonies for the 2010 Olympic Winter Games in Vancouver , the doors to a nondescript warehouse will open here without fanfare .
Inside the refurbished , low - slung structure , U.S. officials have constructed an elaborate , $ 4 million communications complex where law enforcement , public health and military analysts representing 40 agencies will scrutinize potential threats to the Olympics .
Surveillance cameras on U.S. Border Patrol helicopters will stream live video from their patrols to some of the 10 flat - screen monitors ringing the walls of the complex .
There are plans to deal with worst - case scenarios during the Games : the detonation of a radioactive " dirty " bomb ; an anthrax attack ; a crippling blizzard ; a mass evacuation from Canada triggered by a public health crisis .
As the host of the 17 - day Olympics that begin Feb.
12 , Canada plans to spend about $ 900 million ( U.S. ) to keep the Games safe , Canadian security coordinator Ward Elcock has said .
Yet the costly security effort does not stop at the Canadian - U.S. border .
The Vancouver Olympics , perhaps unlike any other recent Olympics , highlight an unusually close relationship between two neighboring countries for which security has become a binational responsibility amid renewed concerns about the international terror threat .
Vancouver 's proximity to the United States — just 30 miles from the U.S. border crossing in Blaine , Wash . — has spurred an extensive security effort on the U.S. side , much of it focused on an 80 - mile stretch of the Northwest border from the Pacific Coast to the western slopes of the rugged Cascade Range .
Accessible from the United States by air , boat , car and train , the Games will be the closest to U.S. soil since the 2002 Winter Games in Salt Lake City .
The Department of Homeland Security ( DHS ) estimates nearly 300,000 people could cross the border to attend events or take part in the Olympic festival .
U.S. and Canadian authorities say there are no credible threats against the Vancouver Games , which will attract 5,500 athletes and officials and up to 1.6 million spectators with tickets , according to the Vancouver Olympic Organizing Committee .
Yet , U.S. officials acknowledge fresh urgency in their preparations , prompted in part by intelligence failures in the botched Christmas Day bombing of a commercial airliner over Detroit .
Al - Qaeda has since claimed responsibility for hatching the plot .
" For us , what happened on Christmas Day means that we can't get comfortable , " says Mark Beaty , DHS federal coordinator for Olympic - related security and emergency preparedness in the United States .
" Though it was a failed attempt , it still shows that there a lot of bad people out there looking for an opportunity to inflict much harm . …
This ( event ) has the potential to generate that kind of response . "
Among the major U.S. Olympic - related security efforts : • The U.S. Coast Guard , Navy and the Canadian Navy will form a protective force stretching from the Canadian coast to Puget Sound .
U.S. Coast Guard Lt. Collin Bronson says the Canadians are leading the overall security effort , but U.S. forces will maintain a " larger presence " than usual in the heavily traveled commercial waterways between Seattle and the Canadian border .
" It 's not just the terrorist threat , it 's all hazards , " Bronson says .
" Can you imagine if we had an Exxon Valdez event " — a massive oil spill — " during the Olympics ? " • The North American Aerospace Defense Command ( NORAD ) , the binational U.S. - Canadian organization that directs North American air defense , will enforce a 30 - mile airspace restriction around Vancouver and parts of the USA .
The southern boundary of the restricted flight zone covers about 20 to 25 miles in Washington state .
Among the restrictions :
All private aircraft destined for Vancouver from the United States during the Games will be funneled through one of 16 U.S. " gateway " airports for customs checks prior to landing in Vancouver , says Constable Mandy Edwards , a spokeswoman for Canada 's Integrated Security Unit .
Normally , aircraft would be able to travel to Vancouver directly and submit to customs and immigration checks there .
•
The DHS is dispatching up to 200 more federal agents , inspectors and Coast Guard personnel to the northern border , including an elite Border Patrol search - and - rescue unit , Beaty says .
The extra units do not include FBI agents and U.S. military personnel also being deployed for Olympic - related duty .
Beaty 's position itself is unique :
It is the first time the DHS has named a federal coordinator for an event outside the USA .
The Vancouver Games also mark the only time the U.S. government has assigned an event beyond U.S. borders a " special event assessment rating , " meaning it poses potential security risks based on its political , economic and social significance .
" You 've got to do whatever it takes to ensure safety at an event like this , " he says .
Preparing for the worst
The call came to the U.S. border station at Blaine just before 9 a.m.
Canadian officials warned their U.S. counterparts to expect carloads of travelers returning from the Vancouver area with troubling symptoms , including rashes , vomiting , diarrhea and acute respiratory distress .
The alert triggered choreographed responses at the border : Inspectors donned surgical masks and gloves and cordoned off two U.S. border station traffic lanes to handle the onslaught .
Border authorities notified public health officials and local emergency medical technicians , who opened a mobile triage center on the shores of Semiahmoo Bay to diagnose the sick before transporting them to nearby St. Joseph 's Hospital .
The episode last month was only a drill — one of about a dozen to prepare for the Olympics .
" If we have something like anthrax or some smallpox outbreak , that 's as scary as it gets , " says Marcus Deyerin , the Whatcom County , Wash . , emergency response program specialist in Blaine .
" It wo n't take much to overwhelm the emergency medical capability here . "
Deyerin says the test served as valuable practice for more than 100 border agents and emergency responders from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention , the Washington State Department of Health , the American Red Cross and the Whatcom County Sheriff 's Department .
Virtually every public safety and health organization in the Pacific Northwest has participated in the drills , some of which started more than two years ago .
In November , NORAD staged air drills over Vancouver Island to test its capacity to intercept prohibited aircraft .
Coast Guard drills have focused on terror scenarios , narcotics smuggling and possible breaches of public health and safety .
One exercise , the Coast Guard 's Bronson says , involved a search for the destructive gypsy moths that sometimes infest wooden pallets carried by cargo ships .
The Washington State Department of Agriculture lists the creature as " one of America 's worst forest pests , " which feeds on the foliage of more than 500 varieties of trees and shrubs .
" We have to know what 's on these vessels coming in , " Bronson says .
" We have to know when the ship is coming in and where it 's been . "
' They 've done all they can ' Ray Mey , a former FBI agent who organized Olympic security details in Salt Lake City and at the 2006 Winter Games in Torino , Italy , says U.S. preparations for an Olympics outside the USA are unusually detailed — but necessary , given the Games ' proximity to the U.S. border .
Mey , a private security consultant , analyzed Vancouver 's public transportation system for the Canadian government in advance of the Olympics .
He says Canada is using 15,000 military personnel , law enforcement and private security officers to secure the Games , about 5,000 more than the United States used in Salt Lake , just a few months after the 9/11 attacks .
" I think they 've done all they can , " Mey says .
" You ca n't put a fence around the city . "
Although the Winter Games are smaller in scale than the Summer Games , Mey says Canada may be a " bigger target " than other recent host cities because of its political alliance with the United States .
Canada 's support of some U.S. missions in Iraq and Afghanistan , Mey says , may make the event attractive to terror groups .
" The large security footprint may make it less vulnerable , not less desirable . "
The last time the Olympics were targeted was 1996 , during the Summer Games in Atlanta .
At that time , survivalist Eric Rudolph detonated a pipe bomb in a crowded downtown park in a late - night attack that left two people dead and wounded about 100 others .
In a December meeting with reporters in Washington , Canada 's Elcock acknowledged that security costs for the Vancouver Games had soared from an initial budget of $ 175 million to about $ 900 million .
" There is an expectation of what you do to protect the Olympics , " Elcock said .
1999 success story Diana Dean may know more about the benefits of vigilance than anyone who has worked the U.S. - Canadian border .
On the eve of the millennium , U.S. authorities feared that terror groups were planning to disrupt the holiday .
Dean , then a U.S. Customs inspector in Port Angeles , Wash . , stopped a suspicious - looking traveler whose " story never made sense . "
The nervous man in the dark green Chrysler was al - Qaeda operative Ahmed Ressam , who had stashed timers and more than 200 pounds of highly volatile bomb - making material in the trunk of the rental car .
Federal investigators later concluded that Ressam — whose 22 - year prison sentence was overturned last week by a federal appeals court that called it too lenient — had planned to mark the millennium by bombing the Los Angeles International Airport .
Dean's Dec. 14 , 1999 , catch remains one of the most important success stories in recent federal law enforcement history .
More than a decade later , Dean 's actions still are used as a training model for new recruits .
Her work has been memorialized on framed posters showing Ressam and other high - profile captures in the offices of officials planning U.S. security for the Olympics .
When Wesley Vanderheyden , the U.S. Border Patrol 's assistant chief in Blaine , and others talk about potential security breaches during the Games , they invariably cite Ressam 's capture .
Sophisticated technology , including radiation detectors and vehicle X - ray machines , was rushed to the borders after Dean 's encounter with Ressam .
Yet Dean , now retired in North Dakota , says experience and instinct may be the best defense .
" If I was still working , I think I would still look for the same things I always looked for , " she says .
" The thing that first got me about Ressam were his eyes :
They were flat , dead , like he had no soul .
It still gives me chills when I think about it . "

Three inmates at Guantanamo Bay who , according to a US Navy report died after they all committed suicide on the same evening , in fact died from suffocation inflicted during interrogations , a US magazine has claimed .
In its March edition , Harper 's magazine accuses the US government of perpetrating a cover - up to conceal the true cause of the deaths of the three men – Salah Ahmed al - Salami , 37 , a Yemeni , and two Saudis , Talal al - Zahrani , 22 , and Mani Shaman al - Utaybi , 30 – who died in June 2006 .
The magazine , which has already posted the article by contributing editor Scott Horton on its web site , bases its conclusions on an examination of portions of the Navy report that were declassified and anonymous interviews with prison guards .
" The cover - up is amazing in its audacity , and it is continuing into the Obama administration , " Mr Horton contended .
At the time , the commander of the camp , Rear Admiral Harry Harris , said that the men had committed suicide in concert with one another as " an act of asymmetrical warfare " aimed at the US .
He ordered an instant lockdown of the whole facility and told reporters to leave , according the magazine .
The official version of events has it that the three men stuffed rags down their own throats and then hanged themselves in their cells using bed sheets .
However , the magazine cites guards saying that the men's bodies had not been taken from the cells .
They suggested the men had been in a separate building used by the CIA and the Pentagon for harsh interrogation sessions .
The guards also asserted that the day after the alleged suicides , they had been assembled by senior officers who told them that they were to stick with the official version of what had happened .
" The official story ... was full of unacknowledged contradictions , and the centrepiece of the report – a reconstruction of the events – was simply unbelievable , " the Harper 's article contends .
" Each prisoner was able somehow to bind his own hands , and , in at least one case , his own feet , then stuff more rags deep down into his own throat .
We are then asked to believe that each prisoner , even as he was choking on those rags , climbed up on his washbasin , slipped his head through the noose , tightened it , and leapt from the washbasin to hang until he asphyxiated . "
The White House did not immediately return calls seeking comment .

This story has gotten quite a bit of play over the last few days .
But I think that some aspects go beyond the privacy matter .
For the background , see this from FOX .
Harriton High School student Blake Robbins and his parents , Michael and Holly Robbins , filed a federal civil rights lawsuit Tuesday against the district , its board of directors and McGinley .
They accused the school of turning on the webcam in his computer while it was inside their Penn Valley home , which they allege violated wiretap laws and his right to privacy .
The suit , which seeks class - action status , alleges that Harriton vice principal Lindy Matsko on Nov. 11 cited a laptop photo in telling Blake that the school thought he was engaging in improper behavior .
He and his family have told reporters that an official mistook a piece of candy for a pill and thought he was selling drugs .
Neither the family nor their attorney , Mark Haltzman , returned calls this week seeking comment .
A listed number for Matsko could not be found .
Lower Merion , an affluent district in Philadelphia ’s suburbs , issues Apple laptops to all 2,300 students at its two high schools .
Only two employees in the technology department , not administrators , were authorized to activate the cameras , which captured still images but not sound , officials said .
“ While certain rules for laptop use were spelled out … there was no explicit notification that the laptop contained the security software , ” McGinley said .
“ This notice should have been given , and we regret that was not done . ”
The FBI is looking into whether any federal wiretap or computer - intrusion laws were violated , according to an official who spoke to The Associated Press on condition of anonymity because the official was not authorized to discuss the investigation .
Montgomery County District Attorney Risa Vetri Ferman has said she might also investigate .
The parents made a mistake in this situation , and they do n’t even know it .
The main point is this ; they let the government give them something .
And as we all know , government assistance of any kind comes with strings attached .
Every level of assistance has a cost attached to it .
Requirements , limitations , stipulations , and mandates are universally part of government programs .
When people fail to recognize that fact , they are made victims .
Some will say that citing this situation is splitting hairs .
It is not .
The schools , especially since they are part of the government indoctrination machine , are based on control .
The officials at this district obviously felt entitled to turn on webcams remotely , after NOT informing the recipients of this feature .
Obviously , they were not thinking of the privacy rights of the students .
Or , they were , and that ’s why the parents were not informed of the security function .
At any rate , who knows what they watched , or what they deleted once the story came out .
Given the recent history of school personnel committing sexual offenses , it ’s not a stretch to imagine that something inappropriate was happening .
As the story suggests , the school used this to allegedly accuse one student of inappropriate behavior .
This , if established as fact , would clearly show that the school was violating the privacy of students .
This leads to a final point , and one that we all need to recognize .
If the government , or an agent of the government , is given power , that power will be abused .
It not a question of if , it is a question of when .

Hollywood imitates life .
And sometimes life imitates Hollywood .
John Underkoffler , who led the team that came up with the interface that Tom Cruise ’s character used in the 2002 movie “ Minority Report , ” co-founded a company , Oblong Industries , to make the gesture - activated interface a reality .
Using special gloves , Mr. Underkoffler demonstrated the interface — called the g- speak Spatial Operating Environment — on Friday at the annual TED conference in Long Beach , Calif. , a series of lectures by experts across a variety of technologies .
He pushed , pulled and twisted vast troves of photos and forms that were on a screen in front of him , compressing and stretching as he went .
He zoomed in , zoomed out and rotated the images using six degrees of control .
In one part of the demonstration , he reached into a series of movies , plucked out a single character from each and placed them onto a “ table ” together where they continued to move .
( Oblong has released its own demonstration video ) .
In this conception of computing , the input and the output occupy the same space — unlike a conventional computer , in which the mouse and computer keyboard are separate from the screen , where the changes appear .
Even the Nintendo Wii game console , which responds to gesture and motions , often projects that motion onto an on -screen figure .
Mr. Underkoffler said this gesture technology was already being used in Fortune 50 companies , government agencies and universities , and he predicted that it would soon be available for consumers .
“ I think in five years ’ time , when you buy a computer , you ’ll get this , ” he said .
In fact , consumers will get the first taste of gesture - based interfaces later this year .
As The Times reported last month , Microsoft , Hitachi and PC makers are on the brink of rolling out game consoles , televisions and computers that use gestures to control the machines .
Gesture - based interfaces are among the most significant advances in computer interface design since the mid-1980s , and they are part of a trend of accelerating advances in how humans interact with computers .
Oblong officially came out of stealth mode in November 2008 , but Mr. Underkoffler said the TED demonstration was the public “ coming out ” of the company ’s technology .
Oblong , which is based in Los Angeles , now has around 25 employees .
The old model of “ one human , one machine , one mouse , one screen ” is passe , said Mr. Underkoffler , who spent 15 years at the MIT Media Lab before co-founding Oblong .
Mr. Underkoffler was working at the MIT Media Lab when Alex McDowell , the production director for “ Minority Report , ” visited in search for ideas for a fictional world set five decades into the future .
Mr. Underkoffler was hired to be a science consultant for the film , with a particular emphasis on a computer interface that would be used in some key scenes .
In developing the vocabulary of motions and gestures for the actors , he deepened his understanding of how humans interacted with the technology .
In filming , the actors were mostly miming and the images of projected data were added later , making the entire situation seem real .
The experience sharpened Mr. Underkoffler ’s desire to make the technology into something commercially viable .

In the wake of the recent earthquake and the presence of US troops in Haiti , interested researchers have unearthed many hints that there 's a lot of gas and oil below and around the island .
It seems the time for drilling has come .
Follows a short quote from the interview : TRNN : Which must be somewhat in flux when you have the country in such chaos and all the normal infrastructures of the state in disarray , other than — I guess the US military is kind of taking up the role of the state , other than the private armies that work for these five , six families .
So the real issue connected to oil is going to be : is this kind of tradition of popular politics in Haiti going to be able to assert itself ?
Or do they get back to politics as usual ?
ENGDAHL : Yeah , that I have no means of calling .
I think the fact that the latest figures are 13,000 US troops on that tiny little island , that 's quite a lot of military power .
I think probably the need is for less military projection and more humanitarian — food , water , and shelter aid from — .
And this is what the Haitian websites have been pleading for ever since the January earthquake .
But I 'm a little bit uneasy about the agenda of the Pentagon in Haiti , with their overwhelming military presence .
The Doctors Without Borders in Geneva protested immediately after the quake that their planes , their transport planes , were turned back from Haitian airports by US soldiers who refused them landing rights — and they had emergency humanitarian aid .
This was n't some kind of a , you know , Soviet , Cold War - era spy game ; this was a humanitarian effort , and they protested quite loudly that the US was hindering that .
So it 's unclear at this point what the US agenda is for Haiti , but the signs and the fact that George W. Bush was appointed special envoy , along with Bill Clinton as UN envoy , gives one grounds for pause here , I think .
TRNN : Well , where George W. Bush seems to be , there usually is oil .
Thanks very much for joining us , William .
Engdahl , in the video , seems to be merely speculating , although it is speculation based on scientific evidence concerning geological formations that have resulted in oil finds in places other than Haiti .
At no point does he claim that there 's evidence yet for mineral deposits that would make Haiti into a rather rich nation .
Other sources , however , do show clearly that this is the case , and it seems that the denial - up to now - that Haiti has gas , oil and other interesting resources , like uranium , is a strategic one .
Let 's start with an
In the course of the 1950s , the Knappen - Tippen - Abbet company conducted drillings in La Gonave , in the Cul - de - Sac plains , in the Plateau - Central and in the region of Gonaives .
All of these drillings had proved extremely promising and the results were beyond expectations .
However , the big multinational oil companies operating in Haiti pushed for the discovered deposits not to be exploited .
Haiti was neither Saudi Arabia nor Kuwait .
At a time when a barrel of crude oil sold for just over a dollar , and the Persian Gulf provided oil galore , there was no reason for these companies to put in production these oil fields deemed much less profitable .
Especially while ARAMCO [ then known as the Arabian American Oil Company ] was , rain or shine in Arabia , at a low price , even to the point of looting the precious oil resources of this kingdom .
The attitude of these big multinational oil companies was " We shall keep the Haitian deposits and other such layers of deposits in reserve for the 21st century when the Middle Eastern jackpot are depleted . "
This is what happened !
The wells of Knappen - Tippen - Abbet were numbered , carefully locked or sealed with cement and forgotten .
Next , we have the two scientists Ginette and Daniel Mathurin , who are quoted extensively in an Haitian soil it is rich in oil and fuel .
We have identified 20 oil sites .
5 of them are considered of great importance by specialists and politicians .
The Central Plateau , including the region of Thomonde , the plain of the Cul - de - Sac and the bay of Port - au - Prince are full of hydrocarbons .
The oil reserves of Haiti are more important than those of Venezuela .
An Olympic pool compared to a glass of water ; that is the comparison to illustrate the importance of Haitian oil compared with those of Venezuela .
On yet another website , uranium 238 and 235 and the deposit zyconium exist in several regions including in Jacmel .
Uranium , of course , is used in nuclear reactors to help produce electrical energy .
Heaving read all of this , the puzzle of Haiti 's reserves is certainly not solved , but it just may shed some more light on why the US is establishing such a large military presence in the country right now , or why tiny Haiti has the fifth largest US embassy in the world .
Once the earthquake situation has been solved one way or another , it seems that Haiti will remain in the news for some years to come .
Update Here 's another take on this theme , from the Toronto based Two days ago , The Real News Network ( TRNN ) made a video available online which features economist and author F. William Engdahl , who convincingly speculates that Haiti and the surrounding sea will most likely have huge and untapped reserves of both oil and gas , arguing that this is usually so in places where tectonic plates meet - and the island containing both Haiti and the Dominican Republic actually are at a meeting point of three such plates .
Mr Engdahl is no unknown author and has written on issues of energy , politics and economics for more than 30 years , beginning in the early 1970s when the world first awoke to the possibility of oil running out at some point .
He is also the author of the best selling book A Century of War : Anglo - American Oil Politics and the New World Order .
Follows a short quote from the interview : Engdahl , in the video , seems to be merely speculating , although it is speculation based on scientific evidence concerning geological formations that have resulted in oil finds in places other than Haiti .
At no point does he claim that there 's evidence yet for mineral deposits that would make Haiti into a rather rich nation .
Other sources , however , do show clearly that this is the case , and it seems that the denial - up to now - that Haiti has gas , oil and other interesting resources , like uranium , is a strategic one .
Let 's start with an English translation of an article by Dr. Georges Michel that was first published on the French webzinemaker.com on March 27 , 2004 : Next , we have the two scientists Ginette and Daniel Mathurin , who are quoted extensively in an article by Peter Schlosser , Are We in Haiti because of Oil ?
The quotes from Ginette and Daniel Mathurin are from January 2008 :
On yet another website , Open Salon , it is said that Daniel and Ginette Mathurin have also shown that Uranium , of course , is used in nuclear reactors to help produce electrical energy .
Heaving read all of this , the puzzle of Haiti 's reserves is certainly not solved , but it just may shed some more light on why the US is establishing such a large military presence in the country right now , or why tiny Haiti has the fifth largest US embassy in the world .
Once the earthquake situation has been solved one way or another , it seems that Haiti will remain in the news for some years to come .

Sportswear manufacturer , Puma will be launching a brand new feature phone at the World Mobile Congress .
The first words about the Puma Phone were spoken back in October last year but since then the phone has been pretty much under wraps until now .
A new mini site at pumaphone.com has recently been launched and although it does n’t give the full specifications we ’ve managed to find out a few details about the new handset .
The Sagem Puma phone will be packed with new features which will be great for sports fanatics that include a solar panel to charge it , a GPS receiver , a bike and run tracker and a pedometer .
The phone will also give users access to the Puma community on Facebook , Youtube , Flickr and Twitter so there will need to be a 3G connection .
Also there will be an application called Puma icon messaging built in ; we assume this will be some kind of chat client .
We do n’t know much more about the Puma phone at this time but it will be officially announced tomorrow at the World Mobile Congress in Barcelona where we hope a full spec will be revealed .
The 2010 Conservative Political Action Conference , which took place this past weekend , showed the nation two things : the right - wing fringe , while still small , has become more activist and , secondly , it has become even more extreme .
It was more than tinged with fascist ideology .
The conference embraced it .
The increased activism was indicated by the number of participants : in 2005 , the straw poll conducted at their yearly event garnered only 641 votes ; the number this year was 2,395 .
This is not surprising ; we ’ve seen the same trend with the tea party movement .
The fact that they are even more extreme was shown by the fact that the fascist John Birch Society – previously considered even too extreme for CPAC – was one of the co-sponsors .
The racism , coded or out - in - the - open lynch mob - like rhetoric , especially employed when talking about President Obama , was hair - raising and sobering .
Even Republicans seem not to be safe from it .
Michael Steele , the African American chair of the Republican National Committee , was the only member of that party to receive more unfavorable than favorable votes in the straw poll .
The meeting ’s content – immigrants are enemies ; tax breaks for the rich will help working people ; the agencies that ensure the safety of our food , workplaces and environment somehow harm us ; abortion is murder – combined with a new fringe narrative : Obama is transforming America into some kind of dictatorship .
Aside from their class positions that defend the banks , corporations and billionaires by saying African Americans , or immigrants or women or unions or liberals are the problem , they got something else wrong .
They are misreading the American people .
According to Florida ’s Tea Party candidate in the Republican Senate primary , Marco Rubio , the election of Sen. Scott Brown in Massachusetts signaled a turning point : Americans are fed up with the “ extreme liberal agenda ” of Obama .
The reality , though , is the opposite .
Many voters are frustrated by the slowness of change , by the jobs crisis , and opted to stay home .
Or they opted to send complacent liberals a message : do n’t take Main Street for granted !
Speeding up the reform process , curbing corporate power and creating jobs are strongly desired by the American people .
That ’s why Barack Obama was elected and the Democratic majority in Congress too !
It was a repudiation of the Bush extreme - right agenda .
Rubio was right about one thing : the 2010 elections will be a referendum .
If the Republicans gain seats , a huge blow to progress will have been dealt .
Therefore , it is up to all of us who care about peace , equality and democracy to push forward , to continue to build a multi-racial , unity - based the movement at the grassroots , neighborhood by neighborhood , workplace by workplace , school by school , to fight for jobs , health care , end to war and violence and terrorism , equality and democracy for all , and connect it to what ’s at stake in the mid-term elections .
If there is one truism in politics and life , it is , the only thing constant is change .
It begins with each of us .

Randy Wing , Ham Radio enthusiast , shares high adventures
and midnight mysteries
You do n’t just walk into a studio , take your jacket off , and sit down in front of the mike .
Ham radio is a do - it - yourself activity from A to Z .
You ’re the on-air personality , scientist , electronics engineer , and construction worker .
Among these things , most radio operators find an irresistible draw that makes the expense and hard work well worth it .
It ’s a fascinating hobby that educates , entertains , helps people in need , and usually provides some unique stories to tell .
Randy posted some photos of his newly constructed radio tower on Facebook .
It was about 100 ’ in height and had a few dedicated antennas mounted to the top .
As an electrician years ago I had to climb a light tower of similar height to change lamps .
I did n’t like it .
The cars and people look surprisingly small and you feel very vulnerable up there .
As I was looking at his photos I thought to myself that this guy must really love what he ’s doing and I wanted to learn more and share it .
He was happy to relate his experiences ...
Q . My first experimentation with radio was with an antique crystal set when I was a kid .
My father gave it to me and it had the original ‘ Cat ’s Whisker ’ detector .
I could n’t get it to work right but it gave me a good appreciation for the evolution of radio technology .
How did your interest in radio get started ?
A Cat's Whisker detector used a semi-conducting mineral crystal , contacted by a small wire , to rectify the radio wave .
It is considered the first semiconductor device .

My manager at the time ( June 1996 ) at Boeing was Steve Heyroth , K5MNZ .
I knew that Steve was an amateur radio operator , but we had n't discussed it much .
One night , while in a class on the design of commercial satellites , Steve asked if I 'd like to go with him to operate our Boeing Employees Amateur Radio Society equipment and make contact with a Russian " robot " satellite that was due to pass over our Wichita , KS site .
He used a radio with about 50 knobs , buttons , slides - many of which had overloaded functionality - but he used a telegraph key to send morse code to the computer onboard the Russian " RS - 12 " satellite .
The computer recorded the contact , sent a confirmation number to Steve which he sent in a letter to the Russian space program .
As the satellite continued on its way - it sent a message - as it passed over Moscow - confirming the contact with Steve - and he received a postcard from the Russian space agency formally confirming the contact .
I was so hooked !
BTW , a lot of people I know tried to get cat whisker radios to work and failed !
The secret I 've learned is to talk to people who were successful - there is an art to it .
Q. Guglielmo Marconi is considered the inventor of radio among the general public , but in reality invention is rarely the work of an individual .
Others , like Nicola Tesla , were also very busy in the science of radio energy transmission .
How do you see it ?
Paul , your point is well taken .
As a computer scientist and program manager , I build on the creative works of others every day to build something unique and valuable for our culture .
Many , many people are very smart and make small cognitive leaps every day .
It is rare that creativeness , resourcefulness , and financial vision come together at the same time .
Both Marconi and Tesla built on the work of others - but they BOTH saw the way forward and pioneered RF and radio technology .
I can tell you I 'd much rather read about Tesla though - he seemed to know how to make the sizzle or new inventions sing !
Q . What was it like trying to acquire the equipment you wanted when you were just getting started ?
Very exciting !
At the time , knowledge of morse code was required to get on " shortwave " - the frequencies that allow you to communicate to points all over the world - so I was studying morse code , my novice and my technician material simultaneously .
Meanwhile I purchased an entry level shortwave transceiver ( radio talk for receiver and transmitter ) - a Yaesu FT - 840 - to LISTEN to shortwave radio .
I purchased a simple wire antenna and a " tuner " .
A tuner helps match the signal from your antenna to the radio and vice versa .
These three items were all I needed to get going .
It cost about $ 700 .
I needed to get the wire up to about 30 feet high for good reception ... so I built a wood pole and used some twine to " guy " the antenna vertically .
( If you are interested in communicating locally it is much less expensive to get started - around $ 150 will get you going with a handheld radio / antenna . )
The first time I heard people talking on my " rig " I was smiling like a child at Christmas !
I passed my tests and began making contacts !
Every new state or country I communicate with brings that excited grin to my face !
Q. I liked to experiment on my own , and I can remember doing some pretty stupid and dangerous things .
Are there any “ learning ” experiences like this in your past that you ’d like to share ?
One cold January night my antenna broke .
I climbed on top of a snowy roof with my 10 year old son - Ben - to solder the wire back together .
I had him hold the antenna while I soldered .
I began to shake from the cold - slipped off the wire and gave him a scar on the back of his hand .
His eyes watered and he looked and me and said " why did you do that , Dad ? "
We learned : 1 ) Do n't do repairs at night in the cold on a snowy roof , 2 ) We set limits on all things - we do n't climb with winds over 15 mph , in the rain , with a storm looming , etc. , 3 ) We completely talk through a repair activity when partnered - so that we both know what we are going to do .
Ben , now 19 , helps me climb my tower several times a year .
We are a great team .
Q . You ’ve got a radio tower now of about 100 ’ in height .
What was it like constructing this thing ?
A lot of fun and a real learning experience actually !
Trying to save money , I put the word out that I needed a used tower .
Other hams told me of an aging gentleman who needed his tower removed - so I volunteered .
Taking DOWN a tower is exciting in an urban setting .
You do n't want to drop anything from 100 feet up onto someone 's house .
It took two 10 hour days to remove all the antennas and dismantle the tower .
I learned how to use a gin pole - which is a pulley and a pole that attaches to the top of the tower ( sort of like a construction derrick ) to help you remove tower sections and antennas ) .
During the installation , I planned on putting the tower back up 10 feet away from house - with 9 guy wires and 3 footings to hold the tower vertical spread out on my rural property .
I decided to dig the 3x3x6 ft deep footings by hand .
I 'd dig them all out - a major undertaking by the way - and a rain storm would collapse the walls .
I dug them out twice before deciding to just rent a backhoe .
I ended up having to build frames for the concrete .
8 cubic yards of concrete were required for the 3 guy footings and the tower base .
I had to wheelbarrow about half of it about 100 feet from the truck - and of course it was 90 degrees with 90 % humidity - and all my friends were previously engaged ...
After that , I had to construct guy wires with large glass insulators making them non-resonant on the ham bands ...
It would take me a weekend to put together 3 guy wires .
Three weekends for all 9 of them .
My hands were raw and recovered during the weekdays .
Although I got the tower free , the concrete cost $ 700 , the NEW 1100 ft of guy wire and insulators cost $ 400 , the new bolts for the tower ( I insisted on new stainless steel bolts and nuts for safety ) , and of course the new ( used ) antennas on top cost me additional $ .
The bottom line - I 'm glad it took a while to erect the tower - it used my disposable income for a year !
As I bolted my first 10 ft section on the base , I climbed to the top to install the gin pole - with my new $ 100 safety harness - and realized that " gee " 10 ft is high !
and imagined my fear at each level to come .
As I added each section , applied the temporary guys and affixed the permanent ones , I was constantly amazed at how far I could see and how puckered I was as I climbed higher and higher .
I would get off the tower each time , not just physically tired but emotionally exhausted from the adrenaline .
However the bottom line - it was exciting and amazing every step of the way .
Although , I DID have to teach each of my 17 neighbors NOT to honk their horn at me on the tower .
Every single honk made my body shake in fear !
One of the side benefits - I can see a LONG way from the top of a 100 ft tower !
Q. HAM radio is considered an amateur hobby because it ’s not a “ for - profit ” business , but you get involved in a lot of serious emergency situations .
What are a few that stand out in your mind ?
I got to lead the radio amateurs for 3 days at the Greensburg , KS tornado site with the Salvation Army - it 's called the Salvation Army Team Emergency Radio Network ( SATERN ) .
Seeing the absolute devestation of the aftermath of homes completely wiped off their foundation by a large tornado is something that I will remember the rest of my life .
I co-lead the organization of SKYWARN amateurs in south - central Kansas who help the National Weather Service by spotting tornadoes during severe weather events .
I enjoy being the net control operator at the NWS and communicating to and from the mobile and fixed station weather spotters .
Everytime one of our spotters is in line - of - site contact with a rotating wall cloud or tornado and I can relay their reports to the meteorologists and it has n't even shown up on radar yet , that is when I know the value of amateur radio to the public .
( and it is an enormous rush to know you are making a difference )
Q. Solar activity is a fascinating thing .
The idea of that giant nuclear fireball having mood swings , and we ’re just along for the ride , intrigues a lot of people .
What ’s the current buzz in your radio community about current space weather and what might be coming ?
There is a lot of concern that this 11 year solar cycle - of which we are just beginning the 24th recorded cycle - actually took over 12 years ... outside of our " norm " of expectations .
However , the sunspots are rising rapidly , now , and the expected peak of the cycle is about 3 1/2 years away .
Every radio amateur is excited what that means - the return of day and night around the world communication again !
Everyone was afraid that the sun might be entering something like the Maunder Minimum - a time several hundred years ago when for 7 decades there was n't many sunspots at all .
This would really change the way we use radio if that would have happened .
One thing is clear - we do NOT understand the sun completely .
Q. Art Bell , from Coast to Coast AM , commented in an interview that nighttime radio is a very different experience from the day .
I would guess that the quiet dark of night gives the imagination a lot more freedom to roam .
Do you enjoy being on - air at night more than the day ?
I am a night owl , so I enjoy the night time .
However , it is generally easier to make contacts in the daytime - smaller antennas are required because you are using higher frequencies than at night .
Another factor is that night contacts are easier in the winter because lightning does n't create as many ' static crashes ' than in the summer .
To make it even more interesting - at the peak of the solar cycle you can make contacts all night long even on the high frequencies .
To sum it up - it is the uncertainty of the chances of making a contact that make it interesting .
Q . What are some strange stories that you can recall that might be hard to explain or make sense of ?
There is a lot of discussion today in amateur radio circles about Long Delay Echoes .
For instance ... some people can create a three second delay by bouncing signals off the moon - but it requires a lot of power and a lot of antennas .
However , some radio amateurs have claimed they have heard their own voice HOURS after transmitting .
All kinds of theories have been put forward about how a natural phenomenon could sustain a transmission that long without a degradation in the strength - but we just do n't know yet !
Easier to explain but just as odd is the times that I have made contacts using the aurora to bounce a signal .
It came back sounding like a demon 's voice because of the distortion in the moving auroral front .
Q . What would you recommend for someone who ’s interested and would like to get started in radio ?
If you are interested in learning more about amateur radio a good place to start is the Amateur Radio Relay League ( ARRL ) at www.arrl.org.
On the 4th weekend of June , every year , there is a nationwide event called Field Day .
Field Day is a great way to learn about amateur radio .
Local Clubs get together ( there are over 700,000 amateur radio operators ( hams ) in the USA ) and for 24 hours setup and operate ham radio stations - it is a way of practicing for emergencies and introducing ham radio to people interested in what it is about .
The ARRL sets up a website to help you find a Field Day site near you .

Sometimes inbetween Christmas and New Year ’s Eve , the “ Help MySQL ” initiative was founded .
This initiative , publicly supported by Monty Widenius , the co-founder of MySQL would be interesting if it was n’t somehow indecent .
Let me explain .
What does “ Help MySQL ” advocate , in a nutshell ?
It claims that if Oracle were to merge with Sun , MySQL customers would be trapped in a market that would be pretty much controlled and captured by Oracle , both through its existing propietary databases offerings and the acquisition of MySQL .
Another issue explained on the web site is that the inherent free and open source nature of MySQL will not be enough to grant effective freedoms to the market since Oracle would be the sole copyright owner of the code and trademarks .
I think I will not be the only one to notice that in a whooping twist of history , Monty Widenius explains us why the business and contribution model to MySQL he crafted himself since the beginning of the database company is terrible for customers .
I am always quite skeptical of the “ do as I say not as I do ” lines of thinking , but so be it , let ’s carry along .
For months now , Monty and his interesting ( and interested ) acolyte , Florian Mueller , have been lobbying everything that seems to be possibly lobbied , from the press to the European Commission where they seemed to have been giving a hard time to Oracle , confused the European anti-trust with byzantine arguments leading to have MySQL relicensed under the BSD while portraying Microsoft as “ understanding towards the Open Source ecosystem ” .
You might then ask , again , why would Monty want MySQL back , or separated from Oracle ?
What would Monty Widenius , co-founder of MySQL , and recently an advisor of the Microsoft ’s Codeplex Foundation , counter Sun ’s acquisition by Oracle after having left Sun as fast as he could have ?
There seems to be many reasons , at least on a personal level .
One of them , as Jan Wildeboer outlined today , might be that Monty just does not want to leave the command of MySQL .
The problem is that the “ competitive case ” just does not seem to exist here .
Not only can anyone fork MySQL ( Monty already did it by the way ) , but the database market is competitive enough to have other credible incumbents fill in the gap , if Oracle were to become .. carnivorous , which remains to be proven .
But there are other reasons , some of whose can be foreseen if one thinks about the possible outcomes of Oracle ’s walking away from the merger at the end of the month .
Sun Microsystems lost several of its most profitable and large customers with the globlal financial crisis .
It is doubtful whether Sun could actually survive in the end .
Sun would then be sold by chunks , and I cannot wait to see who would buy MySQL back …
Monty Widenius , a fellow of the Microsoft ’s Codeplex Foundation , and a man who describes the asserted and patented monopoly as being “ benevolent and understanding towards Open Source ” .
There you go , I know you must feel reassured that MySQL will end up in good hands if it does fall in Oracle ’s portfolio .
Sun Microsystems being sold in chunks , or being merged with Oracle raises a lot of questions that I ‘m not aware Monty Widenius ever addressed in a constructive way :
What about Java , OpenOffice.org , and OpenSolaris ( other examples might also be found ) ?
I have not heard a word from Monty Widenius .
The future of ODF does not seem to be very important , just like , in the same way , his new colleague at the Codeplex Foundation , Miguel de Icaza , seems to think .
Perhaps the quest for another billion is too important and therefore Monty just has n’t found the time to think and focus about other issues .
By helping MySQL , it seems to me you are also helping the personal wealth of a billionaire who calls evil what some might do in the future while forgetting he did the same before .
All things considered , I am not really excited at the prospect of “ saving MySQL ” , and neither should you .
For 2010 , let ’s rather focus on constructive conversations and projects .
Happy New Year 2010 !
( " In some cultures they call this Radar To The Bathroom " )
Mainstream Media just stinks these days .
Why ?
That little thing called De-regulation , the relaxation of Ownership , one media company eating up another media company and eating up another media company .
It was n't always that way , and most people I 've talked to pinpoint when the change came around 1982 , or maybe as early as the day after Reagan took the Oath of Office the first time .
It continued .
Once the wheels of deregulation got rolling , it was impossible to stop them , especially when you had an FCC made up of people trained to look the other way .
So in 1994 in what seemed like an innocuous move on the part of the FCC , the ownership rules for TV networks suddenly changed and the Networks themselves were no longer prevented from creating their own prime time programming .
And as was pointed out , it was now easy for the Distributor to become the Owner .
And suddenly , being the owner of a Network now seemed very attractive .
Jim Zirolli ( NPR News ) : “ Until recently , the FCC barred the major TV networks from producing a majority of the programs they broadcast .
So the biggest part of their schedules had to be filled with programs put out by outside studios .
But last year the FCC relaxed its ownership rules .
The networks are now allowed to run as many of their own programs as they want .
And starting next year they can also reap all the profits from syndication .
For the networks this could become a gold mine , and it comes at a time when they badly need it . ”
From what was once a rather honorable institution with a modicum of integrity going for it , the FCC have cascaded into a pit of giveaways and corruption with no concept of Public Interest or desire for Public Welfare .
The reason it was formed was to prevent exactly what is happening now - the Public Airwaves being hijacked by Special Interests and Corporate shills .
The Public 's Right to Know being overpowered by Propaganda 's Desire to Dumb Down .

Ady Gil Captain boards Whaling Ship to make citizen 's arrest by Takver - Australia Indymedia
Sunday Feb 14th , 2010 6:40 PM
Captain Peter Bethune has boarded the Shonan Maru No 2 to make a citizen 's arrest of the captain of the vessel .
Peter Bethune 's ship , the New Zealand registered high speed trimaran the Ady Gil owned by the Sea Shepherd Conservation Foundation , was sunk by the Japanese whaling ship the Shonan Maru 2 on January 6 after it was purposefully rammed endangering the lives of the six crew .
In the cover of darkness Peter Bethune left the Sea Shepherd flagship , the Steve Irwin on a jet ski with another Sea Shepherd volunteer .
About 6.30 am he clambered aboard the vessel that had destroyed his own ship , getting around the anti-boarding spikes and nets .
As the Captain of the Ady Gil , Peter Bethune has an invoice for $ 3 million which he will present to the skipper of the Shonan Maru 2 .
In a covering letter Bethune states : " I am here to arrest you .
I am requesting that you transfer now to the Steve Irwin , where we will take you into custody , and we will deliver you to the Maritime Safety Authority and the New Zealand Police once we reach Wellington ( New Zealand ) . "
" If you refuse to be arrested , then I am requesting that you deliver me to Wellington ( New Zealand ) .
Having sunk my vessel , and with our issuing of a mayday call , you have an obligation under maritime law to provide me with safe passage back to land . "
" I will refuse to be handed over to any Sea Shepherd vessel .
I will also refuse to be handed over to any New Zealand or Australian Coastguard , Customs or Naval vessel .
I will only leave the Shonan Maru when you transfer with me to the Steve Irwin , or when we arrive on land , be it New Zealand or Australia . "
" I am enclosing an invoice for US$ 3 m , representing the new replacement cost of the Ady Gil .
You are responsible for the collision and as such , you are also responsible for paying for its replacement . "
" I commit to you that while I am on your vessel , that I will not impede or disrupt your crew and their activities . "
The invoice , dated 14 February 2010 , says " If payment is not forthcoming within four weeks of receiving this document , we will be proceeding with criminal charges in Japan against your company .
We will be seeking punitive damages , in addition to the full replacement cost of the Ady Gil .
Further to this , we will be laying criminal charges against the Captain of the Shonan Maru # 2 . "
Peter Bethune concludes his open letter with a plea : " I am just an ordinary man with a wife and two kids , who is prepared to make a stand against something that I believe is wrong .
That is why I came to Antarctica to try and stop you , and that is why I am here on your vessel today . "
According to Captain Paul Watson " Captain Bethune boarded a Japanese whaling fleet security ship at high speed in total darkness , breached the spikes and anti-boarding nets and is presently onboard and the Japanese crew are still not aware that he is there .
He is there to demand justice for the sinking of his ship , " he said .
" The first attempt he actually fell in the water and the jet ski went back and retrieved him .
( The crew ) still did n't notice , " Captain Watson told AAP .
" It was extremely dangerous .
He was boarding a ship going at 15 knots in total darkness in Southern Ocean waters , which are extremely frigid . "
At dawn Peter Bethune knocked on the door of the wheel house and presented his letters of demand for the skipper to surrender .
According to Captain Watson , a Japanese crew member emerged and looked for the boat on which Captain Bethune had arrived .
The crew member then went back inside , leaving Captain Bethune standing there .
" Pete opened the door and walked into the wheelhouse ... that 's the last we 've heard of him , " Captain Watson said in the AAP report .
In a stunning and unprecedented move , Toyota Motor Corp. on Tuesday halted sales of most of its popular models in the U.S. in response to growing concerns that possible defects may cause the vehicles to accelerate unintentionally .
The Japanese car maker , which long has been viewed as the leader in automotive quality , said it told its dealers ...
Crowdsourcing through the snow , on a one - server open source website ?
" Jingle Bells " it is not , but rather Snowmageddon - The Clean - Up .
The site 's creators hope to tap the power of the crowd to help Washington , D.C. , dig itself out from under the blizzard that still blankets that city and others on the East Coast with snow .
Apparently , the deluge has challenged some of the official response teams .
" No offense to the hard - working government workers doing their best to help clean up the city , but I was tired of seeing my streets clogged with snow , and neighbors stuck inside , " said Ryan Ozimek .
" So , I thought I 'd start a little website yesterday afternoon to help connect people having snowmageddon problems – say , a stuck car – with people that have snowmageddon solutions , like strong arms and a shovel . "
Ozimek , the founder and CEO of open source web - development firm Picnet , and a friend who works for him assembled the Snowmageddon site using Ushahidi .
It 's a PHP / MySQL application that plots location , time and descriptive metadata on a map , in this case to describe snow problems and snow solutions .
Ushahidi means " testimony " in Swahili , according to the project 's blog .
It was developed to document post-election violence in Kenya in 2008 , and now forms the backbone of Haiti's " 4636 " emergency short - messaging emergency system .
The application appears equally suited to today 's East Coast snow - mergencies because its basic elements – location , time and description of a problem – apply there too .
Ozimek says he and his friend launched the site a mere two hours after the idea initially occurred to them .
The site has n't really taken off yet , but that could change as more people catch wind of the service .
If it really was conceived and built in less than the time it takes to shovel five driveways , as Ozimek claims , that 's impressive enough , for now .
The next time a blizzard strikes ?
" Snow problem . "
( Well , less of one , anyway . )

Jean - Claude Van Damme -- the most badass fighting sensation of the 90s -- just got challenged to an MMA fight by a guy who used to fight puppets in spandex ... all over an incident from 15 years ago .
The guy issuing the challenge is former White Ranger Jason David Frank , who tells TMZ , he 's had it out for Van Damme ever since 1995 when the Muscles from Brussels -- who had been Frank 's childhood hero -- allegedly blew him off during the premiere of " Mighty Morphin Power Rangers : The Movie . "
As TMZ previously reported , Frank is now a scary - looking MMA fighter who has a fight next weekend in the Octagon -- and Van Damme is reportedly looking to make his own pro fighting debut ... so the timing could n't be better for Frank to settle the score .
Frank claims he 'll take Van Damme " anytime , anyplace , anywhere " -- and " if [ Van Damme 's ] too scared to come into the Octagon , I 'll even take him on in a kickboxing match . "
So far , no comment from Van Damme 's camp .
My idea this week is a two way toothpaste , ideal for those who get angry with their partner for squeezing the toothpaste from the front .
Simply open the other end and squeeze from the back as demonstrated below .
Also quite useful for getting the last of the paste out of the bottom .
I admit that I squeeze from the front but I hope that by recognising the problem I have taken the first steps towards becoming a better person .
With thanks to my excellent illustrator friend Clare Mallison for the use of her hand .
For those who like this idea see my previous genetically modified egg or my home stats doorbell .

Perched on top of an Atlas V rocket , on February 11 the Solar Dynamics Observatory launched into space .
About a minute after leaving the Earth , the rocket did two things : it passed the speed of sound , and screamed past a sundog , a rainbow - colored optical effect in the sky caused by ice crystals .
And when it did , well , it was incredible .
What 's below is just about the coolest video I have ever seen .
And I mean that seriously .
Click the " 720 " button and pay close attention at the 1:50 mark .
You wo n't miss it , the crowd in the audio will alert you ...
Wow !
I 'm quite sure the footage shown here is legit and not a hoax .
Several people I know said they saw the same thing , and there are photos of it as well .
Those ripples were caused by the shockwave of the rocket going through the cloud , which quickly dispersed .
Since the cloud had ice crystals in it , the sundog got literally blown away .
I love the digital revolution .
There are so many video cameras out there that stuff no one would 've believed before are becoming more and more common .
Bright meteor fireballs , rocket launches like this , clear footage of flying saucers ... oh , wait .
Anyway , awesome .
If you ever get a chance to watch a rocket launch , take it .
You never know what you might see !
Tip o' the nosecone to jhumbug on Twitter .
“ Doing it this way was so different and daunting at first , ” said the Senate clerk , Carol Taniguchi .
“ Now it really seems to be a way of life . ”
Before the project , paper was king at the Capitol , as it is in many legislatures nationwide .
Each piece of written testimony from the public was copied countless times and distributed to legislators , who often took a quick look at the documents before tossing them into the recycling bin .
Tall stacks of multicolored bills dwarfed lawmakers trying to cast votes in the waning hours of each year ’s session .
Senate staff members spent hours collating documents by hand and sorting them into folders .
“ It was brutal .
Sometimes it was hot and you ’d be sweating , ” said Kamakana Kaimuloa , a clerk for the Senate Committee on Higher Education .
“ It was n’t fun . ”
That was all put to an end when Senate leadership issued an order : no more paper unless absolutely necessary .
The public would be given documents on CDs instead of on paper .
Bills , testimony and committee reports were put online .
The Senate bought laptops , document - reading software licenses and wireless Internet , at a cost of $ 100,000 .
Employees told legislators and the public alike that they would have to use their own printers if they wanted paper copies .
A new investigation adds more substance to the theory that certain areas of the brain play an important role in promoting spirituality , whereas others are actively involved in suppressing it .
The conclusion was drawn after Italian scientists investigated a number of brain - surgery patients , who had had parts of their cortices removed for medical reasons .
Researchers at the University of Udine , led by cognitive neuroscientist Cosimo Urgesi , were interested in investigating the neural basis of spirituality , Nature News reports .
Working together with a team of researchers from UU , Urgesi investigated a number of brain - tumor patients , before and after they underwent surgery .
The post -operation interviews were conducted three to seven days after the procedure had taken place .
The team immediately noticed a difference in the people 's feeling of self - transcendence , and the root cause for this depended entirely on which portion of the brain had been extracted during the surgery .
In cases where the tumor was located in the parietal part of the cortex , people reported feeling a heightened sense of spirituality .
Conversely , when the doctors removed portions of frontal cortices , the patients that underwent the procedure exhibited less religious or spiritual feelings than they had done before .
“ Self - transcendence used to be considered just by philosophers and crank new age people .
This is the first really close - up study on spirituality .
We 're dealing with a complex phenomenon that 's close to the essence of being human , ” Sapienza University in Rome cognitive neuroscientist Salvatore Aglioti , also a co-author of the new study , explains .
Details of the investigation appear in the latest issue of the respected scientific journal Neuron .
“ The most surprising part was the rapidity of the change .
This discovery shows that some complex personality traits are more malleable than previously thought , ” Urgesi says .
The left inferior parietal lobe and the right angular gyrus were determined to be regions of the brain that , when damaged , led to an increased level of spirituality .
According to the experts , this new investigation lends further credence to the connection between mystic experiences and feeling detached from the body .
These two areas play an important role in our perception of the spatial relation our bodies are in with the external world .
The " Stratton Glasses Effect " might come into play here .
Stratton demonstrated that if you wear glasses that make the world appear upside down for few days , the world will flip itself rightside !
Talk about the power of perception !
[ en.wikipedia.org ]
" George Stratton , a psychologist , was intrigued by the idea of perceptual adaptation .
Because our retina receives images upside down , he was intrigued to see what happens when the brain receives an image that is right side up .
Stratton conducted experiments in the 1890s , in which he tested the theory of perceptual adaptation .
One experiment he conducted was one where he wore a reversing telescope for a whole twenty four hours .
Sadly , the world looked the same , so he wore the telescoping glasses for eight days straight .
By day four , things were upright ( not inverted ) , and on day five things appeared normal until he concentrated on them ; then they became inverted again .
In addition , Stratton found that when removing the lenses , the image became normal looking after a while .

An Oklahoma City man was arrested Wednesday on complaints of neglect by a caretaker and cruelty to animals after the house he shared with his mother and 11 dogs was found filled with animal waste .
David Pilcher , 44 , was arrested after police , Department of Human Services and county health officials went to the house at 2812 NW 16 .
Pilcher ’s 64 - year - old mother was taken to a hospital for evaluation .
Officials said Thursday she was doing well .
" They found deplorable conditions once they got there .
There was reportedly feces and urine from animals that was all over the house , even in the bathtub .
Basically you could n’t go anywhere without coming into contact with this type of filth , ” Oklahoma City police Sgt. Jennifer Wardlow said .
A police report noted Pilcher complained after his arrest about dirty floors at the jail .
Inmates complained about the stench when officers brought Pilcher in , the report said .
When officials spoke to the woman , they saw what appeared to be animal waste on her shirt .
She was n’t sure what day , month or year it was , Wardlow said .
The report stated the woman was unable to care for her own needs and interests .
Troy Skow , an environmental field supervisor for the Oklahoma City - County Health Department , said 11 pit bull terriers were running freely through the house .
" I did n’t see any furniture or any carpet , ” Skow said .
" There was nothing except a cage in the living room .
Basically we had wood floors or plywood floors throughout the house that were saturated with dog urine . ”
The dogs were taken by animal welfare officials , Skow said .
Skow said the woman ’s bedroom was not as bad as the rest of the house .
" She had a bed in there and carpet and everything and it looked OK , but it was kind of separate from everything else .
So it kind of looked like a woman ’s bedroom in the middle of a dog kennel . ”
Pilcher told police he thought he was taking adequate care of his mother .
" He never indicated to officers that he believed that there was any type of problem with the living conditions at the house , ” Wardlow said .
Pilcher was in the Oklahoma County jail on Thursday with bail set at $ 23,000 .
He has prior convictions of violating a protective order and possessing a firearm , according to court records .
Neighbor Jeremy Moad said he did not have a neighborly relationship with Pilcher or his mother .
" They just seemed real unkempt .
That house has been kind of an eyesore , ” Moad said .
Even though Moad saw the house was n’t being taken care of , he said he did n’t realize how bad the situation was .
Police have issued a CCTV image of a man they want to speak to A man who throws animal semen on schoolgirls is being hunted by police following a sixth attack .
Detectives in Greater Manchester , described the assaults , all in the Bury area , as " disgusting " .
The man follows young girls before they discover they have been smeared with the liquid .
Police have released a CCTV image of a man they want to speak to .
The first attack was reported in November and the latest was last week .
None of the victims was physically harmed in anyway but this is still a disgusting act
Det Insp Lynne Vernon , Greater Manchester Police Det Insp Lynne Vernon , from Greater Manchester Police , said : " We have six separate incidents and do not know the motivation behind them - while we do not want people to be frightened unnecessarily , we are taking these reports seriously .
" None of the victims was physically harmed in anyway but this is still a disgusting act and the person responsible must be caught .
" I 'd ask people to take a good look at this image and if you know anything about this man , please contact us .
" He is not necessarily connected to all of the incidents but we would like to speak to him as part of our inquiries . "
The first victim , a 14 - year - old girl , was followed by a man on Kennedy Drive in Unsworth , on 13 November .
He asked her the time and was standing uncomfortably close to her .
Police tests
When she got home , she noticed a sticky liquid on her tights .
The substance was analysed by police and later identified as animal semen .
A 15 - year - old girl was smeared with liquid by a man on 7 December on Ostrich Lane , Prestwich .
Later that day another 15 - year - old was followed .
On 17 December a 14 - year - old girl was in a shop on Mill Gate in Bury town centre with her mother when a man bumped into her and wiped a white substance on her bottom .
The next day , a man followed two 13 - year - old girls on Bury Old Road , near to the M60 in Prestwich .
In the latest attack , on 25 January , a man approached two girls , aged 15 and 16 , on Pinfold Lane , Whitefield , and asked them the time .
One of the girls then noticed liquid dripping from her skirt .
In each incident , the offender was described as being a white man , aged between 25 and 35 and was carrying a bag .

A normal Clojure REPL ( or prompt ) in a terminal window is by default a bit touchy about infinite seqs , deeply nested structures , and long - running operations .
Any of these can cause your REPL to wander off into the weeds , busy spinning , perhaps printing pages of useless data , with the only apparent remedy being to press CTRL-C , which generally kills the entire JVM , Clojure and all , and dumps you back at your operating system prompt .
It 's unfortunate that this is the default , but Clojure 's youth shows particularly when it come to tools and settings like this .
Happily it 's sufficiently mature to provide several solutions that are not difficult to apply .
Run-away trains
The most common of the problems listed above is the infinite seq .
Such a seq is easy to create , easy to print , and can result in an run-away REPL .
The solution : setting your * print - length * to something short of infinity .
I recommend 103 : ( set ! * print - length * 103 ) Now it 's safe to print infinite sequences : ( iterate inc 0 ) ;=> ( 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 35 36 37 38 39 40 41 42 43 44 45 46 47 48 49 50 51 52 53 54 55 56 57 58 59 60 61 62 63 64 65 66 67 68 69 70 71 72 73 74 75 76 77 78 79 80 81 82 83 84 85 86 87 88 89 90 91 92 93 94 95 96 97 98 99 100 101 102 ...)
Note the ... at the end of the list which indicates there was more to print , but Clojure is respecting our requested limit and giving up after 103 items .
I 've been mocked upon occasion for choosing 103 , as if 102 is insufficient and 104 dangerous .
Of course it 's not so important exactly what you pick , so I 'm happy to keep my rationale to myself .
Run-away onions
But * print - length * wo n't help you in the case of infinitely recursive structures , data nested inside data like layers of an onion .
While less common , such nesting can be deep enough that it can still be a problem .
To limit printing of recursive structures , use * print - level * .
Usually 15 is about right for me : ( set ! * print - level * 15 ) Now it 's safe to print infinitely recursive structures : ( let [x ( atom 0 ) ] ( reset ! x { :deeper x} ) ) ;=> {: deeper #< Atom@4cb533b8 : {:deeper #< Atom@4cb533b8 : {:deeper #< Atom@4cb533b8 : {:deeper #< Atom@4cb533b8 : {:deeper #< Atom@4cb533b8 : {:deeper #< Atom@4cb533b8 : {:deeper #< Atom@4cb533b8 : {:deeper #}>}>}>}>}>}>}>}
Again you get a little textual indicator that print is giving up , in this case it 's just the # at the deepest level .
Occasionally scientists develop an invention that turns out to have far more applications than originally thought .
The Research and Development Center ( R&DC ) has built a truly unique instrument designed to identify oil by using a laser .
The laser is used to excite the fluorescence spectra of oil within extremely short time frames -- two to five nanoseconds .
All the fluorescence data is coalesced , and two dimensional diagrams are produced , which serve as oil spectral fingerprints .
Ezzat M. Hegazi , senior research scientist and activity leader for designing and building the instrument , is very proud of the device .
" The system is based on two previous patents and three recently submitted invention disclosures , and it was designed and produced in Saudi Aramco 's R&DC , which in itself has garnered many new patents for new systems and concepts . "
He added , " We developed a truly unique , multipurpose laser instrument that is robust enough for field applications .
It is easily transportable as is , but we 're also working on a remote sensing version that can be used in helicopters to detect and identify oil spills and seepage into water . "
As planned , there are many uses that are based on spectral identification of oil .
Crude oil identification helps our people distinguish among crude oils from different grades and different commercial oils .
This means that , using techniques that seem to come from the popular TV show " CSI , " oil spills can be fingerprinted and their grades identified based on the oil 's spectral characteristics uncovered by the device , which had not been possible until now .
Similarly the device makes it possible to identify the ingredients of blended crude oils as well as blended refined oils in order to measure the blending ratios .
In fact , in some cases the system can measure blending ratios down to 0.001 percent -- ideal for quality control for refineries , multi-product distribution pipelines and pumping stations .
However , it does n’t stop there ; the invention is an application generator .
It has many uses , and there are many more applications that will be developed based on the needs of different disciplines inside and outside Saudi Aramco .
For example , a few exciting applications other than crude - oil identification include :
Illegal Cocktailing Detection of Fuel Oils .
The device can detect the illegal commercial blending of gasoline , diesel fuels and jet fuels .
Drag Reducing Agent ( DRA ) Measurements .
DRA cuts the cost of fuel distribution in pipelines and the device can quickly and easily monitor DRA in pipelines and pumping stations .
Oil Exploration .
The oil fingerprinting techniques can be used as an additional investigative tool for geological continuity assessment .
Oil Deterioration Identification .
Degradation of refined oils such as transformer oil and engine oil can be identified through the spectral fingerprints .
Other potential applications include :
Water - in - oil , Emulsion and Total Sulfur Measurements .
Ongoing research is being carried out to use the device in detecting microscopic amounts of water and total sulfur in refined oils .
Salt content monitoring in oil .
Asphaltenes determination in crude oils .
Viscosity monitoring in pipelines .
The device has immense potential for a wide variety of uses in many areas .
To date , R&DC has received several positive customer comments on the invented detection methods , which have been developed on an existing prototype instrument in the lab .
These techniques provide very convenient and fast ( 30 seconds per sample ) measurement without resorting to any sample preparation .
In some measurements , such as DRA contaminations , the instrument can detect sub PPM ( part per million ) levels by simply pushing a button .
As Awad M. Mofleh , Technical Services Program director at R&DC said , " We see the device as a tremendous homegrown system that will make it easy for scientists to break the barriers between their disciplines .
We believe the system will be vitally important both inside and outside Saudi Aramco .
The instrument is the fruit of team work that includes Maha A. Sayegh and Abdullah H. Grainees , both Saudi junior scientists who have developed a unique research experience in developing such a system . "
The research and development that led to the production of the device is an example of the specialized effort played by the R&DC to provide innovative solutions for technical problems in field operations .
Realizing long - term operation needs triggered in - depth scientific research in the R&DC labs which , in the end , led to a customized solution fit for large - scale field deployment within Saudi Aramco .
Omar S. Abdulhamid , R&DC manager , said , " We view our relationship with our customers as an important source of ideas and enhancements that creatively address their needs through our research and technology development capabilities .
" Our organization exists to serve our customers and the Company , and we love to be challenged to exceed expectations in timeliness and quality .
The device is an ideal example of this type of R&DC effort . "
The US military has long maintained that the deaths of three detainees at Guantanamo Bay in one night in 2006 were suicides , but to the authors of an exhaustive report on the incident , it looks like anything but .
One question that the authors of a report ( PDF ) from the Seton Hall University Law School have is just how — and why — three people who hanged themselves would have managed to stuff rags down their throats before they died .
Another question is why neither the guards on duty nor the paramedics who showed up were interviewed ; or , for that matter , why the paramedics who showed up did n’t even ask the guards what had happened .
ADVERTISEMENT
On the night of June 9 , 2006 , three detainees at Guantanamo ’s Camp Delta were found hanged in their cells .
The US military initially described their deaths as “ asymmetrical warfare ” against the United States , before finally declaring that the deaths were suicides that the inmates coordinated among themselves .
The Seton Hall report questions virtually every major element of the Pentagon ’s story , and suggests a cover - up of the events of that night .
But , lacking a clear picture of what happened , the report has nothing to offer as to what it was that was covered up .
The report ’s description of the military investigation into the matter suggests a less - than - exhaustive review :
The investigation … leaves many unanswered questions .
Three years later it is still unclear how such coordinated conduct could have occurred , much less how heavily supervised detainees could have been dead for more than two hours before they were discovered .
Both the time and exact manner of the deaths remain uncertain , and the presence of rags stuffed in the detainees ‘ throats is unexplained .
Negligence of the guards seems to have been ruled out by the absence of any disciplinary action by any military personnel .
Although some of the guards were formally warned that their original statements were suspected to be false or that they were suspected of failing to follow direct orders , no guard was ultimately charged with either making a false statement or being derelict in his duty … .
There is no explanation of how each of the detainees , much less all three , could have done the following : braided a noose by tearing up his sheets and / or clothing , made a mannequin of himself so it would appear to the guards he was asleep in his cell , hung sheets to block vision into the cell — a violation of Standard Operating Procedures , tied his feet together , tied his hands together , hung the noose from the metal mesh of the cell wall and / or ceiling , climbed up on to the sink , put the noose around his neck and released his weight to result in death by strangulation , hanged until dead and hung for at least two hours completely unnoticed by guards .
The report notes that three detainees were on the cell block together for less than three days prior to their deaths , making some sort of suicide pact between them unlikely .
It also notes that the guards were ordered not to give sworn statements about what happened that night ; that the investigation was unable to determine which guards were on duty that night ; and neither the prison and tower guards nor the paramedics on the scene were interviewed for the investigation .
ADVERTISEMENT
“ The investigations were themselves contrary , not only to best practices for investigations of serious matters , but also failed to conform to minimum standards in several ways , ” the report states .
“ It ’s inconceivable that three prisoners could do this without anyone noticing it , ” said Seton Hall law professor Mark Denbeaux , in a Huffington Post interview with constitutional scholar Scott Horton .
“ We would have assumed that investigators would have run simulations or contacted experts .
The [ Naval Criminal Investigation Service ] investigation did not address this question , or if it did it was discussed in the portion of the report that has been redacted . ”
Denbeaux stated :
The most innocent explanation I can come up with that comports with all the facts is that this is Gitmo meets The Lord of the Flies and the Stanford Prison Experiment : no one really cares about the rules .
Even in that reading , the NCIS investigation is a cover - up of a gross dereliction of duty for which nobody was disciplined , leading to the deaths of three men .

Please see our earlier post : British Drug Smuggler ’s Death Sentence , Netizen Reactions
From Mop :
170 years later , Lin Zexu once again forbids England ’s opium !
The highest court has authorised Akmal Shaik ’s execution !
The English government ’s secret entreaties are useless !
Akmal has been executed by lethal injection !
170 years ago Lin Zexu clearly saw the harm that opium was doing to Guangzhou , searched out all the opium dens , gathered together large amounts of first hand testimonies , and in the nineteenth year of the reign of Daoguang ( March 1839 ) arrived in Guangzhou .
On March 19th , Lin Zexu and other officials including Deng Yanzheng summoned thirteen rows of foreign businessmen , and let it be known to them that they were hereby ordered to hand over all of their drugs , and were to never again sell opium , even saying : “ As long as there is opium , I will not return , I swear that I wo n’t stop until the job is finished . ”
But the foreign merchants refused to hand over their wares , and after a long struggle , the merchants ’ grip was loosened , and all of the opium , approximately 20,000 boxes or 2,370,000 jin , was confiscated .
On the twenty second of the fourth month ( June 3 ) it was all burnt on the beach in front of Humen in front of a crowd .
In the eighteenth year of the reign of Daoguang , on the fifteenth day of the eleventh month , Lin Zexu was appointed imperial chancellor , and that year , 1839 , was the most important year in the history of the banning of opium , and could be said to be Lin Zexu ’s most brilliant .
Sometimes Lin Zexu once write a rhyming couplet in his office : “ 海纳百川有容乃大，壁立千仞无欲则刚 ” .
This couplet ’s imagery is vivid , and has a profound message .
The first line sternly warns that one should listen to suggestions from all corners , and only then can something be done properly , and an unbeatable position can be assumed .
The second is more tempered , when being a government official one must do away with personal wants , and only then can one be unmovable like a mountain , and stand tall .
Lin Zexu promoted this kind of energy , commanded respect , and sets an example for his descendants .
And today , 170 years later , an Englishman has once again poured salt in our wounds !!!!!!!!!
Early in the morning of September 12 , 2007 , Akmal Shaikh of England , on a flight originating from Dushanbe , Turkmenistan , carried 4030 grams of “ viper ” on an international flight bound for Urumqi ’s international airport , in Xinjiang .
Upon going through border inspection , our customs officials discovered said “ viper ” in his carry - on luggage .
After inspection , it was discovered to be of 84.2 % purity .
Dammit , if you do n’t die Akmal , whose soul will we use to honour Lin Zexu ’s magnificent deeds ?
China is n’t the China of hundreds of years ago !
Almost 200 years later the British government once again is acting out the same part !
But they have forgotten …
China is n’t that desolate country any more !
When we banned opium in the past , our country ’s power disappeared like the sun at night , when the guns were pointed at our heads , we were as nervous as dogs .
When we ban opium now , our country has the same position on drugs , but the guns of yesteryear are gone , but everyone ’s whining .
Comments from Mop :
好想爆管理员的菊花 :
Nowadays only we can sell drugs , you foreigners want to come here to sell yours and steal our business ?
Do you wanna die ?
70 mph :
Before , Lin Zexu burnt a whole heap of opium , the Brits started a war ; today we ’ve executed one of them , they can only whine in the background .
whatsoever啦 :
That was just an act perpetrated by a single person , why do you have to overstate its significance ?
Do you want to see the world in chaos ?
I support the Chinese government ’s judgment , and Lin Zexu was a great hero , but there is n’t much connection between the two .
sy_active :
I ’d like to know the specific details [ of the case ] .

Prime Minister Brown , do you think that China is stuck in the times of the Opium war ?

Non-Stop Research
The best part about the company is that it hires people who are enthusiastic and active in their research .
They prefer to personally visit different places in accordance with their departments and venture deeper into the subjects .
Recently , the team under the health department of the company did their research and found an increase in the use of EMS machines for fitness .
Upon visiting and inquiring various fitness centres as well as individuals , they found out about the expansion that the centres have done after investing in EMS machine .
Hence , they decided to make a press release to bring light upon it .
To his wife , Sarah , he is " DH " – dear husband – while his friend Piers Morgan attempts to portray him as a brooding , but romantic , Mr Darcy .
To some former Downing Street staffers , he is a foul - tempered monster who , according to ex-Labour spin doctor Lance Price 's new book , " is psychologically and emotionally incapable of leadership of any kind " .
These descriptions of Gordon Brown were all offered in the past week , and are all variations on old themes .
Which is more accurate is a matter of debate .
What is clear , as The Independent on Sunday 's poll shows today , is that more voters than , say , a year ago , believe the Prime Minister has a " warm human side " .
Fifty per cent of people agree with this statement , while 43 per cent disagree .
Among women , the figure is higher : 55 per cent agree .
Even 38 per cent of Conservative voters believe he is warm .
Aides describe his TV interview with Morgan , broadcast on ITV today , in which he cries over the death of his daughter Jennifer , as a " watershed moment " for the normally private PM .
While the tears are too much for some , Mr Brown 's appearance is the culmination of a project to " humanise " him , and the poll figures show it is working .
In part , Mr Brown 's standing has improved because of his own actions .
His jokes , for example , have become funny .
Last month , at the Fabian Society conference , Mr Brown cracked an apparently off - the - cuff and self - deprecating joke that even he could n't remember the five tests on the euro .
But the project would not have worked without the help of Mrs Brown and two of British politics ' grand masters of communication and spin : Alastair Campbell and Lord Mandelson .
It was Mrs Brown who persuaded her husband to appear on Morgan 's Life Stories , an hour - long interview in front of a studio audience – although both Mr Campbell and the Secretary of State for Business were fully behind the move , Morgan revealed yesterday .
The journalist told the IoS : " I had asked him three or four times and he'd said no , but then they went away at Christmas and he and Sarah talked about it and about other things they might do in the run-up to the election , and after that he said yes . "
Members of the audience were asked to come up with words to describe the Prime Minister , he said .
They came up with three very unflattering labels : grumpy , knackered and plonker , and a surprising one : delectable .
Morgan added : " When I put the word ' plonker ' to him , he answered ' well , you 'd know about that Piers ' . "
Mrs Brown 's well - documented ability to put a soft gloss on her husband 's " grumpy " exterior was enhanced last week when she spent an hour " chatting " on the Mumsnet website , the 2010 election equivalent of GMTV and This Morning interviews of 1997 .
The project to humanise Mr Brown has developed since he became PM in July 2007 , but was stepped up when Lord Mandelson returned to the Cabinet and Mr Campbell became more involved .
The departure last April of Damian McBride , the No 10 adviser , created less divisive press briefings , and the atmosphere inside Downing Street became less toxic .
When things get tense , Lord Mandelson lightens the mood by " taking the mickey " out of Mr Brown .
A turning point came in November , when The Sun attacked Mr Brown over his misspelt letter to Jacqui Janes , the mother of a soldier killed in Afghanistan .
The public 's sympathy was with the PM , with just two dozen out of around 1,000 messages sent to No 10 critical of him .
Among the softer revelations last week is Mr Brown 's appetite for fruit .
In an echo of the revelation that Margaret Thatcher ate four eggs a day when she was campaigning for the 1979 election , we learnt that Mr Brown eats nine bananas a day .
But is the public being fed an inaccurate image of the PM ?
No 10 aides deny recent newspaper reports that Mr Brown hit a male official , and insiders claim that he only gets angry when there is " justification " and it is " never personal " .
Yet there is nevertheless apprehension inside Downing Street at the forthcoming publication of The End of the Party by Andrew Rawnsley , which is rumoured to detail incidents of Mr Brown 's foul temper .
Mr Brown was , it is understood , furious when , during a visit to Washington last summer , it was reported that President Barack Obama had snubbed him .
No 10 insiders claim Mr Brown is best when he is authentic – citing Lord Mandelson 's quote last month that " there 's no airbrushing Gordon Brown like David Cameron " .
One insider said : " If we told him to emote , well , it does n't work like that .
That 's not who he is . "
But was the PM really being true to himself when he bared his soul to Morgan ?
Few who watch his red -rimmed eyes today will fail to be moved .
Yet the timing , weeks before what will be a bitterly fought election campaign , is unsettling .
Mr Brown has an election to fight , and he is up against a Tory leader whom voters see as an emotionally intelligent , if slick , politician .
Mr Cameron 's wife , Samantha , may soon follow Sarah Brown on to Mumsnet .
Just like the leaders ' election TV debates , today 's interview is high risk for Mr Brown , but his friends believe it is a risk worth taking .
The public mood : Could it be The Sun wot wins it for Labour ?
NASA radar imaging flights over Central America , Haiti and the Dominican Republic are in the second week of a three - week campaign .
The JPL - developed Uninhabited Aerial Vehicle Synthetic Aperture Radar ( UAVSAR ) is currently in the second week of a three - week campaign in Central America , Haiti and the Dominican Republic .
Flying beneath the belly of a modified Gulfstream III aircraft from NASA ’s Dryden Flight Research Center , the sophisticated radar can spot minute changes in Earth 's surface by flying precise repeat passes over targeted areas .
The Central American survey flights are focusing on measuring biomass in Central American rain forests , imaging volcanoes from Guatemala to Costa Rica , and imaging Mayan ruins .
The flights over Haiti and the Dominican Republic are targeting earthquake faults on the island of Hispaniola .
Scientists collected data over Central American nations again on Feb. 2 , and then flew a second set of data tracks over Haiti on Feb.
3 before returning to Costa Rica on Feb .

Obama staffer wants ‘ cognitive infiltration ’ of 9/11 conspiracy groups
http://rawstory.com/2010/01/obama-staffer-infiltration-911-groups/
here .
Sunstein argued that " government might undertake ( legal ) tactics for breaking up the tight cognitive clusters of extremist theories . "
He suggested that " government agents ( and their allies ) might enter chat rooms , online social networks , or even real - space groups and attempt to undermine percolating conspiracy theories by raising doubts about their factual premises , causal logic or implications for political action . "
" We expect such tactics from undercover cops , or FBI , " Estrin writes at the Rag Blog , expressing surprise that " a high - level presidential advisor " would support such a strategy .
Estrin notes that Sunstein advocates in his article for the infiltration of " extremist " groups so that it undermines the groups ' confidence to the extent that " new recruits will be suspect and participants in the group ’s virtual networks will doubt each other ’s bona fides . "
Sunstein has been the target of numerous " conspiracy theories " himself , mostly from the right wing political echo chamber , with conservative talking heads claiming he favors enacting " a second Bill of Rights " that would do away with the Second Amendment .
Sunstein 's recent book , On Rumors : How Falsehoods Spread , Why We Believe Them , What Can Be Done , was criticized by some on the right as " a blueprint for online censorship . "
Sunstein " wants to hold blogs and web hosting services accountable for the remarks of commenters on websites while altering libel laws to make it easier to sue for spreading ' rumors , ' " wrote Ed Lasky at American Thinker .
This time I ’m talking about … let ’s call it fun -water shortage .
A massive heat - wave hit China these last few days , and temperatures soared to an alarming 40 degrees Celsius .
So what were the poor Chinese people to do , under these circumstances ?
Find a place to cool of , of course , and what ’s better than a swim at the local swimming pool , right ?
Well , that ’s just not the case for the people of Nanjing , who barely had enough room to tread water at this over - crowded swimming pool .
The Daily Mail thinks this might just be the most crowded swimming pool in the world and I tend to agree .
But then again , what do you expect in a country with a population of over one billion ?
We Recommend :
Or perhaps you 're more old school classic and bow down to the teachings of Joseph Campbell or his bastardized wanna - be cousin Christopher Vogler .
Regardless of what school you follow , they are all full of crap .
All these gurus attempt to provide a framework in which to write compelling stories that resonate with the audience .
And we all want a script that resonates with the audience , right ?
So it boggles my mind to see all these wizards of structure totally miss the boat on something so painfully obvious .
Sex .
We all know that sex sells , right ?
And we all try to put at least a bit of it into our scripts to give it that extra oomph .
Structure should not only take into account , but also meet the basic needs of , your target market .
Let 's take a movie aimed at 18 to 24 year old males for example .
Men of that age think of sex an average of eight times an hour .
If you do n't work with this information , you risk having your target market miss a major plot turn because they are briefly distracted by thoughts of the girl three rows down naked .
How do you avoid this ?
Easy .
Control the animal instinct .
Open with a hint of sex to reset the male internal sexual fantasy clock , then keep giving it to them again every eight minutes , and they 'll naturally get into the rhythm of your script .
This meets their needs and hits them on a psychological level , so every male in the audience will feel deeply in tune with the story .
But every eight minutes ?
That 's a lot of sex .
Especially if your movie is an all male cast and none of the actors have decent cleavage .
Relax .
It does n't have to be actual sex .
Remember , you 're hitting them on a deeper , subconscious level , so go with something phallic - guns , explosions , tunnels , pencil sharpeners , linoleum floors ( remember , we 're talking men just out of adolescence here , so pretty much anything is phallic at that age . )
Or forget subtlety altogether and go for out and out in - your - face sex .
Why do you think so many movies have at least one scene set in a strip club ?
Move that touching and powerful classroom student / teacher bonding scene to a peeler bar if it falls on that ten minute mark .
Same goes for that tear jerking mother / daughter right - of - passage first period scene .
What 's that you say ?
A strip club does n't quite work with your story ?
You 're the writer , damn it .
Make it work !
But what if you 're writing a family movie ?
These rules do n't apply , do they ?
Of course they do !
But you 'll have to get the low down on how - to from someone at Disney , because they are the undisputed masters in that area .
But what about the female demographic ?
Do n't we need to take them into account ?
No , we really do n't .

Those of us who will be around to witness some of the more alarming effects of climate change unless we do something soon to fix it .
Not that long ago , shochu was considered a poor man ’s drink and said to have all the delicacies of drinking dishwashing liquid .
That ’s all changed .
Now the drink formerly known as rotgut is enjoying star status in Japan , outselling sake , and starting to get A - list attention in the United States .
But shochu certainly is n’t new .
The first documentation dates back to being served on the Japanese island of Kyushu in the 1500’s .
They still make shochu on the island , the only territory not to make any other alcoholic beverage .
What is new are premium brands , which have elevated the taste and the drink ’s prominence .
Less Is More
The essential difference between sake and shochu is in its production .
Sake is brewed , shochu is distilled .
Shochu has less calories - about 35 calories per 2 ounces .
By law , it has less alcohol than many other liquors - 45 percent or less .
It ’s said to cause less of a hangover - due to its distilling process , many of the impurities are eliminated during manufacturing .
And it ’s thought to be healthy - it encourages production of enzymes , which break down blood clots ( a preventative measure for heart attacks and strokes ) .
Fiery Liquor
Shochu , which translates to “ fiery liquor ” can be consumed straight up , on the rocks , with fruit juice or tea , mixed with hot water , or as a cocktail .
Like vodka , shochu can be distilled from various types of ingredients that contain natural sugar , such as potato , rice , wheat and barley , resulting in a very flexible spirit with a wide array of styles and tastes .
Ingredients
Imo ( Sweet Potato ) : highly aromatic , soft sweetness with lots of body .
Goes well with anything .
Mugi ( Barley ) : roasted and often dry .
The best to mix with juice .
Soba ( Buckwheat ) : strong , slightly fruity , with a clean taste and sweetness that lingers on the tongue .
Kokuto ( Brown Sugar ) : sweet nose and finish , with a sugarcane aroma .
米 Kome ( Rice ) : lightly refined sweetness similar to sake .
Goma ( Sesame ) : nutty , smokey essence .
Detsu ( Date ) : has more of a brandy taste .
Mold ( koji kin )
Unlike other spirits distilled from a variety of ingredients , shochu is also made from a mold ( koji kin 麹菌 ) that breaks down the starches in the base ingredient and gives the shochu its unique smell .
These molds also have an impact on the flavor and aroma profiles of shochu .
白麹 Shirokoji ( white ) has mild aroma and results in a sweet , mild , gentle tasting shochu .
These shochu tend to be lighter in body .
黄麹 Kikoji ( yellow ) is a very sensitive mold that creates a fruity aroma and a fruity , light , supple tasting shochu .
It is the same mold that is used in brewing sake .
黒麹 Kurokoji ( black ) is stronger and bolder on the nose and creates a sweet , rich , strong tasting shochu .
It is known for making Okinawan awamori .
Type Casting
There are two types of classification for shochu based on the number of times the shochu is distilled and the method of distillation :
Otsushu / Osturui
The traditional method , which has been used since the 14th century .
The shochu is distilled once in a pot still ( tanshiki ) .
It has a stronger aroma and taste from the base ingredient .
It ’s usually enjoyed on the rocks or mixed with hot water .
You will also see this type of shochu called honkaku shochu .
Koshu / Korui
The more modern distillation method ( since around 1949 ) .
The shochu is distilled several times and in a continuous still ( renzoku shiki ) .
This results in less aroma and less taste , and is usually mixed into cocktails .
Shelf Life
Since shochu is a distilled spirit that usually is greater than 25 % in alcohol content , it can be treated like any other liquor and can be left open for a long period of time without decomposition .
Although it is always best to store you liquor in a cool , dark place .
Shochu vs. Soju
Koreans drink a similar drink called soju , which is rice - distilled .
It also has recently gained enormous popularity and Anheuser - Busch distributes a soju brand called Ku .
To add to the confusion around the two drinks , in New York and California there is a loophole in liquor laws allowing restaurants without a full liquor license to serve soju , as long as it contains no more than 24 percent alcohol .
Since this does n’t apply to shochu , you may see some of the Japanese spirit labeled as the Korean soju .
乾杯 Kanpai
Kanpai
In Japanese , the common toast is “ kanpai ” ( translating to “ dry your cup ” ) .
But if your cup goes dry , it ’s customary to wait for your drinking companion to replenish your glass and you refill theirs .
Recommendations
Chef Koji Hagihara of Hakata Tonton recommends :
- Tsukushi Mugi Shocyu | White Label
The best ( barley - mugi ) shochu .
Very rich flavor and deep tastes .
Recommended to drink on the rocks .
- Tsukushi Mugi Shocyu | Black Label
Mugi Shochu finishes in the highest high , deep aroma .
Recommended to drink on the rocks .
Umi No
Ie restaurant owner Matsumi recommends :
- Kappa No Sasoi - Mizu ( 河童の誘い水 ) : distilled from sweet potato , really smooth , goes with anything .
- Heihachiro ( 平八郎 ) : sweet potato - based , stronger flavor .
Sakaya sake store owner Hiroko recommends :
- Beni Otome ( 紅乙女 ) : made from roasted sesame seeds .
( Available at Sakaya and by the glass at EN Japanese Brasserie and Greenwich Grill ) .

The tobacco in cigarettes hosts a bacterial bonanza — literally hundreds of different germs , including those responsible for many human illnesses , a new study finds .
“ Nearly every paper that you pick up discussing the health effects of cigarettes starts out with something to the effect that smokers and people exposed to secondhand smoke experience high rates of respiratory infections , ” notes Amy Sapkota of the University of Maryland , College Park .
The presumption has been that smoking renders people vulnerable to disease by impairing lung function or immunity .
And it may well do both .
“ But nobody talks about cigarettes as a source of those infections , ” she says .
Her new data now suggest that ’s distinctly possible .
If these germs are alive , something she has not yet confirmed , just handling cigarettes or putting an unlit one to the mouth could be enough to cause an infection .
The idea that tobacco might contain viable germs is n’t just idle conjecture .
Several research teams have isolated bacteria from tobacco that they could grow out in petri dishes .
Those earlier investigations tended to hunt for — and , when found , attempted to grow — only one or two species of interest , Sapkota says .
What ’s novel in her study :
She and her colleagues probed for genetic material from any and every bacterium in a cigarette ’s tobacco .
Under sterile conditions , the researchers opened up cigarettes and then performed a series of tests on the leafy bits .
For instance , they isolated all of the ribosomal material and then homed in on its long , species - specific stretches known as 16S regions .
These genetic segments were then compared to 16S patches characteristic of known bacterial species .
Sapkota ’s team had 16S probes for close to 800 different bacteria and found matches to many hundreds in the four brands of cigarettes screened : Marlboro Red , Camel , Kool Filter Kings and Lucky Strike Original Red .
These cigarettes are “ among the most commonly smoked brands in Westernized countries and represent three major tobacco companies , ” Sapkota notes .
All were purchased in Lyon , France , where she was completing her postdoctoral studies .
Among the large number of germs whose DNA laced these cigarettes were : Campylobacter , which can cause food poisoning and Guillain - Barre Syndrome ; Clostridium , which causes food poisoning and pneumonias ; Corynebacterium , also associated with pneumonias and other diseases ; E. coli ; Klebsiella , Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Stenotrophomonas maltophilia , all of which are associated not only with pneumonia but also with urinary tract infections ; and a number of Staphylococcus species that underlie the most common and serious hospital - associated infections .
Sapkota ’s team lists many of these — including the most prevalent bacteria in the tobacco they studied — in a paper published early , online in Environmental Health Perspectives .
Some people have criticized the idea of infectious cigarettes , arguing that as tobacco burns , it would kill any germs present .
But Sapkota is not so sure that 's true .
The tobacco farthest from the burning tip might be a balmy temperature , from a bacterial point of view .
And here ’s “ a really wild idea , ” she says :
What if the smoke particles traveling through the still - unburned part of a cigarette pick up some germs and then ferry them deeply into the lung , where they ’re unlikely to be cleared ?
Would n’t that be the prescription for disease ?
Of course , there ’s also plenty of chances for a smoker to become exposed prior to lighting up .
And , of course , the potential for highest oral exposure would come from chewing tobacco — and nasal exposures from snuff .
Sapkota , an environmental health scientist , plans to follow up her preliminary data to see which types of tobacco are most likely to host viable germs , and whether those bacteria are transported into the body , either during smoking or by the insertion of unburned tobacco products ( including chewing tobacco ) into the mouth .
Several thousand potentially toxic chemicals have been isolated from cigarettes .
Sapkota says that it ’s not hard to imagine that the number of germs hosted by tobacco products could rival that of the carcinogens and other poisons residing in or produced by burning tobacco .
How so , when she 's only found genetic material indicting hundreds of germs ?
Owing to the bacterial probes available when Sapkota began her tobacco work , she was only able to screen for 700 - odd species .
But newer probes on the market can now screen for the bacterial 16S genetic material of 5,000 or more germs .
And if she used such huge batteries of probes now , she said she fully expects she could turn up at least 1,000 hitchhiking bacterial species in tobacco products .

LITTLETON , COLO . —
The scene unfolded Tuesday afternoon with shocking familiarity — a shooting outside a Jefferson County school , wounded students , heroic teachers , frantic parents .
When it was over , a man with a history of mental problems was in jail , accused of opening fire with a hunting rifle ; two eighth - graders were hospitalized — one in critical condition .
The bizarre burst of gunfire that erupted just after 3 p.m. at Deer Creek Middle School , 9201 W. Columbine Drive , ended when David Benke , a 57 - year - old math teacher , rushed the shooter , wrestled him to the ground and held on as others helped him subdue the man .
“ I have n’t cried in 20 years , but I cried like a baby and thanked Jesus , ” said Bob Wilson , who pulled to the side of the road to gather himself after his daughter , Elizabeth , called to tell him what happened .
“ This day could have been so much worse .
“ You never know when your whole life could turn upside down . ”
The two injured teenagers were identified as Matt Thieu and Reagan Weber .
Matt , initially treated at Littleton Adventist Hospital , was later transferred to Children ’s Hospital , where he was in critical condition late Tuesday night .
Reagan was treated at the Littleton hospital and released a few hours later .
Jefferson County authorities identified the alleged gunman as Bruco Strong Eagle Eastwood , 32 .
He was held on two counts of attempted murder , said Jacki Kelley , spokeswoman for the Jefferson County Sheriff ’s Office .
His father , Bruco War Eagle Eastwood , said his son heard voices and struggled financially .
“ I do n’t know why he did this , but he ’s always had problems .
I do n’t know why , though , ” the elder Eastwood said .
“ He ’s different , just different . ”
He also has an arrest record dating back to 1996 — including three incidents in which he was accused of threatening someone with a weapon .
The elder Eastwood said the gun , a bolt - action .30 - 06 , was his , though he was not sure when his son took it .
Deer Creek and nearby Stony Creek Elementary School will be closed today .
It is the second shooting at Deer Creek — in 1982 , a teen shot and killed a student outside the school .
Deer Creek is located just a few miles from Columbine High , the scene of the deadliest public school shooting in American history .
On April 20 , 1999 , two Columbine seniors murdered a dozen students and a teacher and wounded more than 20 others before killing themselves .
When authorities announced that the two students wounded Tuesday were expected to survive , it was clear the scale of the incident was much different than that .
And yet , the scenes that unfolded Tuesday were eerily similar .
Helicopters clattering overhead .
An unending array of flashing red and blue lights .
Parents driving down clogged neighborhood streets , parking willy - nilly , desperate to find their kids .
Youngsters walking down the sidewalk with blank eyes and 1,000 - yard stares .
Tuesday ’s trouble started in the middle of what had been a routine after - school scene .
The bus lane on the west side of the school and the street out front were jammed just after 3 p.m. as the day ’s final bell rang .
Students burst from the doors .
Steven Seagraves , 14 , was outside the front door when a man wearing a fedora walked up and asked a group of kids whether they attended that school .
After several of them answered with a “ yeah , ” the man opened fire with a high - powered rifle .
“ All of a sudden we hear this huge bang , ” said Steve Potter , a bus driver .
“ I thought somebody had an M - 80 . ”
Benke was on a regular shift patrolling the parking lot when he heard a sound as though “ someone lit a firecracker in a garbage can . ”
Benke saw the gunman and realized he was trying to reload his bolt - action rifle .
Benke charged .
“ I grabbed him by the front , and we were kind of dancing around for a while , ” Benke said hours later .
“ The next thing I remember , we were on the ground struggling . ”
As Benke shoved the man to the ground , teachers Norm Hanne and Becky Brown jumped in .
Brown pulled the gun out of the shooter ’s reach .
Just behind them came Potter and another bus driver , Jim O’Brien .
The group held the man down .
Someone appeared with plastic “ zip ” ties and shackled his ankles .
As he lay on the ground , trapped beneath all those bodies , the man uttered unintelligible obscenities , Potter said .
In the meantime , teachers shouted for kids to get down and not make any noise .
Others ran .
Panicked parents rushed for their youngsters .
Students were rushed to nearby Stony Creek Elementary , where they waited for their parents .
Tangie Hardy said the words did n’t sink in when her 14 - year - old son , Princeton , told her what he had seen : A man with a rifle walked right past him and approached two schoolmates , then opened fire .
“ Right now , I feel like throwing up , and I do n’t even think it ’s hit me yet , ” she said .
School district officials have been training for a situation like Tuesday ’s ever since Columbine .
“ We talk about these things all the time , ” said John McDonald , the school district ’s safety director .
“ We ’ve practiced .
We are very proud of our staff .
They went on lockdown very quickly .
They did exactly what they were supposed to do . ”
Kelley , the Sheriff ’s Office spokeswoman , said investigators believe the gunman had been seen at the school earlier in the day , but they were n’t sure why .
9 News reported that Eastwood attended the school in 1992 .
Benke , the teacher who charged the man , was teaching in Gilpin County when Columbine happened .
Over the years , when he has talked to his students about drills for what would happen in a situation like the one that unfolded Tuesday , he would tell them “ I just hoped that I would have the courage ” to do something .
Tuesday , he did .
It was the talk of the town .
“ He ’s the real hero , ” said Potter , the bus driver .
Someone launched a page on Facebook called “ Dr. David Benke Is A Hero !!!! ”
By late Tuesday it had more than 7,100 members .
Among them was Sue Petrone , whose son , Danny Rohrbough , was murdered at Columbine .
Sarah Palin Uses PAC to Buy Her Own Book Political Action Committee paid more than $ 60,000 for copies of ' Going Rogue . '
Feb . 1 , 2010  -- Sarah Palin has been using her political action committee to buy up thousands of copies of her book , " Going Rogue , " in order to mail copies of the memoir to her donors , newly filed campaign records show .
The former Alaska governor and 2008 Republican vice presidential candidate had her political organization spend more than $ 63,000 on what her reports describe as " books for fundraising donor fulfillment . "
The payments went to Harper Collins , her publisher , and in some instances to HSP Direct , a Virginia - based direct mail fundraising firm that serves a number of well - known conservative politicians and pundits .
Sarah PAC spent another $ 8,000 on colorful bookmarks designed by a Nashville - based event branding firm .
And her committee paid her publisher $ 20,000 for what appears to have been the cost of sending her personal photographer and another aide along on her book tour .
Those expenses are listed by the PAC as travel repayment to Harper Collins .
All of the purchases took place in November and December of 2009 , the records show .
Meghan Stapleton , a spokeswoman for Palin , said the book purchases were part of a promotion to reward donors with autographed copies if they gave more than $ 100 to the PAC .
" Due to supporters ' demand for the national best - seller " Going Rogue , " Sarah PAC purchased books and sent free , signed copies to those who donated $ 100 or more between November 16 and November 25 at noon , " Stapleton said .
" The fundraising tool was wildly successful . "
Published in November , " Going Rogue : An American Life , " is described by Harper Collins as " an intimate portrait " in which Palin " opens up for the first time about the 2008 presidential race , providing a rare , mom 's - eye view of high - stakes national politics . "
On the web site of her PAC , Palin posted a special letter to supporters upon the release of her book .
" My book , ' Going Rogue , ' is dedicated to you -- to Patriots -- who fight for freedom ! " she wrote in the note , which concludes with the opportunity to donate .
Palin would not be the first politician to use a PAC to underwrite the purchase of a memoir .
The Federal Election Commission has heard a number of cases on the question of whether it is an appropriate expense .
The rules are somewhat complex , but because Palin is neither a candidate for office , nor a sitting member of congress , her PAC is free to purchase the book under current law , according to Jan Baran , a campaign legal expert .
When former Democratic vice presidential candidate Joseph Lieberman sought in 2004 to give away copies of his memoir , " In Praise of Public Life , " he declined to take royalties off the books purchased by his campaign committee .
It is not known whether Palin entered into a similar arrangement .

In the new issue of the journal Cell Stem Cell , Singapore scientists report the surprising discovery that a novel transcription factor , Nr5 a2 , can replace one of the classical reprogramming factors , Oct4 , to significantly increase the efficiency of reprogramming differentiated stem cells into induced pluripotent stem cells ( iPS cells ) .
Previous research revealed that the reprogramming of differentiated cells into induced iPS cells could be achieved by the three transcription factors , Oct4 , Sox2 and Klf4 .
In this latest finding , which is potentially relevant to cell therapy - based medicine , Genome Institute of Singapore ( GIS ) and National University of Singapore ( NUS ) scientists determined that Nr5 a2 can replace Oct4 .
Thus , a new combination of Nr5a2 , Sox2 and Klf4 can reprogram differentiated cells into iPS cells .
" This is a very exciting moment , " said GIS Senior Group Leader Ng Huck Hui , Ph.D. " Fundamental research in embryonic stem cells is extremely important for us to harness the full potentials of these cells , and this study provides valuable and crucial insights into the mechanism of reprogramming .
" Given Oct4 's critical role in embryonic stem cells and reprogramming , we were very surprised with the discovery that Nr5a2 could replace Oct4 , " added Dr. Ng , senior author of the paper .
" This study highlights the prospect of finding more surprises in the field of reprogramming . "
" This paper represents significant addition to the very active field of cellular reprogramming , " added Davor Solter , M.D. , Ph.D. , Senior Principal Investigator at Singapore 's Institute of Medical Biology ( IMB ) .
Both GIS and IMB are part of Singapore 's A*STAR ( Agency for Science , Technology and Research ) .
" The authors show that gene coding for nuclear receptor Nr5 a2 can replace one of the classical reprogramming factors Oct 4 , " Dr. Solter said .
" In addition they presented evidence that this and another nuclear receptor can significantly increase the efficiency of reprogramming .
These results have great basic and practical significance . "
The reprogramming of differentiated cells into iPS cells is one of the most important breakthroughs in stem cell research , because iPS cells can give rise to all other differentiated cell types that make up the human body .
Because they behave like embryonic stem cells , iPS cells are important starting points for the creation of organs for replacement or transplantation .
The Cell Stem Cell paper , published on Jan. 21 , 2010 , is the second research report on iPS cell science by Dr. Ng 's research group .
In Jan. 2009 , Dr. Ng and his colleagues reported in Nature Cell Biology that the transcription factor Esrrb could replace Klf4 in the combination of Oct4 , Sox2 and Klf4 for iPS cell creation .
Looking towards a prosperous and successful future in a new MLM home business is all well and good .
It is the foundational thought to free ourselves from the demons that hold our lives where they are .
When we think of the wants and needs our desires as to hopes dreams aspirations .
We say to ourselves I must stay positive focused and strong willed as to my reason and purpose to create a new me .
A new chapter that will lead me in to a new light of understanding .
However in saying that and working to that point we are everyday facing a world of people that does not feel or see what we are trying to accomplish .
The fact is that the world and those people in it neither cares or wants you to be successful .
Do not be fooled in to a false sense of security by friends , family , or others who you may deal with on a daily bases .
That they want or hope for you to be better than what they have forecasted made out in their tiny thinking minds to be .
There are things in place to stop you from your success at every corner .
Family , friends , and strangers all saying who do you think you are ?
To believe you deserve to be successful .
Each one in their own way renting space in your mind with negative thoughts , actions , and events .
Events that seem to come out of nowhere to take your focus away from your success and your new MLM home business .
These things can deal with : money , death , criticism , poor health , being told you ’re too old , Loss of loved one .
All problems brought to your door step to make you question if starting completing or even bothering once more to try is worth your efforts .
Now I speak from the heart when I say this .
“ NO MATTER WHAT THE WORLD THROWS AT YOU
OR HOW IMPOSSIBLE IT MAY SEEM , TO STAY IN A POSITIVE FRAME OF MIND AND MOVE FORWARD DO NOT LET THE WORLD AND THOSE IN IT WIN ! ”
I will say it again .
Do not let the world and the demons of self doubt in it win .
So you ask how do we beat these things that seek to destroy our emotional frame of mind .
How do we concur the beast of fear and failure when everything around us seems to be battling against our wants and dreams ?
First :
You demand with all your being that it all STOPS .
Focuses visualize and positively see your spirit sending these negatives away from you .
Second :
You put your faith in god almighty that his will can and is possible to make it stop cold .
Third :
You part the way from all in your life that has kept you in a frame of mind that you are not worthy of self success .
Fourth :
Begin everyday on a path of enlightenment through self talk as to why you are worthy and the steps you want to accomplish each moment to lead you forward to that goal of success .
Now you may ask what success is .
Success can be found in the smallest of things from getting through a day with out screaming or having a tantrum of anger because the world has thrown a heater in stead of a soft pitch .
Or the helping of others by just being there when they need a positive reinforcement of encouragement
Success and desire starts out in small steps taken .
Bruce Lee once said that his success as a martial artist was not because he was truly better than any one else .
It was because he worked hard at being better than any one else .
He did it through self meditation of positive belief that he could and would achieve anything he set his mind in motion to do .
Not in anger or self pity when his masters came to him and said that he could not or was not allowed or capable of doing these great things .
But by putting all their fears aside out of his frame of being and just doing
Bruce Lee accomplished what he wanted to even though through out his life a demon of failure haunted him .
Bruce Lee said in doing and knowing you are worthy of anything there is nothing the world or spirit world can do to stop you from accomplishing what the world would like you to think was impossible .
Gandhi spoke of true success when he said a mile walked is just a mile walked .
It is the mind that must put away self doubt at the start as to all the pain ones feet may feel or not feel well walking that mile .
Starting a MLM home business is like that our minds must put away all the pains as to why we may or may not succeed as to just walking the walk and finding that we can and will see success .
With little pain as to the goal and achievements that bring joy over and above what starting pains may have been .
Martian Luther King wrote that he had a dream that all men were created equal and if he had not truly put faith or visualization and focuses in to that dream nothing that he did would have become a success .
When the whole world was against his dream like a storm .
Martian Luther King stood on the foundational rock that he was worthy and right deserved to be heard and not only battled back the beasts and demons that sought to destroy his dreams for a better world .
But beat it to the point others heard his fight and call and joined with him .
Starting a new MLM home business is in the same spirit as that each one of us have a reason purpose and an undying dream to see our work come to pass and pay off in success .
Each one of us wants to help others see our dream and create dreams of their own .
To hear our call and join us on our journey our walk our path to becoming the best we can through hard work .
Elvis Presley said the reason people started really lessening to my music was not because I sounded good it was because at the start my Momma never taught me how to be a quitter .
Had I not gone back to sun records to make Momma a birthday song ?
Sam Fillips would have never heard me sing nor would the world .
Because my Daddy said it cost two dollars and it was a waste of money two dollars back then was like gold .
Yet I chose to believe in myself and that belief has made me the king of Rock N Roll .
By putting aside the momentary negative Elvis ’s father put to him .
Elvis not only saw his dream of success and desire to be a singer come to pass but he was able to climb higher than any singer in history .
That brings me to Reason Five :
We must surround our selves with like minded people who know how to run a MLM home business .
And understand the costs and work it evolves to achieve our success .
Not one of the people mentioned above said that it was easy to get where they had gotten .
Each one had to put long hours of invested time into themselves and others to gain success and see their dreams realized .
SIX :
Every great achievement set in the world was not done by just the person that sets out to achieve it .
It is done and achieved by the help of the back up singers and staff roadies that are not noticed in the back ground .
Yes you may want to be the big show and have a dream of being the best in your MLM home business .
However with out those master minds and people who help you on your way to that success your dream can never be .
We must always accept the fact we are doing what we do not just for our own win .
However a win for our team and those people who stand with us through the trials the world throws are way .
Seven :
In achieving our dream we must prepare the way for others to possibly become better and more successful than ourselves .
Doing it with a loving heart .
In the bible John the Baptist set out on a mission from god .
He was told to prepare the way for the coming savior .
Now many would say that it would take a lot of money and resources to take on such a task as to doing that assignment .
But with little more than locusts to eat and honey with an animal skin on his back .
John set out with love in his heart to do God ’s will .
He never demanded anything else from god or said to god how can I do this with little to nothing ?
There were no negatives in John ’s heart or spirit because he knew with positive knowledge god would see and bless all he did or needed in his assignment .
John did not complain when god sent Jesus to him and say why lord look how popular I have become why would you come now and strip me from my followers ?
No his heart leaped and he said lord I am not worthy to do this thing you ask of me .
It is you who should do this thing for me .
The lord Jesus smiled and said John it is good that we show ourselves to be part of god ’s kingdom and so John baptized the lord god .
In starting our MLM business and setting out to achieve our goals we to must go with a positive spirit and not question what God ’s plans for our success and dreams are .
Many of us have little to nothing to get started yet we do so knowing god will give us all we need to be successful through people and help and we must also be willing to give what we know with a loving heart like John to others who may one day surpass us where there dreams may be brought forth into a new light .
Eight :
In to days world everything seems to have a price when speaking with people or doing for others .
Society in general has become dropped names market selling information and peoples names to companies for profit .
Many people look at an MLM business as a way to play slick Willy and offer people things they do not need or really can use in their daily lives .
One of the biggest demons we must face in starting a home MLM business is how truthful we are willing to be to those we seek to bring in to our business .
A big rule of thumb is if you can get it for free why paying for it ?
Many people do not understand this rule and believe the old ways are still the right ways they frown on the idea that they really do not have to pay for leads .
They say how much does it cost no matter how many times they hear the words nothing .
All the time because if it is free there must be something wrong with it or a catch that will drag them later down to the poor house
It is this negative feeling the world of MLM systems puts out to people who really have never had or understand an MLM System .
They choose to believe the false information sent out because there is so much of it .
They choose to follow people or take advice from the wrong people who have never been successful
In MLM home business .
From people in a years time who have not stuck with one MLM system but have been involved in Hundreds always making the same mistakes
Nine :
The biggest thing we need starting a home business is guidance that comes from a proven source .
Many would say where can I find that guidance .
Well believe me when I say that the start of your walk to success is right here right now .
In what you are reading .
It comes from my deep felt will as my wife ’s will and so many others who know where you may be right now .
If you are looking at a future MLM home business not knowing the next step feeling like the world is against you .
Ten :
Then stop , look , listen , and act on those feelings by positively taking all the steps above and then realize that life is what you want it to be and the world is wrong not you .
You will in the next year see a new light at the end of that tunnel you may feel you are in at the end of the tunnel is everything promised if you are willing to walk the walk do the work an invest in yourself as well as others .
Results do not very with this program it is exactly what it says it is .
( FREE ) Absolutely no cost to you .
No lead buying no huge promises and nothing but your time and willingness to see your dreams desires for success come to pass .
Mentoring for free can save you years of frustration and failure .
Get the help you need today and get started in the positive and beat the world ’s negative demons back .

Believe it or not , and I prefer to believe , tomorrow ( February 9th ) is International Pizza Day !
Have a look at my simple pizza dough recipe or my first ever effort in the shape of Australia !
I ’m sure that many would upchuck at the thought of baked bean pizza but take my word for it , it is awesome .
The boffins over at Heinz were obviously on to something when they came up with the frozen one .
There is even a Facebook page dedicated to ‘ Bring Back Heinz Baked Bean Pizzas ‘ !!
These days my kids go wild for my own homemade version .
It ’s not complicated and any baked beans will do .
Spread over your tomato sauce or just tomato paste if you prefer , and top with cheese .
The bulk of the cheese is simply cheddar of one sort or another but you can finish it off with a little mozzarella if you like .
Sprinkle some mixed herbs over if you like and voila !
So if it ’s not baked bean pizza , what ’s your favourite ?

To re-balance their economies , Americans need to save more and the Chinese must loosen their wallets .
But judging from homemaker Wang Fang ’s grocery cart leading up to the biggest holiday of the year here it ’s going to take some doing to persuade consumers here to shop til they drop .
Her annual splurge , timed to Sunday ’s Chinese New Year festivities , included a sack of rice , a jug of cooking oil and a bag of beef jerky .
Wang ’s lone personal indulgence : a $ 40 foot - washing basin she bought using a gift card from her husband ’s state - owned gas company .
“ Chinese people like to buy practical gifts , ” said Wang , 49 .
“ So it ’s mainly food and drinks .
We ’re not going to buy junk that lasts one or two years . ”
Debt - strapped Americans would do well to mimic
Wang ’s self - restraint .
But in macroeconomic terms Chinese frugality is not a virtue .
China ’s economy is overly dependent on foreigners to buy its low - cost exports , a weakness that was exposed during the recent global downturn .
The government is now trying to encourage its own citizens to spend , with the goal of building reliable domestic demand for Chinese products .
“ We must . . . transform the current development model that is excessively reliant on investment and exports , ” Li Keqiang , the vice premier widely expected to be the next prime minister , said last month at the World Economic Forum at Davos .
“ We will focus on boosting domestic demand . ”
It wo n’t be easy .
China ’s rapid rise might be the envy of nations across the globe .
Yet for all the talk of its economic miracle , Chinese consumers are taking home a shrinking share of the pie .
In the 1990s , household income accounted for 72 % of the country ’s gross domestic product .
By 2007 it had fallen to 55 % , according to a study on Chinese consumption by consulting firm McKinsey & Co .
That ’s because Beijing has geared China ’s economy toward production rather than consumption .
It ’s a formula that has provided millions of workers with employment but no quick path to the middle class .
Driving the disparity , experts said , is China ’s decision to subsidize manufacturing and exports at almost any cost to keep its factories humming .
The government has showered its manufacturers with low - interest loans , export subsidies and other incentives to give them an edge over foreign competitors .
Beijing has also kept its currency , the yuan , artificially low so that its goods remain cheap abroad .
That has been a boon for Chinese factory owners and other well - connected elites .
The nation boasted 42 billionaires on Forbes ’ most recent list of global tycoons .
But wages for most Chinese workers have grown slowly , while their tax burden has risen to help finance all those business subsidies .
Meanwhile , a weak currency has fueled inflation and makes imports more expensive for consumers at home .
The McKinsey study said the average Chinese worker has to put in seven hours on the job to earn enough to purchase the same amount of goods or services that an American worker could buy with one hour ’s pay .
Yu Yaocai , a 28 - year - old junior high school teacher in Beijing , said he set a $ 300 budget for the holidays , about $ 40 less than his monthly pay .
He said he would put the expenses on his credit card but would pay it off promptly when the bill arrived .
“ I only buy something when I need to buy something , ” Yu said .
To be sure , living standards are rising here .
China surpassed the U.S. last year in auto sales , and it ’s the world ’s No. 1 cellphone market .
Still , more than half of China ’s 1.3 billion people remain in the countryside , where per capita income in 2009 was $ 758 .
City dwellers averaged earnings of $ 2,773 last year , about 15 times less than what the typical American earned .
Persuading Chinese consumers to spend considerably more of their disposable income will require a massive cultural shift .
The Chinese savings rate is more than five times higher than that of the U.S.
That ’s largely because citizens here can’t count on the government to supply them with adequate education , healthcare or retirement benefits .
Hu Yuping , a homemaker from a rural suburb outside Beijing , said she ’s trained her family to survive on about $ 1 a day .
It ’s the only way they can afford her son ’s college tuition , which costs $ 1,000 a semester .
Her husband had to give up a job as a taxi driver because of diabetes .
Their savings helped pay his medical bills .
To make ends meet , he ’s taken handyman assignments in his village .
“ We do n’t buy anything big , ” said Hu , whose deep crow ’s - feet and graying hair make her look far older than her 46 years .
“ The last time we did was five years ago when we bought a television . ”
The central government has launched plans to shore up healthcare and pension plans , but the efforts are still not enough , experts said .
Chinese people “ still do not feel secure about their future , ” said Zhao Ping , an economist with the Ministry of Commerce , who researches consumer spending .
“ Social security is not well - developed .
People in the rural areas have to save money for old age ; children [ providing for their parents in their old age is ] the traditional way , but people ca n’t rely on that because of the one - child policy .
The government is trying to improve the social security system , healthcare and retirement programs in rural areas .
Only when the system is established will people have the confidence to spend more . ”
A host of multinational firms , including Walmart , General Motors , Procter & Gamble and Apple , are betting on it .
On a recent afternoon at one of the 156 so - called “ hypermarkets ” in China run by the French retailing chain Carrefour , hordes of shoppers elbowed their way through the aisles to stock up for the New Year ’s celebrations .
Many said it was the most expensive occasion of year for them .
Family meals had to be prepared and gifts had to be given to in - laws , colleagues and bosses .
The crowds were n’t so thick in the electronics department , but traffic was jammed in the food aisles , where special red gift boxes of Peking duck , mixed nuts and rice wine were ready to be scooped - up by passersby .
“ It ’s nutritious and the packaging is easy to hold , ” said He Liping , explaining why she bought her aunt a seasonally decorated box of organic eggs .
While thrift remains the watchword , some unapologetic consumers can be found in the upscale shopping districts that are springing up in the big cities .
Steven Chen , a 23 - year - old musician , said his fashion icon was hip - hop star Kanye West .
The Beijing native proudly described his ensemble while standing outside a designer T - shirt store : a Victorinox beanie , a Billionaire Boys Club jacket over a Uniqlo hoodie , Buffalo jeans and teal - colored Nike sneakers .
“ If I have the money , I ’ll buy it , ” Chen said , describing his shopping addiction .
“ It ’s my own money so my parents ca n’t complain .
Though they keep telling me to save and buy a house . ”

Mo Dorka - aki nagy örömünkre szintén blogunk nevét viselő kedves követ őinkhöz tartozik - egy novellának is beillő művet engedett át nekünk közlésre az utazók jellegzetes típusairól .
A modoros utazó
A modoros utazó görögbe , spanyolba vagy olaszba megy .
Ha nemcsak modoros , hanem pénzes is , akkor a Maldívra .
Ez esetben feltétlenül érzékelteti , hogy az előbb felsorolt helyekre már csak a lúzerek járnak .
„ Görögbe meg spanyolba bármikor elmehetsz , az nem olyan nagy szám . ”
„ A szokásos görög - török - olasz - horvát - spanyol már dögunalom . ”
" Akinek van mit a tejbe aprítani és nem igénytelen , az ne a gagyi olasz vagy görög tengerparti nyaralóhelyekre menjen . "
„ Mindegy , melyik szigetet választjátok , nem lesz sok magyar sehol sem , ez nem olasz , horvát vagy spanyol . ”
Az utolsó idézetből sejteni lehet azt is , hogy a régebbi posztokban már leírt módokon bezzegelni és honfitársainkat valamint kis hazánkat szidalmazni nemcsak a hétköznapokban lehet , hanem nyaralás közben is rengeteg alkalom adódik az ilyen modorosságok gyakorlására .
Ezt már rögtön a repülőtéren el lehet kezdeni , ahol sorbanállás közben célszerű a többiekre tett félhangos megjegyzésekkel múlatni az időt .
„ Kimondottan rühellem ezt a tolakodást .
Tipikus kelet - európai tulajdonság , sajnos .... ”
„ Tiszta Balkán … bezzeg az angolok meg tudják oldalni a sorbanállást , de ezek itt még erre sem képesek ! ”
Beszálláskor már egyáltalán nem kell visszafogni a hangerőt , sőt , éppen az a lényeg , hogy minél többen meghallják azt a megjegyzést , amely szerint az illető már úgy száll repülőre , mint más a hetes buszra .
Ez a téma szinte kimeríthetetlen : amíg fel nem száll a gép , lehet elnézően , atyáskodva ( és kéretlenül ) bátorítani az először repülőn ülőket és / vagy szakért őként tündökölve viccelődni a gép műszaki állapotán .
„ Ne majrézz , Géza , meglátod , észre sem fogod venni , hogy felszálltunk , én már vagy ezerszer repültem , azt ’ mégis itt vagyok !
Igaz , elég csotrogány ez a gép , az előbb is láttam , hogy még igazítottak rajta valamit , persze úgy , hogy az utasok ne vegyék észre , de egy ilyen tapasztalt vén rókát , mint én , nem lehet átejteni , he - he - he ! ”
Útközben ki lehet tárgyalni a repülős vs. buszos utazás előnyeit , fennen hangoztatva , hogy az utóbbit soha többet .
A fő ok természetesen nem is lehet más , mint a szégyellnivaló honfitársak , akiknek lábszaguk van , nappal káromkodnak , éjjel horkolnak és folyton büdös kajákat esznek .
„ Nincs az a pénz , hogy busszal utazzam bárhová a honfitársaimmal , nem tudom , hogy van ez , de mintha csupa balkáni barbár tömörülne ilyenkor , szégyellem , hogy magyar vagyok . ”
A landolás aztán újabb remek modorosságra ad alkalmat : hősünk elsőként kezd el tapsolni a sikeres földet érés után , hogy ezzel is mutassa a zöldfülűeknek , ő mennyire tisztában van a repülős etikettel .
Mivel valójában nem repül sokat , csak max .
az évi egy nyaralása alkalmával , sosem fogja megtudni , hogy ez a „ szokás ” kizárólag a nyári ( charter ) járatokon dívik , és csak a hozzá hasonlók terjesztik . :)
Érkezés után veszi kezdetét a tulajdonképpeni nyaralás .
Ahány típusú modoros utazó csak létezik , ez annyiféleképpen zajlik …
Az all inclusive - os
A külföldi nyaralás lefoglalása előtt az a legnagyobb problémája , hogy a négycsillagos Hotel Ramadan Superiort vagy az ötcsillagos Hotel Elite Deluxe - ot válassza-e az utazási iroda katalógusából .
Az , hogy melyik országba mennek , nem is nagyon érdekli , de a szálloda kérdésén hetekig rágódik .
Arra viszont képtelen és / vagy lusta , hogy utánanézzen az infóknak a számtalan szállodaértékelő weboldal egyikén ...
Végül nagy nehezen valahogy döntésre jut , lefoglalja és befizeti az utat , majd szigor úan csak ezután (! ) beregisztrál egy utazási fórumra , ahol minimum két - három topikba is beírja a nagy kérdéseit , amelyek általában a következő témák köré csoportosíthatók : homokos-e a tengerpart , mit érdemes megnézni a környéken és egyáltalán , „ lécci írjatok meg mindent , amit tudtok a szállodáról és van-e valaki , aki ugyanakkor jön , amikor mi ? ” .
Mikor erre nyolcból tízen közlik vele , hogy olvasson vissza , halálosan megsértődik – de még ekkor is képtelen arra , hogy kettőt visszalapozzon vagy beüsse a keres őbe a szálloda nevét ... pedig legalább egy tucat véleményt olvashatna , mert csak idén már ő az ötödik , aki erre a hotelre kíváncsi …
A tízből a maradék kettő azért megszánja , és belinkel neki néhány szállodaértékelést , leírják a topik történetében háromszáznegyvenedszerre , hogy nem , a part nem homokos , hanem kavicsos és még néhány közismert környékbeli nevezetességet is felsorolnak .
Csalódottan veszi tudomásul a válaszokat , mert neki az utazási irodában azt mondták , hogy homokos a part , és a tenger csak 100 méterre van a szállodától ( valójában meg légvonalban 500 , de mivel csak kerülővel lehet eljutni a parthoz , igazából 900 - at kell gyalogolni :) ) , de aztán túlteszi magát rajta , és elmegy nyaralni .
Ezek után vagy soha többet nem jelenik meg ú jra a topikban , vagy pedig visszajön , és bőséges beszámolót ír , ami így fog kezdődni :
„ Két hétig még csak ki sem kellett mozdulnunk a szállodából !
Törökország fantasztikus hely ! ”
Ezek után a hotel részletekbe menő ismertetése következik , megtudhatjuk , hogy hány és milyen medence van ( ez ugye fontos , mert ne felejtsük el , hogy a tengerig 900 m-t kellett volna gyalogolni :) ) , milyen animációk és programok voltak , ezek közül melyiket ki tartotta , volt-e magyar nyelvű , ő melyiken vett részt , hányszor cserélték egy héten az ágyneműt , volt-e tévé a szobában … stb. stb…
„ Olyan színvonalas animációs programok voltak , amilyenekkel eddig még sehol sem találkoztam !
Volt jóga , darts , víziaerobic meg step aerobic , és hiába volt izomlázam , folyton mindegyiken ott voltam , mert annyira jó volt !
Volt , hogy nem a lányok , hanem az animátorfiúk tartották , akik beöltöztek lánynak , hát az rém vicces volt , labdákat tettek a cicijük a helyére , hát dőltünk a röhögéstől ! ”
A topik többi résztvevője persze általában nem állja meg szó nélkül , be - beszólnak :
„ Gratula !
Azért mész Törökországba , hogy aerobikozz .
Esetleg messzebb nem akarsz menni ? ”
Nyilván a sértődött válasz sem marad el .
„ Nem azért megyek , nem kell kötözködni .
Aktív nyaraló vagyok , nekem fontos , hogy ne tétlenkedjek ! ”
Persze ennyi aktivitáshoz fontos a megfelelő mennyiségű kalóriabevitel is , úgyhogy muszáj részletesen megemlékezni arról , hogy melyik nap mi volt a svédasztalon reggeli , ebéd , vacsora gyanánt ( ezt lehetőleg néhányszor le is videózni (! ) :) ) , az all inclusive keretében milyen italokat lehetett fogyasztani és milyeneket nem ( ez utóbbi természetesen felháborító ! ) .
„ A kaját csak isteníteni lehet !
A főétkezések között volt három bár ( main , pool , beach ) .
A főépületben , a medencénél és a parton ahol a köztes időszakban szintén kánaán volt …
Az üdítős , sörös , boros csapot az ember maga kezelhette …
El lehet képzelni !
És az ebéd se volt kutya : bárány , nyúl , marha , pulyka , hal… zöldségek ... köret vagy ötféle ... egyszer még malacsült is volt !
Fehér keszty űben szelte a szakács !
Desszertek : fagyi , dinnye , torták , sütik … h

úúúúú… visszagondolni is jó !
Előítéleteimmel szemben a tengeri herkenty űktől megkíméltek bennünket , nem is volt polip és egyéb szörny … ”
Hát igen , végül is a lényeg az , hogy a külföldi nyaralás alatt se kelljen megválni az otthon megszokott ízektől , és mindenféle szokatlan helyi ételt enni … :)
Ha az országban nem is néznek körül , azért a szálloda strandjára csak kimerészkednek .
Ha ott történetesen mégis homokos a part , még akkor sem lehet minden tökéletes …
" A tengerpartot meglepő módon minden nap megtisztították a nagyobb szemetektől – de azért nem szitálták át a homokot , mint jobb helyeken . ”
A napok többnyire esti korzózással végződnek , amelynek során „ furcsa ” tapasztalatokra lehet szert tenni egy idegen országban … :)
„ Nekem nagyon furcsa volt , hogy a sötét bőrűek ( helyiek ? ) esténként ellepik a partot és a sétányt .
A helyi- turista arány kb. 80 - 20 % volt .
Nem volt velük semmi gond , csak hát azért mégis .... "
Tényleg , mit képzelnek ezek a helyiek , hogy csak úgy sétálgatnak az utcán a saját országukban ?
Elképesztő , hogy milyen helyek vannak a világon … :)
Az öblös
Igen , a már ismert öblösről van szó :) , hiszen ő is szokott külföldön nyaralni .
Őt sem az ország megismerésének vágya hajtja .
Motivációja inkább az , hogy megmutassa a világnak , hogy neki bizony telik külföldi utazásra , pedig valójában jobban érezné magát a telken , ahol a haverokkal bográcsozhatna , miközben újra előadhatná nekik a szokásos vaskos vicceket és nagyokat röhögve dönthetnék magukba a söröket .
Éppen ezért , ha ráveszi magát az útra , akkor igyekszik mindent magával vinni itthonról , ami kint hiányozna .
Először is a fent említett haverokat :) , úgyhogy általában több család utazik együtt az ismeretségi körből .
Természetesen egy helyen szállnak meg , így nincs akadálya annak , hogy ugyanolyan bulikat csapjanak , mint amilyet itthon szoktak .
Ehhez ipari mennyiségű kajaalapanyagot visznek magukkal .
Az autók roskadoznak a rúd téliszalámik , a tubusos piros aranyak , kiló krumplik , lefagyasztott rántott húsok és pörköltek súlya alatt , hiszen mi lehetne jobb egy kis hazainál messze idegenben ?
Megfelelő mennyiségű rekesz sör nélkül pedig ú tnak sem indulnak . :)
A célpontjuk általában valami népszerű tengerparti üdülőhely , de olyan , ahol otthonosan érzik magukat , tehát lehetőleg sok magyar járjon oda , ami azért is jó , mert újabb családokkal lehet összeismerkedni és bevonni őket az esti mulatozásokba , meg azért is , mert az ilyen helyeken vannak magyar nyelvű boltok és éttermek .
A nyaralás alatt a nagy társaság közösen megy mindenhová .
Ez a mindenhová általában a strand - kemping / apartman - sétálóutca háromságot jelenti .
Többre nem kíváncsiak , hiszen minden itt van helyben , és csak nem fognak fárasztó kirándulásokat tenni , mikor végre pihenhetnek !
Napközben strandolnak ( ld. régebbi strandolós posztok :) ) , este pedig jöhet a nap fénypontja , a közös bográcsozás , sörözés és sztorizás .
A bulizós plázacica
Sokat lehetne írni róla , de talán mindennél beszédesebb , ha ennek a típusnak a kedvenc újságjából , a Cosmopolitanból ( amely önmagában is megérne egy posztot :) ) idézek egy tavaly júliusban megjelent , Krétáról szóló cikkrészletet .
„ Felejthetetlen hetet töltöttünk ott .
Nem volt éktelen tömeg , úgyhogy napközben nyugodtan napozhattunk toplessben a strandon , esténként pedig vacsora után minden nap másik bárban táncoltunk a pecsenyepirosra égett angol fiúkkal .
Egyik nap - talán a harmadik lehetett - felmerült , hogy elmehetnénk megnézni pár látványosságot , így autót béreltünk , és felkerekedtünk .
Jelentem : Kréta olyan , hogy ha a parton fekszik az ember , és a szárazföld felé néz , mindenhol kopár dombokat lát , ha pedig elindul a dombok felé , akkor sok bizsu- és papucsbolt van , és gyönyörű virágok , meg bárok és gyros .
Amikor a hétvégén hazaértünk , itthon még mindig esett az eső , és mi voltunk a városban az egyetlenek , akik barnák és boldogok voltunk .
Augusztusban is visszamegyünk , mert Krétából soha nem elég ! "
Hát Kréta a papucsoknál és a bizsuknál „ talán ” többről szól , de ez a típus erre sosem fog rájönni …
A kipipálós
Valamilyen rosszul értelmezett „ teljesítménykényszer ” hajtja , hogy minél többször , minél olcsóbban mehessen külföldre .
Szenvedélyes repjegyvadász , aki minden akcióra elsőként csap le .
Nem aszerint választ úticélt , hogy mi érdekli , hanem aszerint , hogy hová van éppen olcsó jegy .
De ha egyszer valahová már eljutott ( akár csak fél napra is ! ) , akkor az a hely többé nem érdekli , „ leírja ” , „ kipipálja ” , hiszen az már kész , megvolt .
Lételeme az utazások örökös tervezése - szervezése .
Minden hírlevélre előfizet , lesi az utazási fórumokat és híreket .
A szomszédos országon túlra három átszállással utazik és büszke arra , hogy a menetrendszerinti árhoz képest féláron jutott a repülőjegyekhez - igaz , közben két éjszakát reptéri várókban kell töltenie .
Amikor úton van , mindig rohan , mintha félne , hogy lemarad valamiről .
Igazán körül sem néz , csak a főbb nevezetességeket „ pipálja ki ” .
Hazaérkezése után szívesen és sokat segít a többi fórumozónak és nagyon hasznos infókat lehet tőle kapni a repülőjáratokra , tömegközlekedésre , olcsó szállásokra stb. vonatkozóan , csak a látnivalókról , az ország jellegzetességeiről nem érdemes kérdezni .
A kritizálós
Soha semmi nem elég jó neki .
Neki mindig minden „ jár ” , de soha semmit nem kap meg a – szerinte – megfelelő minőségben .
A legolcsóbb iroda legolcsóbb last minute útjára fizet be , és ezek után fel van háborodva , hogy nincs hajszárító a fürdőben , tévé a szobában és az erkély nem a tengerre néz .
Nem felejti el a megjegyezni , hogy bezzeg az ugyanabban a szállodában lakó svédek / németek stb. mind tengerre néző emeleti szobát kaptak , viszont a magyaroknak felháborító módon a földszinti lyukakat osztotta ki a – nyilván velejéig gonosz és nemzeti alapon diszkrimináló – szállótulajdonos .
Lamentálás közben sosem gondolkodik el azon , hogy a tengerre néző szoba lakói valószínűleg sokkal többet fizettek be az útért az ő nyugat - európai utazási irodájukban , mint amit ő leperkált a magyar ügyintézőnél , és esetleg inkább ez állhat a szobabeosztás hátterében , nem pedig az egyéni szimpátia .
Ő az , akinek mindig van valami kifogásolnivalója .
Pl. az , hogy a reggelihez nincs hatodik fajta müzli , az idegenvezető nem elég készséges , mert hajnali egykor álmából felverve nem rohan tolmácsolni a kedves utasnak az étterembe vagy szerinte nem takarítanak megfelelően .
- Ezek nem takarítanak !
– így az apa .
- Nálunk minden nap , sőt hattyút is hajtogatnak a törölközőből stb .
Biztos , hogy nem takarítanak ?
– kérdi a szomszéd szoba lakója .
- Biztos , de majd szólunk , mert nem cserélik a törölközőt sem !
Ja drágám - fordul anyához - kiraktad ugye a papírt ?
- Ki hát !
- jön a válasz .
- Milyen papírt ?- kérdezi értetlenül a szomszéd .
- Hát hogy ne menjenek be a szobába , nehogy ellopják a dvd lejátszót ! ”
A körülmények látszólagos gonosz összejátszása ellenére sem csügged , sőt , büszkén hirdeti , hogy ő igenis feltalálja és csak azért is jól érzi magát !
Kisstílűen ügyeskedik , és erről utólag dagadó kebellel ír a beszámolójában , hiszen mindenkinek látnia kell , hogy ő mennyire talpraesett és agyafúrt !
„ A szobakulcs egy húszdekás kulcstartón pihent , amelyben mágnes volt .
A szobában a konnektor alatti helyre kellett illeszteni , így volt áram , tv és légkondi a szobában .
Aki ide jön , annak melegen ajánlom , hogy már az első nap szedje le a kulcsot a mágnesről , és kreáljon valami átfúrt kupakkal saját kulcstartót !!
Így a mágnes a helyén maradhat , így ha a tengerben fürdik az ember , akkor is mehet a légkondi .
Mert úgy kevés , ha csak akkor kapcsoljuk be , amikor a szobába megérkezünk ...
De a kulcsot így nem ajánlom leadni a recepción , mert görbén nézne az angolt erősen törő hölgyike . ”
Az utolsó mondatból természetesen nem hiányozhat a kötelező kritizálás sem , azt pedig inkább ne firtassuk , hogy ő maga vajon mennyire törheti az angolt …
Ő már valamennyire körülnéz az országban , ahol éppen van , de persze itt is mindenben csak a rosszat látja meg .
Az éttermek szerinte koszosak , az árak magasak , a strandok nem elég szépek , a víz nem elég tiszta , a helyi lakosok barátságtalanok stb. stb .
Hazaérkezés után panaszlevelet ír az utazási irodának , amelyben felrója , hogy nem tájékoztatták megfelelően ( nem mintha egyszer is elolvasta volna az utazási szerződést ) , és minden apró sérelmét részletesen kielemzi – akár tehet róla az iroda , akár nem .
Így születnek az olyan panaszos levelek , amelyekről pl. az alábbi cikkrészlet nyújt egy kis összefoglalót
( http://www.borsonline.hu/news.php?op&hid=19246).
„ Ki gondolná például , hogy egyeseket az zavart : a strand túl homokos .
Mások arra panaszkodtak , hogy az utazási iroda nem közölte velük , hogy a tengerben halak lehetnek .
Nyaralásukat tönkretette , hogy a gyerekeik féltek a vízlakóktól .
Meglepő az a duzzogás is , amit egy Indiában turistáskodó férfitól kaptak : tűrhetetlen , hogy minden étteremben curryt szolgálnak fel .
Mások az olaszországi sziesztát akarják betiltatni , mondván , ők éppen akkor vásárolgattak volna .
Földrajzi analfabéta lehetett az a panaszos , aki amiatt reklamált , hogy a repülő Jamaikából őt kilenc óra alatt repítette haza , míg a rohadt amerikaiak már három óra után élvezhették az otthon örömeit .
Mindezeket veri azonban annak a fiatalasszonynak a kiborulása , aki Thaiföldön volt nászúton .
– Első nap elmentünk egy elefántszafárira .
Amikor megláttam , milyen sokkolóan nagy az elefántbika hímtagja , rosszul lettem , képtelen voltam a nászéjszakán a férjem örömére tenni . ”
A nagy utazó
Mélységesen megveti a az előző csoportok mindegyikének képviselőit , hiszen neki határozott elvei vannak arról , hogy hogyan „ kell ” (! ) utazni , és aki nem így tesz , az örökre elásta magát előtte .
Az „ utazási iroda ” vagy a „ fakultatív program ” kifejezések megemlítése vörös posztó számára .
Ha valaki szóba hozza , akkor azon nyomban fens őbbségesen bizonygatni kezdi , hogy mekkora balfaszság irodával menni .
Rögtön kiszámolja , hogy ő mennyivel olcsóbban tudta volna megszervezni ugyanazt az utat .
Eszmefuttatását sokszor a hatásosnak vélt „ persze mindenki arra költi a pénzét , amire akarja ” formulával zárja , mert képtelen megérteni , hogy mások más szempontok alapján döntenek , és nem mindenkinél az az elsődleges , hogy – mondjuk - húszezer forintot megspóroljon .
Általában valamelyik utazós fórum törzstagja .
A rátartisága mellé néha valóban széleskörű tapasztalat is társul , ezért a szervilisebb lelkületű topikolókból gyakran szervez ődik köré rajongótábor .
Ha elismerően nyilatkozol róla és a nézeteiről , akkor befogad a hívei közé és onnantól atyai pártfogását élvezheted , de ha nem ugyanazt fújod , amit ő , akkor a sleppjével együtt hamar kiutál .
Szerinte egyedül ő és a tanácsait követők azok , akik képesek arra , hogy valóban megismerjenek egy országot .
Az előző csoportokkal ellentétben ő ugyanis azért utazik , hogy a helyi lakosokkal keveredjen és átélje az adott hely hamisítatlan fílingjét .
Nyaralásának csúcspontja , ha szóba elegyedhet egy helyi halásszal vagy a cipőpucoló fiúval , és utólag büszkén tölti fel az ezt dokumentáló közös fotót a fórumra .
Ő az , aki a legbetegesebben kerüli a többi magyart .
Már az úti cél kiválasztásánál is lényeges szempont , hogy majd később hazaérve büszkén hangoztathassa , hogy „ sikerült két hétig magyarmentesen nyaralni ” .
Erre sosem marad el a kontrázás …
„ Tökéletesen igazad van !
Én is megpróbálok " magyarmentes " területekre utazni .
Éppen elég itthon a taplóságot elviselni . ”
Az sosem derül ki , hogy mitől jobb az angolok , hollandok , oroszok és egyéb más nemzetek taplóságait elviselni .
Néha pedig önkéntelenül felmerül az emberben , hogy akik a fórumon ilyen nagy egyetértésben ajnározzák egymást és szidalmazzák a többieket , vajon ha két hét múlva az adott országban véletlenül találkoznak , akkor mindketten külföldit tetteknek és jó , hogy le nem köpik a másikat ? :)
Merthogy van ám arra az esetre is forgatókönyv , ha hazánkfia minden óvintézkedés ellenére mégis meglát egy magyar rendszámú autót vagy magyar beszédet hall .
Ilyenkor tüntetőleg idegen nyelvre kell váltani és kínosan ügyelni arra , hogy nehogy véletlenül köszönnie kelljen a honfitársaknak .
„ Én nagyon szégyellem külföldön , hogy magyar vagyok , ha nem kérdezik , nem is mondom meg .
Ha magyar szót hallok , csöndben odébbállok . ”
Unalmas téli hónapokban az a kedvenc időtöltése , hogy az előzőekben felsorolt típusok topikjaiba látogat , ott a hozzászólásokon kéjeleg és tudálékosan kioktatja őket .
Gyakran tesz az alábbiakhoz hasonló megfellebbezhetetlen kijelentéseket :
„ Akinek csak a pörkölt jó ebédre , az menjen inkább a Balatonra ! ”
„ Nem értem , hogy egyáltalán minek megy az ilyen külföldre ? ”
Epilógus
Két hét múlva a különböző típusok képviselői ú jra összetalálkoznak a hazafelé tartó repülőúton és együtt érkeznek Ferihegyre .
A kiszállás után a tömeg áramlik kifelé a folyóson , majd egyszer csak meglepődve ütközik bele egy korlátba , amit valaki véletlenül úgy látszik , elfelejtett eltávolítani az útból .
Az emberek megtorpannak , egy társaság azonban rendületlenül tör előre .
A hangadójuk megrángatja a korlátot , de nem megy , le van lakatolva .
Egy perc múlva megjelenik egy stewardess , aki intézkedik , de hiába , az illusztris társaság ekkor már megalkotta eredeti , frappáns és végletekig modoros ítéletet :
„ Látszik , hogy hazaérkeztünk , üdv Magyarisztánban … ”
By George Will - February 18 , 2010
WASHINGTON --
The Republican presidential nominee , an Arizona senator , was a maverick , which was part of his charm .
He spoke and acted impulsively , which was part of his problem .
Voters thought his entertaining dimensions might be incompatible with presidential responsibilities .
For example , he selected a running mate most Americans had never heard of and who had negligible experience pertinent to the presidency .
This was 1964 .
Barry Goldwater , whose seat John McCain occupies , chose to run with Bill Miller , a congressman from Lockport , N.Y. , near Buffalo .
Miller , Goldwater cheerfully explained , annoyed Lyndon Johnson .
After the Goldwater - Miller ticket lost 44 states , Miller retired to Lockport where he practiced law and lived in dignified anonymity until his death in 1983 .
Although he had served as an assistant prosecutor of Nazi war criminals at Nuremberg , and seven terms in Congress , no one suggested he should be considered for the 1968 Republican presidential nomination .
Yet Sarah Palin , who with 17 months remaining in her single term as Alaska 's governor quit the only serious office she has ever held , is obsessively discussed as a possible candidate in 2012 .
Why ?
She is not going to be president and will not be the Republican nominee unless the party wants to lose at least 44 states .
Conservatives , who rightly respect markets as generally reliable gauges of consumer preferences , should notice that the political market is speaking clearly :
The more attention Palin receives , the fewer Americans consider her presidential timber .
The latest Washington Post / ABC
News poll shows that 71 percent of Americans -- including 52 percent of Republicans -- think she is not qualified to be president .
This is not her fault .
She is what she is , and what she is merits no disdain .
She is feisty and public - spirited , and millions of people vibrate like tuning forks to her rhetoric .
When she was suddenly forced to take a walk on the highest wire in America 's political circus , she showed grit .
She also showed that grit is no substitute for seasoning .
She has been subjected to such irrational vituperation -- loathing largely born of snobbery -- she can be forgiven for seeking the balm of adulation from friendly audiences .
America , its luck exhausted , at last has a president from the academic culture , that grating blend of knowingness and unrealism .
But the reaction against this must somewhat please him .
That reaction is populism , a celebration of intellectual ordinariness .
This is not a stance that will strengthen the Republican Party , which recently has become ruinously weak among highly educated whites .
Besides , full - throated populism has not won a national election in 178 years , since Andrew Jackson was re-elected in 1832 .
After William Jennings Bryan 's defeat in 1908 , his third as the Democrats ' presidential nominee , this prototypical populist said he felt like the man who , thrown out of a bar for a third time , dusted himself off and said , " I 'm beginning to think those fellows do n't want me in there . "
In 1992 , Ross Perot , an only - in - America phenomenon -- a billionaire populist -- won 19 percent of the popular vote .
But because of the winner - take - all allocation of electoral votes , he won none of those .
In 1976 , Jimmy Carter -- peanut farmer ; carried his own suitcase , imagine that -- somewhat tapped America 's durable but shallow reservoir of populism .
By 1980 , ordinariness in high office had lost its allure .
In 1968 , George Wallace , promising to toss the briefcases of pointy - headed intellectuals into the Potomac , won 46 electoral votes with 13.5 percent of the popular vote .
He had the populist 's trifecta -- a vivid personality , a regional base and a burning issue .
Actually , he had three such issues -- backlash against the civil rights revolution , social disintegration ( urban riots , rising crime ) and resentment of the progressive projects of Great Society social engineers ( e.g. , forced busing of other people 's children ) .
Populism has had as many incarnations as it has had provocations , but its constant ingredient has been resentment , and hence whininess .
Populism does not wax in tranquil times ; it is a cathartic response to serious problems .
But it always wanes because it never seems serious as a solution .
Political nature abhors a vacuum , which is what often exists for a year or two in a party after it loses a presidential election .
But today 's saturation journalism , mesmerized by presidential politics and ravenous for material , requires a steady stream of political novelties .
In that role , Palin is united with the media in a relationship of mutual loathing .
This is not her fault .
But neither is it her validation .
People in Seattle stick to themselves …
Pete Warden has collected data on 210 million public Facebook profiles and has discovered some patterns that have emerged regarding how Facebook users connect geographically and the results are quite interesting :
How the clusters break down :
It is important to understand how these clusters form and why so that your online efforts are streamlined and you do n’t waste time .
If you ’re in Ohio , investing time into getting in with the Seattle bunch may not quite pay off .
Stayathomia ( which is a great name , by the way ) is defined by these users ’ connections being mostly in the immediate or neighboring cities and sports fan pages rank more highly than religiously based fan pages .
Dixie is clumped together as the “ Old South ” according to Warren , defined by Atlanta as the hub with God as the most commonly fanned pages .
Bonus trivia that Warren notes is that “ for some reason Ashley shows up as a popular name here , but almost nowhere else in the country . ”
Greater Texas centers around Dallas predominantly unlike the previously mentioned clusters and local sports ( Cowboys , Longhorns ) are fanned alongside God , but not far apart .
This area links widely to others within the entire cluster rather than just neighbors .
Mormonia centers around ( duh ) religion with Utah cities and an Idaho area linked together due to “ how interwoven the communities are , and how relatively unlikely they are to have friends outside the region . ”
LDS - related pages are most frequently fanned in this cluster ( and Glenn Beck ) .
Nomadic
West is defined by how even small towns are connected to distant cities , and Warren notes that “ it looks like the inhabitants have done a lot of moving around the county . ”
Interestingly , Starbucks is “ amost always ” the # 1 fan page in this cluster .
Socalistan centers around LA as the hub in a tight cluster just like “ Greater Texas ” and fan pages typically do n’t include God or sports but celebrities like Michael Jackson and Barack Obama .
Pacifica is defined mostly by living in Seattle - it looks like Seattleites are clique - ish in nature although Warren attributes this cluster as lacking travel ( which I do n’t know that I agree with ) .

Dopamine is known to have a " reward " function in the brain Dopamine , a chemical with a key role in setting people 's moods , could have a much wider - ranging impact on their everyday lives , research suggests .
Experiments show that altering levels of the chemical in the brain influences the decisions people make .
One expert said the results showed the relative importance of " gut feeling " over analytical decision making .
The Current Biology study could help understand how expectation of pleasure can go awry , for example in addiction .
It follows previous research by the University College London team , which , using imaging techniques , detected a signal in the brain linked to how much someone enjoyed an experience .
They found that signal could in turn predict the choices a person made .
With the suspicion that the signal was dopamine , the researchers set up a study to test how people make complex decisions when their dopamine system has been tampered with .
The 61 participants were given a list of 80 holiday destinations , from Greece to Thailand , and asked to rate them on a scale of one to six .
Dopamine has a role in signalling the expected pleasure from those possible future events
Tali Sharot
Wellcome Trust Centre for Neuro - imaging
They were then given a sugar pill and asked to imagine themselves in each of 40 of the destinations .
Researchers then administered L - Dopa , a drug used in Parkinson 's disease to increase dopamine concentrations in the brain , before asking them to imagine the other holidays .
They rated all the destinations again , and a day later they were asked where they would prefer to go , out of paired lists of holidays .
The extra dopamine gave people higher expectations when rating holiday options .
And that translated into the choice of trip they made a day later .
Study leader Dr Tali Sharot , from the Wellcome Trust Centre for Neuro - imaging at UCL , said humans made far more complex decisions than other animals , such as what job to take and whether to start a family , and it seemed dopamine played an important part in that .
It is a sort of shortcut in our thinking
Professor John Maule
Leeds University
She said they had been surprised at the strength of the effect they had seen .
" Our results indicate that when we consider alternative options when making real - life decisions , dopamine has a role in signalling the expected pleasure from those possible future events .
" We then use that signal to make our choices . "
Dr Sharot added that addicts overestimated the pleasure they would gain from something , be it heroin or gambling , because their dopamine system was dysfunctional , and the latest research underpinned that the choices they made would be influenced by that .
Gut instinct
She added : " For many conditions we have medication which changes dopamine function , so knowing we may be changing people 's expectations and their decision making might change how we think about giving these types of medications . "
Professor John Maule , an expert in decision making , at Leeds University Business School , said that in recent years people had begun to realise emotional or " gut instinct " decision making was just as important in human choices as analytical decision making .
" At any one time you will have both these processes going on , so it 's not surprising to see these results , especially when it comes to emotionally based decisions , such as holidays .
" It is a sort of shortcut in our thinking . "

U.S. soldier ' waterboarded his own daughter , 4 , because she could n't recite alphabet '
A soldier waterboarded his four - year - old daughter because she was unable to recite her alphabet .
Joshua Tabor admitted to police he had used the CIA torture technique because he was so angry .
As his daughter ' squirmed ' to get away , Tabor said he submerged her face three or four times until the water was lapping around her forehead and jawline .
Tabor , 27 , who had won custody of his daughter only four weeks earlier , admitted choosing the punishment because the girl was terrified of water .

Detainees had water poured over their face until they feared they would drown .
President Barack Obama has since outlawed the practice .
Tabor , a soldier at the Lewis - McChord base in Tacoma , Washington , was arrested after being seen walking around his neighbourhood wearing a Kevlar military helmet and threatening to break windows .
Police discovered the alleged waterboarding when they went to his home in the Tacoma suburb of Yelm and spoke to his girlfriend .
She told them about the alleged torture and the terrified girl was found hiding in a closet , with bruising on her back and scratch marks on her neck and throat .
Asked how she got the bruises , the girl is said to have replied : ' Daddy did it . '
During a police interview Tabor allegedly admitted grabbing his daughter , placing her on the kitchen counter and submerging her face into a bowl of water .
Sergeant Rob Carlson said the punishment was carried out because the girl would not recite the alphabet .
Police have not revealed Tabor 's military service , but his base is home to units that have served in Iraq and Afghanistan .
Tabor has been charged with assault and ordered to remain on his base and have no contact with his daughter or girlfriend , who has not been named .
He is due to appear in court this week .
The girl has been taken into care .
Her natural mother lives in Kansas but Tabor had been granted custody by a court .
Renowned meteorologist Dr. William Gray tells
Newsmax that a possible new conspiracy regarding global warming has been uncovered in the U.S.
He also said environmentalists , socialists , governments and businessmen are trying to take advantage of climate change concerns for their own benefit , and declared that cap - and - trade legislation would do “ very little ” to improve the climate .
Dr. Gray is a pioneer in the science of forecasting hurricanes and a critic of the theory of human - induced global warming .
He is a professor emeritus of atmospheric science at Colorado State University and head of the Tropical Meteorology Project at the university ’s Department of Atmospheric Sciences .
Gray told Newsmax .
TV’s Kathleen Walter about a new report out of San Diego calling into question the accuracy of “ the data that they ’re basing global warming on — that this is the second or third warmest month or year of the last 100 years and that sort of thing .
[ Investigators have ] been digging more and more into the data bases and they ’ve been finding that there are inconsistencies there .
” Manmade global warming proponents in the government “ are handling the data in ways to obtain data that shows the globe is warming more than it really is .
“ They drop certain data out of their averaging , and the data they ’ve dropped out tends to make the globe cooler .
You ’ll probably be reading a lot about this in the next few weeks or so .
” Gray called the new findings “ Climategate U.S.A .
” Climategate refers the scandal that began when hackers penetrated the computers of the Climate Research Unit at the United Kingdom 's University of East Anglia , exposing thousands of e-mails and other documents .
The e-mails suggested that data that did n’t support the global warming theory was being altered or ignored .
With many people suffering through a very harsh winter , reports have surfaced that a mini-ice age is on the way , Walter noted .
She asked Gray : “ What should we believe ?
” He responded : “ I think we should believe that the climate is not changing much .
There ’s not an ice age coming for perhaps many thousands of years .
” The climate moves in decades - long cycles “ that I think are driven a lot by global ocean deep circulation currents , and we ’ve been in kind of a warming trend from the middle 1970s to the turn of the century , ” he continued .
“ From about 1999 on there has n’t been much of a warming trend .
Some reports have shown that the earth is beginning to cool .
But in my view this is natural . . .
“ In the last two or three years we have been seeing around the globe slightly colder winters and I think that ’s an indication that human - induced global warming that ’s so talked about is really not progressing .
” Gray , who has previously called claims of manmade global warming “ the greatest scientific hoax of all time , ” added : “ Humans are probably doing something [ to affect climate ] and the CO2 may be warming [ the globe ] a bit but it ’s not doing near what the alarmists have been telling us — that the Greenland ice cap is going to melt , the sea ice near the North Pole will not be there in another 20 , 30 years .
All these wild claims , there ’s no basis for .
The ice cap is not going to melt in the next 20 , 30 years .
” Walter asked why global warming alarmist Al Gore and his allies refuse to consider any contrary evidence and insist that human - induced global warming is a fact .
“ They want to use this to push other hidden agendas they have , ” Gray said .
“ The environmentalists want to push environmental things and people will become more sensitive to the environment if they think the globe is really warming .
There are socialists who want to push a leveling of living standards around the globe .
There are governments that want to control peoples ’ lives more .
There are businessmen who want to get into the new renewable energy .
They want to make money on this .
“ There ’s a whole set of people out there who do n’t know much about how the atmosphere ticks but see how they can profit from this global warming hypothesis , and they want to convince the world that this is true .
” He also noted that “ those who are advancing global warming get better grants and get well funded by our federal government compared to us who are skeptical .
” Gray declared that there is absolutely no connection between global warming and more frequent and powerful hurricanes , as some alarmists claim .
He also said cap - and - trade legislation restricting C02 emissions , which is supported by President Obama and many Democrats , would do “ very little of significance to improve our climate , and we will pay an enormous economic price for it .
” Cap - and - trade will drive up the price of energy , he added , and “ the standard of living in the Western world will go down .
No one is going to agree to that in the belief that the climate will get slightly better . ”
In January , I spent two weeks with the kids at Ama Ghar , a home for underprivileged children* in Kathmandu Valley .
It 's a narrow four - story red brick building off of a busy two - lane road , and it houses 38 children whose parents are dead or debilitated from physical and mental illness .
Many of them come from remote villages that are a full day's walk from the nearest road ; communities without electricity that have high illiteracy rates .
Materially , the kids at Ama Ghar have little beyond bare necessities .
Their toys are soccer balls made of rubber bands and old car tires .
In the mornings they wash their hair and brush their teeth at a cold water tap outdoors , and after school they play with their half - exploded imitation Mizuno volleyball near the neighbor 's pigsty until the sun goes down .
Most nights , they do their homework under a single solar - powered backup lightbulb because of scheduled electrical outages , before going to sleep in tiny rooms crammed with second - hand bunk beds .
The most surprising thing about these kids , though , is not their living conditions .
It 's their attitude .
These are really good kids .
Generally speaking , they do n't cheat , steal , complain , sneak off , or flake on their chores .
During an eight - hour field trip to a Hindu temple on the other side of the Valley , the children kept tabs on each other without being told to do so , waiting patiently for the adults as they bargained for potatoes on the side of the street .
Not one child complained about being hungry or needing to use the bathroom .
Like a tight - knit family , they hugged each other often and shared everything without selfishness .
The children all studied hard at school , like their lives depended on it — probably because their lives really do depend on it .
As Bonnie Ellison , the resident manager , told me : " It 's not easy out there . "
Hers is the epitome of tough love ; an American who herself grew up in Kathmandu , she is arming them with the skills and attitude they need to survive and thrive in Nepali society .
I left Ama Ghar with the strong conviction that these spirited , bilingual , ambitious kids could very well shape the future of this beautiful , struggling nation .
On my way home to San Francisco , I stopped through Tokyo to visit my parents .
They were moving out of the property our family lived on for 22 years and had a lot of furniture they needed to get rid of .
My mother was delighted when a nearby orphanage agreed to take the fridge and kitchen cabinet as donations .
We made plans to visit the home and meet the director , who offered to give us a short tour .
We were immediately struck by how large the building was — by Tokyo standards , these 40 kids are living in a palace .
The space , the meals , and the children 's allowances ( $ 30 a month for each junior high school kid and $ 55 once they reach high school ) are all funded by the ward .
These kids come here most often as a result of domestic violence , not poverty or the death of a parent .
Currently , there are 30,000 children living in 550 homes like this one across the country , with 3,000 in Tokyo alone .
It 's a big , growing societal problem .
It was late in the afternoon when we visited the facilities , but none of the kids were around .
School uniforms and manga were strewn across the floors of the oversized bedrooms shared by pairs of teenagers .
The director , a gentle , large man with thick glasses , told us apologetically that the kids had dropped off their books and gone back out .
I asked him if they got along with each other , and he sighed .
" All our children have severe social issues , " he said .
" They can't stay in the same room together for more than a few minutes before a fight erupts .
I 've been here for 25 years .
Back in the day , it was indeed like a big family ; the kids used to go on outings together and take care of each other .
But these days , that 's not the case at all . "
I did n't meet many people at the Japanese children 's home .
I saw a couple of teenaged boys sitting around a table playing Nintendo DS , and introduced myself to one chubby 13 - year old boy who wandered up to the director , imitated him for a few sentences , and then told us he could n't wait until he was in high school so he could get a bigger monthly allowance .
One might expect the children in the Tokyo orphanage to be happier than the children in Nepal .
After all , they have cash , video games , washing machines for laundry , and a huge urban playground to goof around in ( the Nepali kids carry no cash , ca n't afford electronics , and wash their own clothes by hand ) .
But the kids in Tokyo are n't happier .
They can't get along with each other , never mind anyone else .
There is no semblance of family life at the Tokyo orphanage .
It felt like a repository for unwanted children .
In many ways , Nepali culture of today closely resembles pre-tech revolution Japan .
The way the aunties at Ama Ghar prepared food in the kitchen or washed clothes in buckets of cold water reminded me of the way my Japanese grandmother went about her daily chores — it 's something about the pacing and the commitment to what may seem like the most menial tasks that made me nostalgic for my childhood .
I see many similarities between Japanese and Nepali culture .
They 're both traditionally patriarchal societies , with heavy Buddhist influences ; children are taught to respect and care for elders , and society as a whole values community over individualism .
But an unfortunate side effect of economic growth was that some of these cultural values have been compromised — if not ignored outright , they have at the very least become marginalized .
At Ama Ghar , the aunties live and sleep in the same rooms as the children .
This type of setup is common in Nepali homes today and was also common in Japanese homes not too many generations ago .
At the orphanage in Tokyo , all staff members go home in the evening , except one night a week when they 're required to supervise the children on rotation .
I believe this makes a big difference in how home - like each of these two places feels to the kids who live there .
( An expert in otaku culture once told me that the reason the imouto — little sister — fetish exists is because some men still crave the type of closeness that used to bond Japanese families together . )
I believe the disintegration of these kinds of long - held values has something to do with the unhappiness the Tokyo orphanage was sheltering .**
I may never know what created the problematic conditions at the Japanese children 's home , but the director 's words about the orphanage being a much brighter place a quarter of a century ago made me sad .
Maybe the Tokyo orphanage could use a values lesson from its own history or from its counterpart in the developing world .
You can make a donation to Ama Ghar , the children 's home in Kathmandu , on the Ama Foundation web site .
* Structurally , it 's a lot like an orphanage , but the Ama Foundation does n't call it that because many of the children still had one or both living parents , and the kids here are not up for adoption .
** After our visit , my mother got a phone call from the director saying that he did n't want our used furniture after all ; they were going to get a charity organization to buy them all - new appliances .
Against Patriarchy : Tools for Men to Further Feminist Revolution *

Every year , I give out Sidney Awards to the best magazine essays of the year .
In an age of zipless , electronic media , the idea is to celebrate ( and provide online links to ) long - form articles that have narrative drive and social impact .
The first rule of the Sidneys is that they cannot go to any article that appeared in The Times .
So David Rohde does not get a Sidney for his unforgettable series on being held captive by the Taliban .
But those pieces possess exactly the virtues that the Sidneys are meant to honor , and they make one proud to be a journalist .
This year , magazines had a powerful effect on the health care debate .
Atul Gawande ’s piece , “ The Cost Conundrum , ” in The New Yorker , was the most influential essay of 2009 , and David Goldhill ’s “ How American Health Care Killed My Father , ” in The Atlantic , explained why the U.S. needs fundamental health reform .
But special recognition should also go to Jonathan Rauch ’s delightful essay , “ Fasten Your Seat Belts 
It ’s Going to Be a Bumpy Flight , ” in The National Journal .
Rauch described what the airline industry would look like if it worked the way the health care industry works .
The piece takes the form of a customer trying to book a flight with a customer service representative .
The customer wants to fly from Washington , D.C. , to Oregon on Oct. 3 , but the airline lady can squeeze him in only in January or February .
He can call each of two dozen other airlines if he wants to check other availability .
Fusion Garage 's JooJoo tablet PC is expected to be in consumer hands by the end of February , when it will likely give some indication as to the pu blic 's interest in tablets such as the Apple iPad .
According to Venture Beat , Fusion Garage CEO Chandra Rathakrishnan says that not only have the preorders for the JooJoo tablet exceeded expectations , but there has been an increase in inquiries since the debut of the iPad - - so it looks like the public may be ready for tablet computers after all ( or , at least , ready to try them out ) .
The JooJoo tablet , which began its life as the TechCrunch CrunchPad , was announced in December 2009 .
The 2.4 - pound touch screen tablet has a 12 - inch , 1366 - by - 768 - pixel display , 1GB of memory , and a 4GB Solid State Drive ( used to store the OS and cache data ) .
It also features a USB 2.0 port , Bluetooth support , built - in speakers , Wi-Fi , and a Webcam with a mic .
The JooJoo tablet also features a fun ( and potentially incredibly annoying ) color - tinted screen -- but do n't worry , the color can be changed .
Instead of custom - built apps , the JooJoo tablet uses the web as its primary platform .
It also supports Flash and reportedly plays 1080 p
Yo utube streaming videos fairly well .
The JooJoo tablet 's price point is close to that of the iPad's , at $ 499 .
While the JooJoo tablet does beat the iPad in a few ways ( notably , multitasking , Flash support , and the webcam / mic combo ) , it also falls short in some pretty major areas .
It has a 4GB SSD , but users cannot directly save files to said drive -- it 's purely an internet tablet .
The problem with this , of course , is that the JooJoo has Wi-Fi and Wi-Fi only -- there is no 3G option , though Fusion Garage is " not ruling out the possibility of 3G in the near future . "
Here 's a tip , guys -- the " near future " had better come pretty soon or people are going to start wondering what the point is of a big Internet - only - device that you can't store music on .
Because the JooJoo tablet uses the Internet as its platform , the lack of an " App Store " is another downside .
Sure , you do n't really need a Facebook app when you can just go to Facebook itself , but the Apple App Store is definitely a benefit of having an Apple product .
Though some are critical of Apple 's extreme vigilance when it comes to apps , recent influxes of malware into other , similar app stores suggest that perhaps Apple is merely being alert .
Not only will JooJoo 's lack of an app store make it harder for users to use the platform , but the openness may leave the JooJoo vulnerable to outside attacks .
The JooJoo tablet is just , quite literally , the internet in your hands ( of course , the iPad is just , quite literally , a giant iPod Touch in your hands ) , but if Rathakrishnan 's report of increased interest in the JooJoo after the announcement of the iPad is true , perhaps there is a big market for tablet PCs , regardless of what they do ( or do n't ) .
The public expression of contempt for professors is one of our cherished national pastimes and is that rare thing — bipartisan .
We need a commander - in - chief , not a law professor , is a Sarah Palin applause line .
Recently on its front page the New York Times invoked “ the classic image of a humanities professor … tweed jacket , pipe , nerdy , longwinded , secular — and liberal ” in a story on a sociological study of the power of typecasting .
And in the annals of egghead bashing , the perennial butt of the foolproof punch line has long been the English professor .
For decades Hollywood has dined out on this stereotype — Dennis Quaid ’s bloated , bleary , and insufferable literature professor in Smart People is only a recent entry in a long parade of fatuity — but the Times has also loyally done its part .
Their reports on the MLA convention are always good for a laugh , with their generous sampling of silly and sex - addled paper titles ( who can forget “ Wandering Genitalia in Late Medieval German Literature and Culture ” ? ) that the Times cited a few years ago as proof that " eggheads are still nerds ” with too much “ sex on their minds ( and time on their hands ) . "
Whether the accusation is justified or not is less the point than the casualness of the contempt , the easy assumption of a license to scorn .
Almost no group is more safely maligned and mocked .
This reflexive ridicule of the professor seems by now a middle - class entitlement , and even its targets are not above enjoying it .
If this means self - humor replaces self - contempt then the development is not unwelcome .
In an indelible scene from her much - discussed essay “ Desperately Seeking Susan , ” a memoir of her rocky friendship with Sontag , Terry Castle , a professor of English at Stanford , is brought by her famous friend to a SoHo loft with the promise of a “ real New York evening . ”
It is a dinner party attended by Lou Reed and Laurie Anderson — “ elfin spikes of hair perfectly gelled ” — and various others , including “ the freakish - looking lead singer from the cult art - pop duo Fischerspooner , ” who wore “ booties and tights , a psychedelic shawl and a thing like a codpiece . ”
Castle finds herself adrift .
“ Yet it would n’t be quite right merely to say that everyone ignored me .
As a non-artist and non-celebrity , I was so ‘ not there , ’ it seemed — so cognitively unassimilable — I was n’t even registered enough to be ignored .
I sat at one end of the table like a piece of antimatter . ”
Sontag ’s brief attempt to introduce her — “ with the soul - destroying words , Terry is an English professor ” — only made things worse : “ I might as well not have been born . ”
Just after coffee , with Sontag oblivious and sleepy in her chair , she exits “ back to the world of the Little People . ”
Castle ’s incisive sociological eye here for status hierarchy and her own place on the bottom rung testifies to her witty , merciless accuracy — one of the pleasures of The Professor and Other Writings , her irresistible new collection of personal essays .
In it no one is left unbesmirched , including Sontag , whom she also reveres , for Castle always insists on the untidy and uncensored response .
Her radical candor makes it hard to enlist her under any ideological or political banner , and this recalcitrance alone gives her book an invaluable civic function .
As is already apparent , Castle partakes of the culture ’s sense of entitled contempt of the “ English professor , ” while also complicating that entitlement .
Her essays turn her painfully won capacity to see herself and the world “ mock - heroically ” into a source of bracing truth - telling that , in turn , becomes an unexpected source of insight into the power of literature , art , and music in shaping a life .
Castle ’s book can be read as a ribald young - girl - from - the - provinces bildungsroman : how a person of “ zero rakish charm , ” socially and physically shy and maladroit , but also , thanks to insatiable book - worming and listening , possessed of an erudite , subtle , and pungent sensibility , made her clumsy way in and out of a raw blue collar world replete with a violently sociopathic step - brother and a pill - popping stepsister .
“ The prissy aesthete in me shuddered even to hear about these step- relations . ”
Like it or not , she had to spend the summer between a three - year fellowship at Harvard ’s Society of Fellows and the start of her Stanford job on a relative ’s “ fold - out couch next to the gun cabinet and the pinball machine . ”
Castle learned mock - heroism the hard way — above all , as the title essay recounts , by surviving a humiliating , scalding , passionate affair as a graduate student with a self - intoxicated , regal , promiscuous female professor — a “ connoisseur , a sensualist , skilled in the arts of homosexual love , ” a wounding eventually and partially healed by abundant reading in eighteenth - century satire .
The books taught that “ [ n] othing was sacred … even the grandest and most imposing monuments might be defaced .
We were all rolling around in the muck . ”
She dove in to join her already filthy teachers — Austen , Pope , Swift .
Inspired by the “ rococo lightness and drollery ” of their tutelage , and of Watteau ’s paintings and Mozart ’s operas , in all “ a deep moral seriousness humming away at the core , ” she accepted the loss of her “ Bambi ” innocence and relished the plain facts of survival : “ I was fat ; I was mean ; but I was alive . ”
There are several cases when you need the position of the mouse pointer on a webpage ( e.g. if you want to display custom tooltips or elements that follow the mouse ) .
The question is , how can you set the position of an element to align to the coordinates of the mouse pointer ?
The answer seems simple , the cross - browser clientX and clientY properties of the event object retrieve the position of the mouse pointer relative to the top - left corner of the browser window 's client area .
Additionally , the position of a fixed positioned element 's top - left corner can be specified with the top and left style properties relative to the top - left corner of the browser window 's client area .
All right , let 's look at a simple example first :
< head > < style > # flying { position : fixed ; } </ style > < script > function UpdateFlyingObj ( event ) { var mouseX = Math .
round ( event . clientX ) ; var mouseY = Math .
round ( event . clientY ) ; var flying
Obj = document .
getElementById ( " flying " ) ; flying Obj .
style .
left = mouseX + " px " ; flying Obj .
style .
top = mouseY + " px " ; } </ script > </ head > < body onmousemove = " UpdateFlyingObj ( event ) ; " > < div style = " height :1000 px ; " >
The flying object also works for document scrolling .
</ div > < img id = " flying " src = " flying.gif " /> </ body >
Unfortunately the previous example does not work in Internet Explorer 7 at non-default zoom levels .
The problem is that the clientX and clientY properties retrieve the position of the mouse in physical pixel size , while in Firefox , Opera , Safari and in Internet Explorer from version 8 they return the position in logical pixel size .
What does it mean ?
the position of the mouse pointer is calculated in the default pixel size in Internet Explorer before version 8 even if the current pixel size in the document is different ,
from Internet Explorer 8 and in Firefox , Opera and Safari , the position is calculated in the current pixel size .
If the browser is not at the normal zoom level ( the user has the ability to zoom in or out a web page : CTRL and + , CTRL and -) ,
For example , if the zoom level is 200 % , the logical pixel size is two times greater than the physical pixel size , so the clientX and clientY properties retrieve two times greater values in Internet Explorer before version 8 than in other browsers for the same mouse position .
In contrast to the clientX and clientY properties , the top and left style properties specify the position in logical pixel size in all browsers .
So if you want to set the position of an element to align to the coordinates of the mouse pointer , you need to known the current zoom level in IE7 .
How can you get the current zoom level in IE7 ?
There are several JavaScript properties and methods that use physical pixel size instead of logical pixel size in IE7 ( such as the clientX and clientY properties of the event object , the clientWidth offsetWidth and offsetHeight properties of the html , the getBoundingClientRect and getClientRects methods ) .
The clientWidth , clientHeight , offsetWidth and offsetHeight properties retrieve the size in physical pixel size only for the html element , for other elements , they contain the size in logical pixel size .
So you can get the width of the body element with the offsetWidth property in logical pixel size and with the getBoundingClientRect method in physical pixel size .
Both values contain the padding , scrollbar , and the border , but exclude the margin .
The current zoom level can be determined with the help of those two values .
This method only works in Internet Explorer before version 8 , the two values are the same in other browsers .
Note that if you need the current zoom level in IE from version 8 , use the deviceXDPI , logicalXDPI , deviceYDPI and logicalYDPI properties .
This example is the same as the previous one , but it also works in Internet Explorer 7 at non-default zoom levels :
< head > < style > # flying { position : fixed ; } </ style > < script > // always return 1 , // except at non-default zoom levels in IE before version 8 function GetZoomFactor ( ) { var factor = 1 ; if ( document .
body .
getBoundingClientRect ) { // rect is only in physical pixel size in IE before version 8 var rect = document .
body . getBoundingClientRect ( ) ; var physicalW = rect .
right - rect .
left ; var logicalW = document .
body .
offsetWidth ; // the zoom level is always an integer percent value factor =
Math .
round ( ( physicalW / logicalW ) * 100 ) / 100 ; } return factor ; } function UpdateFlyingObj ( event ) { var mouseX = event .
clientX ; var mouseY = event .
clientY ; if ( navigator .
appName . toLowerCase ( ) == " microsoft internet explorer " ) { // the clientX and clientY properties include // the left and top borders of the client area mouseX -= document .
documentElement .
clientLeft ; mouseY -= document .
documentElement .
clientTop ; var zoomFactor = GetZoomFactor ( ) ; if ( zoom Factor != 1 ) { // IE 7 at non -default zoom level mouseX = Math .
round ( mouseX / zoomFactor ) ; mouseY = Math .
round ( mouseY / zoomFactor ) ; } } var flying
Obj = document .
getElementById ( " flying " ) ; flying Obj .
style .
left = mouseX + " px " ; flying Obj .
style .
top = mouseY + " px " ; } </ script > </ head > < body onmousemove = " UpdateFlyingObj ( event ) ; " > < div style = " height :1000 px ; " >
The flying object also works for document scrolling .
</ div > < img id = " flying " src = " flying.gif " /> </ body >
The previous two examples do not work in Internet Explorer 6 , since it does not support fixed positioned elements .
If you need an example that works in IE6 , too , please see the pages for the clientX and clientY properties .

It may have seemed inevitable given the mortgage meltdown , but it is still shocking when you drive through a neighborhood that seems to be entirely filled with ‘ For Sale ’ signs .
The cities here are n’t entirely deserted , of course , but they are examples of the cities that have been hit hard enough to lead residents to abandon their homes .
Detroit
Detroit ’s economy has been hit hard in the last six months , with the Big Three automotive producing companies on the brink of bankruptcy and failure , and in need of government assistance .
Due to the manufacturing industry , many experts estimate that the unemployment rate of the Detroit metropolitan area is at a generation - high 21 % .
Not surprising when 14 % of automotive industry workers have been laid off in the last year .
As a result of this highly localized recession , there are over twelve thousand abandoned homes in the Detroit area .
Riverside County , California
The last two decades have seen a surge of growth for the Inland Empire ( better known as Riverside County ) , which had a population of 2.6 million in 1990 ; in 2007 , the population was estimated to be 4.1 million .
This massive eastern exodus from the more urban Los Angeles and the high prices of Orange County had a number of implications for the region .
First of all , the move eastward drove up the demand and development of housing in the area , which steadily increased throughout the past decade .
Secondly , these houses were purchased by many people who wanted to buy bigger homes for the buck than they could get in LA and the OC , which of course led to an increase in speculative building and investing .
It is estimated that in 2005 , only 15 % of area homeowners could actually afford their houses , with the remaining 85 % living beyond their means or in adjustable rate mortgages that had not yet adjusted .
The latter , once adjusted , would then prove to be unaffordable .
It is also important to note that this area was a known hub for building up Southern California ’s rapid suburban sprawl – not only was this one of the state ’s regions with the most expansion , but it was also an area that furnished many of the construction companies with cheap labor that made surrounding communities ’ growth possible .
By August of 2008 alone , the foreclosure rate for the county was over 4,700 houses , up over 174 % from August 2007 .
By the end of 2008 , the median price of a home in Riverside county dropped to $ 220 k , the first time it had dipped under $ 300 k since the 1990s .
In some Riverside County neighborhoods , as many as 20 % of all homes are have been foreclosed and now sit vacant .
source
Stockton , California
Currently , 90 % of all sales in the greater Stockton region are either foreclosures or short sales .
The median house price dropped to $ 237 K by December 08 , the lowest it has been since February 2003 .
It is estimated that housing prices in former boom markets are more than 40 % off what they had been leading up to 2007 .
source
Las Vegas
Las Vegas and its surrounding suburbs are home to the nation ’s third highest foreclosure rate for a metropolitan area , with 1 in 44 at some stage of foreclosure .
By end the end of 2008 , median housing prices deflated by $ 20,000 to the lowest since 2005 .
Housing inventory would also skyrocket to 30,000 in Q3 2008 , with the pace of housing sales having declined 34 % from the year prior .
This volume is equal to 14 - 16 months of inventory of homes for sale , well above the national average of six to seven months .
Just over a year ago , the Greater Las Vegas Board of Realtors calculated that 45 % of the 22,000 single - family houses for sale at the time were actually vacant .
Most all of these were houses abandoned by new area residents , or investment properties by the area ’s thousands of speculators who were drawn to the region because of its recent track record of housing price increases .
Squatters are increasingly seen occupying the abandoned properties .

North Los Angeles County , California
With the vision of urban sprawl connecting Los Angeles to Bakersfield and the plans for a train connecting the two , builders began winding through the hills to the north from LA .
Today , in Antelope Valley , for example , it is not unusual for long - term rental property owners to have to deal with tenants who recently lost their own home to foreclosure and are having difficulty getting back on their feet .
In some cases , tenants do everything from the typical stripping of copper wire to be sold to the more bizarre use of cabinets for firewood .
Abandoned investment properties are on the rise .
source
Miami , Florida
Miami-Dade and neighboring Broward counties have experienced an extremely high rate of foreclosures over the past two years .
It is estimated that 143,000 homes were voluntarily given back to the bank , or foreclosed upon .
In Miami -Dade County alone , there are currently 38,000 new condos that are recently completed , or near - completed that are vacant and show no prospects of immediate sale .
The MLS for the country shows over 25,000 condos for sale in the county , which equate to a 4.5 year inventory .
This of course , does not include unfinished units .
Many experts suggest that the housing market in Miami will witness a further devaluation in 2009 of over 20 % of the median housing price .
The biggest reason for this is arguably the over - development of medium and high - end condo constructions in the area , many of which are second or vacation homes .
It is an extreme case of the common sense knowledge that second homes and investment properties are the most likely to be abandoned in favor of the owners ’ primary residence when times get tight .

Arizona ranks 48th in New Job Creation .
Developers spread to the west to Phoenix and as far out as Buckeye and foreclosures are currently at a record high , which has resulted in plummeting housing prices .
This is a hard pill to swallow for many recent first - time buyers , who are witnessing a sharp increase in their monthly mortgage payments , against the background of a house with a drastically decreasing value .
Of the 6,150 houses sold in the Phoenix metropolitan area in September 2008 , an astounding 78 % of these were vacant when sold .
There are currently 55,000 homes for sale in Phoenix , of which 40 % have been abandoned and are presently vacant .
Most of these are currently bank - owned properties and are being sold at liquidated prices .
According to area investor and resident , Donna Butera , this massive departure and house abandonment in Phoenix has had other implications in the community .
Understandably , home owners are deciding to walk from their mortgages if the home they just agreed to buy for $ 350,000 is now only worth $ 270,000 .
As a result of the frustration , homeowners are removing everything they can from the homes before they abandon them , selling appliances , cupboards and virtually everything else , including the kitchen sink .
As a result , it is not unusual to drive down a street in what was once a nicer suburban neighborhood in Phoenix and now see a majority of windowless abandoned homes .

Astronauts onboard the International Space Station ( ISS ) have a new view of Earth after the space shuttle Endeavour delivered the Tranquility module to the station .
Measuring 15 feet wide by 23 feet long , Tranquility holds some of the station ’s environmental control equipment , such as the system that cleans carbon dioxide from the air , and it also provides living space for exercise equipment and a bathroom .
Tranquility also comes with a cupola , a dome - shaped viewing port made up of seven windows .
Shortly after the shutters were removed from the windows on February 17 , 2010 , Japanese astronaut Soichi Noguchi took the top photo while looking out from the new cupola .
The tan , brown , and orange Sahara Desert is visible through the windows .
On February 19 , an astronaut captured the bottom photo — looking into the cupola on STS - 130 mission commander George Zamka , who was visiting the Space Station ’s “ new wing ” while the shuttle was still docked to the station .
“ The cupola is intended to enhance situational awareness for ISS operations like spacecraft docking , EVAs [ Extra Vehicular Activities , spacewalks ] , and robotic operations , ” says William Stefanov of the Image Science and Analysis Laboratory at Johnson Space Center , a lab set up to help astronauts take pictures of Earth that will be of greatest value to scientists and the public .
Many of those activities require astronauts to control tools and machines remotely while watching their progress on a monitor .
( Imagine trying to mow your lawn with a remote controlled lawnmower and a fixed video camera . )
But while the view out of Tranquility was primarily designed to give astronauts a way to see the outside of the station itself , it also provides a stunning panoramic view of Earth and space .
“ There is no intention to focus astronaut photography of the Earth through the cupola , but it will almost certainly be used for that purpose by crew members , ” says Stefanov .
In an essay published on the Earth Observatory in October 2003 , Astronaut Ed Lu described the experience of seeing the Earth from the International Space Station .
“ When I look out a window that faces straight down , it is actually pretty hard to see the horizon — you need to get your face very close to the window .
So what you see out a window like that is a moving patch of ground ( or water ) , ” he wrote .
” When looking out a sideward facing window , you can see the horizon of the Earth against the black background of space . ”
The cupola will allow astronauts the luxury of both views at once .

Before the recent goal recession , it had already become pretty clear that the Flames were in need of more offense .
They 've been amongst the very worst teams in the league by most offensive measures ever since the initial SH % outburst petered out .
They 're not good at drawing penalties , they rarely score on the PP and they 're bottom of the barrel in the league in terms of getting shots on net .
In addition , pretty much everyone in Calgary 's top 6 is on par for a below average offensive season , with the possible exception of Rene Bourque .
I say " top 6 " even though it 's a misnomer for this club : as many as seven different players ( Moss , Nystrom , Sjostrom , Boyd , Lundmark , Glencross and Conroy ) have auditioned with Iginla with varying degrees of success ( ranging from a bit to none at all ) .
On this team , everyone is a potential top 6 player because , excepting a few notables , no one is .
The cold snap has brought these issues into sharper focus .
Jarome Iginla , with one goal in his last 13 games , looks like he 's swimming against the tide with a boat in his teeth most nights .
His underlying stats are some of the worst of his career .
He 's the very face of franchise , precisely because he looks frustrated to the point of distraction .
Once upon a time , perhaps he could have carried lesser line mates against the big boys singlehanded , but those days have passed .
He needs some help .
This team , one with aspirations towards some measure of post - season success , needs to help him .
The trade deadline is still some forty days away , but for the Flames the impetus is to ramp up the goal scoring ASAP .
Sutter has n't shied from pre-empting the March frenzy in the past ( Conroy , Stuart come to mind ) so anything 's possible I guess .
There are an almost limitless number of hypothetical trade targets for Calgary , but let 's the cull field with some educated assumptions :
1. ) Play - off bound clubs wo n't be dealing top 6 players .
2. ) The Flames only have a strictly limited amount of trade chips ( few draft picks , prospects ) .
With those parameters in mind , let 's take a look at who might be available .
1. ) Paul Kariya
GP G A P +/- PIM PPG SHG GWG GTG SOG PCT 2009 - Paul Kariya 42 9 11 20 - 5 16 3 0 1 0 111 8.1
Formerly one of the best wingers in the league , time and injuries have rendered Kariya a shadow of his former self .
Both his counting stats and underlying numbers are unimpressive and he's an injury risk on top of all that .
He 's still a step up from certain options on the Flames ( say , Nystrom , Lundmark , Sjostrom etc. ) but he 's hardly ideal .
2. ) Keith Tkachuk
GP G A P +/- PIM PPG SHG GWG GTG SOG PCT 2009 - Keith Tkachuk 43 11 16 27 - 1 34 4 0 0 0 81 13.6
Similar to Kariya , Tkachuk is an aging ex-star who has drifted away from his dominant days .
He has an even worse relative corsi rating than Kariya does on the same team and he faces marginally weaker competition .
He also only averages about two shots on net per game .
I 'd pass on the big guy unless he was available for next to free .
3. ) Ray Whitney
GP G A P +/- PIM PPG SHG GWG GTG SOG PCT 2009 - Ray Whitney 46 15 19 34 - 6 18 3 0 3 0 97 15.5
Probably the most oft cited trade target for the Flames is the similarly old , but still effective former Shark .
Whitney has scored 60 + points in each of his last three seasons and is one of Carolina 's offensive leaders again this year .
He faces decent competition for the Hurricanes but is amongst the top 10 in terms of corsi for the club .
His underlying numbers are strong and he 's capable on the power play .
Overall ,
Whitney would be a relatively attractive rental .
He 's 37 , so there would be little chance of the club retaining him next year , plus he has a lot of experience which some consider important .
Of course , with the ' Canes well out of the race , there 's likely to be a number of play - off bound clubs sniffing around after Whitney come the deadline .
4. ) Colby Armstrong
GP G A P +/- PIM PPG SHG GWG GTG SOG PCT 2009 - Colby Armstrong 48 7 9 16 2 43 0 1 1 0 57 12.3
While Kovalchuk will be getting all the attention in March , the Thrashers may also be shopping Colby Armstrong if they find they can't re-sign him either .
The pending free agent does n't have attractive counting stats , but has been a key contributor for Atlanta for several years .
Essentially , Armstrong is the ' anti - Ilya ' : he starts out in his own zone a lot , faces the other teams best players much of the time , but still ends up moving the puck in the right direction .
Armstrong is n't your prototypical scorer .
He 's an effective hockey player , but the Flames immediate needs probably extend beyond his abilities : Calgary does n't simply need someone who can get the puck into the good end of the ice , but someone who can do something with it when it gets there .
That said , I would n't complain if they acquired him ( or signed him this summer ) .
5. ) Alexei Ponikarovsky
GP G A P +/- PIM PPG SHG GWG GTG SOG PCT 2009 - Alexei Ponikarovsky 51 18 15 33 1 36 4 0 1 0 132 13.6
" Poni " is to the Maple Leafs what Rene Bourque is to the Flames - a top - notch all around forward .
Ponikarovsky faces a decent level of competition , has the second best corsi rate on the team ( +19/60 ! ) , the best ESP / 60 rate on the club ( 2.27 ) and he can play on both the PP and PK .
He 's also a 6 ' 4 " , 223 pound guy who can skate .
I consider Ponikarovsky the ideal candidate for the Flames to target .
He 's managed sterling underlying numbers for the last few seasons , is just 29 years old and is the type of guy the team could try to retain next year .
In fact , he 's so good it would stun me if Burke did n't have his name on a new contract come March .
6. ) Alex Tanguay
GP G A P +/- PIM PPG SHG GWG GTG SOG PCT 2009 - Alex Tanguay 48 8 19 27 1 22 3 0 2 0 53 15.1
Darryl Sutter once called Alex Tanguay one of the best left wingers in the league .
At the time , he was right : Tanguay was one of the most efficient producers of even strength points in the NHL .
He was routinely the Flames second best forward at ES when he was here in town behind only Jarome Iginla as well .
That said , things have gone poorly for Alex since he left the Flames - he spent most of the season with the Canadiens nursing a shoulder injury .
This year , he 's felt the wrath of Rick Tocchet in Tampa .
His stats are mediocre across the board , but he has the advantage of history with Jarome .
In addition , his skill set matches Calgary 's needs almost exactly : a sublime passer and effective puck distributor who has a knack for opening up defensive coverage .
I emailed Raw Charge 's John MClellan about Tanguay recently and this was his response :
The entire situation in Tampa is crappy for offense with thanks to what Rich Tocchet preaches and the skill - set of the offensive players that are on the club .
Where Tanguay is a pure passer , where St. Louis and Lecavalier are more finesse and speed ... Tocchet wants grit , " dog the puck " ..
He seems to value tip in shots , deflections and junk goals more than actually using skills .
Would Tampa Bay trade Alex ?
If you ask any casual fan who sees Tanguay 's production and compares it to Vaclav Prospal 's production in New York , they 'll give you a frustrated " Yes , he 's worthless ! "
For someone like me who sees a bigger issue in Tampa , I 'd sooner hold on to him and change other things with the Lightning .
But the fact is , right now , the Lightning are a lower - middle club and moving pieces to acquire more assets will be more likely than re-signing free agents to be .
So Alex likely will be available by the deadline ( if Tocchet is n't replaced by then ) .
Now what would the Lightning want in return ?
That 's subjective .
They are rebuilding the club in an image that is their own .
While Brian Lawton has already rebuilt the defense in part , he will be looking to acquire more guys on the other side of the blue line to thicken things out .
While Poni might be the best player available , Tanguay might be the most ideal in terms of circumstances .
He 's not valued by the coach , so even if the Bolts think they have a shot at the post - season , there 's little chance they 'll keep him around .
John asserts above that the Lightning may want a defender in return ( the one thing the Flames have plenty of at every level of the organization ) and they may want to get rid of him sooner rather than later considering their on - going financial issues .
The Flames do n't have the assets to go big game hunting this trade deadline , so the group above is likely as good as it'll get for Sutter .
He 's got no first or second rounder next season and no Matthew Lombardi to dangle as a trade chip .
He 'll have to find a pretty friendly trading partner to make a deal , which may very well take any or all of these targets out of the picture , depending on how much demand ramps up post -Olympics .
I 'm imagine he 's already begun to work the phones in earnest .
SAN JOSE , Calif. -- Quick postgame update following the Detroit Red Wings ' 4 - 2 victory against San Jose on Tuesday night :
Niklas Kronwall tweaked his left knee in the first period and did not play in the third period .
He will not play Wednesday at Anaheim , Red Wings coach Mike Babcock said .
Babcock also said the injury has nothing to do with Kronwall 's knee , saying the defenseman hurt his ankle while getting slew footed .
Others , however , said Kronwall hurt his knee .
It 's the same knee he injured Nov. 21 on a knee - on - knee check from Montreal 's Georges Laraque and hurt again in a collision with Pittsburgh 's Jordan Staal on Sunday .
Also , Babcock would n't reveal who will start in goal against the Ducks .

March 2 , 2006  --
A Colorado school is in upheaval following the suspension of a teacher who was recorded comparing President Bush 's rhetoric to that of Adolf Hitler .
More than 100 students at Overland High School in Aurora , Colo. , walked out of class this morning to protest the decision to put geography teacher Jay Bennish on administrative leave .
The school administration made the move after a student went public with a 20 - minute recording of Bennish 's comments to his class .
In the tape , the teacher is heard saying there were similarities between remarks Bush made in his State of the Union address and " things that Adolf Hitler used to say . "
Superintendent Monte Moses told ABC
News affiliate KMGH -TV that policy calls for both sides of an issue to be presented to students .
He said Bennish 's presentation appeared unbalanced .
Sophomore Takes Recording to Radio Station
The recording was made by 16 - year - old sophomore Sean Allen the day after the president 's speech .
Allen said he had been disturbed by " political rants " he heard in Bennish 's class .
" So these kids are going to have notes on why George Bush is related to Hitler and why the state of Israel was founded on violence and terrorism , " Allen told KHOW Radio Wednesday when he went public with his tape .
" These kids are going to have notes on this and accept that as fact . "
On the tape , Bennish , who has taught in the Colorado district for five years , is heard quoting part of the State of the Union address : " It is our duty as Americans to use the military to go out in the world and make the world like us . "
Bennish continues : " Sounds a lot like what Adolph Hilter used to say . "
" We do want teachers to express their opinions , but to put that in context and to provide opposing points of view , " Moses said .
" All discussion must be fair and balanced . "
" [ The suspension ] is not a disciplinary action .
It is to give us enough time to sit down and gather all the facts , " said Moses .
Tustin Amole , a Cherry Creek School District spokeswoman , told KMGH that an investigation of the incident would take about a week .
