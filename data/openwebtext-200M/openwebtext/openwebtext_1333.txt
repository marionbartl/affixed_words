Carrying the Republican War on Science to previously unplumbed depths of human stupidity , Kevin " Dow 36000 " Hassett of the American Enterprise Institute calls for the USAF to bomb both France and Switzerland , hoping to get the scientists in their tunnels before they can destroy the earth :
Atom Smasher Exposes Hole in Earth ’s Defenses : The Large Hadron Collider ... consumes about the same amount of energy as a large city ... could provide evidence of the existence of the Higgs boson , a hypothesized particle that has become known as the God particle .
If it is found to exist , it could complete our understanding of the basic laws of the universe ....
[ T ]he collider ’s energy could induce a catastrophic event .
A brilliant review of the risks associated with the experiment by University of North Dakota law professor Eric Johnson ....
The chief threat is that the LHC ’s high - energy collisions might create a microscopic black hole that would , perhaps over a few years , swallow the Earth ....
One paper even suggested that something with the energy level of the LHC might generate one black hole per second .
With its initial safety argument under assault , the physics community turned to an alternative .
Even if a black hole were created , this new argument went , it would be tiny and would evaporate harmlessly .
This was consistent with a theory of physicist Stephen Hawking .
The evaporation argument was widely viewed as sound , and the LHC continued on track .
But later , some top scholars began to publish papers questioning the evaporation hypothesis .
The issue is far from decided .
So the physics community retreated to what originally seemed like a terrific point :
High - energy cosmic rays constantly bombard Earth and collide with particles in the atmosphere .
If those collisions were going to create a black hole , then Earth would already be gone .
It turns out that this argument , too , is a loser .
When a cosmic ray rocketing toward Earth collides with a particle , the result of the collision would most likely be blasted into space .
That means a black hole created by such a collision might be well beyond our galaxy before it is large enough to harm anything .
In the LHC , by contrast , the result of collisions between two particle beams might stay put and cause significant trouble ....
Oxford University ’s Toby Ord , a philosopher by training , adds ... [ i] t may be that the models that we use to make predictions about the possibility of catastrophe are themselves flawed ....
Ord estimates that the odds of the LHC producing a disaster are between one in 1,000 and one in 1 million ... the likely benefits from this experiment ... [ cannot ] ... justify accepting a cost that includes a real risk of the Earth ’s destruction ....
As science progresses , the possibility climbs ever higher that the fondest dreams of scientists might entail risks of planetary destruction ....
The best science explores things far from our understanding .
How can we know that things we do not understand will not kill us ?
Right now ... [ if ] the U.S. wanted to stop the LHC experiment , it would have no recourse short of military action ...
Following President Obama ’s announcement on Tuesday of a short - term troop surge in Afghanistan , an emotional Michael Moore told CNN ’s Larry King , “ I feel very bad for him . ”
“ I feel even worse for our troops , ” Moore went on , blinking back tears .
“ And I feel a real sadness for the parents of those soldiers .of ours over the next eighteen months who will not come back home . ”

“ Our own CIA says there ’s less than a hundred al Qaeda in Afghanistan , ” Moore explained .
“ What are we doing in Afghanistan ?
This is absolutely insane . …
We have been in this war for twice as long now as the US was in World War II . …
We ’re going to have 100,000 troops there to find these killers — who are n’t even there ! ”
Moore has been begging the president over the last week not to escalate the war in Afghanistan , writing at his own website , “ If you go to West Point tomorrow night … and announce that you are increasing , rather than withdrawing , the troops in Afghanistan , you are the new war president . …
With just one speech tomorrow night you will turn a multitude of young people who were the backbone of your campaign into disillusioned cynics .
You will teach them what they ’ve always heard is true — that all politicians are alike .
I simply ca n’t believe you ’re about to do what they say you are going to do .
Please say it is n’t so . ”
“ I hate to be even saying these things , ” Moore told King in conclusion , “ because I honestly think Barack Obama is a good and decent man .
He has a good heart .
I believe he ’s a man of peace . …
I do n’t think there ’s any evil or dark place in his heart that ’s where this is coming from .
I just think that he ’s listened to the generals .
He ’s taken bad advice . ”

This year is set to be the fifth warmest on record , says the Met Office
The first decade of this century is " by far " the warmest since instrumental records began , say the UK Met Office and World Meteorological Organization .
Their analyses also show that 2009 will almost certainly be the fifth warmest in the 160 - year record .
Burgeoning El Nino conditions , adding to man-made greenhouse warming , have pushed 2009 into the " top 10 " years .
The US space agency Nasa suggests that a new global temperature record will be set " in the next one or two years " .
World Meteorological Organization ( WMO ) and Met Office scientists have been giving details of the new analysis at the UN climate summit in Copenhagen .
The WMO said global temperatures were 0.44C ( 0.79 F ) above the long - term average .
" We 've seen above average temperatures in most continents , and only in North America were there conditions that were cooler than average , " said WMO secretary - general Michel Jarraud .
" We are in a warming trend - we have no doubt about it . "
Mr Jarraud emphasised that the final analysis would not be complete until early next year ; but the UN agency always issues a summary during the annual climate negotiations in order that delegates have the latest information .
The WMO uses three temperature sets - one from the UK Met Office and the University of East Anglia 's Climatic Research Unit ( CRU ) , and two from the US , maintained by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration ( Noaa ) and the space agency Nasa .
Asked whether the controversy surrounding e-mails hacked from CRU could have any bearing on the results , Mr Jarraud replied that all three datasets showed the same result .
Vicky Pope from the UK Met Office made the same point : " The datasets are all independent , and they all show warming , " she said .
Global warming : A future glimpse The Met Office figures indicate that the years since 2000 - the " noughties " - were on average about 0.18C ( 0.32 F ) warmer than years in the 1990s ; and that since the 1970s , each decade has seen an increase of about the same scale .
Although the Met Office has 1998 as the single warmest year , that coincided with strong El Nino conditions - the warming of surface waters in the eastern Pacific that releases heat stored in the deep ocean into the atmosphere , raising temperatures globally .
Now , after a period of La Nina conditions which depressed temperatures in 2008 , another El Nino is developing ; and it is this , combined with greenhouse warming , that is pushing temperatures upwards again , according to Dr Pope .
She declined to give a forecast for the next few years - the Met Office is releasing that later during this summit .
But Nasa 's GISTEMP unit - the division of the agency that maintains the temperature dataset - suggests further warming is coming , with the temperature record for an individual year likely to be set within the next year or two .

Other researchers , though , believe it more likely that temperatures will remain stable for up to a decade as other natural cycles keep the ocean 's surface relatively cool , with rapid warming likely after that .
Climate " sceptics " have claimed that temperatures have not been rising over the last decade .
Of the two widely - used global temperature records , one - the UK HadCRUT3 record - shows an apparent plateau from 1998 to 2008 .
But climate scientists point out that this result is achieved by taking 1998 as the starting point .
Taking , for instance , 1997 or 1999 as the starting point , they argue , produces a different result .
Free release
In a separate move , the Met Office has released data from more than 1,000 weather stations that make up the global land surface temperature records .

Glossary in full
The decision to make the information available is the latest consequence of the hacked e-mails affair .
" This subset release will continue the policy of putting as much of the station temperature record as possible into the public domain , " said the agency 's statement .
" As soon as we have all permissions in place we will release the remaining station records - around 5,000 in total - that make up the full land temperature record .
" We are dependent on international approvals to enable this final step and cannot guarantee that we will get permission from all data owners . "
Mr Jarraud said that weather agencies belonging to the WMO had agreed in 1995 that they would , in general , make data " essential for the protection of life and property " freely available .
But some agencies did not release all their data , he said .
" But whether they all release or not will not alter what we are saying , because the vast majority is already open . "

The hardest talks over the weekend were probably taking place inside Mr. O’Brien ’s camp , which is facing three options : stay , even though the show ’s staff feels increasingly unwanted at NBC ; look for an offer elsewhere , most likely the Fox network , which has let out broad hints that it would be interested in starting its own late - night franchise with Mr. O’Brien ; or walk away and get into a probable legal battle over whether NBC breached Mr. O’Brien ’s contract by making this change .
So far , Mr. O’Brien and his representatives have steered clear of commenting on their plans .
But one issue that will be at the center of any negotiation over the host ’s future is whether his contract is still valid because NBC will still call his program “ The Tonight Show . ”
Mr. Gaspin would not discuss contracts , but he said what was important to Mr. Leno was the opportunity to tell “ jokes at 11:30 p.m. ” and what was important to Mr. O’Brien was keeping the “ Tonight ” franchise .
In private comments from Mr. O’Brien ’s side , however , keeping that title is more likely part of NBC ’s legal maneuvering than a vital interest of the host , who is said to be upset with the moves .
Last week , Mr. Gaspin described Mr. O’Brien as “ courteous , gracious and professional ” in discussing the planned changes .
He said the same of Mr. Leno , who , speaking with reporters in Vancouver , British Columbia , in an appearance there Saturday night , said he was basically on board with the shift  even though his show would be reduced to a half - hour .
CONCORD , N.H. — First the Old Man , now the Big Wind .
New Hampshire 's Mount Washington has lost its distinction as the site of the fastest wind gust ever recorded on Earth , officials at the Mount Washington Observatory said Tuesday .
The concession came three days after the World Meteorological Organization posted a snippet on its
Web site saying a panel of experts reviewing extreme weather and climate data turned up a 253 mph gust on Australia 's Barrow Island during Cyclone Olivia in 1996 .
That tops the 231 mph record set atop Mount Washington on April 12 , 1934 .
" It 's obviously a big disappointment .
Having the world record for over six decades was such a part of the soul of this organization and for fans of Mount Washington around the country , " said Scot Henley , the observatory 's executive director .
The official title at issue is " highest wind gust ever recorded on the surface of the Earth by means of an anemometer . "
But to most people in New Hampshire , it was simply " the Big Wind , " a source of pride in a state that also revered its Old Man of the Mountain , a rock outcropping that appeared to be a man 's profile and was featured on the state 's quarter .
The Old Man crumbled to bits in 2003 , seven years after the wind record apparently toppled .
Henley stressed that Mount Washington still holds the record for the Northern and Western hemispheres , and said it still can claim to be home to some of the world 's worst weather given the combination of bitter cold , snow , wind and freezing fog it frequently experiences .
" So the work continues up there , and we 'll be ready for the next one , " he said .
No one noticed the new record gust at the time , Henley said .
" Somehow it fell through the cracks and the Australians did n't think it was a big deal , " he said .
" We hear that , and it kinds of blows our minds , but of course , we 're weather fans and we 're tuned into that sort of thing . "
Henley first heard about the meteorological organization 's conclusion Monday , when someone posted a link to the item on the observatory 's forum .
He contacted the organization and learned that the information was part of a report being presented at an international conference in Turkey next month .
The panel of experts has shared its research with observatory officials , who plan to review it in the coming weeks .
" There 's no reason to believe it 's not accurate , but we owe it to this institution and to our state and really to weather fans all over the world to make sure it is indeed accurate , " he said .
The Mount Washington Observatory is a private , non-profit organization that maintains a weather station at the summit of the 6,288 - foot mountain .
On April 12 , 1934 , there were three crew members , two guests , three cats and five kittens at the observatory , according to observer Alex McKenzie , who later wrote a book about the Big Wind .
According to his account , April 11 started with a brilliant sunrise , but the weather soon turned cloudy .
By evening , fog obscured the summit and rime ice formed up to a foot thick .
Early the next morning , when observer Wendell Stephenson headed outside to clear ice from the anemometer , the wind knocked him flat on his back as he opened the door .
When he accidentally dropped the club he was using to break up the ice , it went flying off into the fog .
Gusts were at 150 mph .
" I dropped all other activities and concentrated on observations .
Everyone in the house was ' mobilized ' as during a war attack and assigned a job , " observer Sal Pagliuca wrote in a log book .
Gusts grew stronger through the afternoon , until 1:21 p.m. , when the 231 mph gust was recorded .
" Many people have wanted to know what we did after that , " McKenzie wrote .
" Did we cheer or open a bottle of champagne , or what ?
Well , we did n't do anything special for a while , except make more measurements . "
Mary Stampone , assistant professor of geography at the University of New Hampshire and the New Hampshire State Climatologist , said she had long expected the record to fall .
" As we improve our technology in terms of instrumentation , and we 're observing in more locations , we were bound to pick up on something , " she said .

Healthy levels of vitamin D may help patients with a certain type of non-Hodgkin 's lymphoma live longer .
Researchers at the Mayo Clinic have discovered that patients with diffuse large B - cell lymphoma ( DLBCL ) and low vitamin D levels are two times more likely to die from the cancer than patients with optimal levels .
Deficient vitamin D levels also increased the chances of cancer progression .
" These are some of the strongest findings yet between vitamin D and cancer outcome , " Matthew Drake , MD , PhD , an endocrinologist at Mayo Clinic in Rochester , Minn. , says in a news release .
" While these findings are very provocative , they are preliminary and need to be validated in other studies .
However , they raise the issue of whether vitamin D supplementation might aid in treatment for this malignancy . "
Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma is a cancer of the white blood cells .
DLBCL is the most common type of non-Hodgkin 's lymphoma .
The fast - growing cancer usually occurs in adults .
The new findings are based on a study of 374 patients who were newly diagnosed with DLBCL .
Blood testing showed that half of them had a vitamin D deficiency .
Vitamin D deficiency was defined in this study as less than 25 nanogram / milliliter of total vitamin D in the blood .
Those with deficient vitamin D levels were 1.5 times more likely to have the cancer progress , and had a twofold increase in the risk for dying .
The findings add credence to the growing body of evidence that suggests vitamin D plays an important role in cancer risk and survival .
But the American diet usually does n't provide enough vitamin D. Few foods and drinks naturally contain the vitamin , although some , such as milk , cereals , and certain brands of orange juice , are fortified with it .
The body 's greatest supply of vitamin D comes from the sun .
The body makes vitamin D after direct exposure to the sun 's UV rays .
One cause of vitamin D deficiency is limited exposure to sunlight .
" The exact roles that vitamin D might play in the initiation or progression of cancer is unknown , but we do know that the vitamin plays a role in regulation of cell growth and death , among other processes important in limiting cancer , " Drake says .
The study team will present their results this week at the 51st annual meeting of the American Society of Hematology in New Orleans .

" I thought the real hard part was going to be the selling , " says Tom Michaels , thought to be the only man in America who earns a living selling black Périgord truffles that he 's cultivated himself .
" They sell themselves . "
His personal life is n't bad , either .
Michaels 's house , that of a divorced man devoid of domestic skills , looks at best like a college dorm room .
" Besides being a slob , I 'm not organized , " he concedes , when I mention that most everything he owns is teetering in piles .
On the occasions that his girlfriend , Vicki Blizzard , drives over from Knoxville , Tennessee , she finds it all just fine .
" Tom 's house is wonderful .
He 's got that backyard , that view .
So what if it 's not as pristine as mine .
I 'm comfortable there . "
That 's two treasures , a tolerant woman as well as a ready crop of black truffles , one of the most expensive edibles on earth .
Long considered a mainstay of French haute cuisine , Tuber melanosporum , a.k.a. the black Périgord truffle , has not always been rare , but it has always been prized .
Black truffles are identified with the culture of French dining , and for good reason , although they were used much earlier by the Greeks and the Romans .
Great thinkers among those ancients believed they were formed by thunderclaps , although Plutarch , the wisest of all , declared them to be mud cooked by lightning .
Over the years , they have been eaten to gain strength in battle , to cure gout , and of course , as an aphrodisiac .
Until about now , truffles were not part of Tennessee folklore , and they certainly do n't figure into the region 's culinary traditions .
" Most people around here , " Michaels points out , " they want to know if you put gravy on truffles . "
He does n't claim that his tastes are more refined than those of his neighbors , is n't trying to put himself or his Ph.D. in plant pathology on a pedestal , but he does enjoy his truffles chopped up and stirred into eggs , which is somewhat highbrow .
On the other hand , he also admires them shaved over grits .
To win the heart of Blizzard , he prepared truffled cheesy chicken breasts .
The black truffle found in Périgord and Provence , and now Chuckey , Tennessee , has dozens of fungal relatives , some of them used in cooking , a few of them not bad at all , none of them its equal in beauty or bouquet .
Once cleaned , the black Périgord truffle glitters .
Cut open , the veins resemble mica .
( When they are cooked , the marbling disappears . )
Although the truffle possesses a pleasant crunch , it is treasured not so much for its taste or appearance but for its aroma , which has been likened to bedsheets after a night of abandon , slatterns who disdain to bathe , all that is dark and alluring about the human body and soul .
In the middle of the winter growing season , they can be fruity and floral .
Later , they become muskier .
Michaels remembers handing out samples at a festival , his truffles incorporated into a mushroom - truffle cappuccino : " When I 'd be shaving a truffle that was musky , the women , their eyes would roll back .
If it was the fruity kind , it was nice but not as high a level of ecstasy .
When I talk to women chefs , they seem to like the earthy ones , too , the real ripe ones .
I swear there is a gender thing here . "
THE WINTER OF OUR DISCONTENT
By Joe Kress

It is fitting that a snow storm launched President Obama ’s visit to Copenhagen to mediate the warming of the climate debate and transfer billions of America ’s taxpayer money to third world countries .
He left at the commencement of a snow storm of monumental intensity as it enveloped Washington , D.C. Man and false science have joined hands to replace the creator ’s handy - work and the snow storm was appropriate for such an auspicious meeting which turned out to be a snow job of equal intensity .
In the absence of the “ Leader for Change ” and his entourage of secret service agents , several attendants , writers , advisors and major media sycophants using Air Force 1 and other support jet aircraft to haul several vehicles to support one of his many unnecessary trips .
He was absent when the rogue led majority composed of staunch advocates for socialism decided to ignore the Constitution .
Majority Leader Reid in the Senate , and Speaker of the House Pelosi , both advocates for world government and International Socialism , used strong - arm tactics reminiscent of Stalin to force through Senate Bill S 313 .
They rushed it to conclude by a predetermined date the execution of the orders of their traveling messiah .
The dead - line was December 25 , 2009 for passage of a 2,000 page health care bill previously stuck in the senate finance committee for a final vote .
Significantly , the celebrated date of the birth of Jesus Christ , there developed a massive snow storm that could be interpreted to be delicate flakes of frozen tears born of sorrow for the American people who are to give up their freedom in favor of socialism and eventually Godless communism .
Government by outlaw is to end all determinant of our democratic republic and consequently usher in its death knell .
The usurpation of the Constitution was accomplished by not permitting the 2,000 pages of the bill to be read by the Republican minority until just a few hours before requiring the vote to be taken .
If this procedure does not violet the Constitution , what does ?
In it , on page 1027 , future congresses are to be prohibited from amending major parts of the bill .
Forced payment for health care is imposed on not only the highest taxpayers , but the middle class to be collected immediately before the bill actually goes into full effect in 2013 .
This is advance in payments is supposed to help lower the estimated $ 3.4 trillion dollars that will be added to the enormous debt already incurred by the Obama Administration to cover the cost of medical care for everybody including illegal aliens and their children who were born in this country .
Unions are exempted from paying the increases , a special exemption .
Small Business is to be forced to carry insurance on employees which will either reduce wages or force out of business .
An annual fine of $ 750 is imposed for each employee not covered which means the cost of the fine is less than the cost to cover the medical insurance .

The rumor that Senate Bill S.2099 would require that gun owners would be required to list their guns on their 2009 1040D Federal Tax Form , pay huge fines and imprisonment and in addition pay a one - time fifty dollars fee for each weapon in one ’s possession is false .
But Senator Jack Reed of Rhode Island introduced a bill , February 24 , 2000 that was called the Hand Gun and Registration Act of , 2000 with similar propositions .
It only had two other sponsors and failed to get out of committee .
This demonstrates that as early as the year 2000 gun grabbers were in the Senate , but compared to today , the entire Democrat body was willing to sell out the country to further what can only be described as a copy of a failed social welfare experiment in every country that uses it .
Each winter , there is a migration of patients from Canada and from Europe to the United States to receive treatment that in their own countries require too long a waiting period or refusal to treat heart , kidney and hip replacements because of the age of the patients or because the patient is too young and not productive in their new age society .
Bribery by the senate leadership , urged on by the messiah TO FORCE THE BILL THROUGH BY ANY MEANS resulted in closed door meetings of the Democrat majority in the Senate .
Later , the truth was revealed that the trading of perks and funds to benefit hold - out senators within the secret meetings , where Republicans were denied the right to participate , resulted in another Constitutional violation of the right for open deliberation .
The meeting consisted of trading perks for the hold out senators with nothing less than bribery to reach the magic 60 Democrat majority vote to bring the matter to the floor for a vote by the entire senate body .
This most certainly is a violation of the Constitution where some states receive benefits that other states do not enjoy .
Bribery is the name of the game in Washington , not unlike the Roman Senate prior to the collapse of that empire .
The Republican former representative Henry Hide , a member of the Council on Foreign relations , stated as fact that the Constitution of the United States is an outdated document only appropriate for historical archiving .
Naively , the public discounted that remark at the time it was made in the well of the House of Representatives as a statement from just an old man ready for retirement .
Today , we now see before our eyes in the 2009 Congress a rampant diminishment of the U.S. Constitution aided on by the partisan 9th Court of Appeals of California .
The weakening of our founding father ’s legacy really began when Teddy Roosevelt decided to be involved in world economies and misadventures involving wars and treaties .
In 1904 , as president , he launched our country on the road to internationalism when he negotiated the Treaty of Portsmouth , September 5 , 1905 , and the defeated Russians recognized Japan as the dominant power in Korea and turned over the leases of Port Author and the Liaotung Peninsula , as well as the southern half of Sakhalin Island , to Japan .
Both warring powers agreed to restore Manchuria to China .
For his involvement as the negotiator , Roosevelt was awarded the Noble Peace Prize in 1906 .
The result of the treaty ended with Japan entering the 20th century as a world recognized imperial power and the United States as an international player in world politics .
The finance to support the new , powerful Japanese Navy came from the central bankers of Europe and the United States .
But Teddy chose not to run for a second term and left politics for just a short time when he conflicted with President Taft ’s policies , although he previously supported Taft winning the first campaign for election to the office of the president .
At the end of Taft ’s first term his campaign for winning the next inauguration had a glitch even though it then appeared that the Republican president was a shoe - in to be reelected .
Teddy , an internationalist , where Taft was not , formed the Bull Moose Party that split the Republican majority and allowed Woodrow Wilson , the tool of international bankers to become the next U.S. president and he approved the banker ’s dream by placing the central banks in charge of the nation ’s money supply ( The Federal Reserve Act of 1913 ) and also the Federal Income Tax law .

At that point in our nation ’s history , the United States of America openly changed course .
On advice by Teddy , the Republican , and Edward House , Wilson ’s closest advisor , both joined Wilson , the Democrat .
in waging war against the Germans at the behest of the British who were losing the war .
Paul Warburg of the Warburg major central banking family in Germany left for the United States and became an American Citizen .
He coalesced in the issue of War bonds by the Federal Reserve with marketing of Liberty Loans and procurement of capital for the infant war industries which he chaired .
He was one of the bankers who met at Jekyll Island in 1910 to plan the Federal Reserve System and was one of the first members of the Federal Reserve Board of Trustees .
The key operator within the Wilson administration was the wealthy Edward House , a representative of the Rothschilds ’ Bank of England as well as their central banks in France and Germany .
House was one of the members attending the Jekyll Island meeting ostensibly representing the political interest of the yet to be elected Wilson era , but in reality he was the agent of the most powerful of the central bankers , the Rothschilds .
Wilson was a very sick man at the end of 1920 and unable to attend the negotiations of how to divide up Germany and its former territories , so Edward House , his most trusted right hand man was his representative sent to be a part of the negotiations .
From it , the League of Nations was formed whose intent was meant to weaken the sovereignty of those members belonging to the League .
Fortunately , the nation was represented by a senate more loyal to the United States than the one we are enduring today .
They voted to pull out of the League .
In 1921 , Edward House then became the first Chairman of the Council on Foreign Relations ( CFR ) whose purpose is to create a new world order .
Today , many in the CFR hold key positions as chairmen of committees both House and Senate ; key cabinet members ; members are within the highest ranks of our military ; and members are at important decision levels of departments throughout the government , including all but three of the U.S. presidents are / were CFR members , with one , Gerald Ford , belonging to the Bilderberg Group , the secret conclave that meets with world leaders , their representatives , the leading bankers and members of the controlled media who then send their recommendations to the CFR for implementation .
Not until the advent of Teddy ’s cousin , Franklin Roosevelt , did the influence of those who dreamed of a one world government , free trade and a single monetary system , run by an all powerful Federal Reserve , which is not federal and has no backed reserves .
The nation ’s central bank has now grown so powerful that congress turned over its authority of the purse to this Central Bank of “ Amerika ” ( The Federal Reserve ) , the single purpose of its being is to satisfy a corrupted congress led by a socialist president ( messiah ) .
The Secretary of the Treasury is nothing more than a puppet of the FED .
Thus the present administration uses its reckless spending to usher in the concept of international socialism where everyone is equal except the special few who will dole out benefits to an exploding population of illegal - immigrants and an increasingly number of despondent , unemployed mendicants who will become willing contributors to the final collapse .
Afterward , there emergences a welfare state similar to what existed in the Soviet Union and its KGB nomenkultura who shall control dissidents with an iron fist , trials with predetermined verdicts by party members handing out sentences of life in a Gulag or more merciful , a bullet in the back of the head .
We the people for a better union , need prayer and guts , which I perceive is removed because of the indoctrination provided by the far left ’s control of public schooling , those most liberal publishers of undermining text books and too many college , Marxist professors .
At graduation time , the majority of students , in the past , have been trained in a concept of a one fits all , yet not to understand the subjects incorporated in the “ No Child Left Behind ” dictum by President George W. Bush .
Only recently , has the concept that not all students are college material and need technical schooling , but first , children must not be passed on at graduation unable to read or write a complete sentence as was so often the case with Latino legal and illegal residents and many black pupils .
The “ new ” concept is now early labeling those more suited to be trained in skills rather than higher education .
This concept , brought on by Otto von Bismarck , Chancellor of Germany in 1846 - 1890 , is one whereby an elite class ( the Junkers of Prussia ) would lead and save Germany because of their concept of powerful government the majority of the population serve in a capacity whatever the state wishes it to be .
One thing for sure , whatever evolves in our future , there is meant to be a big brother to insure that the general populace will receive the “ proper ” indoctrination either the one for dummying it down so that loyalty to one ’s country will never be tolerated and the other , to form education to make the underclass tools of the state to meet the demands of the state with a rigid system of selectivity that has for generations existed in Europe .
The line was drawn with + ten exams and unfortunately , the late bloomers fate is sealed for their lifetimes .

This is not but my theory alone , but one that before our eyes is being played out .
But with most of these common diseases , the tests have so far identified genetic variants that account for only a small percentage of the risk .
This is in contrast to simple diseases , most of them rare , where a single gene is the cause and the disease has a clear family pedigree .
The failure has left biologists puzzled about the missing heritability , which some have jokingly attributed to “ dark matter ” within the human genome , an analogy with the dark matter invoked by cosmologists to explain the missing mass of the universe .
Some experts believe the missing risk might be carried in a large number of rare DNA variants not included in current scans of patients ’ genomes .
Because it costs too much to decode all three billion units of DNA in a patient ’s genome , biologists use chips that scan just the 500,000 sites where variation is most common .
These sites were expected to explain the genetic component of common diseases like cancer or schizophrenia , but mostly do not do so .
Another explanation is that the missing heritability lies in aspects of cell biology that are not yet understood .
Decode scientists have found one such instance .
They report in Friday ’s Nature that a DNA variant increases a person ’s risk of Type 2 diabetes by 30 percent if inherited from the father , but reduces the risk by 10 percent if comes from the mother .
One of the principal aims of the current health care legislation is to improve the quality of care .
According to the President and his advisers , this should be done through science .
The administration ’s stimulus package already devoted more than a billion dollars to “ comparative effectiveness research , ” meaning , in the President ’s words , evaluating “ what works and what does n’t ” in the diagnosis and treatment of patients .
But comparative research on effectiveness is only part of the strategy to improve care .
A second science has captured the imagination of policymakers in the White House : behavioral economics .
This field attempts to explain pitfalls in reasoning and judgment that cause people to make apparently wrong decisions ; its adherents believe in policies that protect against unsound clinical choices .
But there is a schism between presidential advisers in their thinking over whether legislation should be coercive , aggressively pushing doctors and patients to do what the government defines as best , or whether it should be respectful of their own autonomy in making decisions .
The President and Congress appear to be of two minds .
How this difference is resolved will profoundly shape the culture of health care in America .
The field of behavioral economics is rooted in the seminal work of Amos Tversky and Daniel Kahneman begun some three decades ago .
Drawing on data from their experiments on how people process information , particularly numerical data , these psychologists challenged the prevailing notion that the economic decisions we make are rational .
We are , they wrote , prone to incorrectly weigh initial numbers , draw conclusions from single cases rather than a wide range of data , and integrate irrelevant information into our analysis .
Such biases can lead us astray .
The infusion of behavioral economics into public policy is championed by Cass Sunstein , a respected professor of law and longtime friend of President Obama ; he is now in the White House , overseeing regulatory affairs , and will have an important voice in codifying the details of any bill that is passed .
In Nudge : Improving Decisions About Health , Wealth , and Happiness , Sunstein and Richard Thaler , a professor of behavioral science and economics at the University of Chicago , propose that people called “ choice architects ” should redesign our social structures to protect against the incompetencies of the human mind .

Those who understand thinking better can make life better for us all .
Thaler and Sunstein build on behavioral economic research that reveals inertia to be a powerful element in how we act .
Most people , they argue , will choose the “ default option ” — i.e. , they will follow a particular course of action that is presented to them instead of making an effort to find an alternative or opt out .
Further , they write ,
These behavioral tendencies toward doing nothing will be re- inforced if the default option comes with some implicit or explicit suggestion that it represents the normal or even the recommended course of action .
Sunstein and Thaler propose to use default options …

The Formula One Teams ' Association ( FOTA ) has approved the membership applications of the Lotus and Manor teams , AUTOSPORT can reveal , meaning the organisation now features every team on the grid .
FOTA 's executive committee met earlier this week for its latest discussions about the future of F1 , and on the agenda was the ratification of the applications of the two new F1 teams .
Sources have confirmed that both Lotus and Manor 's membership was approved unanimously , meaning that the outfits follow fellow new entrants Campos Meta and Team US F1 into the organisation .
The move means that FOTA is now made up of 14 teams - with Toyota still members for now despite its pull - out - and significantly it is the first time since Williams was temporarily suspended in May that the body features every team on the grid .
FOTA 's executive committee also confirmed that elections for new chairmen will take place next month , with the mandate of both current chief Luca di Montezemolo , plus vice - chairman John Howett , coming to a finish at the end of the year .
Work is also continuing on plans for a common car launch next year , which the teams are considering doing prior to the first official test of the season in February .
It is understood FOTA representatives met with Bernie Ecclestone and F1 shareholders CVC following this week 's meeting to discuss the concept - which is being considered to help reduce costs further .
The issue of the final grid slot was also discussed at the meeting , but there is unlikely to be any final decision about what happens with either Toyota or BMW - Sauber until after the F1 Commission and World Motor Sport Council meetings that take place in Monaco early next month .
The Electronic Frontier Foundation this morning is issuing a call to arms regarding what it calls a " loophole " in ' Net neutrality regulations being proposed by the Federal Communications Commission .
Today marks the FCC 's deadline for initial public comment on that proposal .
( 2010's 25 Geekiest 25th Anniversaries )
The organization has established a special Web page -- Real Net Neutrality -- designed to collect signatures on a letter urging the FCC to reconsider and eliminate language that would require ISPs " to act as copyright cops . "
An EFF e-mail received here reads :
Tell the FCC : Do n't let Hollywood hijack the Internet
Last fall , the Federal Communications Commission proposed rules for " Net Neutrality " - a set of regulations intended to help innovation and free speech continue to thrive on the Internet .
Buried in the FCC 's rules is a deeply problematic loophole .
Open Internet principles , the FCC writes , " do not ... apply to activities such as the unlawful distribution of copyrighted works . "
For years , the entertainment industry has used that innocent - sounding phrase - " unlawful distribution of copyrighted works " - to pressure Internet service providers around the world to act as copyright cops - to surveil the Internet for supposed copyright violations , and then censor or punish the accused users .
From the beginning , a central goal of the Net Neutrality movement has been to prevent corporations from interfering with the Internet in this way - so why does the FCC 's version of Net Neutrality specifically allow them to do so ?
Should you agree with EFF 's position and want your voice to be heard , here 's the content of the letter you 'll be asked to sign :
To the Federal Communications Commission : Your October 22 , 2009 , Notice of Proposed Rulemaking seeks to create an exception from network neutrality and open Internet principles to allow ISPs to block or filter content which they suspect might be copyright - infringing .
I believe this exception would be damaging to lawful fair use , free speech and innovation on the Internet , and that it should be removed .
EFF 's full comments to the FCC can be read here .
If you 're itching to read the actual FCC document , you can find it here .
The FCC will be accepting initial comments on the proposed regulations through today and replies to those comments until March 5 .
Electronic Frontiers Australia have posted their authoritative condemnation of the Australian government 's plan to impose mandatory , national filtering on the Australian Internet ( like the filters used in Iran , Syria , China , and other repressive regimes ) .
EFA points out that this national censorship plan will do little to curb child pornography and crime ( because people who seek out that sort of thing can always get around filters ) , but it will give unaccountable government bureaucrats the power to secretly and arbitrarily hide information from Australians .
An announcement on Tuesday confirms it : next year , all Australian ISPs will be required to filter access to a government - supplied blacklist containing " refused classification " ( RC ) web content .
That would include nasty stuff like child pornography , but also a broader range of content : fetishy sex , instruction in crime ( such as euthanasia ) , any computer game not suitable for under 18s .
The list will be partly generated by complaints from the public , and may include lists imported from overseas police departments .
While this is sold as a kid- friendly measure , to " improve safety of the internet for families " , it 's clearly nothing of the sort .
A few thousand URLs hardly constitutes a national net nanny .
The list would almost be laughable if it was not only mandatory but secret – unlike censorship decisions made in other media , blocked URLs will remain secret and expressly excluded from freedom of information requests .
Just as worrying is the fact that once this list is in , a conga - line of special interests will be approaching the government to have their pet peeves added to the list .
It 's not much of a stretch to imagine AFACT ( Australian Federation Against Copyright Theft ) clamouring to have bittorrent trackers added , and several parliamentarians are on record calling for a ban on pro-anorexia sites and pornography in general .
Nikki L. sent in images of an article titled “ Are You Turning Your Boyfriend into a Girlie Man ? ” from the February 2010 issues of Cosmo .
Nikki says ,
The article discusses how many women are treating their boyfriends like their girlfriends , making them go shopping , do yoga , and eat vegan food .
It says the gender roles are being blurred , and that ’s a good thing up to a point .
The article says that eventually your man will push you away and resent you for making him girlie .
It gives a list of things your man shouldnt be doing , as it might damage his masculinity …
The first page :
Notice the subtitle in red and the text below it :
First , why would you want to act like your BF or husband is one of the girls anyway ?
Your pull to do girlie things with him stems from experiences with your female friends .
“ Women are intimate with their close friends , we share everything , ” says JoAnn Magdoff , PhD …
Yes .
Why on earth would you want to recreate that type of relationship with a guy ?
Who wants to be intimate , emotionally close , and share everything with their partner ?
Yuck !
Here are some things you do not want your boyfriend / husband to do :
Just to reiterate : men cannot care too much about their personal appearance .
They cannot try to eat healthily , or be vegetarian / vegan .
If they ’re gonna cook , they better not try to keep from burning their hands by wearing items specifically designed for that task .
Sissies !
The article also provides a list of “ manly date ideas ” you can do with your guy to avoid turning him into one of the girls :
That ’s just … stupid !
It ’s stupid !
Gah !
It ’s such a ridiculous division of the world into the stereotypically masculine and the stereotypically feminine with policing to remind us that men must never be feminine .
Ever !
And women , stop emasculating men !
Men like meat !
And pizza !
Girls like chef salads without eggs , bacon , or cheese in them .
Men like dogs !
Women like cats .
Have you ever known a woman who liked dogs ?
As if !
Men like walking in the park and the beach .
Except in movies where walking on the beach is portrayed as all annoyingly mushy and romantic , something men do because women like that sort of thing .
I ’m also pretty sure if his favorite video game turns out to be Bejeweled , that goes up on the list of things you never wanna see .

Used to be , with GNOME it was simple to have multiple wallpapers configured so that each desktop would have its own wallpaper .
But then Compiz came along and monkeyed with that option .
But that option is n't completely gone .
You can still set it up , at the cost of desktop icons , with a little bit of configuration .
But why would you want multiple desktop wallpaper ?
It seems like nothing more than aesthetics ?
To many that is true - but for some power users it can make it quite obvious what desktop is for what job .
I am one of those users that prefers to work with multiple desktops .
It just makes work so much more efficient .
But when you 're using Compiz ( and why should n't you be ? )
Setting up multiple wallpapers is n't as simple as adding a new wallpaper to your existing configuration .
In this tutorial you will see just how to set up Compiz to work with multiple wallpaper .
Assumptions
The first of these assumptions is that you have Compiz working and the CompizConfig Settings Manager installed .
The second assumption is that you are using the GNOME desktop environment ( for this article I am using GNOME 2.28.1 .
The final assumption is that you have no need for desktop icons .
With that out of the way , let 's get to the configurations necessary .
Compiz
The first configuration is in the CCSM tool .
You will find this tool in the System > Preferences > CompizConfig Settings Manager .
When you fire up that tool enter " wallpaper " in the search field .
The Wallpaper settings is listing under Utility .
When you see it listed click on it to open up the options .
As you can see ( in Figure 1 ) there are only two sections to configure .
The first is to click the checkbox to enable the Wallpaper for Compiz .
The second is to add Wallpaper (s ) by clicking the New button , navigating to where you have your images saved , selecting your wallpaper , select your Fill Type ( do you want the image centered , scaled , etc ) , and click Close .
When you have that done you can close out CCSM .
If you check you will still see only one wallpaper .
What gives ?
You 're not done .
Now it 's time to fire up another tool - gconf - editor .
Gconf-editor
Hit < Alt > F2 and type gconf - editor to open up this tool .
You need to navigate to Apps > Nautilus > Preferences ( see Figure 2 ) .
Scroll down until you see the show_desktop entry .
If that checkbox is checked , uncheck it and close the tool .
Now check your desktop .
How many wallpapers do you see ?
As many as you added in CCSM ?
That should be the case .
Hopefully you can see ( in Figure 3 ) the two different wallpapers I have added to my desktop .
Of course I also have a few other features enabled in Compiz , but you get the idea .
Do n't forget to remember how many workspaces you have enabled .
Although you do n't have to add as many wallpapers as you have workspaces , you do n't want to add more wallpapers than you have workspaces .
Final thoughts
I hope you can see how this little addition can make work a little easier .
Create a specific wallpaper for administrative work , put it on a specific workspace , and only do your admin work there .
It 's subtle , but effective .

Martin St. Louis was on an 11 - game point streak before last night 's loss to the Panthers .
He did n't want you to talk about it .
He himself did n't want to talk about it .
Why question success , right ?
Especially during a season when success has been so fleeting for the former Hart Trophy winner .
The conversation should n't be in a " Marty 's back " aspect though with his recent production .
The conversation should be about what is different with St. Louis this season that has limited his scoring so greatly ?
What 's changed that the perennial 20 + goal scorer was on the worst goal - scoring pace since he joined the Lightning ?
Where goes St. Louis , so goes the Lightning .
It 's the truism that has followed the Bolts for better part of 8 years .
This is n't an attempt at putting the entirety of the Lightning 's success or failures on the back of # 26 as - so - much using Marty as a barometer of part of the problems ( and potential solution ) for the club .
There are two different incidents in the previous two games that highlight a change in attack from St. Louis .
Two different incidents that show two different sides of Marty 's game , and how things have changed .
Lets go back to Tuesday night 's victory against the Washington Capitals where St. Louis scored his latest goal -- number 12 on the season ...
It was nothing sexy , a shot from the top of the lower face - off circle , but it was on - net and that 's what matters ...
Even a little deception could be thought of in this instance because of the attackers in the zone .
One fast feeding pass and St. Louis nails one into the open part of the net .
But now lets jump forward in time to Thursday night 's game against the Panthers and a classic St. Louis situation in a forced parameter : Marty , one on one with a goalie .
The " forced parameter " being a penalty - shot attempt , where Martin has struggled ...
Solid save by Tomas Vokoun , Marty denied again .
Ho-hum , what 's the big deal ?
You can't net 'em all , you know ?
Riddle me this though , why is Marty going at net so tentatively ?
So slowly ?
One of the most troubling aspects goaltender face with Martin St. Louis is the fact Marty is quick .
Agile .
Deft .
His speed and reaction time is part of why he is so hard to defend .
He 's as good a play maker as you can find in the NHL .
You want proof ?
Lets take a look back over the years ( via YouTube ) at some of Marty 's previous work - short handed , even strength , it 's all mixed in on this Top Ten video :
Not only is speed and deftness an integral part of the St. Louis attack , but there is a fearlessness that has him crashing the crease or working intimately around the net .
That seems to be missing this season .
The brakes have been applied .
But why ?
There was an incident in Tampa Bay 's loss to Buffalo last week that stood out with me , it outright pained me when I watched the replay .
Ryan Malone and St. Louis going in , two - on - one , on Ryan Miller as the Lightning were down by two in the 3rd .
It 's the fact Marty peels off and Malone goes in one - on - one with ( likely Veinza Trophy winner and likely Hart Trophy candidate ) Ryan Miller that unnerves me .
St. Louis , as well as Lecavalier , Stamkos , Tanguay and even Malone knows that throwing a goalie off - balance is the way to get an open net to shoot on .
Two forwards , going in on Miller , and St. Louis peels off to play the support role ?
It 's not a question of heart , it 's not a question of skill , it 's not a question of " does he still have it " that should be asked .
It 's a question of what St. Louis has had requested of himself from coaching that has changed his game .
My partner here at Raw Charge , Cassie McClellan , described on of the faults of the situation as thus :
...it's not Tocchet discouraging Marty 's speed , just encouraging Marty to go from goal scorer to more of a supporting role and mentor for Stamkos .
When your coach is encouraging you to be more of a mentor than an on-ice leader , you start wondering what 's wrong with you to make him think that .
Confidence also plays into that as well .
Vinny Lecavalier 's sort of in the same boat .
He 's transitioned more from scorer into captain - which is also Tocchet 's fault since he 's making Vinny focus more on his leadership skills than his goal scoring abilities .
He 's not playing as selfishly as he once was , but trying more to set up teammates instead .
He 's thinking team first , not me first .
Which is why he has a greater assists to goals ratio than he ever has in his career .
The idea that St. Louis has been asked to play more of the supporting role holds water when you look at how things play out -- on the power play , at even strength ...
You 're more likely to see Marty shooting from the perimeter with a man in the crease ( Malone , most of the time ) to redirect the shot than see Marty crashing the crease .
You 're more likely to see St. Louis passing off ( to Stamkos on most occasions ) than taking the puck to net .
And the saddest aspect is that you 're more likely to see Marty hold up on a break - out to allow line - mates to catch up to him so he can set up Stamkos , Malone or another player .
Often this falls apart in the fact that St. Louis , immobile and waiting , is easier to defend against .
The fact Marty 's not being asked to finish -- to go to the net and beat the opposing goalie -- plays into the fact he can't score on the shootout or on a penalty - shot .
It reminds distinctively of 2000 when Marty was transitioning from 3rd - line / 4th - line Calgary Flames castoff to a scoring wing again .
Fans could spot his skill , and all wondered what he could become if he could just finish .
One can look at things as Marty " taking one for the team " by playing the support role and doing the best he can instead of scoring , but where Marty goes - so goes the Lightning .
And where this team is goes is often lost , as the majority of the roster fights to figure out how best to fill the role that 's been asked of them .

A Tale of Male Bias and Feminist Denial

ABSTRACT : Today the modern Darwinian theory of evolution is the unifying theory within the biological sciences .
A consideration of its implications for feminism is , however , impossible without a critical evaluation of its history of male bias .
The aim of this article is therefore threefold .
First , to explain what sexual selection entails .
Second , to discuss male bias in and feminist reactions to Darwinian theory in general and sexual selection theory in particular .
Third , to demonstrate that it would be a loss for feminism to keep rejecting an evolutionary framework if we want to understand the roots of gender difference .
This article is informed by a Darwinian feminist perspective .
KEY WORDS evolutionary biology - feminism - gender difference - history of science
… the sexes in each species of beings compared upon the same plane , from the lowest to the highest , are always true equivalents - equals but not identicals in development and in relative amounts of all normal force .
This is an hypothesis which must be decided upon the simple basis of fact .
( Blackwell , 1976 [ 1875 ] :11 )
There can be little doubt that Charles Darwin 's theorizing on the sexes was constrained by his Victorian world view .
As Antoinette Blackwell , the first ( evolutionist ) woman to publish a critique of Darwin 's view of the sexes argued , the precise relationship between the sexes should be decided upon the basis of fact , not upon the basis of social prejudice or ideology .
It took , however , more than a century for Blackwell 's hypothesis to be seriously tested .
It is , then , not entirely without reason that many feminists have judged an evolutionary account of the psychosexual differences between men and women to be sexist .
But although this negative reaction may be understandable , I want to show that feminism throws away a valuable tool for understanding sexism in denouncing an evolutionary approach to the human mind .
MISGUIDED CRITIQUES OF DARWINISM
Feminist critiques of Darwinian theory have focused mainly on the aspect of sexual selection , but some feminists have gone further by pointing to the congruence between Darwinian theory , with its focus on competition , and the capitalist values of upper- class Victorian England ( Bleier , 1985 ; Haraway , 1991 ; Hubbard , 1997 ; Rose 2000 ; Rosser , 1992 ; Segal , 1999 ) .
The crucial point is , however , whether evolution by selection can provide a scientific explanation for the phenomena it purports to explain , irrespective of Darwin 's sources of inspiration .
And it can .
The fundamental processes underlying it have been observed many times in the laboratory and in the field , and have never been countered by a single study or finding .
The theory has those characteristics that scientists seek in a scientific theory : it organizes known facts about organic life , it leads to new predictions , and it provides guidance to important domains of scientific enquiry ( Buss , 1999 ) .
Evolution by natural selection is a firmly established scientific theory , which cannot in the least be undermined by linking it to capitalism or to other value systems .
A comparable strategy of discrediting Darwinism is equating Darwinian theory with social Darwinism ( Bleier , 1985 ) .
The difference between the two , however , is huge .
Darwinian theory is a scientific theory which tries to explain how the natural world works .
Social Darwinism is an ideological doctrine which tries to justify social inequality , and has less to do with Darwinian theory than some people seem to think .
Its leading theorist , Herbert Spencer , proclaimed that progress is inherent in evolution , something which Darwin did not agree with .
Spencer believed that competition between organisms causes adaptations , which are subsequently inherited by the organism 's offspring .
The core of his ideas was Lamarckian , not Darwinian , so strictly speaking the term ' social Darwinism ' is not correct ( Braeckman , 2001 ) .
Better would be ' social Spencerism ' .
Social Darwinists held that social inequalities between the sexes , or between classes or ethnic groups , represent the operation of natural selection and therefore should not be tampered with , since this would impede the progress of the species ( Hrdy , 1999a ) .
VICTORIAN PREJUDICE IN SEXUAL SELECTION THEORY
Darwin was prejudiced , however , in his view of women and female animals in general , as his theory of sexual selection makes clear .
In The Descent of Man and Selection in Relation to Sex ( 1998 [ 1871 ] ) , he defined sexual selection as selection caused by the reproductive competition between members of the same sex and species .
As he observed , in most species with sexual reproduction , members of one sex , usually the males , compete between themselves for mating access to the other sex .
They do this by way of threats , combats and weapons such as antlers and strong muscles , but also by showing off with beautiful colours , elaborate songs , or specific behaviours .
Darwin posited sexual selection as a way to account for many conspicuous physical and behavioural traits in males .
These traits are so energy demanding and so likely to make the animal vulnerable to predators , that natural selection would have normally selected them away in an early evolutionary stage .
According to Darwin , the reason this did not happen is female choosiness : male ornamentation and competition for females evolved because females prefer to mate with the strongest and best - ornamented males .
Female choice thus influences the course of evolution : the chosen males will have a greater reproductive success relative to the unsuccessful ones .
Over evolutionary time , their traits will spread through the population ( Darwin , 1998 [ 1871 ] ) .
The ' prize ' of the winners in the sexual contest is thus not survival , but leaving more offspring .
Although Darwin's view of females was quite narrow , the agency that he conferred to them , however slight it may have been when compared to current theorizing on sexual selection , was in fact revolutionary at the time .
His evolutionist contemporaries could not accept it , since females were assumed to be passive in the mating process ( Buss , 1994 ; Cronin , 1994 ; Gowaty , 1992 ) .
Reaction against the theory went so far that after Darwin 's death it was almost completely forgotten .
Only in the 1970s would scientists gradually come to accept the profound importance of female choice in the animal world , and only in the 1980s would they begin to document within our own species the active strategies that women pursue in choosing and competing for mates ( Buss , 1994 ; Hrdy , 1999a ; Miller , 2001 ) .
Although it has taken some time , current evolutionary theorizing has finally become fairly gender balanced .
Female choice has become much more active , and female choice and male - male behavioural contests are seen as just two of the mechanisms of sexual selection .
Male choice of mates , female - female competition , forced copulation and aggressive conditioning of female behaviour are among the other ones ( Buss , 1994 , 2000 ; Cronin , 1994 ; Geary , 1999 ; Gowaty , 1992 , 1997 ; Hrdy , 1997 , 1999a , 1999 b ; Mesnick , 1997 ; Miller , 2001 ; Shields and Shields , 1983 ; Smuts , 1995 , 1996 ; Thornhill and Palmer , 2000 ; Thornhill and Thornhill , 1983 ) .
Although Darwin attributed a far more important evolutionary role to females than evolutionary biologists would do for almost a century after him , he clearly did not succeed in separating his scientific attitude from his social prejudices :
… the male is the more active member in the courtship of the sexes .
The female , on the other hand , with the rarest exceptions , is less eager than the male ….
she is coy , and may often be seen endeavouring for a long time to escape from the male ….
the female , though comparatively passive , generally exerts some choice and accepts one male in preference to others … .
The exertion of some choice on the part of the female seems a law almost as general as the eagerness of the male .
( Darwin , 1998 : 229-230 )
Man is more courageous , pugnacious and energetic than woman , and has a more inventive genius .
( Darwin , 1898 : 576-577 )
The chief distinction in the intellectual powers of the two sexes is shown by man 's attaining to a higher eminence , in whatever he takes up , than can woman - whether requiring deep thought , reason , or imagination , or merely the use of the senses and hands .
( Darwin , 1898 : 584 )
There is a contradiction at the heart of Darwin 's view of females : they exert a sexual choice and are passive at the same time .
He seemed caught between the Victorian wisdom about women and his own observations .
Darwinian feminists differ in their interpretation of this inconsistency ( Gowaty , 1992 ; Hrdy , 1997 ; Liesen , 1995 ) .
I tend to concur with Patricia Gowaty , who thinks that to Darwin female choice was as important as male - male competition .
Pondering the neglect of female preferences after Darwin 's death , she adds : ' I consider the long - standing theoretical primacy of male - male competition to be one of the most potentially misleading notions in evolutionary biology ' ( Gowaty , 1992 : 229 ) .
Even today the term ' coy ' has not entirely disappeared from evolutionary writings .
What is inappropriate about it ?
For one thing , it is plainly wrong .
During the past three decades , research has revealed that the females of most species are anything but passive or sexually coy .
Through their mate choices , they direct the course of evolutionary change - at least to the extent that their choice is not thwarted by males ( Birkhead , 2000 ; Fedigan , 1997 ; Gowaty , 1997 ; Hrdy 1997 , 1999a , 1999 b ; Mesnick , 1997 ; Smuts , 1995 , 1996 ) .
A primary causal factor in this greater attention to female interests and strategies was the rise of women in the field of animal behaviour .
Because of them , new questions were being asked and new answers given .
Yet the females of most sexually reproducing species are more discriminating than males about mating .
There is a huge difference , however , between ' coy ' and ' discriminating ' : the former is not a value - neutral term .
It is laden with sex - linked cultural meanings and as such does not belong within a scientific vocabulary .
As Helena Cronin notes :
I can't resist wondering what words would be used if the sex - roles were reversed .
Would a ( male ) investor or business executive be called coy for not rushing headlong into the first option ?
If males were choosy about mates , would they be ' coy ' - or discriminating , judicious , responsible , prudent , discerning ?
( And , by the way , would females be ' eager ' - or would they be wanton , frivolous , wayward , brazen ? )
( Cronin , 1994 : 248 )
ANTOINETTE BLACKWELL : THE ROAD NOT TAKEN
Antoinette Blackwell was the first woman to publish a critique of The Descent of Man , four years after its publication .
Darwin , she argued in The Sexes Throughout Nature ( 1976 [ 1875 ] ) , had not given enough attention to the role of females in natural and sexual selection .
As she writes : ' With great wealth of detail , he [ Darwin ] has illustrated his theory of how the male has probably acquired additional masculine characters ; but he seems never to have thought of looking to see whether or not the females had developed equivalent feminine characters ' ( Blackwell , 1976:16 ) .
She knows that , as a woman , she will be considered presumptuous for criticizing evolutionary theory , but she sees no alternative :
Only a woman can approach the subject from a feminine standpoint ; and there are none but beginners among us in this class of investigations .
However great the disadvantages under which we are placed , these will never be lessened by waiting .
( Blackwell , 1976:22 )
Blackwell thus identifies Darwin 's limited perspective as a male observer as one of the main problems of the theory of sexual selection .
For all male secondary sexual characteristics that Darwin describes , there are equally important corresponding traits in females , she stresses .
The net effect of the complementations leads to sexual equality .
Her view of the sexes was , as was Darwin's , influenced by Victorian values , but it was less superficial than his when it came to women .
The precise character of these complementary characteristics is advanced more as a hypothesis .
As she says , ' The facts need careful investigation ' ( Blackwell , 1976:128 ) .
Blackwell thus writes in a scientific spirit , thinking logically , weighing the evidence .
Although part of her ideas turn out to be ill - founded , such as her Lamarckian - Spencerian belief in the progress of evolution , her reasoning was methodologically sound .
It is a great pity , therefore , that her critique was not heard and that , as Hrdy ( 1999a:13 ) writes , ' Her contribution to evolutionary biology can be summed up with one phrase : the road not taken . '
This turning point left a chasm between feminism and evolutionary biology still not bridged .
In evolution , Blackwell finds a basis for demanding more freedom for women :
Evolution has given and is still giving to woman an increasing complexity of development which cannot find a legitimate field for the exercise of all its powers within the household .
There is a broader , not a higher , life outside , which she is compelled to enter , taking some share also in its responsibilities .
( Blackwell , 1976:135 )
As Blackwell was probably the first to show , evolutionary knowledge can be used in a liberating way , to argue for social equality between the sexes .
As to the question of the relationship between evolutionary knowledge and politics , I want to stress that no direct inference can be made from facts to values , from nature to ethics and politics .
It seems , however , that in order to make efficient political decisions , knowledge of human nature , that is , of human needs and propensities , is indispensable .
Indeed , a political ideology is always implicitly or explicitly informed by a view of human nature , even if that view holds that it is the nature of humans to have no nature .
There is thus an indirect link between human nature and politics .
Reading feminist accounts of Blackwell 's critique , however , one is struck - again - by the authors ' inability to distinguish between the scientific and the ideological character of a theory .
Sue Rosser mentions Blackwell , Alfred Russel Wallace and Darwin himself , as persons raising doubts about some key points of the theory of sexual selection .
' Why , then , one wonders , did Darwin insist on the theory so much ? ' , she asks , concluding that it must have been for ideological reasons :
In order to make the differentiation between males and females as strong as possible , the theory of sexual selection is needed .
The theory is the agent of differentiation , that which assures an ever - increasing separation between the sexes and their operation in two quite distinct realms that only touch for the purpose of procreation .
( Rosser , 1992:58 )
Would Rosser from the resistance against female choice also infer that Darwin insisted on it only for ideological reasons ?
It is a strange kind of logic to conclude that , because a scientist has troubles with some aspects of his theory , he should reject it , and that if he does not do so , this means that the whole theory is an ideological construct .
Anne Fausto - Sterling 's ( 1997 ) account is a comparable one .
She describes with admiration Blackwell 's chiding of Darwin , and especially her conclusion that evolution dictates that men should prepare the food .
Subsequently she cites Eliza Gamble , another Victorian female writer who criticized Darwin .
In her book The Evolution of Woman : An Inquiry into the Dogma of her Inferiority to Man ( 1893 ) , Gamble argued that evolution proved female superiority .
Fausto - Sterling detects traces of Victorian values in Gamble 's work , but for the rest she does not seem to have any trouble with the kind of inferences Blackwell and Gamble make on the basis of evolutionary theory .
Although she definitely condemns any sociobiological approach to humans ( ' the entire process strikes me as misguided at best , socially pernicious at worst ' , [ Fausto - Sterling , 1997:48 ] ) , not one word of criticism is uttered when women use the theory to their own purposes .
She calls it ' tactics ' ( Fausto - Sterling , 1997:46 ) .
One wonders how this kind of inconsistency within feminist theorizing can ever be constructive .
If a theory is bad science , why not make it better science , instead of rejecting the whole of it as an ideological construct , but still making use of it when it suits one down to the ground ?

I just can't possibly tell you emphatically enough , if you 're approached by police , DO NOT ATTEMPT TO EAT YOUR STASH
It 's just chilling to watch this young man struggle for his life .
The tasing certainly did n’t help either , but I 'm not ready to join the ranks of commenters I 've seen around the web who are calling this a murder .
From what I can see , the officers did as they were trained and it's just a shame that police are now encouraged to zap anyone who struggles with them .
It 's unclear to me whether the tasing contributed to the choking and / or whether some of Grande 's resistance was caused by his inability to breathe .
What is clear as day , however , is that Andrew Grande would still be alive today if it were n't a crime to possess marijuana .
As long as police continue to arrest and criminally charge marijuana users , there will be no end to tragedies like this one .
It may be easy for some to blame Grande 's panic - induced actions for his death , but that 's only half the story .
If fear of our drug laws leads people to take such risks , then there is something wrong with our drug laws .
The leaders of the war on drugs are constantly claiming that they are only trying to help people like Andrew Grande .
The drug czar upon taking office exclaimed , " we 're not at war with people in this country , " and he might even genuinely believe that to be true .
But such assurances are worthless as long as people are so intimidated that they 'd sooner risk choking to death than receive the sort of " help " our drug policy is known for .
Pacquiao and promotor Bob Arum met for two hours Friday to discuss the proposed deal , according to Pacquiao adviser Michael Koncz , who told The Associated Press that " Manny has some additional requirements , requests , which Arum did n't think was a problem .
" The requests of Manny were so realistic that Arum does n't feel it's a problem and it's pretty much a done deal , " Koncz said .
Later Friday it became a done deal , at least on the Pacquiao side , when he signed the paperwork , the source said .
Mayweather had previously agreed to terms with Golden Boy Promotions , his promoter for the HBO PPV fight , but it was unclear if he had signed a contract .
The source also disclosed other aspects of the fight , which will take place at the welterweight limit of 147 pounds for Pacquiao 's title and match the top two fighters in the world , pound - for - pound .
The camps agreed to a 50 - 50 split of the money , which could be gargantuan .
Many experts expect the fight to eclipse the all - time pay - per - view record for sales , which is the 2.44 million buys generated by Mayweather 's 2007 victory against Oscar De La Hoya .
Both fighters will wear 8 - ounce gloves but each fighter will be allowed to select the brand of gloves he will wear for the fight .
For promotional purposes , the bout will be referred to as Mayweather - Pacquiao , but Top Rank will receive first billing over Golden Boy throughout the promotion .
However , instead of a full - scale media tour , there will only be a single press conference in New York during the second week of January .
With the schedule compressed because of the March 13 date for the fight , rather than May 1 , which the promoters and HBO PPV preferred , it did n't leave time for a lengthy media tour .
The fight is going to take place March 13 because Pacquiao is running for a congressional seat in the Philippines and the elections are in May , which would have been a conflict between his training and the campaign .
Pacquiao will spend the first half of his training camp in Baguio in the Philippines , where he also trained for the first part of his camp in preparation for his 12th - round knockout victory against Miguel Cotto on Nov. 14 .
For the final few weeks of his training , Pacquiao and trainer Freddie Roach will relocate to Roach 's Wild Card gym in Hollywood , Calif .
The site of the bout has not been finalized .
Dallas Cowboys owner Jerry Jones has expressed interest in bringing the fight to his new stadium as have representatives from the Superdome in New Orleans .
Also in the mix is the MGM Grand in Las Vegas , which has hosted several Pacquiao and Mayweather bouts .
Arum has also received a proposal for a 30,000 - seat temporary stadium on the Las Vegas Strip across from the Wynn resort .

Plouffe stepping up role as adviser to White House
David Plouffe , the man who managed President Barack Obama 's campaign , will be taking on an expanded role as an outside adviser to the White House , according to sources familiar with the plan , a move that comes just days after a stunning defeat for Democrats in a Massachusetts Senate special election .
Allies of the White House cast the Plouffe move as less about the Massachusetts election and more about the fact that the election year is heating up and Plouffe has more free time following the publication of his campaign memoir late last year .
Still , the timing is sure to stoke speculation that the White House is seeking to shore up its political operation .
After managing Obama 's successful primary and general election races , Plouffe chose not to go into the White House -- as so many of his campaign colleagues did -- but rather return to the private sector and focus on writing his memoir of the campaign called " The Audacity to Win " .
The book was released on November 3 , 2009 .
Plouffe did stay involved with Organizing for America , the operation formed in the wake of Obama 's victory to maintain the massive grassroots email and donor base built during the campaign .
While OFA officials tout it as a success story there is increasing skepticism within the party about whether it has truly fulfilled its mission of bringing a grassroots army to bear on the President 's top priorities .
Plouffe has also remained in regular touch with the President and his political team .
The President talks fairly regularly with David , " said White House press secretary Robert Gibbs .
" I know that it is somebody whose advice and counsel he both seeks regularly and
believes David is an exceptionally smart advisor who understands the type of anger and frustration that he 's seen . "
In an op - ed set to be published tomorrow in the Post , Plouffe argued that finding a way to pass a health care plan is critically important to the electoral fate of the party in the 2010 midterms .
Wrote Plouffe :
" Americans ' health and our nation 's long - term fiscal health depend on it .
I know that the short - term politics are bad .
It 's a good plan that 's become a demonized caricature .
But politically speaking , if we do not pass it , the GOP will continue attacking the plan as if we did anyway , and voters will have no ability to measure its upside "
Plouffe 's increased advisory role comes after three major defeats for Democrats in recent months .
The party lost gubernatorial races in New Jersey and Virginia in 2009 and watched somewhat helpless as state Attorney General Martha Coakley ( D ) fell to Sen. - elect Scott Brown ( R ) in a special election in Massachusetts on Tuesday .
In each of those races , independents abandoned Democrats in droves ; a new Washington Post poll shows that Brown won independents over Coakley by two - to - one margin on Tuesday , a huge reversal from the 2008 presidential election when Obama carried independents in Massachusetts by 17 points over Arizona Sen .
John McCain .
Coakley 's loss has stoked fears within Democratic ranks that the party is headed toward a major setback in November .
Those concerns have led to considerable speculation that a number of wavering Members of Congress will choose retirement over the prospect of a very contested re-election race .
Since the Massachusetts race , however , no Senate or House Democrat has retired .
What do you think is involved in being an effective parent ?
The Bible tells us in Proverbs 22:6 to “ Train up a child in the way he should go ; and when he is old , he will not depart from it ” ( KJV ) .
Now that ’s a tall order , and a great responsibility , and there are some positive ingredients that make that possible .
Your expectations as a parent for your child have a definite influence on your child ’s behavior .
For example , two different people can try feeding a child .
One will succeed , the other will fail .
Why ?
The one expected to succeed .
The other expected to fail .
The first one had what was called confident expectation .
If you ’re doing something that ’s worthwhile , whether it ’s feeding your child or anything else necessary in parenthood , if you feel it ’s worthwhile and in the best interest of your child , you ought to have enough conviction to carry it through .
That involves confident expectation .
Your child may not want or like what you ’re trying to do and may resist you in different ways .
But do n’t take your cue from your child , letting him control the situation .
With love and gentleness , but with firmness , persist with confident expectation and you will gain the victory .
Dr. Ethel Wethering , a professor at Cornell University , once talked about 4 building blocks that help in raising children .
1. Attitude of Approval
A child ’s attitude has a lot to do with the attitude of the parent .
Choose to have a spirit of approval , so your child sees “ I like you , even when you are bucking me . ”
2. Help
When you have an expectation of your child , figure out how to help make it happen .
3. Respect
Be patient with your child and take time to understand what the child can and ca n’t do .
Respect their abilities .
4. Affection and Tenderness
This building block can cement your relationship with your child .
Show your love for your children .
Hug them , tell them you love him .
That will help you jump over a lot of hurdles and heal a lot of hurts .
The most important part of parenthood involves your character .
Much of what you teach your children will be caught , not actually taught .
You are shaping your child ’s character by your example .
Unfortunately , few parents realize how important it is to be good role models of the attitudes , speech and actions they desire to see reproduced in their children .
So , pay attention to the kind of person you are , and how you relate to your spouse .
You are making an impression .
Ask God for wisdom and direction as to what changes you need to make in order to be a more approving , helping , respecting , affectionate parent .
Be your best and your children will benefit all the more .

GM to make electric motors in U.S .
NEW YORK �( CNNMoney.com ) -- General Motors announced Tuesday that it intends to become the first major automaker to design and manufacture electric motors for cars in the United States .
Electric motors are used in gasoline - electric hybrid vehicles as well as fully electric - powered vehicles .

GM 's first new electric motors would be used on vehicles like the next generation of the Chevrolet Tahoe Hybrid
The first GM electric motors will be used in the next generation of the automaker 's rear - wheel - drive full - hybrid vehicles such as the Chevrolet Tahoe hybrid SUV beginning in 2013 .
Those next - generation vehicles will use two unique electric motor designs , the automaker said .
Those electric motors will be combined with an internal combustion gasoline engine to provide improved fuel economy .
" In the future , electric motors might become as important to GM as engines are now , " Tom Stephens , GM 's vice president for global vehicle operations , said in a statement .
" By designing and manufacturing electric motors in - house , we can more efficiently use energy from batteries , as they evolve , potentially reducing cost and weight -- two significant challenges facing batteries today . "
Electric motors will be a core expertise for GM in the future , Stephens said , in the same way that internal combustion engines are today .
" Our goal is simply to establish GM as a leader in automotive electric motors , " he said .
It will be a long time before the internal combustion engine is entirely supplanted by the electric motor , he said , but the two technologies will exist side - by - side , often in the same vehicle , for some time to come .
The new electric motors will be smaller , more powerful and more energy efficient , Stephens said .
Their smaller size will allow them to be used in a broader variety of vehicles than those used today in GM 's hybrid SUVs .
GM will still purchase some electric motors from outside suppliers , said Peter Savagian , GM 's director of engineering for hybrid vehicles .
" Our intention is not to make all of our electric motors but to make some of them , " he said .
Having in - house expertise in electric motors will also allow GM to deal more effectively with suppliers , Savagian said .
GM was selected in August by the U.S. Department of Energy to receive a $ 105 million grant for the construction of U.S. manufacturing capabilities to produce electric motors and related electric drive components .
In total , GM said , it will invest $ 246 million in electric motor and electric drive manufacturing facilities in the U.S.
The automaker will add " a couple of hundred " jobs to manufacture the engine , Stephens said in a press conference .
Jobs have already been added to research and develop new electric motors at GM , he said .
In January , GM announced the start of lithium - ion battery production at a plant in Brownstown Township , Mich .
Batteries from that plant will be used in the Volt electric car .
We 've all heard about the Dutch cartoonist who 's been threatened by radical Muslims because of his work .
These are the same radical Muslims that have wingnuts peeing in their pants .
So what do you call it when these very same wingnuts similarly threaten an American cartoonist I mean , come on , assholes .
This is n't even funny enough to be worth your ire .
But before you calm down , please explain how threatening to kill an artist who parodies your beliefs differs from the very terrorists you claim to want to fight ?

Tehran , Iran ( CNN ) --
Iran tested an upgraded version of a surface - to - surface missile with a range that makes it capable of reaching parts of Europe , state - run television reported Wednesday .
Iranian Defense Minister Gen. Ahmad Vahidi said on Press - TV that the solid - fuel , high - speed Sajil - 2 missile has " great maneuverability " and can access targets more than 2,000 kilometers ( 1,242 miles ) away , making Israel and U.S. military bases in the Gulf reachable .
Vahidi said the missile has a shorter launch time and is intended to boost Iran 's deterrent capability .
In Washington , Pentagon spokesman Geoff Morrell said Defense Secretary Robert Gates had seen the intelligence on the launch , which occurred Tuesday , " and , based on that , is clearly concerned . "
" At a time when the international community has offered Iran opportunities to begin to build trust and confidence , Iran 's missile tests only undermine Iran 's claims of peaceful intentions , " he added .
" Such actions will increase the seriousness and resolve of the international community to hold Iran accountable for its continued defiance of its international obligations . "
But a U.S. intelligence official said the test launch does not represent " a major advancement " in Iran 's missile technology .
The official added that Iran carries out such tests on a " routine basis ... to attract attention . "
Iran tested the initial version of the Sajil - 2 in May .
In September , days before a key meeting over nuclear issues with industrialized powers , Iran tested two types of long - range missiles .
Those tests drew condemnation after the Islamic republic revealed the existence of a covert uranium enrichment site near the city of Qom .
Iran shocked the world with that revelation .
Since then , it has allowed inspectors from the U.N. nuclear watchdog agency to visit the plant .
Western powers fear that Iran is intent on developing nuclear weapons .
That 's a claim Tehran denies , but the latest test - firing of the Sajil - 2 could add to existing tensions .
President Barack Obama plans to recoup US taxpayer funds spent on bailing out American banks in his next budget , the White House said today .
With Wall Street banks set to reveal huge bonuses for staff this week , a White House spokesman launched an attack on financial institutions , saying some executives " continue not to get it " when they awarded big bonuses after receiving billion - dollar bailouts from the taxpayer .
The president is considering levying a fee or a new tax on financial services companies to help close the yawning federal budget deficit , which is estimated to be greater than $ 1tr ( £ 600 bn ) next year .
" That 's the president 's goal , " Robert Gibbs , Obama 's press spokesman , told reporters but he declined to detail the plan or to describe the mechanism to recoup the funds .
On Monday , US news media reported the administration was considering imposing fees on banks in its proposed budget for the next fiscal year .
The move follows the introduction of a 50 % tax on bank bonuses in the UK and would be a huge boost for Gordon Brown and Alistair Darling , who have faced criticism about the impact their 50 % tax on bonuses will have on the City because no other country with a leading financial centre has followed suit .
The Obama administration has previously resisted calls for stark limits on compensation at the largest financial firms , so Washington 's alignment with the embattled prime minister and his chancellor would be a significant coup and would bolster their attempts to harness widespread public anger in their fight against City excess .
But even as the president and his aides rail at the banks , Wall Street appears ready to enjoy one of the largest bonus seasons in history .
The world 's biggest investment banks are expected to pay out more than $ 65bn in salaries and bonuses in the next two weeks , bolstering the view in the US and UK that it is business as usual on Wall Street and in the City , barely a year since the taxpayers ' bailout of the banking system .
The US bailout – the Troubled Asset Relief Programme , or Tarp – remains one of the most controversial steps the US government took in an effort to stabilise the country 's battered financial system .
The legislation authorised up to $ 700bn in spending , although the US treasury will disburse much less .
As of 30 September , the department had spent $ 364bn , most of it in capital investments in the firms .
Some $ 164bn had been repaid as of late last month .
The treasury department estimates that total bank repayments will top $ 175bn by the end of 2010 , and says the bank investments have already yielded $ 16bn in profits .
The Obama administration insists the programme helped stave off further financial disaster , though it drew howls of protest from all sides of the political spectrum .
Bank executives have acknowledged the potential for public outrage at the size of their bonuses .
Goldman Sachs is thought to be considering a plan to force highly paid staff to make charity donations and has already announced its management team will take their bonuses in shares rather than cash .
However , there have been few signs that bonuses will be reduced , promising to fuel public anger in the US , where unemployment is 10 % .
On Monday , New York 's attorney general , Andrew Cuomo , sent letters to eight of the nation 's largest banks demanding information on the structure of their bonus programmes , with an explanation of how they had adjusted compensation to account for the large influx of taxpayer bailout funds .
" No one can disagree that transparency and disclosure is essential , " Cuomo told reporters .
In the letters , he refers to the " new responsibility to taxpayers " the banks took on when they accepted federal bailout money .
Cuomo , a likely candidate in the New York gubernatorial election next year , has been investigating executive compensation at the banks .

Firefox 3.5 introduced TraceMonkey , our new JavaScript engine that traces loops and JIT compiles them to native ( x86 / ARM ) code .
Many JavaScript programs ran 3 - 4 x faster in TraceMonkey compared to Firefox 3 .
( See our previous article for technical details . )
For JavaScript performance in Firefox 3.6 , we focused on the areas that we thought needed further improvement the most :
Some JavaScript code was not trace - compiled in Firefox 3.5 .
Tracing was disabled by default for Firefox UI JavaScript and add - on JavaScript , so those programs did not benefit from tracing .
Also , many advanced JavaScript features were not trace - compiled .
For Firefox 3.6 , we wanted to trace more programs and more JS features .
Animations coded with JavaScript were often choppy because of garbage collection pauses .
We wanted to improve GC performance to make pauses shorter and animations smoother .
In this article , I ’ll explain the most important JS performance improvements that come with Firefox 3.6 .
I ’ll focus on listing what kinds of JS code get faster , including sample programs that show the improvements Fx3.6 makes over Fx3.5 .
JIT for Browser UI JavaScript
Firefox runs JavaScript code in one of two contexts : content and chrome ( no relation to Google Chrome ) .
JavaScript that is part of web content runs in a content context .
JavaScript that is part of the browser UI or browser add - ons runs in a chrome context and has extra privileges .
For example , chrome JS can alter the main browser UI , but content JS is not allowed to .
The TraceMonkey JIT can be enabled or disabled separately for content and chrome JS using about : config .
Because bugs affecting chrome JS are a greater risk for security and reliability , in Firefox 3.5 we chose to disable the JIT for chrome JS by default .
After extensive testing , we ’ve decide to enable the JIT for chrome JS by default , something we did not have time to fully investigate for Fx3.5 .
Turning on the JIT for chrome should make the JS behind the Firefox UI and add - ons run faster .
This difference is probably not very noticeable for general browser usage , because the UI was designed and coded to perform well with the older JS engines .
The difference should be more noticeable for add - ons that do heavy JS computation .
Option Fx3.5 Default Fx3.6 Default javascript.options.jit.chrome false true javascript.options.jit.content true true about : config options for the JIT
Garbage Collector Performance
JavaScript is a garbage - collected language , so periodically the JavaScript engine must reclaim unused memory .
Our garbage collector ( GC ) pauses all JavaScript programs while it works .
This is fine as long as the pauses are “ short ” .
But if the pauses are even a little too long , they can make animations jerky .
Animations need to run at 30 - 60 frames per second to look smooth , which means it should take no longer than 17 - 33 ms to render one frame .
Thus , GC pauses longer than 40 ms cause jerkiness , while pauses under 10 ms should be almost unnoticeable .
In Firefox 3.5 , pause times were noticeably long , and JavaScript animations are increasingly common on the web , so reducing pause times was a major goal for JavaScript in Firefox 3.6 .
Demo : GC Pauses and Animation
Demo .
The spinning dial animation shown here illustrates pause times .
Besides animating the dial , this demo creates one million 100 - character strings per second , so it requires frequent GC .
The frame delay meter gives the average time between frames in milliseconds .
The estimated GC delay meter gives the average estimated GC delay , based on the assumption that if a frame has a delay of 1.7 times the average delay or more , then exactly one GC ran during that frame .
( This procedure may not be valid for other browsers , so it is not valid for comparing different browsers .
Note also that the GC time also depends on other live JavaScript sessions , so for a direct comparison of two browsers , have the same tabs open in each . )
On my machine , I get an estimated GC delay of about 80 ms in Fx3.5 , but only 30 ms in Fx3.6 .
But it ’s a lot easier to see the difference by opening the demo in Fx3.5 , watching it a bit , and then trying it in Fx3.6 .
In Fx3.5 , I see frequent pauses and the animation looks noticeably jerky .
In Fx3.6 , it looks pretty smooth , and it ’s hard for me even to tell exactly when the GC is running .
How Fx3.6 does it better .
We ’ve made many improvements to the garbage collector and memory allocator .
I want to give a little more technical details on the big two changes that really cut our pause times .
First , we noticed that a large fraction of the pause time was spent calling free to reclaim the unused memory .
We ca n’t do much to make freeing memory faster , but we realized we could do it on a separate thread .
In Fx3.6 , the main JS thread simply adds unused memory chunks to a queue , and another thread frees them during idle time or on a separate processor .
This means machines with 2 or more cores will benefit more from this change .
But even when one core , freeing might be delayed to an idle time when it will not affect scripts .
Second , we knew that in Fx3.5 running GC clears out all the native code compiled by the JIT as well as some other caches that speed up JS .
The reason is that the tracing JIT and GC did not know about each other , so if the GC ran , it might reclaim objects being used by a compiled trace .
The result was that immediately after a GC , JS ran a bit slower as the caches and compiled traces were built back up .
This would be experienced as either an extended GC pause or a brief hiccup of slow animation right after the GC pause .
In Fx3.6 , we taught the GC and the JIT to work together , and now the GC does not clear caches or wipe out native code , so it resumes running normally right after GC .
Tracing More JavaScript Constructs
In my article on TraceMonkey for the Fx3.5 release , I noted that certain code constructs , such as the arguments object , were not traced and did not get performance improvements from the JIT .
A major goal for JS in Fx3.6 was to trace more stuff , so more programs can run faster .
We do trace more stuff now , in particular :
DOM Properties .
DOM objects are special and harder for the trace compiler to work with .
For Fx3.5 , we implemented tracing of DOM methods , but not DOM properties .
Now we trace DOM properties ( and other “ native ” C++ getters and setters ) as well .
We still do not trace scripted getters and setters .

Closures .
Fx3.5 traced only a few operations involving closures ( by which I mean functions that refer to variables defined in lexically enclosing functions ) .
Fx3.6 can trace more programs that use closures .
The main operation that is still not traced yet is creating an anonymous function that modifies closure variables .
But calling such a function and actually writing to the closure variables are traced .

arguments .
We now trace most common uses of the arguments keyword .
“ Exotic ” uses , such as setting elements of arguments , are not traced .

“ Exotic ” uses , such as setting elements of , are not traced .
switch .
We have improved performance when tracing switch statements that use densely packed numeric case labels .
These are particularly important for emulators and VMs .
These improvements are particularly important for jQuery and Dromaeo , which heavily use arguments , closures , and the DOM .
I suspect many other complex JavaScript applications will also benefit .
For example , we recently heard from the author that this R - tree library performs much better in Fx3.6 .
Here is a pair of demos of new things we trace .
The first sets a DOM property in a loop .
The second calls a sum function implemented with arguments I get a speedup of about 2 x for both of them in Fx3.6 vs. Fx3.5 .
Demo : Fx3.6 Tracing DOM properties and arguments Run
Show / Hide Code DOM Property Set : Sum using arguments : function sum ( ) { var ans = 0 ; for ( var i = 0 ; i < arguments .
length ; ++i ) ans += arguments [ i ] ; return ans ; } function runTracingTests ( ) { var t0 = new Date ; var domObj = document.getElementById(' dom_time ' ) ; for ( var i = 0 ; i < 600000 ; ++i ) domObj.x = 10 ; var t1 = new Date ; for ( var i = 0 ; i < 30000 ; ++i ) sum ( 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 , 5 ) ; var t2 = new Date ; document.getElementById(' dom_time').innerHTML
= ( t1 - t0 ) + ' ms ' ; document.getElementById('sum_time').innerHTML
= ( t2 - t1 ) + ' ms ' ; }
String and RegExp Improvements
Fx3.6 includes several improvements to string and regular expression performance .
For example , the regexp JIT compiler now supports a larger class of regular expressions , including the ever - popular w+ .
We also made some of our basic operations faster , like indexOf , match , and search .
Finally , we made concatenating sequences of several strings inside a function ( a common operation in building up HTML or other kinds of textual output ) much faster .
Technical aside on how we made string concatenation faster :
The C++ function that concatenates two strings S1 and S2 does this : Allocate a buffer big enough to hold the result , then copy the characters of S1 and S2 into the buffer .
To concatenate more than two strings , as in JS s + " foo " + t , Fx3.5 simply concatenates two at a time from left to right .
Using the Fx3.5 algorithm , to concatenate N strings each of length K , we need to do N - 1 memory allocations , and all but one of them are for temporary strings .
Worse , the first two input strings are copied N - 1 times , the next one is copied N - 2 times , and so on .
The total number of characters copied is K ( N - 1 ) ( N+2 ) / 2 , which is O ( N^2 ) .
Clearly , we can do a lot better .
The minimum work we can do is to copy each input string exactly once to the output string , for a total of KN characters copied .
Fx3.6 achieves this by detecting sequences of concatenation in JS programs and combining the entire sequence into one operation that uses the optimal algorithm .
Here are a few string benchmarks you can try that are faster in Fx3.6 :
Demo : Fx3.6 String Operations Run
Show / Hide Code /w+/ : indexOf ( ' foo ' ) : match ( ' foo ' ) : Build HTML : function words ( ) { var text_unit = ' word '; var text = '' ; for ( var i = 0 ; i < 1000 ; ++i ) text += text_unit ; var t0 = new Date ; for ( var i = 0 ; i < 300 ; ++i ) text.match(/w+/g ) return new Date - t0 ; } function indexOf_foo( ) { var text_unit = ' bar baz quux ' ; var text = '' ; for ( var i = 0 ; i < 1000 ; ++i ) text += text_unit ; text += ' foo ' ; var t0 = new Date ; for ( var i = 0 ; i < 3000 ; ++i ) text.indexOf ( ' foo ' ) return new Date - t0 ; } function match_foo( ) { var text_unit = ' bar baz quux ' ; var text = '' ; // for ( var i = 0 ; i < 1000 ; ++i ) // text += text_unit ; // text += ' foo ' ; text = ' bar baz qux quux foo ' ; var t0 = new Date ; for ( var i = 0 ; i < 100000 ; ++i ) text.search ( ' foo ' ) return new Date - t0 ; } function runStringTests ( ) { var dt1 = words ( ) ; var dt2 = indexOf_foo( ) ; var dt3 = match_foo( ) ; var dt4 = buildHTML ( ) ; document.getElementById('words_time').innerHTML
= dt1 + ' ms ' ; document.getElementById('indexOf_foo_time').innerHTML
= dt2 + ' ms ' ; document.getElementById('match_foo_time').innerHTML
= dt3 + ' ms ' ; document.getElementById('buildHTML_time').innerHTML
= dt4 + ' ms ' ; } function buildHTML ( url , text , style ) { var t0 = new Date ; for ( var i = 0 ; i < 100000 ; ++i ) var q = '' + text + '' ; return new Date - t0 ; }
Final Thoughts and Next Steps
We also made a lot of little improvements that do n't fit into the big categories above .
Most importantly , Adobe , Mozilla , Intel , Sun , and other contributors continue to improve nanojit , the compiler back - end used by TraceMonkey .
We have improved its use of memory , made trace recording and compiling faster , and also improved the speed of the generated native code .
A better nanojit gives a boost to all JS that runs in the JIT .
There are two big items that did n't make the cut for Fx3.6 , but will be in the next version of Firefox and are already available in nightly builds :
JITting recursion .
Recursive code , like explicit looping code , is likely to be hot code , so it should be JITted .
Nightly builds JIT directly recursive functions .
Mutual recursion ( g calls f calls g ) is not traced yet .
Recursive code , like explicit looping code , is likely to be hot code , so it should be JITted .
Nightly builds JIT directly recursive functions .
Mutual recursion ( g calls f calls g ) is not traced yet .
AMD x64 nanojit backend .
Nanojit now has a backend that generates AMD x64 code , which gives the possibility of better performance on that plaform .
And if you try a nightly build , you 'll find that many of these demos are already even faster than in Fx3.6 !

Police blocking the entrance to the Rote Strasse ( Photo courtesy of MoG )
A brief summary for the , numerous , non-German visitors here ( very freely translated and edited from MoG ) :
On the evening of the 27th of January police raided one of the „ collective “ houses in the Rote Strasse , under the pretense of looking for evidence related to the „ bomb “ which exploded several days ago in one of the government offices responsible for deportations .
This incident occurred only two days after Göttingen authorities arrested and deported a man to Kosovo ( see : „ Protests Against Deportation “ ) .
The „ lead “ which led to this massive police operation is apparently nothing more than a police dog which , five days later and despite rain and snow , apparently led police from the site of the „ explosion “ to the entrance of the house on the Rote Strasse .
This was justification enough to cordon off the entire Red Street with well over one hundred police officers for over three hours and proceed to a thorough raid of the house .
In the course of the raid police confiscated three computers as well as other information storage devices .
Not precisely bomb making material .
The police also took advantage of the opportunity to carry out a further search warrant against an inhabitant of the house , in this case because of alleged property damage in the form of graffitti .
The persons computer as well as several stencils were also confiscated .
During the time of the police operation several hundred supporters gathered at the cordoned off corner of Rote Street and Jüden Street .
Eventually this led to a „ spontaneous “ demonstration through the city , during the course of which several store windows were smashed , at least one police car had its windows broken , and several small barricades were built .
Five people were arrested during or immediately following the demonstration .
Furthermore , approximately 50 people held a spontaneous demonstration in solidarity with the inhabitants of the Rote Str. in Hannover .
Demonstration in Hannover
Most importantly , the inhabitants of the Rote Strasse as well as several autonome and antifascist groups are calling for a demonstration against repression and against the attempts to criminalize anti-racist solidarity .
This demonstration is on Saturday , January 30th at 17:00 at the „ Marktplatz . “
Put in few words :
Be there !
Finally , just in , the press release of the inhabitants of the Rote Strasse houses :
+++ Pressemitteilung anlässlich der Hausdurchsuchung in der Roten Straße 1 Göttingen am 27 .
Januar 2010 +++
Polizei durchsucht Haus in der Roten Straße .
Konstruierte Vorwände sollen Repression gegen linke Strukturen legitimieren .
Gestern , am 27 .
Januar 2010 , hat die Polizei eine Hausdurchsuchung in der Roten Straße 1 in Göttingen durchgeführt .
Bereits gegen 19.00
Uhr hatte ein Großaufgebot an Einsatzkräften die Rote Straße abgesperrt .
Anschließend wurden mehrere Zimmer von Bewohnerinnen und Bewohnern , sowie das Wohnzimmer und der Dachboden durchsucht .
Darüber hinaus verschafften sich die Polizeikräfte Zutritt zu weiteren Zimmern .
Als Vorwand galt der Polizei eine vermeintliche Spur , die ein Spürhund trotz Schneefalls und Tauwetters auch nach fünf Tagen noch aufgenommen haben soll .
Diese habe angeblich von dem Brandherd im Kreishaus , der nach Spekulationen der Polizei auf einen Anschlag zurückgeht , direkt zum Haus in der Roten Straße geführt .
„ Es ist offenkundig , dass hier Stimmung gemacht wird gegen die linke Szene im Besonderen und antirassistische Politik in Göttingen im Allgemeinen . “ , erklärte Sonja Meier ,
eine Sprecherin der Roten Straße .
Während der Durchsuchung verstießen die Polizistinnen und Polizisten gleich mehrfach gegen geltendes Recht .
So verschafften sich die Beamten , ohne die Bewohner und Bewohnerinnen des Hauses darüber in Kenntnis zu setzen , Zutritt zur Wohngemeinschaft .
Als die Betroffenen die Vorlage eines Durchsuchungsbeschlusses forderten , verweigerten die Polizeikräfte diese .
Zudem wurde Sven Adam , der von den Betroffenen hinzu gerufene Anwalt , zunächst von
Polizeibeamten daran gehindert zum Haus zu gelangen .
Die Sprecherin erklärte hierzu : „ Es ist ein Skandal , dass ein Richter einen Durchsuchungsbeschluss auf einer solch vagen Beweisgrundlage überhaupt unterschreibt .
Die Durchsuchung reiht sich ein in eine Vielzahl von Repressionsmaßnahmen gegen linke Strukturen . “
So wurde im vergangenen Jahr eine linke Wohngemeinschaft in der Geismar Landstraße durchsucht ; ein Gericht hat diese Maßnahme mittlerweile für rechtswidrig erklärt .
„ Wir werden diese willkürlichen Maßnahmen nicht widerstandslos hinnehmen und verurteilen sowohl die Hetze gegen antirassistische Politik als auch die mit ihr verbundene Repression . “ , so Sonja Meier abschließend .
Für Samstag , den 30 .
Januar 2010 , rufen die Bewohner und Bewohnerinnen der Roten Straße zu einer Demonstration gegen das Vorgehen der Polizei auf .
Treffpunkt soll laut Angaben der Sprecherin um 17.00 Uhr am Kornmarkt sein .
Bewohnerinnen und Bewohner der Roten Straße Göttingen

From Game Change , by Mark Halperin and John Heilemann
Why Sen. Kennedy was offended about his conversation with Bill Clinton ( page 218 ) :
" Recounting the conversation later to a friend , Teddy fumed that Clinton had said , A few years ago this guy would have been getting us coffee . "
Clinton senior strategist Mark Penn boasted to his staff how many times he managed to say " cocaine " on that famous Hardball segment ( page 163 ) .
Hillary Clinton was initially pleased when her New Hampshire campaign chairman , Billy Shaheen , mentioned Obama 's previous use of drugs ( page 161 ) :
" Hillary 's reaction to Shaheen 's remarks was , ' Good for him ! '
Followed by ' Let 's push it out . '
Her aides violently disagreed , seeing what Shaheen had said as a PR disaster .
Grudgingly , Clinton acquiesced to disowning Shaheen 's comments .
But she was n't going to cut him loose .
Why should Billy have to fall on his sword for invoking something that had been fair game in every recent election ? "

A life without proper food : Keaton , 5 , will never eat due to bizarre medical condition
A little boy is facing a lifetime of never eating because he suffers from a one - in - 135 million genetic condition .
Keaton Foale , five , has never even enjoyed a packet of sweets or crisps - and never will .
He has been diagnosed with the incredibly rare Congenital Disorder Glycosylation Type Two , which means he can't eat food normally .
The youngster has to be fed through a tube into his stomach that he will need for the rest of his life .
Rare : Keaton Foale , 5 , pictured with mother Claire Plummer , can't eat food like most of us and has to be fed through a tube
His condition has baffled doctors around the world .
It was first discovered when he began refusing his bottled milk at three months old .
Medics at Sunderland General Hospital discovered that any food which went into his stomach was instantly rejected .
They had to staple the top of his stomach when he was just six months old to save his life .
Instead , they put in a special feeding tube that delivers a high - calorie milk mixture to his stomach four times a day in 50 - minute sessions .
His mother , Claire Plummer , became frantic with worry after her son first developed the rare symptoms .
Claire , 29 , who is a full - time mother to Keaton , his sister Bethany , 10 , and eight - year - old brother Dylan , said very little was known about Keaton 's rare genetic disorder .
She added : ' As his weight plummeted , doctors put Keaton on tube feeds through his nose - but even this did n't stop him vomiting .
' Something had to be done to make sure that he could get the nutrition he so desperately needed .
Vulnerable : Keaton pictured in hospital shortly after his birth at 24 weeks when he was just four inches tall
' Doctors were forced to insert a feeding tube directly into his stomach .
' When tests were carried out using a kind of X - Ray food machine , to find out why Keaton could n't eat , doctors were stunned .
' The milk was simply stuck in his throat - he could n't swallow .
' The dribbles of milk that did get past his throat either went to his stomach , making him vomit or ended up in his lungs .
' I was so worried when I first heard about his condition .
' For years the doctors could n't diagnose what was wrong with him and even now , knowing that he suffers from such a unique condition is little consolation really .
' Doctors still are n't sure about all the things that are wrong with my son .
' There are only a few people in the world who actually deal with CDG because it is such a unique condition .
Glycosylation Type
Two is a genetic disorder which is not hereditary and can cause a spectrum of disturbing symptom , including cancer and deafness .
As well as not being able to eat , Keaton also suffers from internal bleeding on a regular basis and loses several pints of blood every year .
Sometimes he bleeds as often as two or three times a week .
Keaton was born at just 24 weeks and was just four inches tall - the length of a Biro pen - when he was delivered , but doctors believe this has had no bearing on him developing the condition .
In the first year of his life alone , he battled through jaundice , anaemia and blood infections and had laser - eye surgery to stop him going blind .
After years of tests and problems he was finally diagnosed with CDG at the age of three - and - a - half .
The life expectancy of sufferers varies from 3 months to 60 years .
Even now he struggles to get up and down stairs by himself , and has difficulties with his speech .
American Dr Hudson Freeze , one of the few experts in the condition , said Keaton 's was the most unusual case he had encountered .
He said : ' With Type Two CDG , which he suffers from , we do n't yet know specifically what gene is at fault .
' As yet there is no cure for Type Two and research is ongoing .

HUA HIN , Thailand ( Reuters ) - Japan , the world ’s fifth - biggest air polluter , offered a $ 400 million yen - denominated loan Sunday to Indonesia , the world ’s third - largest air polluter , to help tackle global warming , Japanese officials said .
The loan was part of the “ Hatoyama Initiative ” unveiled last month by Japanese Prime Minister Yukio Hatoyama , in which Tokyo will provide financial and technical assistance to developing countries to help address the problem of climate change .
Hatoyama offered the loan during a meeting with Indonesian President Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono on the sidelines of an Asia -Pacific summit in the Thai beach town of Hua Hin .
The initiative was originally proposed by Hatoyama ’s predecessor and amended by his government as the United Nations Climate Change Secretariat wants developed nations to come up with at least $ 10 billion in initial funding .
Final details of Japan ’s new funding initiative may not be ready in time for the last formal U.N. negotiating session before the Copenhagen climate meeting in early November .
The loan offer to Indonesia came a day after Hatoyama urged his Indian counterpart Manmohan Singh to make an international commitment on climate change , saying it was vital for a U.N. deal due in Copenhagen in December .
Disputes over 2020 emissions cuts by developed nations and the amounts of cash to help developing nations combat global warming are among the main sticking points in sluggish U.N. talks meant to end in Denmark on December 18 with a new treaty .
Developing nations led by China and India say the rich need to make cuts averaging at least 40 percent below 1990 levels by 2020 to avoid the worst of climate change .
Instead , he expressed the frustration common in the White House these days : that he has not gotten more credit for the successes he has had , particularly in pulling the economy back from the brink of a new Great Depression .
That was where the tax cuts came in .
While the economic stimulus package Mr. Obama pushed through Congress last year is known largely for its spending , he pointed out that it also included a variety of tax cuts , and then repeated it in case anyone missed it .
The Republicans who chose not to applaud have argued that the tax cuts were simply accompanied by too much spending .
In fact , when it comes to his program , the narrative of too much was the major notion Mr. Obama was trying to dispel .
Gov. Robert F. McDonnell , the newly inaugurated Republican leader in Virginia , emphasized the point in his official response to the president ’s speech .
“ Today , the federal government is simply trying to do too much , ” Mr. McDonnell said .
In the face of that judgment , shared not just by Republicans these days , Mr. Obama could have pulled back but chose to push forward .
To those who said his ideas have been too ambitious , he said : “ I have one simple question : How long should we wait ?
How long should America put its future on hold ? ”
The truth is , Mr. Obama is still trying to figure that out for himself .
Since the Massachusetts election cost the Democrats unilateral control of the Senate , the president and his advisers have been grappling for a plan to move forward on his agenda .
Some things inevitably will have to wait , and Mr. Obama ’s plans since last week have been a work in progress .
The day after last week ’s election , he suggested returning to the “ core elements ” of health care , only to have aides hours later try to walk back the statement and insist he did not necessarily mean he wanted a scaled - back plan .
A series of popular Coors commercials that ran for several years , until about 2006 , opened with a shot of the Rocky Mountains and the text , “ Somewhere near Golden , Colorado . ”
The ads featured Pete Coors  grandson of the brewery founder Adolph Coors and currently chairman of Molson Coors Brewing Company  standing in the snowy Rockies and commenting that what makes Coors unique is that it is made from that snow , after it melts and flows in streams toward its brewery .
A new commercial , by Cultivator Advertising and Design in Denver , for Breckenridge Brewery , a brewpub and bottler also in the Rockies , will look familiar to Coloradans , since it opens with snowcapped mountains and the text , “ Somewhere near Breckenridge , Colorado . ”
But after this spokesman  the head brewer Bob Harrington , pitching the brewery ’s Lucky U India pale ale  says the beer is brewed with “ real Colorado water , ” he points to a nearby stream and adds , “ Well , not this water  do you know what bears do in here ? ”
Contrary to what viewers might infer , Todd Usry , brewery director at Breckenridge , said they are not suggesting Coors tastes like what bears do in there .
Rather , the ad is spoofing the implication that Coors is rustically drawing water from streams when it is , of course , using water that has been thoroughly treated and purified for human consumption .
“ We did n’t want to rub anyone the wrong way , ” Mr. Usry said .
The 30 - second spot was produced by Fox 31 KDVR in Denver , where it will run exclusively through Feb. 12 . Mr. Usry declined to say how much the campaign will cost , but said the brewery was paying a deeply discounted rate because it was co-sponsoring a home - brewing contest with the station .
( To celebrate its 20th anniversary , Breckenridge will produce and bottle a batch of the winning recipe . )
The brewery ’s total yearly advertising expenditure is about $ 70,000 , Mr. Usry said .
The son - in - law of News Corporation Chairman Rupert Murdoch told the New York Times in little - noticed comments Sunday that he ’s “ ashamed and sickened ” by Fox News Channel ’s Chief Executive Roger Ailes .
“ I am by no means alone within the family or the company in being ashamed and sickened by Roger Ailes ’s horrendous and sustained disregard of the journalistic standards that News Corporation , its founder and every other global media business aspires to , ” said Matthew Freud , married to Rupert Murdoch ’s daughter and recently labeled the most influential PR executive in London .

Rupert Murdoch , News Corporation ’s chairman and politically engaged chairman , did n’t respond directly to the remarks .
But a spokesman for the company put out a statement after a Financial Times inquiry , saying Murdoch was actually “ proud ” of Ailes .
“ Matthew Freud ’s opinions are his own and in no way reflect the views of Rupert Murdoch , who is proud of Roger Ailes and Fox News , ” the statement said .
Murdoch has reportedly privately voiced concerns with Ailes before .
A 2008 biography said he was purportedly “ embarrassed ” by Fox News , a claim he later denied .
Regardless , Fox News is a cash cow for the News Corporation , which has recently entered into a string of less profitable deals .
A $ 5.6 billion purchase of the Wall Street Journal had investors shaking their head , with Murdoch buying the paper near the recent top of the market before the financial crisis munched some of the paper ’s leading financial advertisers .
Murdoch also jumped into buying MySpace for $ 580 million in 2005 .
Fox News Channel , created in 1996 , posted a profit of $ 1.6 billion in 2009 , the majority of News Corp ’s $ 3.6 profit .

A liberal diarist at Daily Kos notes that Murdoch ’s daughter Elisabeth — who is married to Matthew Freud — stands to inherit a great deal of Murdoch ’s empire .
“ It ’s good to know that there are some reasonable members of the Murdoch clan who are n’t afraid to voice their opinions , ” wrote diarist KingOneEye .
“ It makes for some interesting speculation about the future of News Corp. when the Murdoch progeny assume control .
While son James is still a high - ranking executive running Papa ’s European satellite operations , siblings Elisabeth and Lachlan will inherit equal voting shares from their father ’s estate .
“ Should any of this make Ailes nervous ? ” the diarist adds .
“ Well , would you want to keep a division head that made you “ ashamed and sickened ” if you inherited a multinational media empire ?
Would you allow your news network to continue to have a “ horrendous and sustained disregard ” for journalistic standards ? ”

The verdict is in : Windows 7 is Microsoft 's best operating system ever .
It 's stocked with genuinely handy interface upgrades ( hello , Aero Snap ) , long - overdue networking improvements ( we love you , homegroups ) , touchscreen support ( long live tablet PCs ) , and the best Windows Media Center experience yet ( ClearQAM support at last ) .
Like every operating system , though , Windows 7 can benefit from a few tweaks here , some add - ons there , and a smattering of OS - enhancing apps and utilities .
We 've rounded up 27 of them , each one designed to make Windows 7 faster , easier , safer , or more fun .
And because we know that many people still run Windows XP or Vista , we 've identified the tips that work with those versions as well .
Make It Faster
Is Windows 7 really speedier than Vista or XP ?
Different Windows 7 performance tests have yielded varying results , but ultimately it depends on your hardware and the apps you run .
Of course , with a few simple tricks , you can wring better performance from any system .
Go 64 - Bit
Works in : Vista , 7
The old saw still holds true : Windows loves RAM .
The more memory that you supply , the less the OS has to rely on the comparatively poky hard drive .
But if you want Windows to address more than 3GB of memory , you have to run the 64 - bit version .
If you 're buying Windows 7 as an upgrade , you should find a 64 - bit installation disc in the box ; ignore the 32 - bit disc entirely .
In addition to recognizing more RAM , 64 - bit Windows makes better use of your PC 's processor , giving you the best Windows experience possible .
Boot More Quickly
Works in : XP , Vista , 7 Does Windows 7 really boot more rapidly than other versions of Windows ?
Yes , a little .
But the more programs you install , the slower your system will start ( something that 's true of all Windows editions ) .
Many apps force Windows to run them at startup - - a situation not unlike a dozen cars trying to merge into one lane .
Startup Delayer is a great tool that tells the startup programs you select to sit tight , be patient , and run a little later -- after some of the traffic has cleared .
The end result is that your PC boots much more quickly .
The utility presents you with a list of all the programs that start when your system does .
To set a delay for any of them , just drag the item to the white bar at the bottom of the window .
You 'll see a line representing the app ; drag it left or right to decrease or increase the delay .
Startup Delayer is a freebie , and it's one of the best ways we know of to speed up a slow - booting PC .
Even one that runs Windows 7 .
Switch to Chrome
Works in : XP , Vista , 7 Quick -- what 's the single most - used app on your PC ?
The Web browser , of course .
So it 's no surprise that one way to make your Windows experience faster is to switch to the swiftest browser , and that 's Google Chrome .
As we reported in " Browser Speed Tests , " Chrome loads pages faster than Firefox 3.5 ( which ran a close second ) , Internet Explorer 8 , Opera 10 , and Safari 4 .
Granted , the advantage may amount to only a second or two , but those seconds add up .
Tweak Your Power Settings
Works in : Vista , 7 Using Windows ' power - management features to save energy makes sense -- but you should n't do it at the expense of productivity .
For example , if you 're working on a desktop PC ( or using a plugged - in laptop as your desktop ) , you do n't need your hard drive to turn off after 5 minutes , your processor to throttle back when idle , or your video playback to be ‘ optimized for power savings ' .
Since you 're not trying to preserve battery life on this machine , you should crank every performance setting to maximum .
By default , Windows Vista and 7 both come configured for ‘ Balanced ' performance .
To crank things up a bit , click Start , type power , and select Power Options .
Choose the High performance plan .
( If you do n't see it listed , click Show additional plans . )
Now your machine will run with desktop - optimized power settings .
If you want to tweak individual settings , such as how long the hard drive should sit idle before shutting down , click Change plan settings , Change advanced power settings .
Turn Off the Eye Candy
Works in : Vista , 7 Everybody loves bells and whistles , but Windows ' eye candy come at a price -- especially on older PCs with single - core processors or minimal RAM .
If you 're more concerned with zippy performance than you are with transparent windows and animated controls , consider turning off the visual effects .
Open the Control Panel , type visual in the Search field , and click Adjust the appearance and performance of Windows .
Choose Adjust for best performance , and then click Apply .
After a few seconds you 'll see a decidedly plainer Windows interface -- and enjoy a much snappier response .
If the look is too stark , you can choose the Custom option and then select any effects you want to restore .
Just remember :
The more you enable , the greater the performance hit .
Remove Shovelware
Works in : XP , Vista , 7
To this day many PC manufacturers insist on stuffing new systems with unnecessary , unwanted software that consumes drive space and slows startup .
We 're talking security suites you may not require , games you might not want , and vendor - branded utilities that are more nuisance than necessity .
Kick that junk to the curb .
You can venture into the Control Panel and click Uninstall a program , or use one of our favorite freebies , Revo Uninstaller , to make a clean sweep ; the utility not only uninstalls software , but also removes leftover files and Registry entries .
Just make sure not to firebomb anything important , like Adobe Flash Player or Microsoft .
Net Framework .
Expert Tip : Eliminate the Aero Peek Delay
Works in : 7 Aero Peek , one of Windows 7's most celebrated enhancements , temporarily turns all your windows transparent when you mouse over the Show Desktop button .
However , if you accept the default settings , the effect takes nearly a full second to kick in .
Why wait ?
A simple Registry hack will enable instantaneous transparency .
Press the Windows key to open the Start menu , type regedit in the search box , and press Enter .
In the Registry , navigate to HKEY_CURRENT_USER \ Software \Microsoft \Windows \CurrentVersion\ Explorer \Advanced .
Right - click an empty area in the right pane , and choose New , DWORD ( 32 - bit ) Value .
Name it DesktopLivePreviewHoverTime .
By default , Windows will assign a value of 0 , which is exactly what you want .
Now just restart your computer ( or log off and back on ) .
The next time you mouse over Show Desktop , you 'll be Peeking at light speed .
Expert Tip : Run Performance Monitor
Works in : 7 If you like charts , numbers , and data sets , Windows 7 has just the tool for you .
Performance Monitor tracks your PC 's hardware and applications in real time , generating all kinds of data that you can review and compare .
It 's aimed more at system administrators than at everyday users , but if you 're trying to confirm a sneaking suspicion that , say , iTunes is single - handedly tanking your system 's performance , it can help .
To access Performance Monitor , press the Windows key , type perfmon , and press Enter .
You can start assessing your system by expanding the Monitoring Tools folder and clicking Performance Monitor .
From there you 'll probably need to delve into the built - in help files , as the tool is n't exactly user - friendly .
For more , check out the Microsoft Developer Network blog post on using Performance Monitor .
The promise of 100 - gigabit - per- second ( 100G ) networks is no longer just a promise :
It 's a deployed , in - production reality .
Nortel and Verizon today jointly announced the deployment of a commercial 100G network between Paris and Frankfurt .
The new link marks the commercial availability of 100G from Nortel and the production use debut of 100G in a live network .
The technical and business milestone comes at challenging time for Nortel , which has been under bankruptcy protection since January .
The company 's Metro Networking unit which produces the 100G solution , is set to be acquired by Ciena for $ 769 million .
" It 's not every day we have a one - two punch , with the first commercially available 100G and then a customer the size of Verizon that goes out and launches with us , " Mike Adams , portfolio strategy and marketing leader at Nortel , told InternetNews.com .
" We 're very excited -- over the moon , in fact .
This has taken years of work to accomplish . "
Prior to the deployment of 100G , the biggest bandwidth available from Nortel and the industry as a whole has been 40 Gbps with the OC - 768 standard .
The new Nortel 100 G solution uses the new ODU - 4 optical standard to leverage existing 10 gigabit - per- second ( 10G ) equipment to deliver a so - called 10x10G solution .
" On the line transmitter side , it 's a 10x10G client multiplexed into a single 100G channel for transmission over a line , " Adams explained .
On the client side , Nortel is also working on solutions that leverage the emerging 100 - Gigabit Ethernet ( 100 GbE ) standard , which is set to be finalized in mid-2010 .
Nortel has been working on 100 GbE technology since at least December 2008 .
The difference with the client - side 100 GbE technology is that it will enable a single , 100 GbE interface to create the 100G transmission instead of a 10x10G interface .
Adams added that Nortel is still working on the 100 GbE interface technology and it expects to have future announcements on it as the specification matures .
100G has been demoed in test cases as far back as June 2008 , when optical networking vendor Infinera demoed its 100GbE technology at the NXTcomm trade show , showcasing a route going from Las Vegas to Los Angeles .
Alcatel - Lucent and Juniper Networks have also both separately announced their plans to have 100 GbE equipment availability at some point in 2010 .
For Nortel , Adams said a key benefit is that the 100G solution can be deployed in a " plug- and - play " approach over a service provider 's existing 10G or 40G network .
" We simply upgraded the software release on the existing [ Nortel Optical Multiservice Edge 6500 ] , added in two new 10x10G 100G line cards , and it's up and working at Verizon , completed uncompensated from Paris to Frankfurt with no other additions of amplifiers or regenerators , " Adams said .
The net effect of having the 100G technology is that carriers can potentially recognize a ten - fold expansion in the amount of available bandwidth on existing fiber .
Adams noted that with the solution , 88 channels of 100G are now possible within a single C band on a single piece of fiber .
Adams added that he sees the 100G solution as a cost - effective one that should make economic sense to service providers .
" We absolutely see 100G as being economically viable , " Adams said .
" There are a lot of considerations as you deploy , but this is not a ' hero deployment , ' this is not one of one but one of thousands of wavelengths that could be deployed in the next little while . "
With the pending acquisition of Nortel 's optical and metro networking assets by Ciena , Adams also said he sees the his group 's win of Verizon as a client as good news for the group .
" At the end of the day , when the deal is done , this as much a win for Ciena as it is for Nortel 's optical division , " Adams said .
" Gaining a 100G win with a company like Verizon is a great win for Ciena as well . "
December 1 , 2009 -- The Story of Cap & Trade is a fast - paced , fact - filled look at the leading climate solution being discussed at the climate talks in Copenhagen .
Cap and trade is also variously described as ``carbon trading '' and ``emissions trading '' .
In Australia , the federal Labor government is trying to push a variation of this through the Senate called the ``Carbon Pollution Reduction Scheme ' ' .
The Story of Cap & Trade host Annie Leonard introduces the energy traders and Wall Street financiers at the heart of this scheme and reveals the " devils in the details " in current cap and trade proposals : free permits to big polluters , fake offsets and distraction from what ’s really required to tackle the climate crisis .
If you ’ve heard about cap and trade , carbon trading or emissions trading , but are n’t sure how it works ( or who benefits ) , this is the film is for you .
In an excellent example of international collaboration The Story of Cap & Trade has been premiered on hundreds of sites across the globe .

The Story of Cap & Trade : referenced and annotated script
By Annie Leonard
I am so glad that the world is finally getting together to try to stop climate change .
[ 1 ]
When I first heard that our leaders were meeting to talk about solutions , I breathed a huge sigh of relief .
Did n’t you ?
Then I said , wait a minute .
What exactly are they planning to do about this problem ?
So I looked into it .
And I gotta tell you , not all the solutions they ’re working on are what I ’d call solutions .
In fact , the leading solution , known as cap and trade or emissions trading , is actually a huge problem .
Now I know this is the last thing you want to hear , but the future of our planet is at stake , so we gotta take the time to understand what ’s going on here .
Okay , meet the guys at the heart of this so - called solution .
They include the guys from Enron [ 2 ] who designed energy trading , and the Wall Street financiers like Goldman Sachs [ 3 ] who gave us the subprime mortgage crisis .
Their job is to develop brand new markets .
They stake their claims and then when everyone and their grandmother wants in , they make off with huge amounts of money as the market becomes a giant bubble and then bursts .
Well their latest bubble just burst and now they got a new idea for a market – trading carbon pollution .
They ’re about to develop a new $ 3 trillion bubble , [ 4 ] but when this one bursts , it wo n’t just take down our stock portfolios , it could take down everything !
So how does cap and trade work ?
Well , pretty much all serious scientists agree that we need to reduce the amount of carbon in the atmosphere to 350 ppm if we want to avoid climate disaster . [ 5 ]
In the U.S. , that means reducing our emissions by 80 % – maybe even more – by 2050 . 80 % ![ 6 ]
Now the problem is that most of our global economy runs on burning fossil fuels , which releases carbon : the factories that make all our stuff , the ships and trucks that carry it around the world , our cars and buildings and appliances , just about everything .
So , how are we gonna reduce carbon 80 % and not go back to living like Little House on the Prairie ?
Well , these Cap and Trade guys are saying that a new carbon stock market is the best way to get it done .
The first step would be getting governments around the world to agree to a yearly limit on carbon emissions .
That ’s the “ cap ” .
I think that part ’s great .
So how do they want to insure that carbon emissions stay under this cap ?
Well , governments would distribute a certain amount of permits to pollute .
Every year there would be fewer and fewer permits as we follow the cap to our goal .
Innovative companies will get on board building clean alternatives and getting more efficient .
As permits get scarcer , they would also become more valuable , so naturally , companies who have extra will want to sell them to companies who still need them .
That ’s where trading comes in .
The logic is as long as we stay under the cap , it does n’t matter who pollutes and who innovates . [ 7 ]
We ’ll meet our climate deadline , avoiding catastrophe .
And oh yeah , these guys take their fee as they broker this multi-trillion dollar carbon racket , I mean market .
Save the planet , get rich , what ’s not to like , right ?
Some of my friends who really care about our future support cap and trade .
A lot of environmental groups that I respect do too .
They know it ’s not a perfect solution and do n’t love the idea of turning our planet ’s future over to these guys , but they think that it is an important first step and that it ’s better than nothing .
I am not so sure .
And I ’m not the only one .
A growing movement of scientists , students , farmers , and forward thinking businesspeople are saying “ wait a minute ! ” [ 8 ]
In fact even the economists who invented the cap and trade system to deal with simpler problems like fertilizer pollution and sulfur dioxide , say cap and trade will never work for climate change . [ 9 ]
Here ’s why I think they ’re right .
When it comes to any kind of financial scam , like subprime mortgages or Bernie Madoff ’s pyramid scheme , the devil is always in the details .
And there are a lot of devils in the details of the cap and trade proposals on the table .
Devil number one is known as Free Permits , which is why some people call this system Cap and Giveaway . [ 10 ]
In this scheme , industrial polluters will get the vast majority of these valuable permits for free .
Free !
The more they ’ve been polluting , the more they ’ll get .
It ’s like we ’re thanking them for creating this problem in the first place .
In Europe where they tried a Cap and Giveaway system , the value of the permits bounced around like crazy , energy costs jumped for consumers , and guess what ?
Carbon emissions actually went up ! [ 11 ]
The only part that did work was that the polluters made billions of dollars in extra profits .
MIT economists say the same thing would likely happen here in the US . [ 12 ]
Those billions come from OUR pockets .
A real solution would put that money to work stopping climate change .
Instead of just giving permits away to polluters , we could sell them and use the money to :
- build a clean energy economy [ 13 ] - or give citizens a dividend to help pay for higher fuel prices while we transition to that clean energy economy [ 14 ] - or share it with those who are most harmed by climate change .
Some people call this paying our ecological debt . [ 15 ]
Since we in the richest countries released the most carbon for centuries , and lived a pretty comfy lifestyle in the process , do n’t we have a responsibility to help those most harmed ?
It ’s like we had a big party , did n’t invite our neighbors and then stuck ‘em with the clean up bill .
It ’s just not cool .
Did you know that in the next century , because of the changing climate , whole island nations could end up underwater [ 16 ] and the UN says 9 out of 10 African farmers could lose their ability to grow food . [ 17 ]
Would n’t a real solution benefit these people instead of just polluters ?
Devil number two is called Offsetting .
Offset permits are created when a company supposedly removes or reduces carbon .
They then get a permit which can be sold to a polluter who wants permission to emit more carbon .
In theory , one activity offsets the other .
The danger with offsets is it ’s very hard to guarantee that real carbon is being removed to create the permit .
Yet these permits are worth real money .
This creates a very dangerous incentive to create false offsets – to cheat .
Now in some cases cheating is n’t the end of the world , but in this case it is .
And already there ’s a lot of cheating going on .
Like , in Indonesia , Sinar Mas corporation cut down indigenous forests , causing major ecological and cultural destruction .
Then , they took the wasteland they created and planted palm oil trees .
Guess what they can get for it ?
Yup , offset permits . [ 18 ]
Carbon out ?
No. Carbon in ?
You bet .
Companies can even earn offsets for not doing anything at all .
Like , operators of a polluting factory can claim they were planning to expand 200 % but reduced the plans to expand only 100 % .
For that meaningless claim , they get offset permits – permits that they can sell to someone else to make more pollution !
That is so stupid ! [ 19 ]
The list of scams goes on and many of the worst ones happen in the so - called Third World where big business does whatever it wants , to whomever it wants .
And with lax standards and regulations on offsets they can get permits for just about anything . [ 20 ]
Devils one and two , Cap & Giveaway and Offsetting , make the system unfair and ineffective .
But the last devil , which I call Distraction , makes it downright dangerous .
See , there are real solutions out there , but cap and trade with its loopholes and promises of riches have made many people forget all about them . [ 21 ]
We ’re not even close to a global agreement on a carbon cap to begin with , and duh , this is the whole point of cap and trade .
But instead of hammering out a fair and strong deal , we ’re putting the cart before the horse and rushing off to trade schemes and offsets .
With all the bogus offset projects , huge giveaways to polluters , and the failure to address the injustices of climate change do you think the Third World will get on board with a global cap ?
I doubt it . [ 22 ]
If a cap and trade proposal is stopping us from actually capping carbon , it ’s a dangerous distraction .
We do n’t need to let these guys design the solution .
We – us , our governments - can make laws and do it ourselves .
In my country , we already have a law – the Clean Air Act – that confirms that carbon is a pollutant which our environmental agency is allowed to cap .
So what are we waiting for ?
Go EPA go !
Cap that carbon ! [ 23 ]
Instead , a U.S. cap and trade law proposed in 2009 guts the Clean Air Act , leaving it to the market to fix the problem . [ 24 ]
If a cap and trade proposal weakens our ability to make strong laws , it ’s a distraction .
Concerned citizens around the world need to speak out and demand we redesign our economies away from fossil fuels . [ 25 ]
But cap and trade makes citizens think everything will be okay if we just drive a little less , change our light bulbs and let these guys do the rest .
If cap and trade creates a false sense of progress , it ’s a dangerous distraction .
These cap and trade proposals are mostly about protecting business as usual .
Right now , the US subsidizes fossil fuels at more than twice the rate of renewables . [ 26 ]
What ?
We should n’t be subsidizing fossil fuels at all !
These guys do n't seem to realize that the simplest way to keep carbon out of the atmosphere is to leave it safely in the ground . [ 27 ]
US congressman , Rick Boucher , a well - known friend of the coal industry voted for cap and trade .
He said it “ strengthens the case for utilities to continue to use coal . ” [ 28 ]
No law that encourages coal use can stop climate change .
Period .
Solid caps , strong laws , citizen action , and carbon fees to pay off ecological debt and create a clean energy economy , that ’s how we can save our future .
Next time someone tells you Cap and Trade is the best we ’re gonna get , do n’t believe them !
Better yet , talk to them .
They probably want a future safe from climate change too .
Maybe they ’ve just forgotten that you can only compromise to a point before a solution is n’t really a solution .
I know we ’d all love to sacrifice nothing , save the planet and get rich doing it .
But get real !
This is the biggest crisis humanity has ever faced .
We ca n’t solve it with the mindset – their mindset – that got us into this mess .
We need something new .
It wo n't be easy , but it ’s time we dream bigger .
It ’s time to design a climate solution that will really work .

The more you fun you have , that makes your family life better .
If you have more money , you might be able to make a bigger impact .
Think about where you need to focus right now so you can improve your life overall .
Ask Yourself :
What areas have the lowest fulfillment factor ?
What areas have the highest fulfillment factor ?
What area will you focus on over the next 90 days ?
Here is how to know if it is time for a career change :
You are not valued , rewarded or appreciated .
Are you working your butt off and no one is noticing and saying “ Good job ! ” ?
You are not challenged , and there is no opportunity for growth in your current job .
You are stagnant and you do n’t have the motivation to learn more .
You are doing the same thing every day .
Eventually , you will become an expert and you wo n’t be challenging yourself to learn more .
You do n’t trust your company .
Your company is doing something sneaky and you do n’t like what you see or hear .
You have lost your excitement and passion for your job .
You should enjoy what you do !
You know in your gut .
The fact that you are listening to this podcast is a sign it is time for a career change !

Copenhagen – Hypocrisy – Fraud – Confidence Trick
Over the next few days in Copenhagen , World leaders will try to work out how they can produce something positive from what has been somewhat of a debacle , as each day , a new crisis seems to be thrown up .
Led by the Major leaders of the most important Countries , they will attempt to work out something .
Both the UN , and those major World leaders need something positive to save losing face , the UN on the overall scene , and those major World leaders at home , because they want to take any decision here back home to implement their own agendas , and if nothing really substantive comes out , then that makes it more difficult for them back home .
There is no doubt that they will try and come up with something , because there is no way the UN will come out and admit that nothing concrete can be agreed to .
The spin will be that this United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change ( UNFCCC ) COP15 Conference was in a actual fact quite successful .
That ’s the way of the UN .
They will try and find some sort of consensus that they can announce to the World , showing that they are the only ones looking after the future of our Planet .
They NEED something successful to be produced , because , for them , there is too much at stake , not the spin that they deliver on a daily basis , but the underlying reason for all this .
They have to protect the most important thing they have , and to that end , they have engaged in the most massive of confidence tricks .
They consistently tell us that CO2 emissions are the cause of global warming / climate change , and that something drastic and immediate needs to be done to lower those emissions .
However , by the end of the Conference , the truth of the matter is that nothing whatsoever will have changed with respect to CO2 emissions , and no decision they make will make them decrease .
They can spin the Science for all they please , but emissions will not come down in the long term , let alone in the near term .
That ’s where the hypocrisy , the fraud , and the confidence trick come into it .
The confidence trick has been played on those scientists by the major world leaders .
For so long now they have been directing what now amounts to Billions of dollars , and perhaps even hundreds of billions of dollars to scientists , both individually , and in research facilities and universities , and other establishments , to explain why CO2 is causing what has now been described as catastrophic global warming .
Those scientists , who for decades and longer have worked on shoestring budgets , or no budget at all , have recently seen vast amounts of money being pushed in their direction .
To that end , they endeavoured to find every single piece of what they now call evidence to support that finding , and to ensure that the money keeps flowing .
More and more scientists came on board , finding more and more correlations in support of the argument .
Now we find that absolutely everything can be put down to global warming or climate change , and because of that , we now are in the situation where there is now the single largest body of so called scientific ‘ evidence ’ than there has been for anything of a scientific nature in history .
Those politicians and World leaders have cashed in on what they instigated in the first place .
They now have what they call vast proof that CO2 causes global warming .
Those scientists who dispute these findings are marginalised , sneered at , labeled with epithets , have their funding rescinded , roundly attacked by nearly all media outlets , scoffed at , sneered at , and even laughed at .
Scientist has turned against scientist .
All this has played into the hands of those politicians and World leaders .
Why have those politicians and world leaders done this ?
The scientists have concentrated on their special field alone .
They even know the main source of the CO2 emissions , that being from the coal fired power production sector .
They tell us that the vast emissions from this main source are the main contributing factor , and tell us that the only way to avoid absolute catastrophe is to reduce those emissions .
This was an absolute Godsend for those politicians .
Running concurrently now with that science is the political part of all this equation .
Now they have their ‘ proof ’ , and they have a source , those politicians have come up with what they call the answer .
Their answer is to regulate that CO2 , place a cost on it , and then spin that with the science .
The cost can be in two ways , either an outright cost on the CO2 , or with a Cap and Trade mechanism , and either way , they win .
Now , because of that science that backs them up so neatly , it becomes an easier thing to foist on the public .
They tell them that the science demands that they they do something .
In effect .
they have found a beautiful way to impose what amounts only to a huge tax , and then make it completely acceptable to the people , who will be happy to pay it , because they are led to believe that this will solve the problem of the approaching catastrophe that they have all been scared into believing .
So , then , why is it a fraud ?
No one has even bothered to ask an electrical engineer .
They have become so caught up in the science , that the root cause of the whole thing has become totally lost .
Any electrical engineer will tell you that there is no way to replace the power that is currently being delivered by those coal fired power plants .
True , it can be replaced by Nuclear power plants , but only a very few Countries are rich enough to instigate measures to construct those nuclear power plants , and we ’re not talking one or two nuclear plants .
We ’re talking in the vicinity of thousands of them .
So now you see the predicament regarding nuclear power plants .
Coal fired plants , ( and nuclear plants ) are the only ones that can run at near full speed for 24 hours of every day , barring scheduled and planned maintenance down time , supplying huge amounts of a constant and regular electrical power .
You will be led to believe that these plants can be replaced by the three versions of renewable power , that of wind turbines , Solar photovoltaic , and Concentrating Solar .
These three types of plant can never , and will never replace the constant power that is already being delivered by those coal fired power plants .
These three types of plant are enormously expensive , take years to construct , supply minimal power , can only deliver that power for less than one quarter the time at best , need vast Government subsides , both at the construction end , and also at the delivery of power end , last only one third of the time , and the scale of power they provide is barely the smallest fraction of coal fired power .
Again , this renewable power sector is also being used by Government bodies as they direct vast amounts of money to them in an effort to make them ‘ seem ’ that they can be scaled up to provide replacement power .
Those politicians and World leaders know all of these things , and they know it BEYOND ANY REASONABLE DOUBT .
The UN .
Well , they also know this , and they also know it BEYOND ANY REASONABLE DOUBT .
The both of them , world leaders and the UN are using the science for the reason of raising money , and here I ’m not talking piddling amounts , because this will amount to hundreds of billions of dollars , and even more .
Whichever way it goes , even if they can find a way to replace the power supplied from those coal fired plants , we ’re talking decades for it to come on line , and in the meantime , those coal fired plants will have to keep producing the power they do , and emitting the same amounts of CO2 they always have .
In those still developing countries , well they have no power that we in the Western World already have , and to that end , for them to actually develop , they must keep constructing power plants that can provide 24 hour a day electrical power , and that ’s those coal fired plants , because they are the cheapest at the front end , come on line the quickest , and the fuel to run them , the coal , is still plentiful , and relatively cheap , plentiful being the main thing here .
So , no matter what decision comes out of Copenhagen , those emissions levels will not only not be coming down , they will be increasing , and increasing steadily .
Major Western Governments will be using the science to impose that tax on emissions .
This tax will be imposed on the providers of that electrical power , those owners of the coal fired power plants .
They , in turn , will pass that cost down to the consumers of the electrical power in the three sectors that use it , the Residential sector , the Commerce sector , and the Industrial sector , so not only will your personal residential power bill rise , and rise considerably , but at every point , that charge will be added to all you buy , to all you have done , everything .
The ploy that the Government will use is that this new monetary impost is essential to reduce those emissions .
In fact , they have even stated that each year the emissions level that they impose will be lowered so that the plants will actually have to pay even more , and in the process , they have even spun this positively so that the people will not only accept it , but will be happy to do so , because they have been told that it is doing something good for the environment .
Because electricity is an essential of life in our Western World , and it is discretionary , then any changes you make to your level of consumption will be so minor as to not even register .
So , those coal fired plants will just keep humming along as they always have done , emitting the same amounts of CO2 , and no amount of tax will lower those emissions .
Meanwhile .
overall levels of emissions will be rising , as China especially , India secondarily , and those other developing Countries construct more of them so their people can actually have access to the electrical power that they do not currently have .
So that accounts for the major Countries that will be introducing , or attempting anyway , to introduce that new tax on those CO2 emissions .
The UN has also gotten onto this gravy train of an endless source of huge amounts of money by imposing costs on those Countries already with huge numbers of coal fired power plants .
Then , as well , they will be sending in Inspectors to every Country to monitor those emissions , work out how much then comes into the UN coffers , and then add on further penalties if , ( and that obviously means when ) those emissions increase , which will inexorably happen .
The confidence trick has been played on those scientists by those world leaders , and also by the UN .
Those scientists have n’t even bothered to find out what would happen if all those coal fired power plants were to be closed down .
The confidence trick has then been perpetrated down to the ordinary people who have been told only the science part of the equation , and not the consequences of closing down the source of those emissions .
They have now been fed so much science that the brainwashing process is all but complete .
The people themselves are almost willing to pay this huge new tax , and in fact a vast majority are actually clamoring for it to be introduced .
There is so much hypocrisy in all this that it is difficult to find a place to start , but the major part of the hypocrisy is that nobody has been told the side of the argument that shows the implications of this belief in that science .
I could n’t care less if you believe the science that the Atmospheric CO2 content ( 388 parts per million or 0.0388 % of the total Atmosphere ) is what alone is causing runaway Global Warming .
You can believe whatever you want to believe , or as is the case here , what you have been directed to believe .
What you need to be aware of in conjunction with that belief is the consequences .

Rupert Murdoch 's son - in - law says family members are " ashamed and sickened " of the mogul 's right - wing channel Fox News , in what Murdochologists said could be the opening salvo in a public battle for the soul of America 's most - watched news channel .
The attack on Fox by Matthew Freud , the British public relations guru who is married to Elisabeth Murdoch , caused an immediate sensation in the media industry , as much for the fact that it was made in public as for the strength of the words chosen .
And attention was focusing last night on the future of Fox 's combative founder and boss , Roger Ailes , the former aide to Richard Nixon who shaped the channel 's coverage in his own image as a right - wing rabble - rouser .
Fox emerged as a counterpoint to the perceived liberal bias of CNN and became the strongest cheerleader for the presidency of George W Bush , under its slogan of " fair and balanced " journalism .
Since the election of Barack Obama , the channel has given voice to opponents of the President and was boycotted by the White House over the summer for inflaming protests against proposed healthcare reform .
Agreeing to contribute his thoughts to a New York Times profile of Mr Ailes , Mr Freud stated : " I am by no means alone within the family or the company in being ashamed and sickened by Roger Ailes 's horrendous and sustained disregard of the journalistic standards that News Corporation , its founder and every other global media business aspires to . "
Mr Ailes has long been rumoured to have a tempestuous personal relationship with Rupert Murdoch , while the mogul 's children are known to have substantially more liberal views than those on show on Fox .
A recent biography of Mr Murdoch , The Man Who Owns The News by Michael Wolff , described how the mogul 's wife , Wendi Deng , persistently urged her husband to rein in the political coverage on Fox .
Mr Wolff said last night that Mr Freud 's statement could only be interpreted as a calculated attempt to put pressure on Mr Ailes .
" Matthew Freud , a PR man of extraordinary craftiness , is not going to say anything off the cuff , certainly not that .
I have never heard a shoe drop as loud .
I do n't believe Roger Ailes can continue in this company .
Not only has he been told that its controlling shareholders do n't want him , but he has been told they think he is despicable .
Something has just been set in motion . "
Mr Murdoch turns 79 in March , and has long been grooming his children to succeed him in running News Corporation , the family - controlled media giant , where Fox News is increasingly seen as the most valuable journalistic asset .
The company also owns The Times , The Sun and BSkyB in the UK , the Wall Street Journal , and Twentieth Century Fox movie studio , among other businesses .
The family 's voting rights will eventually be shared amongst Mr Murdoch 's adult children .
Of the four , only James Murdoch now works for News Corp , overseeing all its European and Asian divisions .
Elisabeth currently runs her own TV production business in the UK .
Mr Ailes was paid $ 23 m in salary , bonuses and benefits last year , more than Rupert Murdoch himself .
The two men are said to have clashed over Mr Murdoch 's flirtation with the idea of endorsing Mr Obama for the presidency last year .
In the end , the company 's US tabloid , the New York Post , stayed Republican but Mr Murdoch gave political donations to both sides .
Washington ( CNN ) -- African - Americans are extremely supportive of President Obama , but their enthusiasm appears to have dramatically dropped from earlier this year , according to a new national poll .
The CNN / Opinion Research Corp. survey , released Tuesday , also indicates that Obama 's presidency appears to have made blacks more optimistic about race relations , but less than one in five believe the new president has ushered in a new era of race relations in the country .
More than nine in 10 blacks questioned in the poll approve of the job Obama 's doing in the White House , far higher than 42 percent of whites who approve of his performance as president .
But when asked how they personally feel about Obama 's presidency , only 42 percent of black respondents say they 're thrilled , with nearly half of those questioned saying they are happy but not thrilled .
The 42 percent who are thrilled is down from 61 percent in January , when Obama was inaugurated .
" African - Americans are still big fans of the first black president in U.S. history , but the thrill is gone , " said CNN Polling Director Keating Holland .
According to the poll , 51 percent of African - Americans say Obama 's presidency has brought some improvement in race relations in the U.S. , but only 18 percent feel it 's the start of a new era .
Another 23 percent say they 've seen a real change in race relations over the past 11 months and 7 percent say things have gotten worse .
The survey indicates that three - quarters of blacks believe race relations will improve eventually , which is up from 49 percent of blacks who felt that way a year before Obama was elected .
" Whites take a dimmer view of Obama 's effect on race relations , with a third believing that the new presidency has not changed race relations in the country and 15 percent of whites saying that Obama has made race relations worse , " Holland added .
" Not surprisingly , whites are less supportive of Obama , although for a notable number of whites , their negative view of the president is due to the perception that he 's not been liberal enough . "
The CNN / Opinion Research Corporation poll was conducted December 16 - 20 , with 1,160 adult Americans , including 259 African - Americans and 786 whites , questioned by telephone .
The survey 's overall sampling error is plus or minus 3 percentage points and plus or minus 6 percentage points for the African - Americans sample .
CNN Deputy Political Director Paul Steinhauser contributed to this story
When South Carolina Governor Mark Sanford was caught red - handed returning from a tryst with his Argentine mistress last June , he told the Associated Press that he had met his " soul mate . "
His choice of words seemed to suggest that having a deep emotional and spiritual connection with Maria Belen Chapur somehow made his sexual infidelity to his wife Jenny Sanford less tawdry .
What the two - timing governor did n't understand is that most women view emotional infidelity as worse , not better , than sexual betrayal .
This may explain why Hillary Clinton stayed with Bill Clinton and seemed unconcerned about his sexual affair with Monica Lewinsky .
Research has documented that most men become much more jealous about sexual infidelity than they do about emotional infidelity .
Women are the opposite , and this is true all over the world .
The prevailing theory is that the difference has evolutionary origins :
Men learned over eons to be hyper - vigilant about sex because they can never be absolutely certain they are the father of a child , while women are much more concerned about having a partner who is committed to raising a family .
New research now suggests an alternative explanation .
The new study does not question the fundamental gender difference regarding jealousy -- indeed it adds additional support for that difference .
But the new science suggests that the difference may be rooted more in individual differences in personality that result from one 's relationship history but that can fall along gender lines .
Pennsylvania State University psychological scientists Kenneth Levy and Kristen Kelly doubted the prevailing evolutionary explanation because there is a conspicuous subset of men who like most women find emotional betrayal more distressing than sexual infidelity .
Why would this be ?
The researchers suspected that it might have to do with trust and emotional attachment .
Some people -- men and women alike -- are more secure in their attachments to others , while others tend to be more dismissive of the need for close attachment relationships .
Psychologists see this compulsive self - reliance as a defensive strategy -- protection against deep - seated feelings of vulnerability .
Levy and Kelly hypothesized that these individuals would tend to be concerned with the sexual aspects of relationships rather than emotional intimacy .
Similar to earlier studies examining sex differences in jealousy , Levy and Kelly asked men and women which they would find more distressing -- sexual infidelity or emotional infidelity .
Participants also completed additional assessments including a standard and well validated measure of attachment style in romantic relationships .
Findings confirmed the scientists ' hypotheses .
As Levy & Kelly report in Psychological Science , a journal of the Association for Psychological Science , those with a dismissing attachment style -- who prize their autonomy in relationships over commitment -- were much more upset about sexual infidelity than emotional infidelity .
And conversely , those securely attached in relationships -- including securely attached men -- were much more likely to find emotional betrayal more upsetting .
The scientists state that these findings imply that the psychological and cultural - environmental mechanisms underlying sex differences in jealousy may have greater roles than previously recognized and suggest that jealousy is more multiply determined than previously hypothesized .
Additionally , placing jealousy within an attachment theoretical perspective , highlights the value of a taking a more nuanced approach relative to earlier research , points to new research possibilities , and suggests that promoting secure attachment may be an effective means of reducing the kind of sexual jealousy that contributes to domestic violence .

WMR has learned from a veteran member of the White House Press Corps that the Obama administration has made it known through White House Press Secretary Robert Gibbs and other White House Communications officials that certain questions posed by the reporters who cover the White House are definitely off - limits .
On the banned list are any questions about Obama ’s post-Columbia University employment with Business International Corporation ( BIC ) , a global financial and political information company that WMR previously reported was a front for the CIA .
White House Press Corps members have been quietly told that any questions related to BIC , Obama ’s withheld records while he was a student at Occidental College in Los Angeles from 1979 to 1981 , or his records at Columbia , are forbidden .
At the same time he was attending Occidental , Obama , using the name Barry Soetoro and an Indonesian passport issued under the same name , traveled to Pakistan during the U.S. buildup to assist the Afghan mujaheddin .
WMR has learned from informed sources in Kabul that Obama has been extremely friendly , through personal correspondence on White House letterhead , with a private military company that counts among its senior personnel a number of Afghan mujaheddin - Soviet war veterans who fought alongside the late Northern Alliance commander Ahmad Shah Masood .
The firm is also involved in counter - insurgency operations in Colombia , where Obama is building seven new military bases , and Iraq .
[ efoods ]
In 1981 , Obama spent time in Jacobabad and Karachi , Pakistan , and appeared to have an older American “ handler , ” possibly a CIA officer .
WMR previously reported that Obama also crossed the border from Pakistan and spent some time in India .
At the time of Obama ’s stay in Pakistan , the country was being built up as a base for the anti-Soviet Afghan insurgency by President Carter ’s National Security Adviser Zbigniew Brzezinski and later by President Reagan ’s CIA director William Casey .
Obama has suspiciously refused to release his transcripts from Occidental or Columbia University and he has remained cagey about his post -Columbia employment with BIC .
The word from the White House Press Corps is that if anyone were to ask Obama about BIC or possible past CIA work , domestically or abroad , the offending reporter would see a quick pulling of the White House press credential .
The White House website states the following about openness and transparency by the Obama administration :
“ My Administration is committed to creating an unprecedented level of openness in Government .
We will work together to ensure the public trust and establish a system of transparency , public participation , and collaboration .
Openness will strengthen our democracy and promote efficiency and effectiveness in Government .

A traveling guitarist is becoming viral sensation after leading a group of passengers in a rousing round of the Beatles ' classic " Hey Jude " while stuck at Newark airport over the weekend .
Guitarist Josh Wilson posted the video on his YouTube channel following the security debacle at Newark Liberty when a security breach caused Terminal C to be shut down for over six hours .
Wilson leads the group of dozens of tourists , families and even some disinterested onlookers through the song , giving prompts through he verses and getting more clapping and encouragement during the chorus .
The video is titled : " Stuck in Newark Airport ( With Total Strangers ) :
A second video from a different angle was posted by a friend of Wilson 's who wrote : " Josh just could n't take it anymore and broke into song .
A few shaky moments but the " Na Na's " saved him .
Powerful Catharsis but the line was unmoved .
We 're still just sitting here an hour later .
Going to South Asia today ?
Doubt it . "
The delay was caused on Sunday when someone picking up a passenger told an officer guarding the exit that he thought he saw a man enter through the doors Sunday , TSA officials said .
TSA reviewed surveillance video before sweeping the airport , she said .
The video confirmed the man had entered through the exit , and officials made passengers leave the terminal and be rescreened , which caused massive delays .
Authorities found nothing suspicious when they searched the terminal after evacuating passengers .
They are still trying to determine the man 's identity .
Terminal C , where the security breach occurred , is used mostly by Continental Airlines .
Wilson did not return a request for comment -- hopefully he finally made it to South Asia .

Along with the hand - wringing by Democrats tonight in Washington , we ’re told that there also was a fair bit of dialing .
On the telephone , that is , as party leaders placed calls to some of the most vulnerable Democrats in the House and Senate .
Their goal ?
Try to halt any party switching , which already has eaten into the Democratic majority .
Head - hunters also are looking at some Democrats , urging them to consider leaving behind the hassle of seeking re-election in this challenging environment to join K Street or lead an association .
Already , Representative Earl Pomeroy , Democrat of North Dakota , is being eyed to lead the American Council of Life Insurers .
From Peter Baker , a White House correspondent :
The defeat , of course , is a blow for Democrats in Massachusetts .
But they bear more than a little of the blame themselves .
After all , Senator Edward M. Kennedy led the charge to change state law in 2004 to strip the governor of the power to appoint a senator until the next regular election .
Why ?
In case Senator John Kerry won the presidential race that year .
Democrats did not want Mitt Romney , the Republican governor , to appoint a successor to Mr. Kerry .
It turned out to be a moot point – until tonight .
From Katie Zezima at the Republican ’s campaign headquarters : “ I hope they ’re paying close attention because tonight the independent voice of Massachusetts has spoken , ” Mr Brown told his supporters .
“ From the Berkshires to Boston , from Springfield to Cape Cod the voters of this Commonwealth defied the odds and the experts .
Tonight the independent majority has delivered a great victory . ”
“ I am ready to go to Washington without delay , ” he said .
As Senator - elect Scott Brown gives his victory speech , supporters in the crowd shout “ 41 , 41 , ” alluding to his vow to add his vote in the Senate to those in the Republican minority who want to thwart the Senate Democrats ’ ability to avoid a filibuster on health care legislation .
The implications for tonight ’s outcome will be dissected for days to come .
And the results will haunt the Democrats for much longer .
Party leaders are urging against finger - pointing , with little immediate success .
Soon , the discussion will turn away from Massachusetts .
But to understand one side of what happened here , we caught up with Celinda Lake , the pollster for Ms. Coakley .
She touched off a bit of a furor earlier today when she said that the campaign did not have enough money to conduct polls and did not know that Mr. Brown was surging until it was too late .
Eric Schultz , a spokesman for the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee , dismissed that critique as “ categorically not true . ”
As Ms. Lake walked through the Sheraton Boston Hotel , where Ms. Coakley just finished delivering her concession speech , we stopped her for an interview .
Here is a portion of that conversation .
Q . Was there really no money for tracking polls ?
A . “ We were short of money at the end of December and early January .
We would have been up on the air and we would have been tracking if we had more money . ”
Q. But the Democrats control the levers of government in Washington .
Why was n’t more money available ?
She had more money than her opponent at the end of last year , right ?
A. : “ She ended the year with $ 600,000 cash on hand , but they needed the money for ads .
We still were n’t going up on the air with ads then .
It costs a million here to have even a decent buy .
This is a very expensive media state . ”
Q. So who is to blame for Ms. Coakley ’s defeat ?
Yana Paskova for The New York Times
A. “ I do n’t just blame the national situation .
I think Martha and the campaign should have been raising more money , too .
Everybody deserves some blame here . ”
“ The much bigger issue is recognizing the mood of the voters and really understanding what we should do in the next five months , so that we do n’t face a tsunami in November 2010 . ”
Q. People assume Democrats should win in Massachusetts .
Are they wrong ?
A. “ The National Democratic Senatorial Committee never understood how hard it is in Massachusetts .
They thought it was just the bluest of blue states .
It ’s Ted Kennedy ’s seat .
They did n’t understand how hard it is to elect a woman here , they did n’t understand how ornery the independents are .
They did n’t understand that it is n’t that blue .
You ’ve got previous Republican governors , not just one anomaly – Jane Swift , Romney , Weld . ”
Q . So what has been learned from this race ?
A . “ There are a lot of people in Washington underestimating what the mood is like out in the real world and how angry people are , how tough this economy is , how much people think that the Democrats have not delivered the change they promised and how much people want that change and we better deliver on it . ”
Q. Did the visit on Sunday by President Obama help ?
A. “ At that point we needed to get out the base and he delivered a fantastic message .
But we need that Wall Street message for the next five months . ”
From Katie Zezima at the Republican candidate ’s victory gala :
The crowd booed while Ms. Coakley was giving her concession speech .
Just before , Mr. Brown ’s daughter , Ayla , had been singing and announced : “ Ladies and gentlemen , Martha Coakley has just conceded the race .
Scott Brown is your next United States senator . ”
Bryce Vickmark for The New York Times
The Democratic candidate gives her speech , in defeat , and says she takes full blame for her loss .
But at the end , she invokes the words of Senator Edward M. Kennedy , saying the dream never dies .
The White House sent a clear signal this evening that it would not sanction a delay in certifying the vote or quickly seating Mr. Brown in the Senate .
To make the point , the president ’s spokesman referred to him in a statement as “ Senator Brown . ”
( He is , of course , already a state senator .
But soon will be a United States senator . )
“ The president congratulated Senator Brown on his victory and a well - run campaign , ” said Robert Gibbs , the White House press secretary .
“ The president told Senator Brown that he looks forward to working with him on the urgent economic challenges facing Massachusetts families and struggling families across our nation . ”
1 . He ran a better campaign – period .
Putting policies aside , his strategy took a page from the Obama playbook .
He tapped into the discontent in an electorate hungry for change .
He won over independent voters .
He captured his base .
( Initially , some Republicans said he was n’t a pure conservative , but those voices died down after his candidacy took off . )
2 . He was likeble .
His guy - next - door persona – in television ads and on bus tours across the state – appealed to voters .
3 . The discord that is very much alive inside the Republican Party was not visible in this race .
Republicans from outside Massachusetts largely stayed away – unlike last year ’s race in New York ’s 23rd Congressional district – so Mr. Brown could surround himself by sports stars and John Ratzenberger , who played the affable mailman , Cliff Clavin , on “ Cheers . ”
1 . Her candidacy was uneven and she came across in television ads and public appearances as a less likeable person .
She had no emotional connection with voters , while her opponent developed a movement - like following .
2 . Her strategists failed to define Mr. Brown .
She won the Democratic primary on Dec. 9 and soon began running what appeared to be a Rose Garden - like strategy .
Yes , she took a vacation over the Christmas holidays , but she also did n’t start running TV ads until after Mr. Brown had already introduced himself to voters .
3. Democrats in Washington were not properly focused on the race .
An air of overconfidence – it was , after all , Senator Edward M. Kennedy ’s seat – caught Democrats off guard until it was far too late .
There was a failure to recognize the anger percolating in the electorate .
The defeat for Ms. Coakley , which was expected in recent days , delivered a terrifying jolt to Democrats across the country .
The victory by Mr. Brown means that Republicans will have 41 votes in the Senate and will suddenly have a far louder voice on Capitol Hill .
The loss for Democrats marks the third - straight defeat in a major race in which Mr. Obama has campaigned on behalf of the party ’s candidate .
The White House had dismissed losses in the New Jersey and Virginia governors ’ races last year as isolated incidents , but the lead pollster for Ms. Coakley warned that Democrats must recalibrate .
“ We ’ve got Virginia , we ’ve got New Jersey and we ’ve got Massachusetts , ” Celinda Lake , the pollster for Ms. Coakley said in an interview .
“ We , as a party , have to figure out what we ’re going to do about that before this wave hits the 2010 elections . ”
Martha Coakley has conceded the Senate race to Scott Brown in a stunning victory in Massachusetts that will erode the Democratic supermajority in the Senate and upend the second year of President Obama ’s administration .
From Katie Zezima , the Brown camp rejoices :
State Representative Karyn Polito just announced , that with 49 percent of the vote in , it was 52 for Mr. Brown and 47 for Ms. Coakley .
At Brown headquarters , the crowd exploded and chanted : “ Go Scott Go . ”
A Brown supporter , Joanne Reilly , 49 , a financial planner from Wakefield , and a registered Republican , enthused : “ I ’m elated for the state of Massachusetts .
I ’m elated as a Massachusetts Republican .
My vote actually counts .
I ’m elated for our country because it will help put us on the right track . ”
You can watch the returns come in , click by click , right here on our interactive map .
From Katie Zezima at the Park Plaza Hotel where the Brown campaign is stationed :
Former Massachusetts Gov. Mitt Romney is here , for the first time during Mr. Brown ’s run , receiving a huge cheer when he stepped onto the press riser .
The room is packed with supporters .
And they ’re giving away the CD of Mr. Brown ’s daughter , Ayla , who was an “ American Idol ” contestant .
( She placed sixth , by the way , and has been featured in her father ’s campaign . )
Update : Brown s-Supporters listened to the Flutie brothers band , with Doug on drums , playing songs including “ Sweet Home Alabama ” as they ate tortellini , cheese and dumplings .
The polls are now closed – after 13 hours of voting here – and optimism abounded among Republicans as a sense of gloom hung over Democrats from here to Washington .
If their mood matches the real returns , Scott Brown expects to deliver a victory speech before the 11 p.m. news .
But a word of caution :
We ’re not calling the race and do n’t expect others to until a fair sample of the vote totals come in .
That , however , did not stop aides to Mr. Brown from speaking with bold confidence .
“ For a Republican to win in Massachusetts you need to run a near perfect campaign , you have to hope your opponent makes a few mistakes , and you need the issues on your side , ” Eric Fehrnstrom , a spokesman for Mr. Brown , told reporters tonight at the Park Plaza Hotel .
“ And we had all three working in Scott Brown ’s favor . ”
Democrats were studying turnout models and disappointed by what appeared to be lower - than - expected turnout in minority precincts , which typically trend Democratic .
The enthusiasm gap – obvious during the final weeks of the campaign – was apparent here tonight as well .
Crowds began to gather at the Park Plaza Hotel , where Mr. Brown had established his home base tonight , while a silence hung in the air at the Sheraton Boston Hotel , where Ms. Coakley is headquartered .
Stay tuned for updates as the real vote totals begin coming in later this hour .
Yana Paskova for The New York Times
Throughout the day , our reporters have been talking to voters as they headed to and from the polls , which close at 8 p.m .
In fact , an interactive feature captures residents ’ sentiments as they explained why they voted the way they did .
In North Andover , Katie Zezima interviewed a mother - daughter team , both of whom have long histories of voting for Democratic candidates but who switched allegiances in this hotly contested race .
The views below are telling , in a way , because they perhaps underscore the shifts to State Senator Scott Brown that pollsters and the campaigns have picked up on in recent days among independent voters and some Democrats in a race that a month ago looked like a shoo - in for Martha Coakley , the Democratic candidate .
From Ms. Zezima : Marlene Connolly , 73 , of North Andover , says she cast her first vote for a Republican today , forced to return to her polling place after waiting 45 minutes initially when the lines were long .
She left to pick up her grandson from school , and then waited another 20 minutes before finally getting her opportunity to be heard in the voting booth .
“ I voiced my opinion and voted for a Republican , and the roof did not cave in , ” Ms. Connolly said .
“ I ca n’t believe I ’m saying this and if my husband were alive you ’d hear a roar , but I think I am now a Republican .
I ’m just devastated by what Obama ’s doing .
I do n’t think he cares enough about anything other than his own personal agenda or this foolish health care bill . ”
It did give her pause to consider putting a Republican in to fill the seat of the late Senator Kennedy , she said .
“ It bothered me very much that it ’s Kennedy ’s seat , that did bother me .
But the health bill totally upsets me .
First of all , do we really know what ’s going on with it ?
It ’s always evasive when they ’re talking about it . ”
Most upsetting to her was the proposed deal made for unions recently on the excise tax .
“ My daughter and her husband work for companies that are not unionized and they would get slammed , ” she explained .
But she also said that while it was fair for the president to place blame on the administration of former President George W. Bush for the economic situation , President Obama ’s programs would also increase the nation ’s debt .
“ My little grandson and his children will be paying for all these things , these giveaways .
I ’m a JFK person , and Jack would give you a hand up , not a handout .
And that ’s the difference .
The Democratic party is not Jack Kennedy ’s party and , ergo , I voted for Senator Brown .
I think he ’ll help change our tide .
Of course he ’s only one person , but he scared the Dickens out of the Democrats , ” Ms. Connolly said .
See the related article by Liz Robbins on the turnout , with more voters talking about the decisions they made today .
Michael Cooper relays :
Here , in time for watching the Senate returns come in , is a brief primer on the political geography of Massachusetts , courtesy of David Paleologos , the director of the Political Research Center at Suffolk University in Boston .
Martha Coakley , the Democrat running for the seat long held by Edward M. Kennedy , will need a big turnout , and wide margins , in the state ’s urban areas , Mr. Paleologos said : greater Boston , Springfield , Fall River , New Bedford and Lawrence .
Scott Brown , the Republican running for the seat , needs to do well in the vote - rich crescent of suburbs surrounding Boston – the swath between Interstate 495 and Route 128 – whose many independent voters have proven key in electing Republicans governor of Massachusetts for 16 years until 2006 .
In a state where Democrats outnumber Republicans by three to one , but a majority of voters are independents , the highest concentrations of Democrats are still in urban areas , Mr. Paleologos said .
Suffolk County , which includes Boston , is the only county in the state where a majority of voters are registered Democrats .
So she must win by wide
margins in urban areas , and he must win by wide margins in the suburbs .
“ Her base is urban , ’’ Mr. Paleologos said .
“ His strength is going to be in a lot of the suburban , or rural communities . ’’
Mr. Paleologos said that Mr. Brown ’s strength was likely to come in places like North Andover , Middleton , Wellesley and his home base of Wrentham .
He added that he would expect Ms. Coakley to do well around her home in Medford , in parts of Middlesex County , where she served as district attorney , and in North Adams , where she is from .
Then there are the bellwethers : places like Fitchburg , Gardner and Peabody that he said have closely tracked the statewide results in past similar elections .
“ We ’ll be looking closely at those , ’’ he said .
Much of the analysis about the race quickly gets back to finger - pointing among three Democratic establishments :
The Coakley campaign , the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee and the White House political apparatus .
We ’re not predicting the outcome .
Without exit polls in this race , we are patient enough to wait for the ballots to be counted tonight .
( Several strategists here believe the results could be known by 9:30 p.m. )
But before then , let ’s ask a hypothetical question : If Ms. Coakley loses tonight , what is the morning headline ?
Democrats Lose Seat or Republicans Seize Victory ?
The point here is this : Republicans in Washington have deliberately been quiet about their role in Mr. Brown ’s campaign , fearful that the campaign would devolve into a sideshow among the various factions of the Republican Party .
( Who can forget the race in New York ’s 23rd Congressional district late last year ? )
It was a sign of discipline that has n’t been seen in Republican quarters for awhile .
It makes us wonder whether the Republican campaign committees in the House and Senate – outmatched in recent years by Democrats – have returned to the pole position .
Sheryl Gay Stolberg , from the White House briefing room :
With Democrats in full finger - pointing mode , the White House tried valiantly to stay out of the who - is - to - blame and what - will - happen - next debate over the tight race for the Senate in Massachusetts .
But Robert Gibbs , the White House press secretary , did say President Obama was not happy about the situation in which the Democrat , Martha Coakley finds herself .
“ He was both surprised and frustrated , ” Mr. Gibbs said .
“ Angry ? ” one reporter asked .
“ Not pleased , ” Mr. Gibbs replied .
Later , another reporter pressed for elaboration .
Who is displeasing the president ?
Mr. Gibbs would n’t say .
Would the White House change the State of the Union address next week if Mr. Brown , the Republican , prevailed in the election ?
“ I do n’t think that ’s true .
No , ” Mr Gibbs said .
Whatever the outcome on Tuesday , the president will still talk about jobs , about fiscal responsibility , about Iraq and Afghanistan and terrorism , he said .
Given that the speechwriters were working on the address to Congress “ right now , ” Mr. Gibbs said that he did n’t expect them to rip it all up tomorrow .
But if Mr. Brown wins , he was asked , will the president ’s body language for the State of the Union shift from boldness to contrition ?
“ I think the president understands that regardless of what happens in Massachusetts , we face a set of circumstances that have to be dealt with , ” Mr. Gibbs said , whether there are 59 seats or 60 in the Senate that are counted on the president ’s side .
“ We still have to work hard to get our economy back , ” he said .
“ I do n’t believe there ’s an entirely new agenda behind some door based on the result of tonight . ”
And with House and Senate leaders talking about a Plan B for health care — having the House simply pass the Senate bill and send it quickly to Mr. Obama for his signature — Mr. Gibbs would not say whether Mr. Obama favors such a plan .
“ These are all going to be great questions tomorrow , ” he said .
Would he promise to answer them tomorrow ?
“ I promise I ’ll be here tomorrow , ” he said .
Michael Cooper tells us that State Senator Brown took some time out on Election Day to run a few errands .
By midday he had taken out the trash , been to the post office and gone to the bank , an aide said .
But he did campaign a bit , too .
He called into several radio programs , visited phone banks without reporters to thank volunteers and took part in what the aide called his usual Election Day ritual : phoning hundreds of friends and neighbors to personally ask for their vote .
As Election Day moves beyond the midpoint , there seems to be little optimism – or excitement – in the voices of Democrats here .
Early field reports for Democrats suggest turnout is falling below expectations in several key areas , including precincts dominated by black voters , the party ’s traditionally reliable sector of the electorate .
So the president is weighing in through a last - ditch appeal to supporters across the country , asking them to make telephone calls to Massachusetts voters .
For days now , members of Organizing for America have been logging hundreds of thousands of calls .
It remains an open question if the long - distance persuasion has had any effect .
“ The polls are still open , the choice has not been made , and you still have a crucial role to play by calling voters in Massachusetts , ” Mr. Obama said in his e-mail appeal .
“ In a low - turnout special election like this one , every single voter counts . ”
The flood of calls – from candidates and outside interest groups – is contributing to a sense of overload , according to several voter interviews .
And here ’s another potential worry , which was just passed along by a Democrat .
What if the robust calling effort is turning out voters for Mr. Brown , instead ?
Dalia Sussman , one of our polling editors , offers us this glimpse of the electorate :
As voters choose who should fill the seat long held by the late Edward M. Kennedy , an analysis by Gallup points out , perhaps somewhat surprisingly , that the state ’s residents are no more likely than all Americans to identify themselves as Democrats .
Gallup combined 350,000 interviews that it conducted across the country in 2009 ( including 8,580 in Massachusetts ) , and found that 35 percent of Massachusetts residents call themselves Democrats , matching the national average .
Compared with all Americans , however , Bay State adults were more apt to label themselves independents and far less likely to call themselves Republicans .
About half ( 49 percent ) identified as independents , compared with 35 percent nationally .
And just 13 percent said Republican — that ’s 14 percentage points below the national average for last year .
At the same time , when independents were asked which party they leaned toward , most said the Democratic Party .
That helps explain the edge the party usually has in the state as well as why Mr. Obama ’s approval rating in Massachusetts last year was about 10 percentage points higher than Gallup ’s national average .
Nevertheless , Gallup ’s analysis notes : “ This political environment is not necessarily rigidly Democrat , but instead one built on an underlying structure with a substantial independent component . ”
Indeed , despite such low Republican identification , Gallup points out that four of the state ’s last five governors have been Republican .
BOSTON – One of the biggest questions surrounding Tuesday ’s Senate election in Massachusetts has been this :
What will the turnout be ?
So far , several early indications suggest that voters are responding to the race with considerable interest .
It ’s hardly a surprise , considering that the race here between Attorney General Martha Coakley and State Senator Scott Brown has taken on the frenzy of a presidential campaign .
Matt Campbell / European Pressphoto Agency
A spokesman for the Secretary of State ’s office said that by 9 a.m. , two hours after the voting began , more than twice as many people had cast ballots than during the same time period in the December primary .
That , of course , was long before the race became nationalized .
We ’re following the developments here throughout the day from our team on the ground in Boston and across the state .
Yana Paskova for The New York Times
Michael Cooper reports from Boston : Some political candidates assume that by Election Day , they have done all they can , so they rest up and wait for returns to come in .
( Senator John McCain , for example , was known to go to the movies on Election Days past . )
But Ms. Coakley has packed her last day full of campaign stops .
She developed a reputation early on in the campaign for keeping a light schedule and shying away from the kind of retail politics that many New Englanders expect .
But on Tuesday , she is hitting key urban bases where she needs a high turnout from Democrats .
She met morning commuters in Boston , with plans to stop at diners in New Bedford and Fall River , followed by greeting voters in Springfield , Worcester and Boston .
Her fate , of course , depends largely on whether she can draw enough Democrats to the polls to counter the success that her opponent , Mr. Brown , seems to be enjoying from independent voters in the suburbs .
In some places , voting seemed brisk to Republicans and Democrats alike .
Earl Berner , 63 , chairman of the Leicester Republican Committee , said at midmorning that turnout “ is incredible .
It is like rush hour now and it ’s been going on all morning . ”
Dispatches from several polling places Tuesday morning — while not a scientific sample by any means — showed that for some voters , the health care debate in Washington held some resonance .
Mr. Brown had vowed on the campaign trail to become the 41st vote against the legislation , which if he won would leave the Senate Democrats without their supermajority .
From Marlborough , Anne Lenault , 56 , who identified herself as an independent , said she backed Ms. Coakley to help continue the agenda that the late Senator Edward M. Kennedy held dear .
“ I did n’t feel that someone like Scott Brown could replace Ted Kennedy ’s ideas and views , ” Ms. Lenault said .
“ Coakley had more of the views I was looking for to replace Ted . ”
But on the Republican side , Kevin Trenholme , 44 , an engineer , was among those who cast a vote reflecting the antigovernment sentiment that Mr. Brown seemed to have tapped into .
“ I voted for Brown to hopefully control the craziness in Washington , ” said Mr. Trenholme .
“ Health care is being forced down our throats . ”
A similar view was voiced in Leicester by Robert Rivard , 67 , a retired mechanical engineer and independent , who said his vote was as much for Mr. Brown as it was “ also a statement about what I do n’t want . ”
“ I do n’t like business as usual , which is what we have now , and I also recognize the national consequences with this election .
I do n’t like that the health care bill is being ramrodded through , ” Mr. Rivard added .
Other voters interviewed in Leicester seemed to hope that some type of health care overhaul could be achieved .
Helen Shuster , 73 , a retired library director and Democrat who helped make calls on Ms. Coakley ’s behalf , said getting the bill passed was a pressing issue .
“ It is critically important for the country , and while it is not perfect , we need to do something . ”

In an annular eclipse , the Moon does not quite cover the Sun 's disc
One of smallest satellites ever flown by the European Space Agency ( Esa ) has returned its first images of the Sun .
On Tuesday , mission managers hailed the excellent performance of the Proba - 2 technology demonstration spacecraft .
The PRoject for OnBoard Autonomy satellite is intended to test hardware and software that might be incorporated into future Esa missions .
The 0.6 m by 0.6 m by 0.8 m box includes new computer , battery , thruster , and solar panel systems .
It also carries some instruments to study the Sun and the space environment .
The satellite is part of a series of technology demonstration missions
At a press conference at the Royal Observatory of Belgium in Brussels , the Proba team unveiled the spacecraft 's first solar observations .
These included pictures of the annular solar eclipse on 15 January , which was seen from the Earth 's surface across much of Africa and Asia .
Proba - 2 was a secondary payload on the rocket which launched Esa 's flagship " water mission " - the Soil Moisture and Ocean Salinity ( Smos ) Earth Explorer .
Future Proba missions will be used by Esa to test new Earth observation techniques and the technology to fly spacecraft in formation .

In July , Chinese authorities blocked Twitter because of protest - related content .
Microblogging spreads in China , even without Twitter BEIJING 
When Chinese student Rachel Zhang discovered Twitter last April , she realized her " little dream " of sharing with strangers the movies that made her laugh and the books that made her cry .
Then , in July , Beijing blocked the U.S. - based microblogging site , where users post brief updates as fast as they can tap on their cellphones .
Zhang , 24 , a postgraduate student at Communication University of China , fell silent .
That is , until Chinese media giant Sina launched its own Twitter - like service recently .
But that service came with a price : Chinese authorities can monitor traffic and curtail its use .
" No one likes to have second thoughts before writing personal blogs , " she says .
Microblogging — the sending of brief text , audio or video to select groups — is growing rapidly among China 's estimated 360 million Internet users , according to New Weekly magazine in China .
The magazine 's Jan. 15 cover story is titled " Micro Revolution . "
China shut down
Twitter access after it was used to transmit images and messages about riots against the government in western China .
YouTube and several other social - networking sites remain blocked , too .
But there are many sites that the " Great Firewall of China , " as it is widely known , has not impeded .
Even on those sites , there is " more debate and criticism by Chinese people than at anytime in history , " China Internet specialist Jeremy Goldkorn says .
ARCHIVE : Social - networking sites Twitter , Flickr go dark in China TECH LIVE : News and gadgets from USA TODAY reporters " You 're seeing networks of people forming links outside the state , and this alarms the state , so they want to monitor microblogging closely , " says Goldkorn , whose Danwei website also was blocked in July .
" The government is determined to control the discourse on the Internet , and is in a very censorious mode . "
China 's communist authorities do n't see all unfettered microblogging as bad .
State - controlled media laud the Internet , especially microblogging , for providing the public a way to keep officials in check .
" With this new tool , there will be more citizens supervising the government , " says Min Dahong , a new - media researcher at the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences in Beijing .
Beijing 's chief concern lies in the Internet 's power to mobilize , Goldkorn says .
Despite the government 's efforts , " the genie is out of the bottle . "
In December , the Ministry of Public Security promised stricter control of the Internet and closer monitoring of new forums such as microblogging .
The Internet " is not only a new technology , new media , but also a new ideological front , " the state - run Xinhua News Agency reported this month .
Min , a microblogger on both Twitter and Sina , sees more " political issues " discussed on the former .
" I think Sina microblog users know the bottom line , so they wo n't publish radical opinions , " Min says .
China - based Twitter users must " climb the wall , " a phrase describing Internet access through proxy servers that evade the censors .
There they can find posts such as Beijing film professor Cui Weiping 's short interviews with intellectuals about the Dec. 25 jailing of dissident Liu Xiaobo , punished for his role in a pro-democracy manifesto that was disseminated online .
Rachel Zhang knows how to " climb the wall , " but rarely bothers .
" I believe many microblog users perform their own ' censorship ' before the supervisors , because we cherish this platform , " she says .
" I may read or quote interesting words of others , but I 'm careful about what I write down myself . "

— The State Bureau of Investigation was called in Wednesday morning to investigate after a man died in an altercation with a Wayne County deputy , authorities said .
Deputy Martin McAlduff used a stun gun to subdue Joe Spruill Jr. during the incident , said Capt .
Tom Effler of the Wayne County Sheriff 's Office .
The incident began at about 5:30 a.m. when deputies responded to a report of a fight near the intersection of N.C. Highway 111 and Dollard Town Road , southeast of Goldsboro , Effler said .
When McAlduff and Deputy Zachary Kinlaw arrived at the scene , they did n't see any evidence of a fight and searched the area .
The deputies found Spruill sitting on a porch on Thrasher Circle nearby and were escorting him to his Dollard Town Road home when he became unruly , Effler said .
The deputies said Spruill began throwing things at them and resisted when they tried to take him into custody for disorderly conduct , Effler said , so McAlduff fired his stun gun .
One prong of the stun gun hit Spruill near the neck , and the second hit him in the back , Effler said .
The deputies called EMS , which is standard protocol , he said , but while waiting for paramedics to arrive , they noticed Spruill was lying motionless on the road .
Paramedics declared Spruill dead at the scene .
Joe Spruill Sr. said his son had collapsed in late December and had been hospitalized for heart problems .
He said his son was still on medication for his condition .
Jessica Spruill said her husband was well known in the area and that deputies knew he had a heart condition .
" They were very aware of the situation in reference to his health and what happened at Christmas , " Jessica Spruill said .
" They knew his heart was bad , and they ( used a stun gun on ) him anyway . "
Effler said the deputies did n't know about Joe Spruill Jr. 's alleged heart condition .
He noted that deputies used a stun gun on him about a year and a half ago for not cooperating during another investigation .
" At this point , I do not know of anything that they have done wrong , " he said .
McAlduff has been placed on administrative duty , pending the outcome of the SBI investigation .
That is standard procedure when someone dies in an incident involving a law enforcement officer .
Joe Spruill Jr. has a criminal record dating to 1996 , with convictions on several drug charges and for assault , according to state Department of Correction records .
He is survived by a wife and four children .
" God gave him back to us , " Jessica Spruill said , recalling her husband 's collapse a month ago .
" He pulled through that .
He was able to have second chance , and the police took that away from him ( Wednesday ) morning .
" Outraged is far from what I 'm feeling , " she said .
( PhysOrg.com ) --
Researchers from Yale Cancer Center and other institutions are the first to demonstrate how distinct groups of cells from the same tumor are capable of forming tumors .
Their findings , which appear January 1 in the journal Cancer Research , could impact the evaluation of patient therapy .
The research team , led by Marcus Bosenberg , M.D. , Ph.D. , lead author and associate professor of dermatology and pathology at Yale School of Medicine , generated new mouse models of melanoma to study differences between cells in the same tumor .
Using stem cell markers , they were able to divide tumor cells into three distinct groups .
One group of cells always formed tumors after injection of a single cell , a second sometimes formed tumors , and the third group of cells rarely formed tumors .
These results are the first to show high rates of tumor formation following the injection of single purified cells .
Until now , laboratories have attempted to purify cells capable of reforming tumors in mouse models but typically needed 100 - 100,000 purified cells , which slowed the analysis process .
“ This is the only time a research group has been able to take individual cells from a cancer and determine that one will definitely form a tumor and the other will not , ” Bosenberg said .
“ This detailed analyses will help us to develop more effective treatment options for our patients and may explain why some patients have a partial - response to treatment . ”
The ability to purify the specific cancer - causing cells within a tumor may allow for a more comprehensive evaluation of the molecular features that define tumor - forming capability and resistance to chemotherapy .

WASHINGTON -- The White House will announce plans Wednesday to provide another $ 5 billion in tax credits for manufacturers of wind , solar , electric vehicle and other renewable energy products , hoping to leverage at least $ 15 billion in private investment and create " tens of thousands " of jobs .
The expansion would increase three - fold the $ 2.3 billion available in the Section 48C Advanced Energy Manufacturing Tax Credit program , part of the $ 787 billion stimulus package enacted in February .
That program has been over - subscribed ....
Both of my SS gifts arrived the about a day apart .
The second gift was delivered by FedEx a day after the first gift and was stolen ( along with the first gift ) 10 minutes later .
Fortunately , I had a camera watching the whole time .
I just wish I got the license plate# .
I attached a pic of the asshole .
I 'm sorry Secret Santas . :(

At the molecular level , proteins that belong to these extremophiles have evolved toward a biased amino acid composition , which reduces the interactions with the solvent .

Immersed in waters saltier than chicken soup , salt - tolerant “ halophilic ” microorganisms are able to thrive in conditions that would reduce a less - adapted organism to a shriveled remnant .
One way halophilic archaea avoid this fate is by bathing their molecular machinery in a similarly salty intracellular environment that would cause ordinary proteins to lose their shape .
How do the proteins inside these cells survive ?
At least part of the answer seems to relate to an abundance of certain amino acid residues on the protein surface .
Salt - tolerant proteins tend to have lots of aspartic acid , glutamic acid , and other non-hydrophobic residues on their surfaces .
They also tend to have fewer lysines than similar proteins from non-halophilic counterparts , their places often being taken by bulkier arginine instead .
What traits of these residues make them salt - friendly ?
One school of thought suggests it 's the charge they carry .
Another suggests it 's not so much charge as the size of the side chain that gives these residues their evolutionary edge in a saline setting .
To determine what allows extremophile proteins to tolerate salt , Oscar Millet , Xavier Tadeo , and colleagues analyzed the structure and thermodynamics of three protein domains under different salt concentrations :
Hv 1ALigNm from Haloferax volcanii , a halophile found in places like the Dead Sea and Great Salt Lake ; Ec 1ALigN from Escherichia coli ; and ProtL from the mesophilic Streptococcus magnus .
They then used site - directed mutagenesis to create three broad classes of domain mutations : mutations in which the amino acid side chain length changed but the charge did not , mutations in which the charge changed but the length did not , and mutations in which both length and charge were altered .
Analyzing the structure and thermodyamics of the altered domains , the investigators found that reducing the size of the residue 's side chain without changing its charge improved salt tolerance in both Hv 1ALigN and Ec 1ALigN .
Lengthening the side chain had the opposite impact on mutation of all three domains being investigated .
Mutations increasing the negative charge of the domain , on the other hand , showed little impact on salt tolerance in any of the three protein domains studied .
The researchers also investigated whether the tendency of halophiles ' protein surfaces to have arginine rather than lysine had any effect on the proteins ' ability to cope with salt .
They found that substituting lysines for arginines or other polar residues with small side chains increased the salt tolerance of ProtL.
Introduction of lysine residues , with their long side chains onto the surface of Hv 1ALigN , decreased stability in salty solutions .
To further explore the connections between residue side chains and salt tolerance , the researchers used other types of mutagenic systems to alter a different set of residues on the surface of the proteins .
The results indicated that it is the nature of a mutation , and not its location , that alters the proteins ' ability to withstand a salt assault .
Interestingly , the researchers also discovered that salt tolerance is not the only characteristic conferred by the particular mix of residues found in halophilic proteins .
Their residue substitution experiments also showed that the abundance of aspartic acid and glutamic acid characteristics of halophilic proteins is good not only for salt tolerance but also for solubility — another valuable trait in conditions typical of high - salt environments .
Concluding from their experiments that residue compactness and not charge is what matters most when it comes to surviving in salt , the researchers assessed salt tolerance and ( using high - resolution NMR ) the accessible solvent surface area in two multiply mutated versions of ProtL , in an attempt to quantify the relationship .
They found that a decrease in surface area correlated well with an increase in salt tolerance , indicating that tight packing is the trick for preventing salt from trashing proteins .
At the same time , they also discovered that such packing is not a survival skill that 's fit for all conditions .
When the same mutants were exposed to a low - salt environment , the molecules destabilized , indicating that the mutations that made them better able to tolerate salt also made them less able to tolerate its absence .
All together , these findings not only shed light on a fascinating evolutionary trait , but also provide valuable insights into what it takes to survive in a saline environment — information that could be applied to engineer proteins in a way that does not alter their biological function but does confer salt tolerance beyond what they naturally would endure .

While the US and other countries beef up airport searches for terrorists , an Israeli expert advises that eying passenger behavior is critical .
While the United States and other countries beef up airport searches for terrorists , an Israeli expert advises that eying passenger behavior is critical for preventing attacks .
Rafi Sela , a security consultant at Ben Gurion International Airport , explained to the Canadian news agency Canwest , " If you have a suicide bomber or somebody who wants to make an impact , he does n't have to bring down a plane .
He can just explode in the middle of this huge crowd that is waiting for security . "
Sela 's advice was given shortly after the United States announced stricter inspections following last month ’s failed bombing of an Amsterdam - Detroit flight .
Passengers overcame the terrorist , who had put together an explosive device on board .
Following the incident , Amsterdam officials hastily installed expensive scanning equipment .
Airlines and other companies around the world have frequently studied Israel ’s airport and airline security to learn how to combat terrorists .
The United States often has been charged by minority groups with “ profiling , ” but Sela criticized security procedures that check everyone equally , regardless of whether he is a potential threat or a tourist who is among the majority of harmless travelers .
" You have to actually look for the things that are dangerous , and not just scan everybody , " he advises .
“ This calls for a total change in approach to the transportation security issue . "
Sela said that direct eye contact by security officials can help them spot abnormal behavior .
Using such procedures probably would have stopped last month ’s bomb maker if he had tried to board the plane in Israel - although no system is failsafe , Sela added .
He also noted that the security warnings that the U.S. State Department received on the terrorist would have red-flagged him at Ben Gurion Airport .
The United States has announced it is increasing body scans and physical inspections for all passengers from 14 countries that are considered prone to terror .
They are Cuba , Iran , Sudan , Syria , Afghanistan , Algeria , Iraq , Lebanon , Libya , Nigeria , Pakistan , Saudi Arabia , Somalia and Yemen .
The Transportation Security Administration said that the " majority ” of all other passengers , including American citizens , will undergo stricter security searches .
In order to create an atmosphere where these greedy objectives can be accomplished the Western and even Eastern media have constantly shown atrocities being committed against the ordinary people of Afghanistan and Pakistan , in markets , universities and public gathering places and have then blamed these on the perceived enemy , in order to discredit any legitimate struggle for liberation and in order to demonise them in the eyes of the world and thereby justify the occupation and real intentions .
The truth about such bloodshed and mayhem is only now becoming public knowledge after information about the real perpetrators has emerged ( such as the CIA related agency Black Water ) .
The billions of dollars paid to the Pakistan regime by the USA / UK alliance and to the Secret services in Pakistan , their army and to the Karzai Afghan regime by way of bribes has led them to slaughter their own citizens with the help of the USA / UK and to then blame the Taliban in an attempt to subdue those seeking liberation to fulfil their right to run their lives by divine law and to protect the US / UK military and economic interests .
With additional atrocities being committed by the USA and UK through indiscriminate air raids and other operations the number of ordinary Muslim men , women and children who have been killed has reached horrendous proportions .
Not to mention the torture and abuse of basic rights by the occupiers in Afghanistan , such as in Bagram Air Base , the case of Dr Affia Siddiqui being a clear and brutal example .
EGYPTIAN OFFICIALS yesterday confirmed that Cairo is covertly constructing an underground steel barrier along the border with Gaza to cut smuggling into the Strip .
They contradicted a report in the Cairo daily Al - Shorouk quoting an unidentified source who said , “ Egypt is dealing with smuggling seriously and is capable of stopping it without [ a ] wall . ”
When completed in 18 months ’ time , the impenetrable and indestructible wall will be 10 - 11 km in length and will extend 18 - 30 m below the surface along the 13 km - long border .
Four kilometres have , reportedly , been completed north of the town of Rafah , which is bisected by the border that also divides Palestinian families – many of whom are involved in the illegal cross - border trade .
Over the past year the number of tunnels has doubled from 750 to 1,500 .
They carry essential goods , household appliances , fuel , medicines , fertiliser , seeds , clothing , motorbikes , and even the occasional car .
If the flow of goods is impaired or interdicted , the 1.5 million Gazans would be reduced to reliance on the ration package con- taining flour , pulses and tea distributed by UN agencies .
Only basic supplies are permitted to enter the Strip through goods crossings controlled by Israel , which tightened its blockade of Gaza following the seizure of power there by Hamas in June 2007 .
Israel routinely bombs tunnels it claims are used for explosives and weapons traffic , while Cairo tries to tackle smuggling by arresting dealers , closing down warehouses on the Egyptian side of the frontier and blowing up tunnels .
Last March , the US provided Egypt with $ 32 million ( €21.75 million ) to install electronic surveillance devices and other equipment to prevent smuggling .
Since these efforts have failed to halt or seriously limit commerce , Cairo is said to have come under pressure from the US and Israel to agree to the sinking of an underground barrier .
US army engineers have designed the wall , modelled on structures used to reinforce levees in hurricane - prone New Orleans .
US firms have manufactured its sections , which fit together like a jigsaw puzzle .
Farmers and herdsmen have remarked on the clearing of land near the border , and local municipal official Suleiman Bair said farmers would be compensated for the loss of fruit and olive trees .
Shoot - outs have erupted between Egyptian police and Bedouin tribesmen involved in smuggling and tunnel protection .
Confirmation of the construction of the underground wall coincided with an appeal issued by dozens of UN agencies , inter - national organisations and national non-governmental bodies for $ 664.4 million to finance humanitarian programmes in Gaza , East Jerusalem and areas of the West Bank where the Palestinian economy has been devastated by Israel ’s settlements , separation wall , checkpoints and restrictions on movement .
UN humanitarian co-ordinator Maxwell Gaylard asserted : “ The continued erosion of livelihoods and the denial of basic human rights together are compelling Palestinians to become more and more dependent on international aid . ”
A wall between Egypt and Gaza is likely to deepen the distress and dependence of Palestinians trapped in the Strip .

The half - naked body of a 51 - year - old trans woman was found last week in
a vacant lot in the Montrose area of Houston .
But reports of
Myra Ical ’s death have been salacious at best , with mainstream media
referring to Ical as a man and saying the area where her body was found
was known by police to be frequented by prostitutes and drug users .
The Houston Chronicle reported that Ruben Dario Ical “ also went by the name of Myra Chanel Ical ” and that “ he had numerous bruises and defensive wounds , as if he had struggled against his attacker . ”
Police told the Chronicle the area is a “ well - known spot where homeless people camp and is frequented by prostitutes and drug users . ”
Human Rights Campaign board member and Pride Houston president Meghan Stabler submitted a strongly worded letter on behalf of the two organizations to media covering Ical ’s murder , urging reporters to “ use fair , accurate and inclusive reporting ” when covering LGBT issues .
Reads the letter : “ On Monday January 18 the brutal murder of Myra Ical occurred in Houston .
She is a transgender woman but the media continue to use male pronouns along with colorful statements about being found in an area known for drugs and prostitution .
This lazy and irresponsible journalism shows the amount of ignorance about transgender issues that is rampant among far too many reporters despite the existence of resources to help them report accurately . ”
The letter then links to the Gay and Lesbian Alliance Against Defamation ’s Media Reference Guide .
A candlelight vigil in memory of Ical will be held in the lot where her body was found .

BUSSIGNY , Switzerland --
In November , Switzerland voted to ban the construction of new minarets , the towerlike structures that adorn mosques .
A week or so later , in an apparent act of defiance , a new minaret unexpectedly sprang up here .
But the new minaret is not attached to a mosque ; this small town near Geneva does n't even have one .
And it's not the work of a local Muslim outraged by Switzerland 's controversial vote to ban the structures , which often are used to launch the call to prayer .

Schwarzenegger : Outsource prisoners to Mexico
California Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger went a little off - script yesterday and floated a novel solution for his state ’s overcrowded prison system :
" We pay them to build the prisons down in Mexico and then we have those undocumented immigrants be down there in a prison . …
And all this , it would be half the cost to build the prisons and half the cost to run the prisons , " Schwarzenegger said , predicting it would save the state $ 1 billion that could be spent on higher education .
About 19,000 of the state ’s 171,000 prisoners are illegal immigrants , according to the most recent statistics available online .
The state spends more than $ 8 billion a year on the prison system .
Aaron McLear , spokesman for the governor , said later that Schwarzenegger ’s comments did not represent a concrete proposal , but " a concept somebody mentioned to him " and he could not say where the governor came up with the $ 1 billion figure .
Aside from the troubling fact that Schwarnegger seems to have just made up the $ 1 billion figure and not consulted anyone before bringing up this idea , his timing is a bit unfortunate given that just five days ago 23 Mexican inmates were killed in a prison riot in Durango .
Two other riots last year killed at least 20 inmates each .
Here ’s how the Los Angeles Times described the country ’s penal system :
Mexican prisons have grown more crowded and dangerous as the government carries out a war against cartels , with more than 67,000 drug arrests in three years .
The increased incarcerations have often created an incendiary mix by jamming members of rival gangs inside the same walls .
The penal facilities also have seen dramatic breakout attempts as drug gangs seek to rescue captured members , sometimes with success .
In May , a convoy of men dressed in what appeared to be police uniforms cruised into a prison in the northern state of Zacatecas and calmly led 53 inmates to freedom as surveillance cameras rolled .
Authorities said it was an inside job .
Yes , definitely sounds like a place that could use another 19,000 prisoners .
Security Theater
Maureen Dowd nails it :
If we ca n’t catch a Nigerian with a powerful explosive powder in his oddly feminine - looking underpants and a syringe full of acid , a man whose own father had alerted the U.S. Embassy in Nigeria , a traveler whose ticket was paid for in cash and who did n’t check bags , whose visa renewal had been denied by the British , who had studied Arabic in Al Qaeda sanctuary Yemen , whose name was on a counterterrorism watch list , who can we catch ?
The new procedures are all security theater .
What is needed is to actually use the tools we already have and to reform them .
For example , the no-fly list has so many false positives that it is worthless .
The majority of people on it are n’t terrorists and everyone knows it , so they do n’t enforce it rigorously .
( It ’s also unconstitutional , since it is punishment without a trial , being able to face ones accuses and see the evidence against one .
Of course the parts of the US constitution having to do with making war and civil rights are largely in abeyance , anyway , except when it comes to being able to tote around a personal machine gun . )
The kid had every possible warning flag .
He ’s the person they should have been strip searching , as opposed to random strip searches and pat downs which do almost nothing .
As for all the new rules , they wo n’t make anyone safer , but they will make air travel even more unpleasant than it already is .
And given that air travel is already extraordinarily safe , far more so than driving a car or crossing the street , again , the new rules are just security theater .

BOSTON ( Reuters ) - Shaving 3 grams off the daily salt intake of Americans could prevent up to 66,000 strokes , 99,000 heart attacks and 92,000 deaths in the United States , while saving $ 24 billion in health costs per year , researchers reported on Wednesday .
The benefit to the U.S. population would be comparable to cutting smoking by 50 percent , significantly lowering obesity rates and giving cholesterol drugs to virtually everyone to prevent heart attacks , said Dr. Kirsten Bibbins - Domingo of the University of California , San Francisco and colleagues .
Such a goal , they said , is readily attainable .
Salt , which contributes to high blood pressure and heart disease , is widely overused in the United States , with 75 to 80 percent coming from processed food .
Men typically consume 10.4 grams per day .
For women , the average is 7.3 grams .
Its use is rising .
A reduction of 1 gram would prevent 11,000 to 23,000 strokes , 18,000 to 35,000 heart attacks and 15,000 to 32,000 deaths from any cause , the researchers reported in New England Journal of Medicine .
Women would benefit the most .
“ Even if the federal government were to bear the entire cost of a regulatory program designed to reduce salt consumption , the government would still be expected to realize cost savings for Medicare , saving $ 6 to $ 12 in health expenditures for each dollar spent on the regulatory program , ” the researchers wrote .
In a commentary , Dr. Lawrence Appel and Cheryl Anderson of Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore said the new study may be underestimating the benefits .
They said it did not take into account how it would help children or the fact that lower salt intake may reduce the risk of stomach cancer , kidney disease , congestive heart failure and osteoporosis .
Negotiations over Conan O’Brien ’s departure from NBC stalled Tuesday over the “ Tonight Show ” host ’s demands that NBC compensate staff members who will lose their jobs when the show goes off the air .
The issue was one of several slowing the negotiations , which were expected to have been finalized earlier in the week .
“ The Tonight Show ” employs about 190 people , including 60 to 70 who followed O’Brien to Los Angeles from New York last year when he switched jobs .
NBC paid to relocate 40 to 50 of those staffers , said a person close to show .
O’Brien ’s last night on the “ Tonight Show ” is expected to be Friday .
NBC has not said when the show ’s former longtime host , Jay Leno , will return to the late - night slot .
Leno ’s last appearance on his short - lived prime - time show is Feb. 11 .

The O’Brien - Leno fiasco is becoming increasingly costly for the General Electric Co.- owned network , which not only spent more than $ 25 million building a new studio for O’Brien on the Universal Studios lot , but now must also shell out millions more developing new dramas for 10 p.m. , the time period vacated by Leno ’s return to late night .
The moves come shortly after GE acknowledged that NBC will lose about $ 200 million on its upcoming Winter Olympics coverage .
NBC is facing $ 40 million to $ 50 million in “ Tonight Show ” severance payments , including about $ 30 million to O’Brien , according to people close to the situation .
This month , NBC decided to shift Leno back to 11:35 p.m. after affiliate TV stations threatened to preempt his prime - time show because they were losing viewers for their late local newscasts .
When NBC tried to push O’Brien ’s show to 12:05 a.m. to make room for a half - hour Leno show , O’Brien refused .

“ We are fighting hard to get as much as possible to these people who are going to be out of work , ” Gavin Polone , O’Brien ’s manager , said Tuesday .
NBC officials bristled at the suggestion that they were being insensitive to staff members .
“ It was Conan ’s decision to leave NBC that resulted in nearly 200 of his staffers being out of work .
We have already agreed to pay millions of dollars to compensate every one of them .
This latest posturing is nothing more than a PR ploy , ” NBC said in a statement .
Not so , Polone said .
“ It is not a ploy or a strategy .
Conan ’s first priority is and always has been to take care of the employees of the show .
He paid them out of his own pocket during the strike when NBC laid them off . ”

O’Brien has been unrelenting in his on - air swipes at the NBC brass .
In his monologue Monday , O’Brien sang about them : “ Morons . Incompetent morons . ”
On Tuesday he said , “ It ’s been a busy day for me today .
I spent the afternoon at Universal Studios ’ amusement park , enjoying their brand - new ride , the Tunnel of Litigation . ”

Socioeconomic Impacts of Global Warming are Systematically Overestimated
Part I : Why are Impacts Overestimated ?
Indur M. Goklany
[ Note to the Reader : For the sake of argument , in this post I will accept the IPCC ’s estimates of global warming .
I will show that even if one takes those estimates for granted , the impacts of global warming are , nevertheless , overestimated . ]
Most of the scientific debate on global warming has focused on “ climatological ” issues that have been the province of IPCC Work Group I ’s Science Assessment .
However , there are even greater grounds for skepticism when it comes to estimates of the impacts of climate change , which is the monopoly of IPCC ’s Work Group II , not least because these estimates are based on a chain of linked models with the uncertain output of each unvalidated model serving as the input for the next unvalidated model .
[ Yes , it ’s that bad ! ] .
The first link in this chain are emission models which use socioeconomic assumptions extending 100 or more years into the future to generate emission scenarios , which strains credulity .
As Lorenzoni and Adger ( 2006 : 74 ) noted in a paper commissioned for the Stern Review , socioeconomic scenarios “ cannot be projected semi-realistically for more than 5 – 10 years at a time . ”
The results of these emissions models are fed into coupled atmosphere - ocean general circulation models ( AOGCMs ) to estimate spatial and temporal changes in climatic variables ( such as temperature and precipitation ) which are , then , used as inputs to simplified and incomplete biophysical models that project location - specific changes in biophysical factors ( e.g. , available habitat , or crop or timber yields ) .
Notably , the uncertainty of estimates of climatic changes increases as the scale at which they have to be specified becomes finer .
This is particularly true for precipitation , which is a — if not the — critical determinant of natural resources ( e.g. , water and vegetation ) that human beings and all other living species depend on either directly or indirectly .
As the US Climate Change Science Program ( CCSP ) review , Climate Models : An Assessment of Strengths and Limitations , notes :
“ Climate model simulation of precipitation has improved over time but is still problematic .
Correlation between models and observations is 50 to 60 % for seasonal means on scales of a few hundred kilometers . ”
( CCSP 2008 , p. 3 ) .
“ In summary , modern AOGCMs generally simulate continental and larger - scale mean surface temperature and precipitation with considerable accuracy , but the models often are not reliable for smaller regions , particularly for precipitation . ”
( CCSP 2008 , p. 52 ) .
[ Emphasis added . ]
In colloquial English this means that the AOGCMs have not been validated for less - than - continental or less - than - regional scales because they are unable to reproduce historical temperatures and precipitation simultaneously ( and , moreover , cannot endogenously reproduce major climatic features such as the ENSO , PDO , etc. ) .
But the real world distribution of climate - sensitive resources and climate itself is heterogeneous and varies considerably on “ scales of a few hundred kilometers . ”
Therefore , we necessarily should be using finer scale models to estimate impacts on these resources .
No matter , depending on the human or natural system under consideration , the outputs of the biophysical models ( which also are not generally validated ; see Nogues - Bravo 2009 ) may have to be fed into additional models to calculate the social , economic , and environmental impacts on those systems .
Ideally , the outputs from this set of models should be fed back into the emissions models , thereby closing an iterative loop of models .
But models have , so far , not yet incorporated this feature .
Notably , I have never seen an end - to - end analysis of the uncertainties / confidence limits associated with impacts estimates derived from the entire chain of models at relevant scales ( including uncertainties associated with the basic assumptions feeding the emissions models ) .
I have often wondered why such a step , that should be fundamental to any scientific analysis , is ignored .
In any case , this post will not deal with the level of confidence or uncertainty attached to impacts estimates but with reasons why impacts estimates are systematically overestimated .
Also , this post will not address potential “ catastrophes , ” i.e. , low - probability but potentially high - consequence outcomes such as a shut down of the thermohaline circulation or the melting of the Greenland and Antarctica Ice Sheets .
These are deemed unlikely to occur during this century , and are grist for other post (s ) .
The major reason for systematic overestimation is that the magnitude of future damages depends critically on society ’s future “ adaptive capacity ” — a fancy word for “ adaptability . ”
But the methodologies used to estimate impacts underestimate individuals ’ and society ’s future capacity to make self - directed ( or autonomous ) adaptations to global warming .
[ Adaptations should include measures to either reduce any adverse effect of global warming or take advantage of any of its positive impacts . ]
Figures 1 and 2 , based on cross-country data , show how two climate - sensitive indicators of human well - being — cereal yield and available food supplies per capita — have improved with wealth and time ( a surrogate for technology ) .
This makes perfect sense since wealthier societies ought to be better able to afford technologies that can enhance crop productivity ( Figure 1 ) .
And if that is insufficient to meet food demand , wealthier societies also ought to be able to purchase the food supplies they need ( Figure 2 ) via internal or external trade .
Not surprisingly , hunger and malnutrition are lower in wealthier societies .
Figure 1 : Cereal yields vs. GDP per capita , 1975 - 2003 .
Source : Goklany ( 2007 ) .
Figure 2 : Average daily food supplies per capita vs. GDP per capita , 1975 - 2002 .
Source : Goklany ( 2007 ) .
Figures 1 and 2 also show that the crop yield and food supply curves shift upward with time , that is , for any given level of GDP per capita , crop yield and food supplies increase as time marches on .
This can be attributed to the secular change in technology which accretes over time , and is defined broadly to include both hardware ( e.g. , catalytic convertors and carbon adsorption systems ) and software technologies ( e.g. , knowledge , policies and institutions that govern or modulate human actions and behavior , culture , management techniques , computer programs to track or model environmental quality , trading ) .
The patterns indicated in Figures 1 and 2 hold for virtually all objective determinants of human well - being — hunger , malnutrition , mortality rates , life expectancy , the level of education , greater access to safe water and sanitation .
See here and here .
All improve along with the level of economic development and time / technology , at least until they approach “ saturation ” ( which helps accounts for the shape of Figure 2 ) .
Similarly , spending on health care and research and development tends to go up with GDP per capita .
Notably each of these determinants helps boost economic and technological development , and human and social capital ( see , e.g. , here and here ) , which themselves boost adaptive capacity .
Therefore , in the future , as time marches on — and if societies become wealthier — as is assumed under all IPCC emission and climate scenarios , their adaptive capacity ought to be higher , and the net damages from global warming should be correspondingly lower .
Adaptive Capacity in Global Impacts Assessments in the IPCC ’s Latest Assessment
To date , however , no impact study has fully accounted for both increasing wealth and secular technological change , as will be discussed in greater detail below .
Consequently , they all overestimate the negative impacts and underestimate the positive impacts .
Consider , for example , the suite of studies of the global impacts of climate change sponsored by the UK Department of Environment , Food and Rural Affairs ( Defra ) and undertaken by a host of authors intimately involved in the IPCC ’s various assessment reports ( Parry 2004 ; Global Environmental Change , Volume 14 , Issue 1 , pp. 1-99 ; IPCC WGII , AR$ , Ch. 2 ) .
These studies were state - of - the - art at the time the IPCC ’s Fourth Assessment Report was compiled .
However :
The water resources study ( Arnell 2004 ) totally ignores adaptation , despite the fact that many adaptations to water related problems , e.g. , building dams , reservoirs , and canals , are among mankind ’s oldest adaptations , and do not depend on the development of any new technologies ( see here , pp. 1034–35 ) .
While , arguably , this may be acceptable methodology for an academic paper , it is simply inadequate to use “ as is ” to inform policymakers .
The study of agricultural productivity and hunger ( Parry et al. 2004 ) allows for increases in crop yield with economic growth due to greater usage of fertilizer and irrigation in richer countries , decreases in hunger due to economic growth , some secular ( time - dependent ) increase in agricultural productivity , as well as some farm level adaptations to deal with climate change .
But these adaptations are based on currently available technologies , rather than technologies that would be available in the future or any technologies developed to specifically cope with the negative impacts of global warming or take advantage of any positive outcomes ( Parry et al. , 2004 , p. 57 ; and here , pp. 1032–33 ) .
However , the potential for future technologies to cope with climate change is large , especially if one considers bioengineered crops and precision agriculture ( see here , chapter 9 ; and here , pp. 292-93 ) .
Nicholls ( 2004 ) study on coastal flooding from sea level rise takes some pains to incorporate improvements in adaptive capacity due to increasing wealth .
But it makes some questionable assumptions .
First , it allows societies to implement measures to reduce the risk of coastal flooding in response to 1990 surge conditions , but not to subsequent sea level rise ( Nicholls , 2004 , p. 74 ) .
But this is illogical .
One should expect that any measures that are implemented would consider the latest available data and information on the surge situation at the time the measures are initiated .
That is , if the measure is initiated in , say , 2050 , the measure ’s design would at least consider sea level and sea level trends as of 2050 , rather than merely the 1990 level .
By that time , we should know the rate of sea level rise with much greater confidence .
Second , Nicholls ( 2004 ) also allows for a constant lag time between initiating protection and sea level rise .
But one should expect that if sea level continues to rise , the lag between upgrading protection standards and higher GDP per capita will be reduced over time , and may even turn negative , if that seems warranted .
That is , adaptations would be anticipatory rather than reactive , particularly , for a richer society .
Fourth , Nicholls ( 2004 ) does not allow for any deceleration in the preferential migration of the population to coastal areas , as might be likely if coastal flooding becomes more frequent and costly ( see here , pp. 1036 –37 ) .
[ FWIW , New Orleans population continues to be below pre-Katrina levels , and Florida has been losing population in recent years – of course the risk of floods and hurricanes are hardly the only determinants of migration . ]
The analysis for malaria undertaken by van Lieshout et al. ( 2004 ) includes adaptive capacity as it existed in 1990 , but does not adjust it to account for any subsequent advances in economic and technological development .
There is simply no justification for such an assumption , particularly since there were older papers in the open literature that had pointed that adaptive capacity was a critical element in determining impacts ( see here , here , here ) .
Yet this study passed peer review !!!
In my next post , I will look at what can be said about future adaptive capacity , and show that it has been grossly underestimated in impacts studies .

With an eye toward building safer , lighter and tougher spacecraft , NASA said today its prototype space crew module made up of composite materials handled tests simulating structural stresses of launch and atmospheric reentry .
The idea behind NASA 's Composite Crew Module ( CCM ) project is to test new structural materials for possible future NASA spacecraft .
According to NASA , composite materials are being looked at because they are stiff and lightweight and can be formed into complex shapes that may be more structurally efficient .
In space travel , where every additional pound of weight drives costs higher , any weight savings provides increased payload capacity and potentially reduces mission expense , NASA stated .

20 projects that kept NASA hopping in 2009
The CCM is an all - composite representation of the part- metal , part - composite flight crew module Orion , which is part of the space agency 's Constellation program and is being tested by NASA 's Engineering and Safety Center 's ( NESC ) .
NESC tests NASA 's high - risk projects to ensure safety and to help it avoid future problems .
NESC mounted the full - scale test CCM into a custom - built rig for static testing at NASA 's Langley Research Center , Hampton , Va . Internal pressure and forces were applied to critical parts of the module , simulating the stresses it would encounter as it carries astronauts during a space flight .
" We pressurized the module to twice Earth 's atmosphere to demonstrate the ultimate design capability of the structure , and followed that by pushing and pulling it to simulate the forceful tug of the different mission phases , " said Mike Kirsch , manager of the CCM project in a statement .
For the push and pull tests , the CCM was blanketed with 318 strain gages -- fiber optic cables generating about 3,500 channels of data -- and 80 acoustic sensors that listen for fiber breaks in the composite lay - ups during the testing .
In addition , a stereo video system focused on complex - shaped zones of interest to generate a computerized view of surface deformation , NASA stated .
According to NASA future testing will gauge the structure 's resistance to damage , culminating in a planned test to failure .
The crew module structure was fabricated by Alliant Techsystems ( ATK ) .
Its top and bottom halves were joined by hand using a stiffened honeycomb sandwich of carbon fiber impregnated with resin , heat - and pressure - treated in an autoclave , then spliced together using local heaters .
During buildup of the two halves , many of the critical , orthogonal joints were assembled by the use of preformed three dimensional weaving technology , known as Pi joints , NASA said .

History
MathJax grew out of the popular jsMath project , an earlier Ajax - based math rendering system developed by Davide Cervone in 2004 .
In the following years , there were many significant developments relevant for web publication of mathematics : consolidation of browser support for CSS 2.1 , Web Font technology , adoption of math accessibility standards , and increasing usage of XML workflows for scientific publication .
In 2009 , the AMS , Design Science , and SIAM formed the MathJax Consortium to enable Cervone and others to design MathJax from the ground up as a next - generation platform , while still benefiting from the extensive real - world experience gained from jsMath .
Since its initial release in 2010 , MathJax has become the gold standard for mathematics on the web .
In 2019 , MathJax joined the NumFOCUS family of open - source software products as a fiscally sponsored project .
MathJax continues to be supported by the founding sponsors and other partners , as it joins this dynamic community .
Over the years since MathJax was first developed , new web technologies and paradigms emerged , and MathJax was not always easy to incoporate into these new approaches .
In 2017 , after nearly a decade of use , work on MathJax version 3 was begun , a complete rewrite of MathJax from the ground up using modern techniques .
This new version integrates with current toolchains and frameworks , and can run equally well in a browser on a server , or in a stand - alone application .
It should form a solid foundation for another decade of MathJax use , and its use of the Typescript language should make contributions from our user community easier to produce and incorporate into MathJax .

The MathJax team consists of Davide Cervone and Volker Sorge .
Contributors include Christian Lawson - Perfect , Omar Al - Ithawi , and Peter Krautzberger .

I ’m the author of Capture : : Tiny , which is intended to be the only STDOUT and STDERR capture tool anyone would ever need .
( See the Capture : : Tiny presentation on My Talks . )
For a while , I thought I succeeded , but lately a number of test failures have been cropping up on certain platforms .
While I ’m distracted with many other tasks , I ’m looking for a volunteer to analyze the failure reports and develop patches .
A warning : the guts of Capture : : Tiny are very pithy and it involves some relatively obscure ( insane ? ) file handle manipulations .
It ’s not for the faint of heart or the weak in Perl skills .
It ’s a “ Tiny ” module – so everything has to be done in just a couple hundred lines of code .
But if you like a challenge , you ’ll probably enjoy figuring it out .
Please contact me through my cpan.org email address if interested .
( I.e. dagolden@ …)
Thanks !
Update :
Thanks to quick responses from Robin V. and Christian Walde , it ’s clear that several of the failures , particularly on Win32 , are due to a broken alarm ( ) function .
As that ’s just for the test and not critical for Capture : : Tiny , I ’ll release a new version soon that removes that from testing .

Al Qaeda ’s Armies of One
When Humam Khalil al - Balawi exploded himself at a CIA base in Khost , Afghanistan , last month , killing seven CIA officers , his suicide attack did not just have repercussions for the NATO effort in Afghanistan — it also represented a giant leap forward for al Qaeda ’s global Internet movement .
In the minds of Web jihadists , Balawi was more than just another suicide operative .
He was one of them , someone whose thinking they trusted , knew intimately , and had been reading for years .
Before he became a Jordanian " triple agent , " Balawi was the jihadi online pundit Abu Dujana al - Khorasani .
Under that moniker , Balawi had been anonymously feeding his online readers a steady stream of jihadi missives since early 2007 .
His climb from eager chat - room participant to elite jihadi
Web forum administrator to revered Internet pundit to triumphant suicide bomber helped forge a path that Web jihadists could finally hope to emulate .
The number of Web jihadists who make the transition to real - world terrorists is growing .
Terrorists who have been radicalized online include Maj. Nidal Malik Hasan , Umar Farouk Abdulmutallab , Badr al - Harbi — the Kuwaiti who posted more than 1,000 times on an al Qaeda Internet forum before blowing himself up in Iraq — and now Balawi .
In doing so , they have taught other Web jihadists how to upgrade their keyboards into suicide vests .
With his many screeds posted to forums lionizing those who carry al Qaeda ’s torch , Balawi helped narrow the distance separating the global jihadi movement ’s fighters and its online sympathizers .
Balawi had developed into what can usefully be termed a jihadi pundit , leveraging his writings to achieve a prominent position within the online jihadisphere .
Most Americans have never heard of this genre of al Qaeda literature , nor has the U.S government made it a priority to read , analyze , or translate these writings , largely because they contain no operationally relevant information .
Nonetheless , jihadi punditry has become a critical part of the online radicalization process for both its producers and consumers .
One can only speculate whether Jordanian and American intelligence had given Balawi ’s essays the intellectual due diligence they required .
If so , his handlers should have been familiar with the seething rage for Arab governments and the West that suffused Balawi ’s writings .
They would have well understood that this material was perversely vile , even when compared with that of his fellow al Qaeda pundits .
According to the pro-al Qaeda media outlet Al - Yaqin , Balawi actually had two online identities .
The first moniker , which has not been revealed outside the jihadi
Web world before this article , was " Malik al - Ashja’e , " the name of one of the Prophet Mohammed ’s pious companions .
Using that identity , Balawi served as a Web administrator for the most elite al Qaeda forum , al - Hesbah .
Balawi was better known , however , as " Abu Dujana al - Khorasani , " whose writings , along with those of a handful of other elite jihadi pundits , served to bridge the thinking of al Qaeda ’s senior leadership with its global Internet - based movement .
Other senior Web pundits like " Abd al - Rahman al - Faqir , " " Yaman Mukhaddab , " " Abu Shadiyah , " and " Asad al - Jihad2 " also routinely post essays to al Qaeda forums that dissect , parse , interpret , analyze , and promulgate jihadi thinking .
Each pundit varies in terms of his style , sophistication , tone , and viewpoint .
One of Balawi ’s contemporaries named " Asad al - Jihad2 , " for instance , relies on an absurdist cocktail of prediction and bravado in his writings .
He once bragged , " I conducted a study on the condition of the United States and the plights which Almighty God decreed for it .
I was , by the grace of God , the first ever to write and congratulate the leaders of jihad and the mujahideen , and all the Muslims , for the beginning of the collapse of the United States . "
The first wave of contemporary jihadi Web punditry emerged in 2002 and lasted until 2005 .
It was dominated by anonymous al Qaeda strategists , some of the most prominent of whom used the pen names " Abu Bakr Naji , " " Abu Ubayd al - Qurashi , " and " Lewis Attiyatallah " to write articles for several online al Qaeda magazines including Al - Ansar and Sawt al - Jihad .
These authors , many suspected of being Saudis , generated serious scholarly thinking about al Qaeda ’s military strategy and international politics , and their work continues to be read widely .
Also during this time , the jihadi Internet community was feverishly compiling and sharing the tactical know - how for implementing this strategic counsel .
The leading voices of this first wave eventually grew silent , likely due to aggressive Saudi counterterrorism efforts .
In 2006 , the next wave of pundits began to coalesce .
This second cadre of e-jihadists focused less on strategy and more on interpreting , defending , and heralding the messages of al Qaeda ’s senior leaders .
Pundits like " Husayn bin Mahmud , " " Yaman Mukhaddab , " and " Shaykh Attiyatallah " helped shore up al Qaeda ’s credibility , both politically and religiously , at a time of great transition and controversy for the organization , as it faced widespread anger among many Muslims due to its indiscriminate campaign of terrorism across Iraq .
As this second wave of pundits concentrated on playing defense , 2007 saw the rise of a third wave of al Qaeda commentators eager to go on the offense .
Employing a self - promotional writing style , a penchant for stinging sarcasm , and an insatiable blood lust , pundits like " Abd al - Rahman al - Faqir " and " Asad al - Jihad2 " — and Abu Dujana al - Khorasani — helped re-energize al Qaeda ’s Web activism .
The forum administrators lionized these pundits , building them up as role models for the scores of wannabe al Qaeda forum denizens who would never make it to the battlefields .
Following in the footsteps of Web pundits like Abu Dujana al - Khorasani , those who had been radicalized online were learning that they too could be jihadi heroes — all they needed was a catchy writing style and an Internet connection .
In the summer of 2009 , an official al Qaeda propaganda outlet , Al - Fajr Media , released an interview it had conducted with Abu Dujana al - Khorasani in its e-magazine , Vanguards of Khorasan .
In it , Balawi , still using the Abu Dujana pen name , explained that he had recently arrived in the Afghanistan - Pakistan region and joined with the mujahideen fighters .
His transition from author to fighter — from theory to practice — was not unprecedented , but nevertheless extraordinary given his prominence within the global al Qaeda movement .
Abu Dujana ’s fans collectively praised his decision to exchange his pen for the sword .
The jihadisphere is now teeming with aspiring pundits — fresh voices trying to make it big and establish a popular online following .
Consider the example of new forum participant , Bakhsuruf al - Danqaluh , whose reputation was made literally overnight when another respected participant compared his writing style to that of Abu Bakr Naji , the heralded early 2000s pundit , author , and strategist .
One of the most prolific and respected al Qaeda pundits today is actually a first - generation jihadi writer using the name " Shaykh Abu Ahmad Abd al - Rahman al - Masri . "
An Egyptian national , al - Masri was active during the jihadi crucible years , living in Afghanistan from 1987 to 1992 , he has said , to " follow up on the [ various ] jihad projects [ taking place ] . "
According to him , he failed in his efforts at the time but has since generated a bevy of books and essays , many of which are disseminated with high - gloss artwork by the Al - Ansar Mailing Group , a pre-eminent jihadi media organization .
He has also published articles in the Taliban ’s official magazine , Al - Sumud .
Al - Masri ’s writings are now touted as " must reads " by jihadi Web forum administrators and often appear translated into English on Western jihadi websites .
Despite his towering reputation among al Qaeda readers and his long history working inside the global jihadi movement , al - Masri ’s name appears almost nowhere in open source English counterterrorism reporting .
The goal of al - Masri ’s works , like those of Balawi , is to force Muslims into choosing between two courses of action : passively accepting the status quo or changing it through violence .
When Omar Farouk Abdulmutallab — another jihadi
Web user - turned - operative — tried to explode a bomb hidden in his underwear aboard Northwest Flight 253 , al - Masri issued a celebratory memo that same day .
He wrote , " From the womb of the ummah of the truth the heroic commandos are born … .
They wrote these lessons on the page of existence with their pure blood … .
Among these lions , we have the brother , the heroic jihadist , Omar al - Farouk . "
Al - Masri issued a similar celebratory memo after Abdullah al - Assiri ’s failed assassination attempt on Prince Mohammed bin Nayef , the Saudi deputy interior minister in charge of the kingdom ’s counterterrorism efforts .
Al - Masri is not likely to follow in Balawi ’s footsteps as a suicide bomber .
He is , however , one of a number of elite jihadi online pundits who sustain al Qaeda ’s monopoly over the rhetorical battle space and fan the flames of jihadi violence by encouraging others to kill themselves for the cause .
For years ,
Web jihadists have had ample access to both ideological material that teaches them why they should commit terrorism , and the requisite tactical knowledge of how to kill .
Nevertheless , cases of Web jihadists entering the battlefield have been anomalous .
The online jihadisphere is decentralized , even democratic , making mass mobilization next to impossible without a leader to rally the troops .
The recent phenomenon of Web jihadists joining the physical fight , culminating with Balawi , seems to have provided just the kind of role model for which al Qaeda Web users have been longing .
If so , countries across the world — and particularly the United States — should brace themselves for an exodus from the Web forums and onto the battlefield by self - styled al Qaeda armies of one .
TNEF 's Enough allows Macs to read and extract files from Microsoft TNEF stream files .
The files are usually received by SMTP based e-mail programs from Microsoft Exchange and Microsoft Outlook users .
The SMTP based e-mail program will usually receive either a MIME attachment named " winmail.dat " or a MIME attachment with the type " application / ms - tnef . "
The file is a rich text ( or MAPI ) message that is sent from Outlook to Exchange .
When Exchange sends the message to an outside server it writes the MAPI message as a MIME attachment .
The unfortunate side effect of this plan is if the Outlook user has someone in their address book as a person who can receive " Rich Text " then the user will receive the TNEF file whether the user uses Outlook or not .
The recent death in Afghanistan of seven American counterterrorist officers , one Jordanian intelligence operative , and one exploding al Qaeda double agent ought to give us cause to reflect on the real capabilities of the Central Intelligence Agency and al Qaeda .
The report card is n't good .
America 's systemic intelligence problems were partially on display in the bombing at the CIA 's Forward Operating Base Chapman in Khost province .
Worse , al Qaeda showed skill that had been lacking in many of its operations .
In response , President Barack Obama will likely be obliged to adopt counterterrorist methods that could make his administration as tough as his predecessor's .
Professionally , one has to admire the skill of suicide bomber Humam Khalil Abu-Mulal al - Balawi 's handlers .
This operation could well have been months — if not longer — in the making , and neither the Jordanian intelligence service ( GID ) , which supplied the double agent to the CIA , nor Langley apparently had any serious suspicion that al - Balawi still had the soul and will of a jihadist .
That is an impressive feat .
The Hashemite monarchy imprisons lots of Islamic militants , and the GID has the responsibility to interrogate them .
The dead Jordanian official , Sharif Ali bin Zeid , reportedly a member of the royal family , may not have been a down - and - dirty case officer with considerable hands - on contact with militants , but al - Balawi surely passed through some kind of intensive screening process with the GID .
Yet the GID and the CIA got played , and al Qaeda has revealed that it is capable of running sophisticated clandestine operations with sustained deception .
Indeed , al Qaeda did to us exactly what we intended to do to them : use a mole for a lethal strike against high - value targets .
In the case of al - Balawi , it appears the target was Ayman al Zawahiri , Osama bin Ladin 's top deputy .
During the Cold War , the CIA completely dropped its guard in the pursuit of much - desired Cuban and East German agents .
The result ?
Most of our assets were plants given to us by Cuban and East German intelligence .
With al - Balawi supposedly providing " good " information about al Zawahiri and al Qaeda 's terrorist planning , a salivating CIA and the GID proved inattentive to counterintelligence concerns .

Have a favorite tool that was n't mentioned in the Hive Five ?
Let 's hear about it in the comments .
Have a topic you 'd love to see covered by the Hive ?
Send an email to tips at lifehacker.com with " Hive Five " in the subject line .
Airline passengers will have no right to refuse to go through a full - body search scanner when the devices are introduced at Heathrow airport next week , ministers have confirmed .
The option of having a full - body pat - down search instead , offered to passengers at US airports , will not be available despite warnings from the government 's Equality and Human Rights Commission that the scanners , which reveal naked bodies , breach privacy rules under the Human Rights Act .
The transport minister Paul Clark told MPs a random selection of passengers would go through the new scanners at UK airports .
The machines ' introduction would be followed later this year by extra " trace " scanners , which can detect liquid explosives .
A draft code of practice covering privacy and health issues is being discussed in Whitehall .
Clark dealt with concerns raised by the Commons home affairs select committee about the ability of airports abroad to upgrade their security to similar levels by indicating that extra support and help was under discussion .
Lord West , the counter - terrorism minister , told the MPs the government had firmly ruled out the introduction of " religious or ethnic profiling " into transport security .
Instead , he said , airport security staff were being trained in " behavioural profiling " , which meant spotting passengers who had paid cash , were travelling with only a book for luggage on a long - haul flight or were behaving erratically at the airport .
He said the decision to raise the terror threat level to " severe " – meaning an attack was highly likely but not imminent – had been taken by security service officials at the Joint Terrorism Analysis Centre last Friday .
The decision , thought to be based on an increase in intelligence traffic on threats from Yemen , was confirmed by the home secretary , Alan Johnson .
West refused to discuss the intelligence behind the decision , saying he was not going to jeopardise " getting the bastards " .
The body scanner trials , which are due to start at Heathrow next week , will involve a machine that has spotted the type of concealed device used in the Detroit airline bombing attempt .
The airport 's owner , BAA , is preparing to install a scanner in each of its five ­terminals .
The trials will use two different technologies that see through passengers ' clothing .
One trial will involve " backscatter " technology , which exposes travellers to low - level x-rays .
This is already in use at Manchester airport .
Security staff at Manchester recently replicated the underwear bomb that Umar Farouk Abdulmutallab smuggled on to Northwest Airlines flight 253 .
The machine singled out elements of the fake weapon .
" We could see that there was something on the person that would have required a further search , " said a spokesman for Manchester airport , whose machine requires passengers to stand between two Tardis - like blue boxes .
Under the new security regime , due next month , the suspect passenger would then be led away for a secondary examination that would include using chemical swabs to test for explosives .
Pat - down searches of passengers and hand luggage inspections will also increase .
The second type of machine uses a " millimetre wave " system , which bounces radio waves off the human body to form a 3D image of the passenger .
Both types of technology have raised privacy concerns owing to the graphic nature of the passenger images , with civil liberties campaigners calling the process " virtual strip - searching " .
The Department for Transport has drawn up a preliminary code of conduct for using the machines , and it will follow some guidelines used in the US .
These state that the security officer guiding the passenger through the machine never sees the image , and that the employee viewing the scan must be based away from the passenger , in a secure room .
The two officers communicate with wireless headsets ; and , once viewed , the scan cannot be saved , printed or transmitted .
Banning the ' Burqa ' France 's Quest to Maintain its Secular Identity
Six months after President Sarkozy declared the burqa and niqab " not welcome " in France , a parliamentary committee has recommended banning full veils .
Does the proposal send a clear signal to Muslims in Europe , or is it a distraction from the ongoing economic crisis ?

On bmj.com , two experts debate whether the conflict of interest is unacceptable when drug companies carry out clinical trials on their own medicines .
Their views come as new guidance on the standards required for communicating company sponsored medical research is published .
Vincent Lawton , a healthcare consultant and non-executive director at the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency in London , argues that having invested billions of pounds in medicine development , it is unrealistic to expect the drug industry to " surrender its intellectual property . "
He adds that taking away research from pharmaceutical companies will lead to delays , inefficiency and a lack of innovation .
Ben Goldacre , a doctor and writer from London disagrees and argues that " it is hard to see any justification " for allowing the current situation to continue .
Goldacre says that increasing evidence points to a conflict of interest for the drug industry which " results in bad evidence , which distorts medical decision - making , and harms patients . "
One of the problems , argues Goldacre , is that the industry can choose which data to publish , and which to leave unavailable .
He refers to the difficulties in getting clear information about the number of suicide attempts in industry trials of SSRI antidepressants or the number of heart attacks in individuals taking the anti-inflammatory drug rofecoxib ( Vioxx ) .

Goldacre concludes that the current situation " is dangerous and absurd " and that " doctors who are making treatment decisions need access to good quality trial data , presented transparently , and all of it , not just the positive findings that drug companies choose to share . "
Vincent Lawton , however , believes that it is acceptable for the drug industry to make a profit and still undertake rigorous clinical trials that stand up to regulatory scrutiny .
He points out that , in January 2005 , the industry made a commitment to increase the transparency of clinical trials by registering its trials in central , publicly accessible databases .
Most major companies also publish trial results , whether positive or negative , on their own websites .
Lawton sums up by saying that it is unlikely that publicly sponsored academics would have the infrastructure to conduct all clinical trials on all new medicines , leading to regulatory approval .
An accompanying paper , also published on bmj.com , sets out new guidance for communicating company sponsored medical research .
Written by the International Society for Medical Publication Professionals , the good publication practice ( GPP2 ) guidelines have been updated in response to changes in the environment in which authors , presenters , and other contributors work together to communicate medical research .
They include guidance on defining the roles of authors , sponsors , and other contributors , recommendations about reimbursement , and confirmation of the role of professional medical writers , and apply to peer reviewed journal articles and presentations at scientific conferences .
Lead author , Chris Graf says the guidelines " make recommendations that will help individuals and organisations maintain ethical practices and comply with current requirements when they contribute to the communication of medical research sponsored by companies . "

In the past , we ’ve seen lists about all sorts of mythological creatures , including a list specifically about Filipino monsters .
However , Japanese folklore seems to be a class apart from the rest of the world when it comes to supernatural beings that are bizarrely specific or simply insane .
Here are a handful of the most unusual creatures from Japan .
10 Kappa
Now , at first glance , there ’s nothing too ‘ outlandish ’ about a Kappa .
It ’s a little goblin - like creature , frequently referred to as a water monkey .
A Kappa has a dent in its head that is full of water from its native spring .
If the water spills out of its head , it looses its magical powers .
Kappas generally drink blood but can be either good or evil .
Kappas love to eat cucumbers and a family wishing to gain the favor of a kappa , or at least avoid its wrath , writes their names on a cucumber and throws it into the Kappa ’s pond .
The creatures are known for being polite and always keeping promises .
The strange thing about Kappas in Japanese folktales is that there are over a dozen different , weirdly specific categories of Kappa .
There are different names for one - eyed Kappas , hairy Kappas , cowardly Kappas , mountain - climbing Kappas , and even party animal Kappas .
9 Heikegani
The Heikegani are on this list for one very cool reason : they actually exist .
Heikegani Crabs are a species of arthropod native to Japan .
Originally , Japanese myth states that these crabs bore the faces of Heike samurai that died in the battle of Dan - no - ura , and indeed , the bodies of these crabs do in fact resemble human faces .
Carl Sagan proposed that , in the past , Japanese people only ate Heikegani crabs that did n’t resemble samurai faces , therefore ensuring that those with markings resembling a human face would survive and have offspring .
Nowadays , most crabs have bodies resembling human faces ; however , at a mere 1 or 2 inches in diameter , they ’re not eaten very often .
8 Kasa -obake
The Kasa - obake is a type of Tsukumogami – an object that spontaneously comes to life after existing for 100 years .
The idea of inanimate objects spontaneously developing spirits after a certain amount of time seems reasonable enough when you consider how strange legends and folklore tend to be to begin with .
The bizarre thing about the Kasa - obake is that , apparently , umbrellas were animating so often that someone eventually decided that they required their own name , just to separate them from other Tsukumogami .
That ’s right , Kasa - obake is the name of an animated parasol .
7 Nuppeppo
There ’s not nearly enough information about the Nuppeppo to satisfy my curiosity .
Nuppeppos are animated lumps of human flesh .
They walk around on their own hands and are most often spotted in graveyards or deserted temple areas at midnight .
Where do they come from ?
Why are they alive ?
Do they smell bad ?
Why do most images of them seem to be downright cute ?
We do n’t have nearly enough information about this horror - film fodder .
6 Makura - Gaeshi
Here , we have another case of Japanese folklore being bizarre if for no other reason than its specificity .
The Makura - gaeshi is a trickster spirit notorious for … moving pillows while people sleep .
Some sources say they also sprinkle sand in the eyes and steal souls , but , really , what they ’re known for is moving pillows .
Stories do n’t specify how far the pillows are moved , some sources claim that they move pillows all the way to the foot of the bed while the victim is peacefully asleep .
5 Mokumokuren
The mokomukuren is another example of a bizarrely specific creature .
In ancient Japan , sliding walls made of paper were fairly common .
Paper , however , can collect holes and become torn .
A Mokumokuren is a spirit that inhabits a sliding paper wall with a hole in it .
If the owner of the wall is careless , the wall may collect more holes , and the more holes there are in the wall , the more likely somebody is to notice the eyes if the Mokumokuren peeking out .
This probably becomes a bit unnerving , over time , and the only way to get rid of a Mokumokuren is to repair the holes in the wall .
4 Konak jiji
The Konak jiji is simply a malicious little creature .
It takes the form of an infant and lurks in remote mountain areas , waiting for an innocent traveler to pass by .
When a victim is in sight , the Konak jiji begins to cry .
Now , it ’s human nature to want to stop a baby from crying , and so most kindhearted travelers will seek out the wailing infant and , of course , make the fatal mistake of picking it up to comfort it .
Once the Konak jiji is picked up , it grows unbearably heavy .
Some sources say that they can grow up to over 350 kilograms in weight , enough to do serious damage to anybody holding them .
Most of the time , it ’s not possible to drop a Konak jiji because you become paralyzed once you pick it up .
It ’s not all bad , though – If you manage to survive the crushing weight of the Konak jiji , it may give you magical gifts .
3 Akaname
The Akaname is on this list because it is both bizarrely specific and bizarre in its own right .
Akaname can be translated to ‘ filth licker ’ , and that ’s no misnomer .
The Akaname is a hideous type of Japanese bogeyman that quite literally licks dirty bathrooms clean with its tongue and the aid of poisonous saliva .
It is believed that the monster may have originated as a way for parents to motivate their children to keep the bathroom clean .
2 Ittan Momen
The Ittan momen looks harmless enough ; after all , it ’s only a strip of white cloth , oh , 33 feet long or so .
It has a habit of flying around at night , which is a bit weird , but not too frightening .
It ’s not frightening , that is , until it becomes scared or frightened , or if it ’s just plain evil .
Then , it may wrap around your head and crush your skull or smother you to death .
It ’s not all bad , though - Ittan momen enjoy being worn by people who have gained their trust , although how , exactly , one gains the trust of a giant strip of cloth seems to be a mystery .
1 Shirime
Time for something a little crass .
Shirme was the name given to an apparition of a man with an eyeball where his anus should have been .
Now , we ’re not given much , if any information on why such an apparition should exist at all .
In fact , there is only one recorded story of the Shirime , but the idea was apparently so well liked by the Japanese poet and artist Yosa Buson that he included it in several of his paintings of supernatural creatures .
The story of the Shirime simply states that a lone samurai was walking down a road at night when somebody called to him .
He turned , to see a mysterious man undressing and pointing at his derriere when a large , glittering eye opened from the indicated area .
The samurai was , understandably , so horrified that he ran away screaming , and the Shirime was never seen again .

Here 's the synopsis :
Nearly wiped out by the Jedi Knights in a long - ago war , deadly Mandalorian warriors emerge from the shadows to exact cold revenge upon their peace - seeking rivals .
Cloaked in mystery and hardened by memories of their bitter defeat , they are fueled by a collective desire to reclaim the glory of Mandalore – no matter the cost .

Surfers in South Australia say they have witnessed a pod of killer whales attacking a school of more than 100 dolphins .
One of the surfers on lower Eyre Peninsula , Jamie Kidney , says the attack was an incredible sight .
" Chaos , you just saw monstrous amounts of white water and then a dolphin would go flying in the air , a killer whale would jump out of the water , grab it and body slam it , " he said .
" They were just jumping out the water attacking dolphins and it was just chaos really .
" Normally what you see great whites do to seals and that . "
Surfer Anton Storey also watched in awe as the whales flipped dolphins into the air .
" When the killer whales turned up a whole heap of dolphins started shooting towards the shallows there , " he said .
" Next thing you know we look up the back and these killer whales were just ramming dolphins out of the water and then grabbing them , and this just kept going on and on and on .
It was unreal . "
The South Australian Museum 's curator of mammals , Cath Kemper , says the reports of killer whales attacking dolphins are the first of their kind in SA .
" There have been a couple of reports from Tasmania of killer whales herding up common dolphins into a bay , I do n't think they actually were observed to kill any at that time - whether they were just trying to scare the living daylights out of them or whether they really did want to eat them , but they eat mammals , they eat seals and they will eat dolphins , " she said .
It also said that boys were more likely to be labelled " disruptive or rebellious " in mixed classrooms where the presence of girls might encourage them to try and be " cool " rather than studious .
This situation affected the learning experience of both girls and boys , it stated .
The BF and I made this on a cloudy cool day in Florida .
We halved the recipe .
We wish we had n't halved it because it was delicious !
It was spicy enough to warm you up , but not enough that we were grabbing for water .
We did n't add any chili powder , though we were ready for it .
Great flavor , so filling .
We topped ours with a generous dallop of sour cream and mixed aged cheddar with jalepeno jack cheese .
Other mods :
Used the full amount of garlic .
Used only 1.5 lbs of turkey ( as per other reviewers recommendations ) .
We did n't have to simmer the second time for the whole 30 minutes , probably because we halved it .
Blached the tomatillos .
When shopping in the store for the ingrediants , we used cilantro leaves insead of the dry coriander ( no fresh available , same plant different growth stage ) .
We used the small can of canned adobo chipotles ( there were two sizes ) , and found the green chilies next to the taco shells ( for some reason it was separate in Bravo supermarket ) .
Lastly , we ended up reserving the canned bean liquid and adding it back in for consistancy at the end .
Ours came out pretty red .
Gosh this was yummy !

Phillips Curves And Hayekian Triangles :
Two Perspectives on Monetary Dynamics Don Bellante and Roger W. Garrison I. Introduction
During different phases of the Keynesian episode , the monetary theories offered first by Keynes and later by the Keynesians have been judged by changing standards .
The standards changed along with the changing perceptions of what constituted the most viable alternative to the Keynesian vision .
" [ T ] here was a time , " wrote John Hicks ( 1967 , p. 203 ) , " when the new theories of Hayek were the principal rival of the new theories of Keynes . "
But times changed , and Milton Friedman ( 1969d ) , with his restatement of the quantity theory of money , became the dominant alternative to Maynard Keynes .
And eventually , Friedman 's Monetarism gave way to New Classicism and the idea of " Rational Expectations . "
The profession has been treated to exhaustive comparisons of Keynes and then Keynesians with the various opposing schools , but comparisons of the sequential alternatives to Keynesianism have been all but lacking .
The present paper begins to fill this void by offering a critical comparison of the Monetarists and the Austrians as represented by Friedman and Hayek .
(1)
A statement by Robert Lucas ( 1981 , p. 4 ) suggests how such a comparison can be undertaken : " ... I see no way to account for observed employment patterns that does not rest on an understanding of the intertemporal substitutability of labor . "
Lucas 's concise way of identifying the understanding that explicitly underlies his theories ( and implicitly underlies Friedman 's ) hints at an alternative way of accounting for observed unemployment patterns .
While Monetarism and New Classicism are based on the intertemporal substitutability within the market for labor , Austrianism is based on the intertemporal complementarity within the market for capital goods .
Differences between the monetary theories of Friedman and those of Hayek , then , can be spelled out in terms of the markets ( for labor and for capital , respectively ) that serve as a focus for each .
(2) With attention to the major themes of each theorist , Sections II and III identify the relevant aspects of monetary disturbances as seen by Friedman and as seen by Hayek .
Focusing on both substance and method , Section IV offers a critical comparison of the two perspectives .
Section V points out some implications in terms of the conventionally defined categories of unemployment , monetary lags , and the concept of " full " employment ; and Section VI provides a summary view .
II .
Friedman ( and the Monetarists ) on Monetary Dynamics
With conventional qualifications and allowances for real growth , increases in the supply of money lead , in the long run , to proportionate increases in the general price level .
This proposition , which constitutes the kernel of truth in the quantity theory of money , is not in dispute .
But the nature and significance of the monetary dynamics , the market process that translates the initial cause into its ultimate effect , is and has long been a matter of much controversy .
This issue , in fact , is what separates the Monetarists from the Austrians and gives scope for interpretation within both schools .
Friedman appears to be of two minds on the issue of monetary dynamics �the transmission mechanism linking money to prices .
On occasions where the focus is on long - run comparative - statics results , it is simply admitted that he ( along with Anna Schwartz ) has " little confidence in [ their ] knowledge of the transmission mechanism , except in such broad and vague terms as to constitute little more than an impressionistic representation rather than an engineering blueprint " ( Friedman , 1969 b , p. 222 ) .
But on occasions where the focus is on the transmission mechanism itself , such as the market process that traces out a short - run Phillips curve , there is an accounting of the the mechanism in terms of the market for labor that would rival any blueprint ( 3 ) ( Friedman , 1976 ) .
These monetary dynamics , which are used by Friedman to explain the short - run nature of the negatively sloped Phillips curve and to suggest the existence of a vertical long - run Phillips curve , can be used as a basis for evaluating the Monetarist view and for comparing it to the alternative offered by the Austrians .
The monetary dynamics envisioned by Friedman hinge on the sequential effects of perceived relative - price changes in the market for labor .
A number of heuristic assumptions about the market for capital goods and about income effects in commodity markets are invoked .
These assumptions are required to narrow the focus so that the Monetarists ' story can be told .
The lack of discussion in this context of the allocation of capital goods or of the short - run effects of a monetary injection within the market for capital goods is evidence enough that such considerations are no part of the story .
(4) Implicitly , one of several alternative constructions is adopted : ( 1 ) Real capital is taken to be completely homogeneous , or �to use the fiction invented by Frank Knight �it is treated as a " Crusonia plant . "
( 2 ) The structure of real capital , which admittedly consists of heterogeneous elements , is fixed .
It cannot or , for some reason , is not altered �even in the short run�as a result of a monetary injection .
( 3 ) Allocations within the market for capital goods are ( somehow ) always governed , whether in the presence or the absence of monetary disturbances , by " real factors only . "
This third construct is in the spirit of the New Classicism .
One of these three or some effectively similar construction or assumption must underlie any macroeconomic theory that ignores the allocation of resources within the capital - goods sector .
Implicit assumptions of this sort about capital goods are not at all at odds with the Chicago tradition more broadly conceived .
The inattention to capital theory stems from Frank Knight 's grappling with the thorny issues and conceptual difficulties that inhere in this subject matter ( Knight , 1934 ) .
In general , Monetarists have taken comfort in the Knightian view that the structure of capital , particularly the intertemporal structure , can be safely ignored , and that theories in the Austrian tradition , which make use of such concepts as " roundaboutness " and " stages of production , " are especially misguided .
( 5 )
The Knightian view of capital permits the Monetarists to focus exclusively on the market for labor .
But at least two additional assumptions are needed to limit the focus to the relative - price effects in the labor market .
Distribution effects ( who gets the new money ) and differential income effects ( how it gets spent ) must be removed from consideration .
Friedman 's heuristic device for short - circuiting the distribution effects is to assume that increases in the money supply are brought about by a one - time dropping of money from a helicopter in such a way that each individual picks up the new money in direct proportion to the amount already in his possession .
(6) The differential income effects of " helicopter money " �as it has come to be called �are assumed away .
This mode of theorizing reflects the implicit assumption that differential income effects are in fact negligible or the heuristic assumption that indifference curves are both identical across agents and homothetic .
( 7 )
Within this theoretical construction , the Quantity Theory holds in its strongest form , and any divergence in the pattern of prices between the initial injection of money and the eventual increase in the price level is purely stochastic .
Thus , disequilibrium relative - price movements within the markets for both capital goods and final products are taken to be unsystematic .
No generalizations about such movements can be made .
But movements in the price of labor relative to the price of final output are systematic in the Monetarist view .
And the temporal pattern of these movements depend in a critical way on differences in the ability of workers and of employers to perceive the price changes most relevant to each .
( 8 )
The spending of newly created helicopter money begins to bid up the prices of final products in unsystematic ways .
The individual worker , who clearly perceives his yet - unchanged nominal wage , has no clear perception of the change in his real wage �depending , as it does , on the change in some index of final - product prices .
The employer , whose perception of the general price level is no better than the workers ' , is motivated by a different concern .
From the employer 's perspective , the relevant real wage is the Ricardian real wage , which depends upon a single price �the price of the product that the employer produces .
If the output price has increased , the wage that he pays to the workers �relative to the output price �has clearly decreased .
Alternatively stated , workers and employers alike have no clear perception of the real wage , where real is understood in the market - basket , or Fisherian , sense ; but employers have a clear perception of the real wage , where real is understood in the Ricardian sense . )
Quantity adjustments in the labor market are made in ways that correspond to the differing perceptions in real - wage movements .
The behavior of workers , who make their labor - leisure decisions on the basis of yet unchanged perceptions , is depicted by an unchanged labor supply curve ; the behavior of employers who now enjoy higher output prices is depicted by a rightward shift in the demand for labor .
(9 ) The nominal wage rate rises as does the level of employment .
( Figure 1 shows the corresponding movement ( from A to B ) along the initial Short- run Phillips Curve . )
The higher nominal wages paid to a larger number of workers exert upward pressure on the prices of final products ; increases in output exert downward pressure on final - product prices .
And with the passage of time , workers begin to get a clearer perception of their real wage rate .
A temporal pattern of the real wage rate is traced out by a series of iterative steps in which the reinforcing and counteracting forces interact .
In the end , after a " long and variable " �and fundamentally indeterminate �time lag , the worker - employer perception differential is eliminated ; the short - run Phillips curve shifts rightward .
The level of employment , the level of output , and the real wage ( both Fisherian and Ricardian ) return to the levels that characterized the economy before the monetary injection .
( Point C in Figure 1 differs from point A only in terms of absolute prices and wages . )
III .
Hayek ( and the Austrians ) on Monetary Dynamics
If Frank Knight accounts for the Monetarists ' inattention to capital theory , Eugen von Böhm - Bawerk ( 1959 ) accounts for the Austrians ' preoccupation with it .
Where Friedman 's treatment of monetary dynamics requires some key assumptions about the workings of the market for capital goods , Hayek 's treatment ( 10 ) requires similar assumptions about the workings of the labor market .
Recognizing this symmetry allows us to describe the alternative treatments in a way that facilitates a comparison .
More often than not , Hayek 's assumptions about labor , like Friedman 's assumptions about capital , are implicit .
Labor skills are assumed to be non-specific .
Individual occupations are defined in terms of the particular capital goods that are complementary to labor .
Wage rates are flexible , but not perfectly flexible .
Workers can be bid away from some occupations and into others , but not instantaneously .
Adjustments in the labor market that involve a reduction in labor demand in some occupations will be characterized by temporary increases in the level of unemployment �the greater the adjustment , the greater and longer - lasting the temporary increase .
With allowance for frictions of this sort , workers are able correctly to perceive and respond to changes in the pattern of real wage rates .
Expectations about wage rates and prices can come into play �but not expectations whose formulation requires a theoretical understanding of economic relationships , such as ( correct or " rational " ) expectations about the upper turning point of a business cycle .
It might be noted at this point that Lucas ( 1981 , pp. 215-17 ) sees a certain kinship between his own ideas and those of Hayek .
But Lucas parts company with the Austrians when he treats knowledge of the economy 's structure in the same way as knowledge within the structure .
Hayek ( 1948 b , pp. 79 - 81 ) makes a first - order distinction between theoretical knowledge and knowledge of the marketplace .
Market participants can be expected to make use of information conveyed by prices along with other particular knowledge that they might have , but they cannot be expected to know �even in a probabalistic sense �the parameters of the economy 's structure .
That is , they can not be expected to know , or to behave as if they know , the answers to questions that economists have been debating amongst themselves for more than two hundred years .
( 11 )
The assumptions spelled out above about the workings of the market for labor allow the Austrians to deal with monetary dynamics exclusively in terms of the market for capital goods .
The dynamics within the capital - goods market , coupled with these assumptions , will have clear implications about the corresponding pattern and time path of the employment of labor .
The effects of a monetary disturbance within the market for capital goods reflect several considerations .
Capital goods in the Austrian view are heterogeneous in the extreme , and the structure of capital involves multidimensional complexity .
Individual capital goods are characterized by different degrees of specificity and are related to one another , both intertemporally and atemporally , with various degrees of substitutability and complementarity .
( 12 ) Thus , a set of heuristic assumptions about the capital structure is required to allow the identification of its most essential features and to render the treatment of monetary dynamics tractable .
In the Austrian view , the central problem in macroeconomics is the problem of intertemporal discoordination .
( O' Driscoll , 1977 , pp. 70 - 79 ; Garrison , 1984 , 1985 ) Whether the focus is on the coordination of investment decisions with consumption decisions or on the time - pattern of macroeconomic magnitudes over the course of a business cycle , the temporal element is essential to the macroeconomic perspective .
Hayek incorporated this temporal element into his monetary dynamics by focusing on the intertemporal aspects of the economy 's capital structure .
To avoid undue complexity , Hayek envisioned a heavily stylized production process .
His vision gives recognition , sometimes explicitly and sometimes implicitly , to a set of corresponding heuristic assumptions .
Each production process is characterized by a modifiable sequence of inputs and a point output ; some production processes are more time - consuming than others .
The sequence of inputs is conceived as consisting of " stages " of production .
The once -
famous Hayekian triangles ( 13 ) represent a stylization of the entire economy 's production process ( See Figure 2 ) :
The horizontal leg represents the time element in the process �the depth of the capital structure .
In the simplest case this leg represents the time that sepatates the earliest stage of production from the final output ; the vertical leg represents the nominal value of the final output .
The height of the hypotenuse at successive points in time represents the value of semi- finished goods as they move through time from the earliest to the latest stage of production . ( 14 )
Capital goods can be shifted �within limits �from one production process to another in response to relative - price changes .
More importantly , capital goods can be shifted from one stage of production to another in ways that modify the intertemporal pattern of output .
Some types of capital goods that are employed in the earlier stages of production ( or that , with some modification , can be so employed ) may be needed in the later stages of production as well .
That is , while competing for the use of individual capital goods , the stages themselves exhibit a certain degree of intertemporal complementarity .
There is no one - to - one relationship between stages of production and business firms .
Some firms may operate within one stage , some in several sequential stages , and some in different stages of different production processes .
Spelling out the characteristics of the Hayekian structure of production is , by itself , almost enough to specify the nature of the corresponding monetary dynamics .
The general pattern of events set into motion by a monetary injection can be identified as soon as the method of injecting the new money is specified .
Because of the historical relevance , Hayek assumed that the new money is injected through credit markets �that the central bank , in effect , pads the supply of loanable funds with newly created money .
( 15 )
Clearing the market for loanable funds in the face of such a monetary injection requires that the rate of interest fall until the quantity of funds demanded matches the increased supply .
( 16 ) In turn , this lowered rate of interest has implications for the intertemporal structure of capital .
To the extent that the temporal relationship between the various types of capital goods and the ultimate output of the production processes is perceived by entrepreneurs , the prices of the capital goods will be affected in a systematic way .
In the earlier phases of the market 's reaction to the credit expansion , the greater the time between the use of the capital good and the emergence of the ultimate output , the greater the relative increase in the price of the capital good .
This pattern of relative - price changes follows from the application of standard discounting techniques .
There will be a corresponding pattern of quantity adjustments .
Capital will be bid away from relatively less time - consuming production process into relatively more time - consuming processes and away from relatively late stages of production into relatively early stages of production .
Marginal adjustments of these sorts will be made throughout the capital structure as firms seek to take advantage of the favorable credit conditions .
In Figure 2 the shift towards more time - consuming processes is represented by a movement from A to B .
( The change in the slope of the hypotenuse reflects smaller profit differentials between the stages of production , which in turn reflect cheaper credit . )
The later phases of this dynamic process are marked by a reversal of the price and quantity movements that characterized the earlier phases ( Hayek , 1967 , p. 58 ) .
The passage of time takes production projects that were begun as a result of credit expansion into their later stages .
Some of these later stages require the use of capital that was used up in�or irrevocably committed to �earlier stages .
That is , the money - induced expansion caused more capital to be committed to the earlier stages of production without providing the additional resources�as would have been provided had the expansion been savings - induced �necessary for the completion of all the production processes .
In Figure 2 the value of the production projects in their final stages is represented by a broken line , indicating that a credit - induced boom cannot be sustained .
Capital goods complementary to the yet - uncompleted production processes are now in short supply .
Their prices are bid up , and as a result of these higher prices , the demand for credit increases .
The rate of interest , which had been artificially low during the monetary expansion , is now bid up .
Two significant differences between the Austrian and the Monetarist views can be noted here : First , because of intertemporal complementarity , the initial investment raises the demand for capital ( 17 ) ; second the resulting rise in the interest rate is separate from any Fisher effect , which depends upon a rising price level .
( 18 )
Both directly through the market for capital goods and indirectly through credit markets , the prices of capital goods committed to the early stages of production are bid down .
Uncommitted capital goods are bid away from the earlier stages of production and into the later stages .
( 19 ) But in this phase of the dynamic process , marginal adjustments may not be possible .
Some capital goods attracted to the earlier stages of production by the monetary expansion may not be retrievable .
As a consequence , many production projects may have to be abandoned ; many others can be completed but only with a great delay and / or at a much higher cost than could have been anticipated .
( The claim , made in the spirit of the New Classicism , that market participants will anticipate the money - induced capital shortage rings hollow .
Such an anticipation would require that they know �or behave as if they know �the " real scarcities " independent of the price system which supposedly communicates that information to them .
In the Austrian view , if a monetary injection distorts the price signals , market participants will be economizing on the basis of erroneous information . )
This later phase of the adjustment process takes on the characteristics of a crisis , a sharp down - turn .
But with time , some types of capital can be liquidated to accommodate the excess demands for other types .
Eventually , the economy 's capital can be restructured in a way that reflects real resource availabilities , and the credit market can be adjusted to reflect the supply and demand for loanable funds .
Abstracting from the capital that is lost forever as a result of the credit expansion and from possible long - run effects on the distribution of income , the rate of interest and the corresponding structure of production will return to the level and configuration that characterized the economy before the credit expansion .
Figures 1 and 2 can serve to depict the correspondence between the Monetarist and the Austrian views .
Arguing respectively in terms of the wage - rate effect on the employment of labor and the interest - rate effect on capital utilization , Friedman and Hayek have traced out the consequences of a monetary injection from A to B to C , where , in both diagrams , points A and C represent identical sets of real parameters .
Point B represents �in Figure 1 �a rate of unemployment temporarily and unsustainably below the ( Friedmanian ) natural rate and �in Figure 2 � a depth of capital temporarily and unsustainably maintained by a loan rate of interest kept below the ( Wicksellian ) natural rate .
To this point the Austrian story has been told exclusively in terms of the market for capital goods .
Yet a major purpose of the story is to account for the cyclical unemployment of labor .
But filling in the blanks about how the labor market is affected by the dynamics in the capital market is not difficult .
In the trivial case of perfect wage flexibility and instantaneous adjustments , there need be no unemployment at all .
Labor would simply be shifted around during the unfolding of the dynamic process so as to be employed in ways consistent with the changing pattern of relative prices .
( 20 ) This is clearly not what Hayek had in mind .
The recognition that labor is complementary to ( some ) capital and that frictions inherent in the market process prevent adjustments from taking place instantaneously is all that is required to translate the story about capital into a story about labor .
During the early phases of the dynamic process , there is a net increase in the demand for labor .
The new money injected through credit markets is used not only to bid workers away from some jobs and into others but to attract new workers as well .
To use Friedman 's terminology , unemployment falls below its natural rate .
But during the late phases of the process , there are actual decreases in the demand for labor in the early stages of production .
And the increases in the demand for labor in the later stages is only partially offsetting �due to the shortage of complementary capital goods .
The frictions involved in the economy - wide movements of labor out of the early stages and into the late stages coupled with the net reduction in the demand for labor account for a considerable amount of supernatural unemployment during this phase of the dynamic process .
Once the misallocated capital has been liquidated and the wage rates have adjusted to the underlying market conditions , the cyclically unemployed workers can be reabsorbed .
In Hayek 's story as in Friedman 's , unemployment eventually returns to its natural rate .
IV .
A Critical Comparison
While the two views of monetary dynamics spelled out in the previous two sections differ in important respects , they are in several fundamental respects quite similar .
Comparing the differences , then , must be prefaced by a clear recognition of the underlying similarities .
Five points of commonality are noteworthy : ( 1 ) Both theories can be fully squared with the kernel of truth in the quantity theory of money .
( 2 ) Both theories deal with disequilibrium phenomena , but neither denies that equilibrating forces dominate in the end .
( 3 ) Both hinge in a critical way on the distinction between short - run effects and long - run effects .
( 4 ) Both involve a market process that is necessarily , or endogenously , self - reversing .
Monetary disturbances cause certain kinds of distortions in market signals .
These distortions give rise in the short run to movements in certain prices and quantities , movements which in the long run create market conditions for counter - movements in those same prices and quantities .
( 5 ) With appropriate qualifications ( about what constitutes the long - run ) both theories are characterized by monetary disturbances whose short - run effects are non-neutral but whose long - run effects are neutral .
With allowance for these points of commonality , Friedman and Hayek are offering in some respects complementary views , in other respects competing views .
Our comparison will attempt to separate the two kinds of differences .
Comparing aspects of the two views that are at odds with one another must await a closer look at each view separately .
But ways in which the two views are different but complementary can be readily identified .
At the root of these kinds of differences is the fact that Friedman focuses his analysis on the market for labor while Hayek focuses his on the market for capital goods .
( 21 ) The trade - off that gets distorted by monetary disturbances is labor vs. leisure for Friedman and goods now vs. goods later for Hayek .
And due in large part to the differing natures of labor and capital ( the more radical heterogeneity of capital as compared to labor ( 22 ) ) , Friedman argues in terms of substitutability and Hayek in terms of complementarity .
( 23 )
In an important sense there is simply no scope for conflict here .
Labor - leisure preferences and intertemporal preferences interact with the perceived constraints that are relevant to each .
The dimensions of the two market processes can be seen as orthogonal to one another .
Trading off labor against leisure in a sequence of periods can be understood as substituting labor in some periods for labor in others .
Thus , with both views laid out intertemporally , we see that Friedman is dealing with the intertemporal substitutability of labor while Hayek is dealing with the intertemporal complementarity of capital .
Spelled out in these general terms , then , we have a harmony , rather than a conflict , of views . ( 24 ) 1 . A Critical Retelling of Friedman's Story
But when we turn again to the specifics of the market processes envisioned by Friedman and Hayek , we see first - order differences .
Some of these differences put the two views at odds with one another �or at least allow for a preference of one over the other on the basis of plausibility or fruitfulness .
Identifying these differences and their significance can begin with a critical assessment of Friedman 's view , which we preface with a recognition of existing criticism in the literature .
Sketchy expositions of the Monetarist view have given much scope for misinterpretation .
Gardner Ackley ( 1983 , p. 10 ) , for instance , sees the Monetarist dynamics purely in terms of " tricks " played on employers and workers .
It is a " trick for an inflation to fool both employers and workers �in opposite directions �about the movements of the real wage paid by one and received by the other . "
But to call this a trick is to miss Friedman 's point .
The " real wage " means one thing to workers and something else to employers .
Neither workers nor employers have a clear perception about what is happening to the general price level , but both are responding in conventional ways to the incentives that they face .
Recognizing these incentives gives Friedman 's view a microeconomic footing and insulates it against criticism of the type offered by Ackley .
Another criticism of Friedman 's view ( Birch , Rabin , and Yeager , 1982 ) is based on a perceived contradiction between the market process envisioned and the equation of exchange .
( 25 ) The familiar identity MV = PQ implies that when M , or more properly MV , increases , the corresponding increase in PQ is split in some way between an increase in P and an increase in Q .
That is , Q can increase only to the extent that P does not increase .
By contrast and according to the Monetarist account of the dynamic process , it is increases in P that cause increases in employment and hence increases in Q .
That is , Q increases to the extent that P does increase�hence the perceived contradiction .
But what appears at first blush to be a contradiction is in fact a manifestation of a self - reversing process .
There is nothing logically contradictory about a process in which P begins rising before Q but in which Q falls as P becomes fully adjusted to the increase in M .
While the Ps and the Qs can be squared with the equation of exchange at each point in the process , Q's initial upturn and inevitable downturn , which reflect similar movements in the employment of labor , constitute the essential self reversal that lies at the heart of the Monetarist view .
Our own criticism is fundamentally different from the ones identified above .
While the sequence of movements in P and Q are not evidence of a contradiction , they are evidence of a certain anomaly in the Phillips Curve story .
An initial rise in prices is a prerequisite to any movement along a short - run Phillips curve , but the story accounts inadequately for the nature of this initial rise .
To make the story stick we must recognize that there is some other , logically prior , market process that is set into motion by a monetary injection .
The process can be easily identified by drawing more broadly from the Monetarist literature .
Helicopter money adds to each individual 's cash balances , thereby inducing greater spending and the bidding up of prices ( Friedman , 1969 c , p. 5 ) .
But if buyers of labor services receive their pro-rata share of the helicopter money , they would be bidding up the price of labor at the same time .
The simultaneous rise in the price of output and the price of labor would preclude the fall ( as perceived by the employer ) in the real wage , which itself constitutes a critical aspect of the self reversing dynamic process .
The real - cash - balance effect , then , becomes the whole story rather than a prelude to the Phillips - curve story .
The Phillips Curve story can be saved by assuming a monetary injection in which the new money falls first into the hands of consumers and only later into the hands of producers .
While this kind of assumption , which highlights a particular distribution effect , violates the spirit of Monetarism , it allows in a straightforward way for a variation on the Austrian theme .
We turn now to consider the Austrian alternative .
2 . Heuristic Assumptions and Domain Assumptions
The assumptions made by Friedman and Hayek about the nature of the hypothesized monetary injection are not just two alternative assumptions that serve the same purpose .
Friedman 's assumption ( that money is dropped from a helicopter ) is a heuristic assumption .
It is a deliberate fiction whose purpose is to bypass any questions that relate directly to the actual injection of money while still allowing for the derivation of implications that can be tested empirically .
( Friedman 's uninhibited use of such fictions identifies his method as instrumentalism . ( 26 ) )
Hayek 's assumption that money is injected through credit markets is a domain assumption .
( 27 ) In many instances money actually is injected through credit markets .
Thus Hayek 's story applies directly and without modification to those instances .
A lower rate of interest resulting from the credit expansion increases the quantity of credit demanded .
Given the relative volumes of commercial lending and consumer lending , we can say that the new money falls first into the hands of producers and only later into the hands of consumers .
This disproportionate distribution of the new money is consistent with Hayek 's story about the effect of a monetary injection on the structure of capital : Production for future consumption is temporarily favored over production for present consumption .
For instances in which money is injected by some other means , Hayek 's story applies only after suitable modifications are made .
Suppose , for example , that a monetary expansion takes the form of increased transfer payments to consumers .
This type of monetary injection would temporarily favor present consumption over future consumption .
Capital goods would be reallocated accordingly .
In many respects , the self - reversing market process triggered by such an injection would be a mirror image of the process triggered by a credit expansion .
Capital goods in the later stages of production would be first in short supply and subsequently in surplus .
The demand for labor would rise and then fall as workers were bid into the later stages of production only to become unemployed when the demand for present consumption fell to its " natural " level .
The downturn associated with such a transfer expansion may be less severe than one associated with a credit expansion if only because short - term capital can be liquidated more quickly than long - term capital .
Two observations are warranted here .
First , Friedman needs to incorporate a transfer expansion , or something like it , into his theoretical construction if his Phillips curve story is to become coherent .
Second , inflation - rate and unemployment data that suggest a negatively sloped short - run Phillips curve and a vertical long - run Phillips curve are consistent with Hayek 's story whether the new money is lent into existence or transferred into existence .
( 28 ) Before we suggest what empirical , or historical , considerations might constitute a basis for choosing between the alternative stories offered by Friedman and Hayek , we turn to one further issue �the issue of generalizability .
3 . Generalizability
Any theoretical construction that suggests how a particular market works may be more or less generalizable �adaptable to different circumstances or extendable to other markets �depending in large part upon the nature of the assumptions used in the construction .
The discussion above suggests that theories based on domain assumptions are more generalizable than theories based on heuristic assumptions .
Hayek 's story can be adapted to apply to circumstances in which the new money favors consumption activity over investment activity even though it was first told the other way around .
The story can be generalized to recognize that monetary expansion can cause intertemporal discoordination �in one direction or the other �depending upon the particular device used to inject the new money .
In recent years Hayek has generalized his own story even further by recognizing that monetary expansion causes a self - reversing discoordination in many markets , whether or not it causes any intertemporal discoordination ( 1975a , pp. 23 - 24 ) .
By generalizing in this way , Hayek has not at all changed his mind about the effects of monetary expansion , he has simply recognized that the domain ( credit expansion ) that once dominated his subject matter is no longer so dominant .
But money - induced discoordination �of one sort or another �still dominates the story . ( 29 )
Friedman 's story makes use of a monetary helicopter whose precise function is to assume away the discoordination that Hayek 's story deals with .
The monetary helicopter does not constitute one domain from which the theory can be extended ; it constitutes the intentional neglect of all such domains .
The Friedmanian helicopter , like the Walrasian auctioneer in a different story , should be seen as a " red flag , " a marker where something important has been left out of account so that some other part of the story could be told .
From this perspective we can admire the outrageousness of the particular fiction employed : the helicopter is a red flag that virtually no one could fail to see .
But a red flag is no basis for generalization .
If we go back and take into account the effects of actual monetary injections , we do not get a generalization of Friedman 's story ; we get Hayek 's story .
Hayek 's story is generalizable in another important respect .
The task of identifying the effects of credit expansion was made tractable by employing a heuristic assumption about the structure of capital - using production processes �the assumption of multi-period inputs and a point output .
This particular assumption allowed for the abstraction from many complexities while it retained the essential element �the time element �in the analysis .
Once the story is told in its most tractable form , then , it can be generalized and extended to take into account some of the complexities that were initially assumed away .
( 30 ) Production processes with multi-period outputs can be taken into account as well as processes that make use of capital goods of a greater or lesser degree of durability or whose final output is a durable consumer good .
And by recognizing the ways in which the market for " human capital " is like the market for capital goods , Hayek 's analysis can be extended in a direct way to labor markets as well ( Bellante , 1983 ) .
Unfortunately , Hayek 's attempt to tell his story in the contexts of several different circumstances was seen as evidence of confusion on Hayek 's part .
In response to criticism that he assumed an initial state of full employment and placed too much emphasis on changes in the terms of credit , Hayek ( 1975 c , pp. 3 - 37 ) offered an alternative account in which widespread unemployment was assumed and the loan rate of interest was held constant .
The resulting story was then criticized ( Kaldor , 1942 ) on the grounds that it contradicted Hayek 's own earlier rendition .
By uncritically adopting Kaldor 's assessment of what he dubbed the " concertina effect , " modern critics have failed to appreciate the adaptability , the generalizability , that characterizes Hayek 's formulation .
( 31 )
A similar sort of generalization and extension is not possible for Friedman 's story .
The essential feature on which his story depends is unique to the particular context in which it is told .
For Friedman , the differing perceptions of workers and employers is what gives rise to the story ; they are what " drive the system . "
The market process that Friedman identifies has no direct counterpart in the market for capital goods .
The owner of a diverse capital stock , for instance , is unlikely to have perceptions that differ in a systematic way from those who may buy the services of that capital stock .
Such perception differences are even less likely in the more prominent cases in which capital goods are owned indirectly through financial markets .
Thus , independent of any empirical considerations , we have some basis for preferring Hayek 's story over Friedman's .
Hayek 's domain assumptions and even his heuristic assumptions allow for generalization and extension in ways that Friedman 's do not .
Hence , Hayek 's theoretical construction is the richer , the more fruitful , of the two .
4 . Historical Applications and Policy Implications
Extensive empirical testing has favored Friedman 's view of the nature of the short - run Phillips curve over beliefs or hopes that there is a more permanent trade - off between inflation and unemployment .
But this same empirical testing provides no clue at all about the nature of the market process that moves the economy along a short - run Phillips curve and then shifts that curve so as to conform with the long - run vertical Phillips curve .
That is , the testing allows to us choose between a Keynesian view and a Friedman - Hayek view , but not between the Friedman view and the Hayek view .
Direct empirical evidence about the nature of the monetary dynamics involved in adjusting the economy to a monetary injection may be all but impossible .
Directly substantiating Friedman 's story would require data on perceived real wage rates ; directly substantiating Hayek 's story would require the quantification of actual changes in the complex structure of capital .
( 32 ) We must look for implications of the two views that allow for empirical differentiation .
As it turns out , our comparison of the two views provides the needed clue about differing implications .
In Friedman 's story a general rise in prices of final output is a necessary link in the self - reversing market process triggered by monetary expansion .
Without this price inflation , which has a different significance for workers and for employers , there is no story to tell .
While Hayek 's story allows for price inflation , his story does not depend upon it ( 1967 , pp. 22-30 ; 1975 b , pp. 104 , 121 , 196 , and passim ) .
An initially depressed interest rate followed by subsequent resource constraints within the market for capital goods can serve alone as the basis for the self - reversing market process envisioned by Hayek .
( 33 ) This realization that price inflation plays a leading role in one story and , at best , a supporting role in the other allows us to identify important differences in the way the two stories are used not only in the interpretation of history but also in the prescription of policy .
Historical episodes in which monetary expansion is accompanied by an unchanging price level are interpreted differently by Friedman and Hayek .
The decade of the 1920s provides the most dramatic illustration of this difference .
Real economic growth during this decade , which in the absence of monetary expansion would have produced a decline in the price level , served instead to offset the inflationary effects of the monetary expansion .
The self - reversing process that , in Friedman 's view , characterizes other episodes of monetary expansion does not get triggered in this one .
There is no Phillips - curve story to tell .
Economic problems that surfaced at the end of the ' 20s are not , according to the Monetarist view , a result of a market process that began much earlier in the decade .
The economic downturn is blamed instead on exogenous factors �the incompetence and irresponsible behavior of the central bank ( Friedman , 1963 , pp. 299-419 ) .
From an Austrian perspective , the same historical episode is seen quite differently ( Hayek , 1975 b , pp. 18 - 20 ; Robbins , 1934 ; Rothbard , 1963 ) .
The fact that there was virtually no price inflation is irrelevant .
There is no scope for the idea that the monetary expansion simply accommodated real growth : real growth , in the Austrian view , must be accommodated by real saving .
The credit expansion during the 1920s caused the rate of interest to be lower than it otherwise would have been and thereby triggered a self - reversing process within the market for capital goods .
The actual self reversal came in 1929 causing the economic downturn .
This historical episode , then , is an illustration of Hayek 's story and not an exception to it .
Interpretations of history have their counterpart in policy recommendations .
Again , the differing significance of price inflation is the basis for differences in preferred policies .
In the Monetarist view , so long as the price level is stable , monetary expansion is not disruptive .
Monetary expansion may even be necessary to keep prices from falling during periods of real economic growth .
In the Austrian view , monetary expansion is a disruptive force , whether or not the price level is changing as a result of the expansion .
The particular nature of the disruption will depend upon the particular form of the expansion .
The differing recommendations can be stated concisely in terms of the equation of exchange and an assumed constant velocity of money .
The Monetarist recommendation : Increase the supply of money to match long - term , secular increases in real output ; the Austrian recommendation : Abstain from monetary expansion even in periods of economic growth ; increased credit should come only from increased saving ; increasing output should be accommodated by a declining price level . ( 34 ) These policy differences suggest that the critical comparison of alternative monetary dynamics is more than an idle exercise .
V. Further Implications
Our critical comparison has important implications about the way we think about macroeconomic problems .
The monetary dynamics envisioned by Hayek provide a richer understanding of the market processes that might be triggered by a monetary expansion , but the Austrian alternative may at the same time render less serviceable �or even misleading �some of the standard macroeconomic concepts .
At issue , in particular , are the conventionally defined categories of unemployment , the notion of " long and variable " monetary lags , and the concept of " full " employment .
1 . Cyclical and Structural Unemployment
Beginning with Keynes , it has been standard practice to identify a number of categories of unemployment in order to isolate conceptually one particular component of special interest .
Cyclical unemployment is the major focus of macroeconomic and monetary theory .
Traditionally , theorizing about what causes unemployment of this category or about how it might be reduced or eliminated have been facilitated by impounding other categories of unemployment in a ceteris paribus assumption .
Frictional unemployment , which is inherent in any market economy , is wholly attributable to the existence of search costs .
Unemployed workers of this category always find employment , but not instantaneously .
Institutional unemployment , such as might be caused by minimum - wage legislation , may be lamentable , but it is to be fully accounted for in terms of the legal constraints .
These two categories of unemployment can be conceptually separated from cyclical unemployment , whether we accept Friedman 's treatment of monetary dynamics or Hayek's .
Structural unemployment involves a geographical or occupational mismatch of workers and employment opportunities .
Unemployment of this sort could result from autonomous shifts in consumer demand or from technological innovations .
In Keynesian and Monetarist formulations , structural unemployment is combined with frictional and institutional unemployment , and all three are collectively impounded in a ceteris paribus assumption .
Keynes 's views on unemployment of these sorts are virtually identical to the " Classical " views of , say , Cecil Pigou ; they were spelled out by Keynes ( 1936 , p. 6 ) only to make clear what he was not talking about .
Friedman ( 1976 , p. 217 ) makes use of these categories to locate the vertical long - run Phillips curve .
The natural rate of unemployment , which is simply the market rate given frictions , mismatches , and institutional constraints , serves as the base point from which to analyze cyclical unemployment .
Operationally , this last category is defined as a residual .
Cyclical unemployment is calculated by subtracting an estimation of the natural rate from the measured unemployment rate .
Friedman 's story begins with an economy in which all unemployed workers are " naturally " unemployed .
Initially , then , a monetary expansion gives rise to negative cyclical unemployment , which persists until employer / worker wage - perception differentials are eliminated .
In symmetrical fashion , a monetary contraction �or disinflation �causes the actual unemployment rate temporarily to exceed the natural rate .
Eventually , the natural rate is reestablished , but �more significant for the present discussion �the rate of structural unemployment remains constant all the while .
The market process by which the economy deviates from and then returns to the long - run Phillips curve creates no mismatches between workers and employment opportunities .
Money is neutral with respect to the structure of the economy .
Hayek 's story can begin at the same point as Friedman's , but once the economy begins to react to the monetary expansion , the strict dichotomy between structural unemployment and cyclical unemployment can no longer be maintained .
The self - reversing process plays itself out in terms of changes in the structure of capital and corresponding changes in the structure of employment .
Friedman 's initial increase in employment becomes , in Hayek 's story , an increase of some particular kinds of employment at the expense of other particular kinds .
If the new money enters the economy through credit markets , the " forced saving , " as Hayek uses that term , is financing production for the more remote future at the expense of production for the more immediate future .
The structure of employment opportunities is modified accordingly .
The unemployment that characterizes the later phase of the dynamic process , then , is structural unemployment .
It differs from the structural unemployment that existed prior to the monetary expansion only in terms of the causal factors .
But operationally , structural unemployment caused by autonomous changes in tastes and technology and structural unemployment caused by monetary disturbances may not be separable categories of unemployment .
( Does the waning of smokestack industries reflect a technological shift towards an information - based economy , or does it represent a structural hang - over from an earlier money - induced boom ? )
Further , expansion - induced structural unemployment is likely to be long - lasting .
The long run in Hayek 's formulation must be long enough so that all misallocated capital can be liquidated and all capital / labor mismatches can be rectified .
The amount of time required may be so great as to make any propositions about long - run neutrality highly misleading .
( It would do violence to standard macroeconomic terminology to categorize the Great Depression as an instance of " short - run non-neurtality . " )
Hayek ( 1977 , p. 282 ; 1975a , p. 44 ) does allow for the possibility that some cyclical unemployment may not be structural unemployment .
The reduction in incomes during the downturn can �through the reduction in effective demand �have an aggravating effect on the problem of unemployment .
This is what Hayek refers to as the " secondary deflation , " or the " cumulative process of contraction . "
The unemployment associated with the economy 's spiraling downwards is the type of cyclical unemployment dealt with by Keynes .
Hayek 's recognizing the possibilitly of a secondary deflation does not , as some have suggested , constitute a capitulation to Keynes .
In fact , this problem was put into perspective ( 1975 b , p. 19 ) well before the appearance of The General Theory .
Rather , the fact that Hayek sees the Keynesian component of cyclical unemployment as a secondary effect draws attention to the primary effect which Keynes overlooked .
2 . The Long and Variable Lag
We turn now from the nature of the unemployment that is caused by a monetary disturbance to consider the length of time between the initial injection of new money and the economy 's eventual adjustment to it .
As an empirical summary , the Monetarist phrase " long and variable lag , " ( Friedman , 1969a , p. 238 ) is appropriate for both Friedman 's and Hayek 's account of the monetary injection and its ultimate effect .
But further reflection on the two views of monetary dynamics reveals important differences in this respect .
First , the " ultimate effect , " which marks the end of the lag , refers to different things in the two views .
As suggested above , the overall level of prices may become fully adjusted to the increased quantity of money long before the money - induced distortions in the structure of capital ( and labor ) are fully eliminated .
Thus , the short - run and long - run Phillips curves may be separated by a much shorter span of time than the short - run and the long - run Hayekian triangles .
Second , the basis for the lag differs between the two views in an important way .
Friedman 's lag depends upon how long it takes for workers to straighten out their misperceptions of the real wage ;
Hayek 's lag depends upon characteristics of the capital structure �the degree of specificity and intertemporal complementarity of the capital goods that make up the structure .
Hayek 's story suggests that credit expansion is less disruptive ( and involves a shorter adjustment lag ) in underdeveloped countries than in industrialized countries .
This accords with casual empiricism .
Does Friedman 's story suggest that workers in underdeveloped countries have better and / or more quickly adjusting perceptions of their real wage rates in comparison to workers in industrialized countries ?
Third , there is an important difference in the basis for the variability of the lag from one expansionary episode to another within a given economy .
For Friedman , the length of the lag , being based on workers ' misperceptions , is fundamentally indeterminate .
But it is not at all clear why it should take workers so long to straighten out their misperceptions about the real wage and why it should take much longer in some episodes than in others .
( 35 ) For Hayek , the length of the lag will depend upon the particular way in which capital and labor markets are distorted , which in turn depends upon how the new money is injected .
Monetary injections that discoordinate intertemporally are more likely �precisely because of the temporal nature of the discoordination �to involve longer lags than injections that discoordinate in some atemporal way .
This relationship between the method of injection and the likely length of the lag helps to explain why the Austrian theorists have always seen credit expansion , which was characteristic of the 1920s ' boom , as particularly troublesome , and why , in their study of this and other expansionary episodes , they are as much or more interested in how�rather than how much �money was injected .
3 . " Full " Employment
Finally , we turn to the concept of " full " employment as used by Keynes and Friedman in the light of the monetary dynamics as envisioned by Friedman and Hayek .
For Keynes , full employment is achieved so long as investors are sufficiently optimistic or sufficiently moved by the " animal spirits , " or so long as public works takes up the slack created by any insufficiency of private spending .
But the very nature of a self - reversing dynamic process �as incorporated into the visions of both Friedman and Hayek �suggests that the critical issue is whether or not a particular pattern of employment is sustainable .
In either vision any level of employment above the full - employment level is clearly not sustainable .
But in Friedman 's formulation , full - employment is �by construction �a sustainable level of employment .
For Hayek , the level of employment that corresponds to Friedman 's full - employment may be sustainable or it may contain the seeds of its own undoing ( 1975 c , pp. 60 - 62 ) .
That is , even though the real wage rate consistent with the underlying real factors is correctly perceived by both employers and workers , the existing capital structure may be inconsistent with the intertemporal pattern of consumer demand and resource availabilities .
The market process through which these inconsistencies are discovered and remedied may involve a considerable period of cyclical ( structural ) unemployment .
Again , the circumstances existing in the late 1920s can illustrate the distinction .
In the Austrian view , the economy was experiencing , in those years , unsustainable full employment .
Friedman does recognize that irresponsible monetary policies may eventually increase the natural rate of employment .
In two different pieces of analysis ( 1976 , pp. 232-33 and 1977 , pp. 459-60 ) , he suggests the possible existence of a " positively sloped Phillips curve . "
But in each case , new considerations not integral to his story of the adjustment process are introduced to account for such a possibility .
( 36 ) In neither case are structural considerations �as conceived by Hayek �integrated into the dynamic process envisioned by Friedman .
Friedman 's strict dichotomization of structural and cyclical unemployment stands in the way of his recognizing the possibility of full ( in the operational sense ) but unsustainable ( in the Hayekian sense ) employment .
Hayek 's formulation , which involves an interplay between structural and cyclical unemployment , allows for the recognition of such possibilities and for the prescription of policy most conducive to sustainable full employment .
VI .
A Summary View
Purely as an instrumentalist 's device , it could be argued , Friedman 's story has served the Monetarists well .
It put them onto the idea that the Phillips curve trade - off is a short - run trade - off only .
After this idea was confirmed empirically ( or properly , after it failed to be falsified over many trials ) the story itself became superfluous .
The realization that the empirically defined long - run Phillips curve is vertical is enough to carry the day .
It provides a strong basis for arguing that in the long run , " nominal magnitudes do not influence real magnitudes " and for warning against all attempts to exploit the trade - off offered by the short - run Phillips curve .
Friedman 's story and Hayek 's story differ sharply in methodological terms .
Because of its instrumentalist qualities , Friedman 's story fares poorly as a source of insights about the market process that translates a monetary injection into its ultimate consequences ; it fails to increase our understanding of any actual market process .
Hayek 's story identifies the essential workings of the self - reversing market process triggered by a monetary expansion in a way that sheds light on the structure and timing of the pattern of unemployment caused by such monetary disturbances .
The Austrian insights contained in the Hayekian triangles square with but go beyond the empirical regularities of Monetarism .
From a broader perspective , Friedman 's story represents a recognition of the intertemporal substitutability of labor and of the possibility that monetary disturbances can interfere with the intertemporal allocation of labor .
Hayek 's story represents a recognition of the intertemporal complementarity of capital and of the possibility that monetary disturbances can interfere with the intertemporal allocation of capital .
Viewed as such , the two stories are themselves not substitutes , but complements .

Notes : 1 . Two related contributions are Hoover ( 1984 ) , who provides an insightful comparison between Old Monetarists in the style of Friedman with the New Classicists in the style of Lucas , and Butos ( 1985 ) who compares Hayek and Lucas in the context of a general - equilibrium approach to business - cycle analysis .
Although not originally conceived for this purpose , the present paper can be seen as completing the trilogy by comparing Hayek and Friedman on the issue of monetary dynamics .
2 . We should note that the sharpness of the labor - market / capital - market distinction that characterizes our paper is not intended to suggest that Hayek has had nothing to say about labor markets or that Friedman has had nothing to say about capital markets .
Hayek ( 1975a , pp. 15 -29 ) specifically addresses the relationships among " Inflation , the Misdirection of Labour , and Unemployment " ; Friedman ( 1970 , p. 24 - 25 ) includes the existence of a cash - balance effect on asset prices as one of the key propositions of Monetarism .
Our paper focuses more narrowly on a comparison of Phillips Curves and Hayekian Triangles as alternatives bases for theorizing about monetary dynamics .
3 . The article exhibiting Friedman 's agnostic stance was first published in 1963 ; the " engineering blueprint " appeared in 1976 after having been presented at the Southern Economic Association meetings two years earlier .
Some might argue that a dozen or so years is enough to transform vagueness into a blueprint .
An alternative view is that the agnosticism persists ( see , for instance , Friedman , 1969 c , p. 6 ) ; the arguments in the later effort , which have their roots in his 1967 A.E.A Presidential Address ( 1969e ) , are to be understood as Friedman 's willingness to take on his adversaries on their own turf .
If this view is valid , a distinction must be made between Friedman and his followers .
Some Monetarists ( e.g. Darby , 1976 , pp. 328-50 ) write as if Friedman 's critical analysis which demonstrates the absence of an exploitable long - run Phillips curve is at the same time an exposition of the Monetarist view of the market process which transforms monetary injections into increases in the price level .
Also , the formal analysis offered by Phelps ( 1970 . pp. 124-66 ) is similar to Friedman 's critical analysis of the relationship between long - run and short - run Phillips curves .
4 . In other contexts , Friedman opts for a more broadly conceived adjustment process in which asset prices change , but he trivializes the corresponding quantity adjustments ( e.g. that may temporarily alter the structure of capital ) as " first - round effects . "
See Friedman and Schwartz ( 1982 , ch. 2 ) and Friedman and Meiselman ( 1963 , pp. 217-22 ) .
5 . Reder ( 1982 ) could be interpreted as denying the significance in this respect of Knightian capital theory for the development of the Chicago tradition .
" The contribution to economic thought with which Knight is most readily identified ( theory of the firm , uncertainty and profit , capital theory , social cost , etc. ) are only tangentially related to the Chicago tradition " ( Reder , 1982 , p. 6 , our emphasis ) .
An anonymous referee has suggested that Reder 's assessment is compatible with our own : " The modern Chicago school interpreted Knight so as to allow them to ignore capital theory . "
6 . See Friedman ( 1969 c , pp. 4 - 7 ) .
Friedman clearly recognizes that the money drop has to be perceived as a one - time event .
" Let us suppose further that everyone is convinced that this is a unique event which will never be repeated . "
This essential assumption separates Friedman from the New Classicists in terms of the issues that each is addressing .
The money drop in Friedman 's analysis does not constitute a " policy " in the New Classicist view .
Further , Friedman 's treatment of expectations creates a certain internal tension in his own view if his analysis is to explain more than a single episode of monetary expansion : Market participants have adaptive expectations ( about the price level and real wages ) during the period that the market is adjusting to a money drop , but static expectations about the likelihood of a future money drop .
7 . As an alternative formulation , Friedman does away with both the distribution effects and the differential income effects by assuming " infinitely lived people " such that no transitory event has any effect on permanent income ( Friedman , 1969 c , p. 6 n ) .
This alternative , however , does not represent a net " relaxation " of simplifying assumptions ; it represents the replacement of one assumption with another , analytically equivalent , assumption .
8 . The exposition that follows draws primarily from Friedman , 1976 , pp. 213-37 .
9 . As Friedman makes clear , the shifting of and movements along the curves are reversed if we take the employer 's point of view .
The movement down the employer 's demand for labor corresponds to an apparent shift in the supply of labor ( Friedman , 1976 , p. 223 ) .
10 .
The exposition of monetary dynamics as seen by Hayek draws largely from his early writings ( Hayek , 1967 and 1975 b ) .
Even the more advanced of these two books was intended only as an outline ( 1967 , p. vii ) .
Hayek 's monetary dynamics is based upon a theory first set out by Mises ( 1953 , pp. 339-66 ) , which integrated the capital theory of Böhm - Bawerk with a theory of interest - rate movements adapted from Wicksell ( 1936 ) .
11 .
The kernel of truth in the idea of rational expectations is clearly recognized by Mises as early as 1953 as is demonstrated by the following passage on inflationary finance : " Here the famous dictum of Lincoln holds true :
You can't fool all of the people all of the time .
Eventually the masses come to understand the schemes of their rulers .
Then the cleverly concocted plans of inflation collapse ....
[ I ] nflationism is not a monetary policy that can be considered as an alternative to a sound money policy .
It is at best a temporary makeshift .
The main problem of an inflationary policy is how to stop it before the masses have seen through their rulers ' artifices .
It is a display of considerable naivete to recommend openly a monetary system that can work only if its essential features are ignored by the public " ( Mises , 1953 , p. 419 ) .
For a comparison of Hayek 's approach to the issue of expectations with that of New Classicism , see Garrison ( 1986 ) .
12 .
For a treatment of Austrian capital theory that emphasizes these features , see Lachmann ( 1956 ) .
13 . Jevons ( 1970 , pp. 229-36 ) had earlier employed a triangular construction for similar purposes .
Attempting to characterize the economy 's capital structure in terms of the dimensions of a triangle is what qualifies Prices and Production as an outline .
In Hayek 's more formal �and more formidable �Pure Theory of Capital ( 1941 ) , many of the heuristic assumptions of his earlier efforts were relaxed .
This volume was to serve as the basis for a more comprehensive treatment of monetary theory ( Hayek , 1941 , p. v- vi ) , but no follow - on volume was ever written .
14 .
At the time of Hayek 's London lectures , which were to become Prices and Production , this formulation was largely unintelligible to his British audience .
Hicks ( 1967 , p. 204 ) was later to note that " Prices and Production was in English , but it was not English economics . "
While the neo-Austrian Hicks pointed to difficulties in Hayek 's communication of the message , Joan Robinson , who had difficulties with the message itself , dubbed the Hayekian episode a " pitiful state of confusion " and categorized it as a crisis in economic theory ( Robinson , 1972 , p. 2 ) .
15 . See Hayek , 1967 , p. 54 ) .
In his earlier writing ( 1975 b , pp. 143-48 ) Hayek criticized L. A. Hahn and Ludwig von Mises for beginning their stories with " arbitrary interferences on the part of banks . "
Hayek regarded an exogenous credit expansion as a " specially striking case , " and as a sufficient condition but not a necessary one for the occurrence of alternating boom and crisis .
He did note ( p. 150 ) that " it is possible to assume , with Professor Mises , that the Central Banks , under the pressure of an inflationist ideology , are always trying to expand credit and thus provide the impetus for a new upward swing of the Trade Cycle ; and this assumption may be correct in many cases . "
16 .
This aspect of the market process reflects the insights of Wicksell ( 1936 , pp. 102-21 ) : a economic boom grows out of the divergence between the loan rate of interest and the natural rate .
But as an anonymous referee has noted , Hayek differed from Wicksell on the question of what causes the divergence of the two rates .
Wicksell believed that the natural rate increases first due to technological advance and that the loan rate adjusts but with a lag .
17 .
This aspect of Hayek 's theory is the central focus of his 1937 article , " Investment that raises the demand for capital . "
( See Hayek , 1975 c , pp. 73-82 . ) 18 .
Early on , Hayek was acutely aware that his own monetary theory of the trade cycle was distinctive in that it did not hinge on changes in the general level of prices :
" We are in no way concerned to explain the effect of the monetary factor on trade fluctuations through changes in the value of money and variations in the price level ... "
Instead , his explanations hinged upon " changes [ monetary in origin ] which are bound to disturb the equilibrium inter-relationships existing in the natural economy , whether the disturbance shows itself in a change in the so - called ' general value of money ' or not " ( 1975 b . pp. 103-4 ) .
19 .
Hayek uses the term " Ricardo Effect " ( 1948a ) to refer to the quantity adjustments in markets for capital goods brought about by this upturn in interest rates .
Also , see O'Driscoll ( 1977 , pp. 92-134 ) .
20 .
Richard Wagner ( 1979 , pp. 182-85 ) demonstrates that the applicability of Austrian business - cycle theory is independent of any unemployed labor that may be associated with the downturn and that to estimate the social costs of a monetary disturbance by the unemployment caused by it is to underestimate those costs .
21 . As Hayek ( 1967 , p. 33 ) clearly recognized , this same distinction separated his own theorizing ( 1967 ) from the contemporaneous theorizing of Dennis Robertson ( 1949 ) .
22 .
The claim that capital is more radically heterogeneous than labor is not based simply on a difference in degree .
Different man-hours of labor are not perfectly substitutable for one another .
But our attempt to construct an analogous claim for capital is revealing : Different ________ of capital are not perfectly substitutable for one another .
The difficulty of even filling in the blank is a clear sign of dimensional , or radical , heterogeneity .
We must resort either to some universal non -unit , such as " hunks , " or to some value measure , such as " dollar 's worth , " which leads to an inescapable conflation of the price of capital and its corresponding quantity .
Further , differences between different man-hours of labor are conventionally attributed to differences in human capital .
Theories about labor that hinge on such differences are faced with the same thorny problems that are inherent in theories about capital .
It is largely because of these well - recognized problems that most monetary theorists have preferred to think in terms of homogeneous , perfectly substitutable , man -hours .
23 .
Hayek recognized that some capital goods are substitutes for one another .
We emphasize the notion of capital complementarity to contrast Hayek with most other theorists , who , explicitly or implicitly , take all capital goods to be substitutes .
24 .
For an alternative treatment of the relationship between labor - based and capital - based theories , see O'Driscoll and Rizzo , 1985 , pp. 160-87 .
25 .
These critics would not take Hayek to be the most viable alternative to Friedman .
They would opt instead for theories of monetary disequilibrium in the style of Warburton ( 1966 ) and Clower ( 1969 ) .
Their preference is based upon a perceived asymmetry between price adjustments associated with a falling price level and price adjustments associated with a monetary injection .
" Deflation has to work through a sequence of millions of piecemeal price and wage decisions ; the alternative of nominal monetary expansion puts no such demands on the economy 's coordinating mechanism " ( Birch , Rabin , and Yeager , p. 213 ) .
But the asymmetry is non-existent unless the question - begging assumption of " helicopter money " is employed .
Actual deflations and actual monetary expansions " [ have ] to work through a sequence of millions of piecemeal price and wage decisions . "
26 .
For an instrumentalist defense of Friedman 's economics , see Boland ( 1979 ) .
27 . Musgrave ( 1981 ) uses the modifiers " negligibility , " " domain , " and " heuristic " to define three categories of assumptions that underlie various theoretical constructions .
Generically , a domain assumption identifies the domain , or scope , of direct applicability ; a heuristic assumption is a deliberate fiction used to facilitate the logical development of a theory .
Musgrave uses these distinctions to evaluate Friedman 's treatment of methodological issues ( 1953 ) in which assumptions are categorized as " realistic " or " unrealistic . "
28 .
For a treatment of Hayek 's analysis in terms of the Phillips curve , see O'Driscoll ( 1977 , pp. 115-18 ) .
It should be noted that O'Driscoll uses Phillips ' original construction , which has wage inflation on the vertical axis ; the analysis is applicable whether or not there is price inflation as well .
29 .
It may be misleading to claim that Hayek generalized his theory only in recent years .
The case involving the expansion of credit to producers provided a focus for Prices and Production where Hayek " concentrated on the successive changes in the real structure of production , which constitute [ cyclical ] fluctuations . "
In his earlier work where he was concerned with " the monetary causes which start the cyclical fluctuations , " his arguments were much more general in nature .
( See , for instance 1975 b , pp. 91 , 146-47 , and passim ; the quoted passages are from the preface , p. 17 . )
Modern Hayekians may even judge that Hayek generalized a little too much : " The initial change [ eliciting a cyclical fluctuation ] need have no specific character at all , it may be any one among a thousand different factors which may at any time increase the profitability of any group of enterprises " ( 1975 b , pp. 182-83 ) .
30 .
Drawing from Hicks ( 1946 , p. 222 ) , Leijonhufvud ( 1968 , p. 222 ) contends that the Austrian construction cannot be generalized in this way : " the result reached for the point - input point - output case ... ' does not generalize in the sort of way in which it might have been expected to generalize . ' "
But the obstacles that make generalizing difficult are not to be attributed to the Austrian formulation but to the very nature of capital and hence of capital theory .
( See footnote 20 above . )
If measured in terms of the " period of production , " the time element in the production process depends upon the " quantity " of capital employed at each point in time ; the quantity of capital must be measured in value terms , which in turn depend upon the rate of interest .
Thus , the " lengthening " of the period of production brought about by a fall in the rate of interest may involve a " lengthening " that follows from the very definition of the period of production plus a " lengthening " that results from a market process set into motion by the fall in the rate of interest .
Hayek ( 1941 , pp. 76-77 , 140-45 , 191-92 and passim ) was aware of the hoary problems of this sort well before the so - called " reswitching " debate of the 1960s .
The fact that the Austrian formulation is capable of making some important distinctions , such as between the two senses of " lengthening , " should be seen as a credit to that theory and not as grounds for condemning it .
31 .
For modern treatments of Hayek that rely heavily on Kaldor 's critique , see Blaug ( 1978 , pp. 571-74 ) and Ackley ( 1978 , p. 632 ) .
Ackley refers to the Austrian view as a fantasy and is particularly vitriolic in his treatment of it .
' In what must be one of the most devastating critiques in the history of economics , Nicholas Kaldor showed the absurdity of what he called Hayek 's " concertina effect " �the cyclical " lengthening " and " shortening " of the production process .
Remnants of this idea may still be circulating in the byways of economics , but the writer has not encountered them for several decades . '
32 . Wainhouse ( 1984 ) , whose comparison of Friedman and Hayek is compatible with the one offered in the present paper , employs " Granger causality tests " in an attempt to establish the empirical relevance of Hayek 's story .
33 .
In recent years Friedman has been attributing high interest rates , not to an inflation premium , but to the volatility of money growth ( Brimelow , 1982 , p. 5 - 6 ) .
And his argument sounds more Hayekian than Friedmanian :
In 1980 the Federal Reserve began a relatively rapid monetary expansion .
Businessmen assumed the cheap credit was going to last for a considerable period , but when it did n't , " you had the business community left with all sorts of commitments based on a wrong diagnosis , a wrong prediction .
And you had a great deal of distress borrowing that was highly insensitive to interest rates . "
34 .
This policy prescription observes the stricture of separating policy implications from judgments of political feasibility .
There is no evidence that Hayek has changed his mind about the implications of his theory , but in recent years he has tempered his recommendations .
Prefacing an argument for a stable price level ( 1975a , pp. 26 ) , Hayek " confess[ed ] that 40 years ago I argued differently .
I have since altered my opinion �not about the theoretical explanation of the events but about the practical possibility of removing the obstacles to the functioning of the system by allowing deflation to proceed .... "
And looking to future monetary systems , Hayek ( 1984 , pp. 325 - 26 ) notes that " Sixty years ago I began my work on monetary theory by questioning the belief , then universally accepted , that the purchasing power of money should be kept stable .
I then suggested that it was more desirable for the purchasing power of money over consumer goods to increase over time .
But I have since become convinced that a money of stable value is really the best we can hope for . "
35 . When Friedman ( 1969a , pp. 255-56 ) explicitly considers the question of why the lag should be so long , he gives a Hayekian - triangle answer rather than a Phillips - curve answer .
The process of monetary expansion effects the demand for " equities , houses , durable producer goods , durable consumer goods , and so on ....
The effects can be described as operating on ' interest rates , ' if a more cosmopolitan interpretation of ' interest rates ' is adopted than the usual one which refers to a small range of marketable securities . "
This same process later generates " reactions [ which ] undo the initial effects on interest rates . "
36 .
The positive slope is attributed in one piece of analysis ( 1976 , p. 233 ) to " slow adjustments of anticipations to experience , long - term contracts , government interventions into specific markets , and other elements of ' friction ' or ' rigidity ' .... " ; and in the other piece of analysis ( 1977 , p. 460 ) to " the interdependence of experience and political developments . "
The scanners are being tried out at Amsterdam 's Schiphol airport EU countries have been debating the use of body scanners at airports , in response to the Christmas Day attempt to blow up a US - bound jet .
The European Commission is holding talks with aviation security experts from the EU member states in Brussels .
Italy has said it will introduce the scanners for US - bound flights , alongside the Netherlands and the UK .
The 27 EU countries are free to use the scanners as long as the security checks do not contradict national or EU law .
A Nigerian man is accused of trying to blow up a flight from Schiphol on 25 December as it prepared to land in Detroit .
He had not gone through a scanner .
Ahead of Thursday 's meeting , Belgium 's Transport Secretary Etiennne Schouppe said the measures were " excessive " , adding that security requirements at European airports were already " strict enough " .
Italy announced it would introduce the scanners as an experiment at airports in Milan ( Malpensa ) , Rome ( Fiumicino ) and Venice .
Spain has said it will wait until the Commission has made a decision regarding the scanners , while France and Germany remain uncommitted .
Trial run Schiphol airport in Amsterdam has been trying out the scanners , which use microwaves to see through clothing .
US airport security measures have been tightened since the alleged plot The Commission withdrew a draft EU regulation on body scanners in 2008 , following objections from the European Parliament .
MEPs raised concerns about passengers ' privacy and health , so the Commission decided that further technical analysis was required before EU - wide rules could be adopted .
The Commission says it " remains convinced that body scanners can play a very useful role as a complementary means of screening " .
Some governments argue that the scanners are a necessary tool in the fight against terrorism .
But some civil liberties campaigners say the equipment could breach child protection laws and invade people 's privacy , as it produces a " near naked " image .
The US has singled out 14 countries , including Nigeria , Somalia and Yemen , for enhanced security measures for travellers .
Since November 2006 the EU has enforced a ban on carrying liquids onto planes in hand luggage .
No liquids in containers bigger than 100 ml are allowed .
That ban followed the exposure of an alleged terrorist plot to smuggle liquid explosives onto planes at London 's Heathrow airport in August 2006 .

Iodine is an element that 's required for the thyroid gland to produce thyroid hormones .
Since the body does not produce iodine on its own , it needs to come from dietary sources — and striking the right balance is key .
Inadequate levels or overconsumption of iodine can lead to or worsen thyroid disease , as well as cause other significant health concerns .
The Importance of Iodine
When you consume iodine , it is quickly absorbed and entered into your bloodstream .
Your thyroid , which has tiny cells that capture the circulating iodine , takes in and oxidizes it so it can begin to be used to create triiodothyronine ( T3 ) and thyroxine ( T4 ) — thyroid hormones that make their way throughout the body to regulate metabolism and ensure healthy functioning of the heart , brain , and other organs .
While the major portion of iodine is concentrated in the thyroid gland , the nonhormonal iodine is found in a variety of body tissues including the mammary glands , the eyes , the gastric mucosa , the cervix , and the salivary glands . ﻿﻿
1:32
Levels of T3 and T4 — as well as thyroid stimulating hormone ( TSH ) , which is influenced by the two — that are out of normal ranges can lead to issues such as hypothyroidism and hyperthyroidism , and the complications related to having an underactive or overactive thyroid .﻿﻿
This can occur for a number of reasons , including taking in too little or too much iodine .
How Much Iodine You Need
According to the Food and Nutrition Board of the National Academies ( formerly the National Academy of Science ) , the recommended dietary allowance ( RDA ) for iodine in the United States ranges anywhere from 90 mcg per day for toddlers to 150 mcg for teens and adults .﻿﻿
Considering that one cup of plain low - fat yogurt contains about 75 mcg , 3 ounces of fish sticks contain about 54 mcg , a cup of cooked pasta contains about 27 mcg , and a quarter teaspoon of iodized salt contains about 71 mcg , that 's generally an easy amount for most people to consume .
Pregnant and Breastfeeding Women
The American Thyroid Association recommends that all pregnant and breastfeeding women in the United States and Canada take a prenatal vitamin containing 150 mcg of iodine a day as part of an overall recommended intake of 220 mcg / day and 290 mg / day , respectively .
Excess iodine , however , can be particularly dangerous in these women .﻿﻿
Iodine Sources
Most Americans have no trouble meeting the recommended intake of iodine because of the iodization of salt in the United States and incorporation of iodine - rich foods such as the following : ﻿﻿
Cod ( 3 ounces ) : 99 mcg
Plain low - fat yogurt ( 1 cup ) : 75 mcg
Reduced fat milk ( 1 cup ) : 56 mcg
White enriched bread ( 2 slices ) : 45 mcg
Shrimp ( 3 ounces ) : 35 mcg
Enriched macaroni ( 1 cup ) : 27 mcg
Egg ( 1 large ) : 24 mcg
Canned tuna in oil ( 3 ounces ) : 17 mcg
Dried prunes ( 5 prunes ) : 13 mcg
Cheddar cheese ( 1 ounce ) : 12 mcg
Raisin bran cereal , ( 1 cup ) : 11 mcg
Apple juice ( 1 cup ) : 7 mcg
Frozen green peas ( 1/2 cup ) : 3 mcg
Banana ( 1 medium ) : 3 mcg

Supplements ( e.g. potassium iodide , sodium iodide , kelp ) and iodine - containing herbs , such as bladderwrack , are other sources that can be considered .
Iodine Deficiency
Since iodine is needed to make thyroid hormone , diminished levels can lead to hypothyroidism ( low thyroid function ) .
Iodine deficiency is also linked to the development of goiter ( thyroid enlargement ) .
The impact of too little iodine reaches further .
Children born to mothers with severe iodine deficiency can suffer from stunted growth , severe and irreversible intellectual disabilities , and problems with movement , speech , and hearing .
Even mild iodine deficiency during pregnancy can lead to subtle intellectual deficits , although many children improve with iodine supplementation .
Mild iodine deficiency can also cause miscarriage .
Fibrocystic breast disease , a benign condition characterized by lumpy , painful breasts mostly in women of reproductive age , is also associated with iodine deficiency .
Risk Factors
The World Health Organization ( WHO ) estimates that two billion people , including 285 million school children , are iodine deficient .
Among them , iodine deficiency disorders ( IDD ) affect some 740 million .﻿﻿
In the United States , however , the risk of iodine deficiency is relatively low ; incidence of IDD has dropped significantly since the iodization of salt first began in the 1920s .
To further stem the risks of thyroid disease worldwide , the American Thyroid Association ( ATA ) called for the universal iodization of salt in 2017 .﻿﻿
That said , there are certain risk factors for iodine deficiency that everyone should be aware of no matter where they live :
Pregnancy
A low - or no -salt diet
An iodine - poor diet high in goitrogenic foods such as soy , cassava , and cruciferous vegetables ( e.g. cabbage , broccoli , and cauliflower ) , which may significantly impact your body 's ability to utilize any iodine it does get
Preventive Supplementation When You Have Thyroid Disease
Some practitioners are almost knee - jerk in their insistence that anyone with a thyroid problem requires iodine supplementation ; alternative practitioners may recommend iodine - containing herbs , like kelp or seaweed .
This can be particularly risky , in part because iodine supplements can interact with several types of drugs , including anti-thyroid drugs used to treat hyperthyroidism .﻿﻿
Taking high doses of iodine with anti-thyroid medications can have an additive effect and could cause hypothyroidism .
If iodine deficiency is n't the cause of hypothyroidism , then iodine supplements wo n't be helpful .
You 'll want to be very careful about upping your iodine intake unless you and your practitioner have some very strong evidence that you 're deficient .
This is especially true if you 're pregnant or planning to become pregnant .
Excess Iodine
Given the strong link between iodine and thyroid health , it 's reassuring to learn that iodine deficiency is rare in the United States and other developed countries where iodized salt is used .
Indeed , as an International Journal of Molecular Sciences study reported in 2014 , iodine excess is currently a more frequent occurrence in these places .
This , though , is not without concern .﻿﻿
For some people with abnormal thyroid glands , excessive iodine can trigger or worsen hypothyroidism .
While initially , you may have more energy , high doses can cause an " iodine crash " that leaves you feeling exhausted and achy within a few days .
That 's because high iodine intake can initiate and exacerbate infiltration of the thyroid by lymphocytes , the white blood cells that accumulate due to chronic injury or irritation .
In addition , large amounts of iodine block the thyroid 's ability to make thyroid hormones .
A 2014 study in the journal Endocrinology and Metabolism found that more - than - adequate or excessive iodine levels are unsafe and may lead to hypothyroidism and autoimmune thyroiditis ( Hashimoto's thyroiditis , chronic lymphocytic thyroiditis ) , especially for people with recurring thyroid disease .﻿﻿
Women who take too much supplemental iodine during pregnancy may give birth to babies with congenital hypothyroidism , a thyroid deficiency that , if left untreated , can lead to mental , growth , and heart problems , according to a 2012 study published in The Journal of Pediatrics .﻿﻿
While iodine poisoning is rare , the overconsumption of iodine can be just as problematic as consuming too little .
Are You Getting Enough or Too Much ?
While iodine can be detected in urine , relying on such a test is not helpful , since 90 percent of the iodine you ingest is quickly expelled .
Rather , doctors use thyroid tests to determine if your iodine intake is concerning or not .
In addition , iodine deficiency is typically suspected based on the development of goiter , hypothyroidism , or congenital hypothyroidism ( low thyroid function at birth ) .﻿﻿
Be sure that any adjustments you make to your iodine intake , whether you have a circumstance that seems to call for them or not , are cleared by your doctor first .
Laptop owners upgrading their Windows XP and Windows Vista machines to Windows 7 are complaining that Microsoft 's new OS has severely reduced their available battery life .
One user tells
The Reg that after upgrading his circa 2007 HP notebook from Vista to Windows 7 , the machine 's battery life dropped from two hours to a half hour , and countless others are voicing similar complaints on Microsoft 's TechNet forums .
The problem is caused by a new tool designed to alert users when their battery needs replacing .
In some cases , according to TechNet posts , this alert appears time and again - even as a battery continues to run as it always did - falsely warning that the machine may suddenly shutdown .
But in other cases , the machine does shutdown prematurely .
It would seem this occurs well before the battery has run out of juice .
In a statement sent to The Reg , Microsoft has acknowledged the issue , saying it 's related to the way Windows 7 reads system firmware .
" We are investigating this issue in conjunction with our hardware partners , " the statement reads .
" The warning received in Windows 7 uses firmware information to determine if battery replacement is needed .
We are working with our partners to determine the root cause and will update the [ Technet ] forum with information and guidance as it becomes available . "
According to some users posting to Technet , the issue dates back several months , to the Windows 7 beta .
But others say they did n't see a problem until the final " release to manufacturing " ( RTM ) build .
" I was having excellent battery life until I installed the RTM of Windows 7 - all RC and beta builds that I installed I had nearly three hours of battery .
Now , I have about 20 minutes and Win7 shuts down my laptop , " writes one user .
" This change in behavior happened when I went from an RC to RTM .
Instant behavior change .
Needless to say , I - like you that have posted here - [ am ] not happy . "
Microsoft confirms that its " consider replacing your battery " warning is new to Windows 7 .
But the company also says that in some cases , the new tool may be working properly .
In other words , if it says your battery needs replacing , it may need replacing .
But for so many laptops owners posting to TechNet , this is clearly not the case .
One poster says the problem has occurred on the same machine with two different sets of batteries .
" At first , I was thinking the laptop is a couple years old , and sat on a shelf gathering dust , not being stored properly , " he writes .
" I went to replace the batteries , and realized that HP had recalled them .
So i replaced them with brand new batts from the factory .
And wala ! same issue . "
According to posts , the issue occurs across many multiple laptop makes and models , and Microsoft 's statement seems to confirm this is the case . ®

Over the past year I ’ve received quite a few questions from people wondering how I manage all the windows that must be all over the place on all the various screens and systems .
The standard answer is that “ I ’ve got my own little tool that I developed for managing window layouts ” ( on single as well as multiple systems simultaneously ) .
However , that standard answer seems to result in even more questions as to how it works and what it does .
Since I ’m a firm proponent of code re-usability I ’m also a firm believer in not wasting too much time answering the same questions over and over again so I ’ve decided to answer the question in detail , once and for all .
What I ’m using for my windows and layout management is the Window Layout Manager , or WiLMA for short ( hey , as developers we ’re allowed to invent a dozen new acronyms each day and we like that little perk ! ) .
The following page provides a more detailed outline of what the Window Layout Manager does and how I use it .
The Window Layout Manager is a small 500K application , written in C# and using The .NET framework 2.0 and higher , using a lot of imports from user32.dll and avoids any unsafe code .
But I bet you could care less about THAT . 🙂
The cool thing about WiLMA is that I can get the same thing done in different ways and the combinations of all the options and features allow me to construct just about any layout under any circumstance and with any combination of how I apply it .
The main application has a basic window that allows the management of various layouts .
Adding new ones , editing existing ones , configuring the options , all the basic things you can expect from any normal application .
When closed or minimized it sits in the tray and offers a tray icon with quick access to layouts that are enabled ( it ’s possible to exclude layouts from populating the tray menu since some layouts are not meant to be applied directly ) .
A layout is a collection of window definitions that contain conditions and actions .
Conditions that describe the window and how it should be detected and matched and actions that allow various actions to be taken such as minimizing , moving , relocating , moving it to a different screen , offsetting the position , maximizing it to a certain screen , etc .
There are three types of layouts :
Normal Layouts : these contain window definitions where the entire layout can be applied to a current desktop .
: these contain window definitions where the entire layout can be applied to a current desktop .
Individual Window Layouts : these contain window definitions that can be applied individually through an active window context popup menu .
: these contain window definitions that can be applied individually through an active window context popup menu .
Live Layouts : these are layouts where the system is monitored and when windows that match any or all definitions it will apply the actions to that window as it becomes available and gets noticed .
Sounds complicated ?
Not really , but the Window Layout Manager offers enough features and combinations that it does need a lot of fine tune control over how the application behaves , as can be seen from the main configuration options :
Some of the options offered here are :
Restoring a layout after a specified time - out ( if enabled ) will pop up a small window after a layout or other actions are applied so they can be kept or undone .
a layout after a specified time - out ( if enabled ) will pop up a small window after a layout or other actions are applied so they can be kept or undone .
Ignoring certain process names for the Automatic Capture feature .
certain process names for the Automatic Capture feature .
Options that fine tune what is included in an Automatic Capture of all the available desktop windows .
of all the available desktop windows .
Detection options that control what types of windows are looked at and considered when a layout is applied .
options that control what types of windows are looked at and considered when a layout is applied .
A check newer version on startup because I had to implement a common approach to that for a different product and I used WiLMA as the test application in which I tried out the best approach for it .
Needless to say , I never have to check for newer versions because I ’m quite aware when I modify it and compile a new build . 🙂
And of course system wide hotkey support ( with a thank you and shout out to Max Bolingbroke who had provided a very clean example as a result of working with Movable Phyton ) .
The Popup Hotkey allows for a popup menu to appear over the active window that offers the matching layout options that are available within the layouts managed by the Window Layout Manager .
A way to quickly position windows individually without using an individual window hotkey or entire layout .
This is what the Individual Window Layout type of layout is for .
Above is a screen capture of the Layout Editor where layouts can be given a name , an optional description , a hotkey ( to apply the entire layout quickly and efficiently ) , and a whole range of other options such as :
A collective layout offset .
Imagine you ’ve got a layout that has all its windows located on the left screen in a dual monitor setup .
You could create another layout and edit all the window definitions individually to instruct it to take actions to relocate them to the right screen – either by screen relocation or XY offsets , but it ’s easier to copy an entire layout including all its window definitions and within a multi- monitor situation simply provide a collective offset for the entire layout and all its window definitions .
Why would you want to do that ?
Well , in my case , if you ’ve seen my home office setup , I regularly have a certain set of windows on a specific monitor and want to keep the layout the same but move them around because I angle and rotate one of the screens towards a guest that I ’m showing something .
In that case I just hit the hotkey or apply the layout so that all those windows get positioned exactly as they are on one of the other screens .
That then clears a monitor for other display purposes .
The layout editor allows for adding , editing , copying , removing , and capturing windows .
And copying window definitions between layouts ( to make life easy and avoid having to create duplicate definitions in different layouts or to grab a predefined definition in the repository for easy editing ) .
Capturing is the process whereby the entire layout is populated by all the windows that can be found on the desktop and running on the system based on the detection options ( a.k.a. the Window Filter that can be overridden and specific for any layout ) .
If I ’ve moved a bunch of windows in the positions that I ’m most comfortable with and wish to preserve as a layout I just hit capture and that is sufficient for all the basic tasks .
I can then always edit each individual window when I see fit .
The window definition overview shows the basic conditions and criteria and actions .
It may seem rather cryptic but this is part of an older version of WiLMA that was command line driven and used configuration files where conditions and actions were specified in a proprietary format ( which WiLMA takes care of in a full user interface ) .
When a layout is set to “ Enable Individual Popup Selection ” it means that each window definition can be applied to an active window that matches the criteria .
For example , I often need to move around my command shell windows ( mostly Power Shell these days since I ’m a total Power Shell fan ! ) and prefer it in very fixed positions .
There ’s about seven different ones and in an “ Individual ” layout I can define all seven of those , give them a description and when I make a shell window active and hit the popup hotkey it offers me a popup context menu with all these seven choices .
I hit the menu item for the actions I want applied and wham , I can continue work without having to waste time moving the window around manually .
A closer look at the window definition or Edit Window dialog .
As you can see , individual windows can be given a hotkey just like entire layouts can .
However , a hotkey for a layout needs to be unique while many different window definitions can use the same hotkey .
What happens if you do that is that all windows that are detected on the desktop that match the criteria will have their actions applied .
It is a little redundant since you can group the windows to a layout and manage it from a single layout but there have been situations where I prefer to have it both ways .
The criteria for a window definition consist of a few basics such as matching a definition to window based on the title ( or partial title by wildcard or full Regex – that ’s regular expressions for those who do n’t know what that means ) .
Same for the process name , process filename , and the window class name .
Advanced matching includes whether a window is minimized , maximized , a main window , whether it is on a specific screen , or within a region .
The fun part about the editor ( and certainly was fun implementing ! ) is that the parameters are enabled and disabled based on combinations that are either allowed or mutually exclusive .
For example , the region criteria work in absolute coordinates over the entire desktop space unless the “ on screen ” is also selected , then the region parameters become relative to the selected screen .
Coloration of the controls provide feedback when parameters are chosen that are considered to be out of bounds .
It will allow this , but it will notify me just in case I ’m making a mistake or trying to do something that would reposition a window where I ca n’t get to it .
When all the chosen criteria are matched against a window one or more actions can be applied .
These include minimizing , maximizing , restoring , moving windows to fixed positions , sizing windows , relocating to a screen , making a window on top or sending it to the background , or any combination of these .
Again , all options are handled by exclusivity so if the action is “ minimize ” it wo n’t allow you to also reposition and scale it because that would be pointless .
A Match function allows for a quick matching test against the windows on the desktop while the Test function allows for a quick test of the actions .
A Find option is included to locate specific windows through the Window Locator ( as seen below ) .
The Window Locator allows me to browse through all windows ( including the invisible ones that should n’t be messed with ) and get a quick overview of their state , type , process , title , and various other details .
Selecting one from the locator will automatically bring over the details to the editor so I can make minor changes and create the actual definition without having to spend too much time editing parameters .
If you are wondering why I ’ve blurred a few things in there … those lines contained public IP addresses and a product name of something that I ’m not at liberty to disclose .
Sowwy ! 🙂
And for those of you paying attention , the highlighted window there is called Ignytion Log Collector .
Not nearly as interesting as the Window Layout Manager , mind you .
Do n’t ask !
Something that is not part of the main UI but worth telling about is the peer to peer network feature .
When enabled it allows all the WiLMA ’s on the network to find eachother and allows one machine to apply layouts of another system either locally or remotely .
This was a quick hack I added in order to satisfy my own sense of “ lazy but efficient ” and while it works great it ’s really meant for a single - user scenario since it does n’t have any features for authentication and security .
Imagine the terror you could cause in a network of multiple users running WiLMA .
What fun that would be , eh !
The last thing that is worth a note is the Hotkey Explorer .
Because it is easy to lose track of hotkeys and layouts and individual windows there ’s a quick overview for all the hotkeys used by the layouts and windows .
It ’s mostly there for reference purposes because even I sometimes lose track of what I ’ve been configuring .
So there you have it .
This concludes the really quick nickle and dime tour of the Ignytion Window Layout Manager , WiLMA .
While I ’ve only covered the basics here I trust all the above contains sufficient detail so you can duplicate my efforts and write your own layout manager …
… or not .
I guess the next question I might be asked is …
“ Can I have it ? ! ” or “ Where can I get it ?! ” .
I ’ll have to think about that one .
Since it ’s been written for proprietary use there ’s no “ manual ” of sorts and if there ’s something I really hate it ’s writing manuals for “ end users ” .
I like writing source documentation well enough but end - user manuals are just a pain in the you know what .
Maybe if there ’s a lot of interest for WiLMA to be available as some kind of download I might chance my mind .
Drop me line .
If my inbox overflows that ’ll be a fairly clear indicator , I think . 🙂
The answer to the question “ Can I have it ? ” is …
Sure .

DENVER — A handful of doctors are writing almost all of Colorado ’s referrals for medical marijuana , and state health authorities are asking for new guidelines for how doctors can refer patients for pot use .
As of Monday , a total of 820 licensed physicians had authorized medical marijuana for 15,800 patients .
But just 15 doctors account for 73 percent of all the state ’s marijuana patients , the Colorado Department of Public Health and Environment said .
And just five doctors authorized 49 percent of all recommendations , the department said .
But because of medical confidentiality laws , the health department is barred from turning over those doctor names to law enforcement .
Instead , the department is asking state lawmakers to write rules clarifying when doctors can refer patients to marijuana .
That would make it easier for state health authorities to bring suspect doctors to the state Board of Medical Examiners .
The changes include a rule that doctors and medical marijuana patients must have an “ ongoing ” relationship and that the doctors ca n’t take payments from medical marijuana dispensaries .
Current law says only that referring doctors must be in good standing .
Department spokesman Mark Salley said health authorities are n’t seeking to share doctor names with police .
They are simply seeking better guidance before referring doctors to the review board .
The proposal would not change the list of maladies that make patients eligible for medical marijuana .
Qualifying ailments include seizures , multiple sclerosis , glaucoma , HIV and “ chronic pain , ” a condition some say is too vague .
Doctors can’t write “ prescriptions ” for pot , because marijuana remains illegal under federal drug laws and ca n’t be provided by a pharmacy .
Instead , doctors can “ refer ” patients to a state - certified caregiver to provide marijuana .
Patients who do n’t want to pay a dispensary are allowed to grow small amounts of marijuana for personal consumption .
The fact that so few doctors are writing hundreds of referrals has state officials wondering whether the state ’s marijuana rules are being misapplied .
Colorado Chief Medical Officer Ned Calonge said officials are suspicious of whether the doctors writing hundreds of referrals have true relationships with the people they ’re referring .
Calonge said in a statement that the proposed regulations “ parallel federal laws designed to provide protection from economic conflicts of interest that may arise when a physician stands to benefit directly from the sale of a medication or service that he or she prescribes . ”
Last month , Peter W.S. Grigg of Colorado Springs became the state ’s first doctor convicted of selling a recommendation for a medical marijuana registry certificate .
Grigg met an undercover police officer in a Wal - Mart parking lot last year and sold him a marijuana referral for $ 300 , even though the officer said on tape he had no medical condition qualifying him for marijuana .
Grigg told the officer he had written about 200 referrals .
It was n’t clear Thursday whether he was one of the “ handful ” of doctors mentioned by the health department .
Grigg pleaded guilty to attempting to influence a public servant and was sentenced to five years probation .
Grigg also voluntarily surrendered his license to practice medicine in Colorado .

The architects met on a damp October Saturday and set off to visit a modern New York landmark , the American Folk Art Museum .
The building is clad in lustrous bronze panels that shift in color as they catch the sun ’s slow trek across the sky .
Inside , a skylight shoots brilliant beams into a grand interior space .
But the two men had n’t traveled to Midtown Manhattan to look at the structure ’s famous features .
Instead , they slid their curious fingers along the pocked surface of the alloyed bronze facade .
Inside , their hands explored a smooth , round railing of warm cherry wood , a counterpoint to the chilly glass panels of the main staircase .
Their canes clicked along the intricate floor , sensing the shift from swaths of concrete to planks of Ruby Lake fir .

“ We were exploring how we could sense it with a cane , sense it with our fingers , sense it with our feet , ” said Northern California architect Christopher Downey .
“ There is this great palette of textures .
. . .
All of a sudden , it starts to engage your brain in a different way . ”
Downey said he and Lisbon ’s Carlos Mourão Pereira joke that their meeting three months ago was the “ first - ever International Blind Architects Conference . ”
But the questions that engage the men are deeply serious :
What makes a building beautiful if you ca n’t see it , and how can you create beautiful structures if you ’re blind ?
For the last 22 months -- since Downey lost his vision after surgery to remove a brain tumor -- the 47 - year - old has searched for answers to both queries , along with many others .

In spring 2007 , Downey was coaching his son ’s Little League team when he began to have trouble following the ball .
By that December , he could no longer play catch on his quiet , leafy street in suburban Piedmont .
“ Even with just a simple , soft toss , ” Downey said , “ I was just guessing at where the ball was . ”
That year ’s end was a busy time .
Downey was leaving the firm he and a partner had opened four years earlier for a job as managing principal at Michelle Kaufmann Designs in Oakland , which specialized in green , modular houses .
A neighborhood optometrist could find nothing wrong with his eyes and referred him to a specialist .
Downey visited ophthalmologists and nerve specialists .
He had eye exams , was prescribed eye drops and eventually had an MRI .
Advertisement
Then , in February , Downey was called in for more tests .
As he waited for results , he noticed “ a lot of somber - looking doctor types ” looking at his medical charts .
He was told that a slow - growing brain tumor was pushing on his optic nerves .
“ I was given the names of surgeons and advised to see them as soon as possible , ” Downey said .
Surgery -- all 9 1/2 hours of it -- took place March 17 , 2008 , a Monday morning .
The benign growth was deep inside his brain , close to the pituitary gland .

“ The best tumor , ” he said , “ in the worst spot . ”
The next day , Downey ’s vision was blurry , as predicted , and he could n’t discern his wife Rosa ’s brown eyes or her dark , curly hair .
But he could make out colors and shapes .
A day later , though , the world appeared cut in half , as if a line had been drawn across his field of vision .
Above the line was the same blurry , post - surgical vista .
Below , darkness .
Downey was whisked back into intensive care for five days of tests and frantic experimental procedures .
When he woke up on March 26 , the world had gone black .

“ That was a tough day , realizing that [ blindness ] is the new deal , ” he said .
“ I ’ve always been the outdoors type , loved sunlight , would run around and open up all the curtains in the house and let the sun in .
. . .
So first , oh , my gosh , no more sun .
That ’s just . . . ”
His voice trailed off .
He paused .
“ It ’s hard for me to get through a day like that . ”
By February 2009 , Downey had been blind for nearly a year and had spent more than half of that time trying to find someone like himself , anywhere in the world .
He met blind software engineers , writers and professionals who teach computer skills to others who have lost their sight .
He read about Los Angeles - based Eric Brun-Sanglard , the self - proclaimed Blind Designer , whose specialty is home design .

Downey learned to use software that reads text on his computer screen aloud .
He got a cellphone that reads him his e-mails and uses GPS to give audible walking instructions .
He began drawing with Wikki Stix , strands of wax - covered yarn that adhere to paper with just a little pressure .
His most useful tool became a large - format embossing printer , which turns blueprints into raised line drawings that he can read with his fingertips .
Downey returned to his new job on a limited basis just a month after brain surgery , but he struggled to balance work and rehabilitation .
At the same time , the economy was collapsing .
He was laid off , and the firm eventually closed .
So it seemed more important than ever for Downey to talk to someone who had mastered what he calls the “ heroically visual ” field of architecture without the most basic tool of all : eyesight .
Advertisement
Last Feb. 23 , he hit the send button on an e-mail that was equal parts proud and plaintive , hopeful and hesitant .
“ Dear Mr. Carlos Mourao Pereira , ” he wrote to this stranger in Portugal , describing him as “ amazingly ” the only blind architect “ that I had been able to locate since I started searching last August . ”
“ Leaving the profession has never crossed my mind , ” Downey wrote , “ but I must admit that it is requiring a lot of effort , training and research to try to figure out how to approach what is inevitably thought of and practiced as a very visual profession . ”
Pereira quickly wrote back , “ It is a surprise to discuss experiences with another blind architect . ”
Advertisement
Pereira told about losing his sight three years earlier .
About how he uses clay , Legos and lots of hand signals to get his point across .
About how he had just been commissioned to design a town hall .
“ A blind architect is specially sensitive to tactile , acoustic and smelling details of the Architecture , ” Pereira wrote . " . . .
The important thing is not stop working . ”
Downey told Pereira that “ most everybody I talk with assumes that I would now have to be on the fringes of the profession . ”
He ’d spent 20 years , he wrote , working on private homes and public aquariums , libraries , wineries , retail projects .
And he did not want to leave that behind .
Downey marveled at how Pereira described his own work “ as being so much more about the senses ” but said he was “ perhaps a bit doubly disadvantaged , as I lost all sense of smell in my surgery . ”

“ That brings me down to touch , sound and taste .
Personally I think I ’ll avoid tasting buildings for now , ” Downey wrote wryly .
“ There still is plenty to work with . ”
In late summer , Downey sat at a long conference table at the Western Blind Rehabilitation Center in Palo Alto , two seats from Millicent Williams , who supervises the men and women who teach newly blind veterans how to perform basic tasks again .
The Department of Veterans Affairs facility is scheduled to be replaced in three or four years by the sprawling new Polytrauma & Blind Rehabilitation Center .
Downey slid a heavy white piece of paper down the table toward Williams -- the floor plan , embossed in thick raised lines , of the proposed center ’s teaching kitchens .

Like her students , Williams is blind .
Although her input in designing the facility has been key , she has struggled through endless meetings to understand its intricacies .
Sometimes people would try to talk her through the floor plans .
Other times , a colleague might take her finger and run it along a standard blueprint .
But as Williams touched the 3D diagram , created in Downey ’s living room on his embossing printer , she was able to envision the seating areas and countertops , the appliances and the doorways .
“ Oh , this is what we ’ve been talking about , ” she said .
“ Now this makes sense . ”
No one at either of the architecture firms designing the facility had worked on buildings for the blind .
Understanding how people would experience a structure they could not see had proved elusive .

The architects held focus groups with VA staff and patients .
They thought about wearing blindfolds to get a sense of what life was like without vision but nixed the idea .
So when partners at SmithGroup and The Design Partnership met Downey , they were intrigued enough to hire him as a consultant .
“ The question we ask ourselves is , how can architecture help people lead a better life ? ” said John Boerger , a partner in The Design Partnership .
“ That was a real stumbling block we were having ” with the Palo Alto center .
Downey collaborated on a room - numbering system to help blind students navigate the building .
The facility will use different textured flooring in a few key areas so students can tell where they are by the tap of a cane .

Blind students who descend a staircase that deposits them in the middle of a vast lobby will be able to find their way because the ceiling will be enhanced , at Downey ’s suggestion , to create an acoustic corridor to the door .
Over the last 10 months , the building ’s design has been transformed in subtle ways .
So has Downey .
His first thought after losing his vision was about “ the life lesson for my son : taking it seriously and dealing .
I do n’t have any control over what happened , but I do have a lot of control over where we go from here . ”
Beyond that , all he really wanted was to be an architect -- still .

“ It had n’t occurred to me to focus on centers or buildings for the blind , ” he said .
“ But with this project , all of a sudden it became clear where my real value is . ”

On to Plan C
Sen .
Jim Webb puts out a statement that puts the notion of a quick Senate vote out of reach and pretty much makes a certification fight moot :
In many ways the campaign in Massachusetts became a referendum not only on health care reform but also on the openness and integrity of our government process .
It is vital that we restore the respect of the American people in our system of government and in our leaders .
To that end , I believe it would only be fair and prudent that we suspend further votes on health care legislation until Senator - elect Brown is seated .
And good luck getting Lieberman to vote for cloture this week , anyway .
SD - WAN Overview
Failsafe Reliability and Exceptional Quality of Experience for a Multicloud World
It can be hard to differentiate one SD - WAN product from another .
While all offer some link aggregation , branch simplification , and easier WAN edge management , few can deliver the reliability and application quality of experience ( QoE ) you want and expect as traffic shifts to the internet and applications move to the cloud .
Oracle knows applications and cloud , and Oracle SD - WAN delivers the unmatched security , reliability , and QoE you need in a multicloud world .
Oracle SD - WAN was created to solve the ongoing IT challenges network managers face every day — from expensive , sluggish , inflexible WANs to difficulties deploying new office WAN links and accessing cloud services .
With Oracle SD - WAN , enterprises can benefit from internet economics , leverage high - bandwidth and inexpensive Internet connections , and safely migrate applications to the public cloud and SaaS at their own pace – without sacrificing the high availability and predictable application performance they expect from their MPLS - only WANs ..
For the last 40 years , Unix operating systems have helped to power mission - critical IT operations around the globe .
Now , as Unix enters middle age , its backers are busily developing the new specifications that they hope will carry the OS forward into the next age of computing .
Open Group execs discuss Unix ’s direction — and what Linux ’s growth means for the platform ’s future .
Sitting at the forefront of the Unix ecosystem is the Open Group , a
vendor - and technology - neutral consortium that oversees usage of the Unix name and compliance with its specifications — particularly The Single Unix Specification , a set of specs that constitutes a Unix - compliant system .
Currently , The Single Unix Specification is at version 3 ( Unix 03 ) , though new specs are already in the works to expand on Unix 03 ’s successes .
“ We ’ve been very pleased with the uptake of Unix 03 , ” Andrew Josey Director of Standards at the Open Group told InternetNews.com .
“ We ’re working on an evolution of that [ for ] which we ’ve basically got the base specs done .
We ’re just working on how to roll it out . ”
Doing so wo n’t involve reinventing the wheel .
Josey said that instead of ushering in a revolutionary change in Unix , any new specs will be evolutionary in nature — and in particular , will continue to support existing platforms and prior Unix specs .
That ’s critical since backward compatibility has long been an important feature of Unix .
According to Josey , application binaries built for 1995 ’s Unix specification will still work on platforms today .
Such reliability has come to be a key selling point for Unix deployments , and for the host of companies that offer systems based on the OS .
Unix 03 - compliant operating systems come from multiple vendors including HP , IBM , Sun and even Apple , which has been Unix - compliant since 2007 .
“ Our vendors are very conservative , ” Josey said .
Ensuring a measure of continued backward compatibility is n’t the only area where its backers hope the next Unix will shine .
“ We ’ve got some new glibc features coming in to make the API sets richer , ” Josey said .
“ We ’re looking at better internationalization support , multi - threading support , more robustness , and we ’re looking at better thread handling . ”
Unix 10 ?
Although test suites are now being built for next version of the Unix specification , there are still several more steps ahead before the new Unix specifications become formally approved .
Josey explained that the Open Group first produces a set of higher - level standards that profile the new specifications .
Then the standards go though a committee stage to help build consensus .
Lastly , a formal voting process by Open Group members approves the final specification .
While the new Unix specifications will build on the Unix 03 standards , it is not yet clear what the new Unix standard will actually be named .
“ We may not even do a brand number this time — we ’re debating how to package it up , ” Josey said .
“ If we do give it a number , we might call it ‘ Unix 10 , ’ but we may not call it that at all . ”
The Linux challenge
While Unix has weathered a variety of challenges over the 40 years of its existence , one of the most recent — and persistent — threats to its position in the marketplace has been the rise of Linux .
However , despite Linux ’s booming appeal particularly in the datacenter , the Open Group does n’t see Linux as a representing a danger to Unix or its standards .
Instead , the relationship has become far more complementary , Josey said .
“ I ’ve always seen Linux as a very positive thing , and we ’ve been working with the community , ” Josey said .
“ I ’ve seen Linux change from something that is quite incompatible with Unix to being much more compatible . ”
The line between Unix vendors and Linux vendors has also grown far more blurry in recent years , with the major Unix vendors including HP and IBM now also the major supporters of Linux as well .
“ Our members are involved in the supply side of both Unix and Linux , ”
Allen Brown , CEO of The Open Group , told InternetNews.com .
“ It ’s not about saying one is better than the other .
They have different goals and different functions . ”
In spite of the growth of Linux and the narrowing distinction between Unix operating systems and versions of Linux , Brown said that it ’s likely that Unix will remain an important platform in the years ahead for several critical reasons .
“ Forty years ago , folks like us were putting in applications that we thought would n’t last very long and would be ripped out , ” Brown said .
“ Now they ’re part of the legacy that you ca n’t rip out and have to integrate everything else with . ”
Josey added that Unix is used in U.S. military assets such as aircraft that are supposed to last for 50 years .
Consequently , he expects that Unix will remain vibrant and alive .
“ Unlike other platforms , Unix is used more and more in mission - critical situations , ” Brown said .
“ Because they are mission - critical deployments , it ’s really difficult to get them out of the infrastructures once they ’re in . ”

Power - generating rubber films developed by Princeton University engineers could harness natural body movements such as breathing and walking to power pacemakers , mobile phones and other electronic devices .
The material , composed of ceramic nanoribbons embedded onto silicone rubber sheets , generates electricity when flexed and is highly efficient at converting mechanical energy to electrical energy .
Shoes made of the material may one day harvest the pounding of walking and running to power mobile electrical devices .
Placed against the lungs , sheets of the material could use breathing motions to power pacemakers , obviating the current need for surgical replacement of the batteries which power the devices .
A paper on the new material was published online Jan. 26 , in Nano Letters .
The Princeton team is the first to successfully combine silicone and nanoribbons of lead zirconate titanate ( PZT ) , a ceramic material that is piezoelectric , meaning it generates an electrical voltage when pressure is applied to it .
Of all piezoelectric materials , PZT is the most efficient , able to convert 80 % of the mechanical energy applied to it into electrical energy .
" PZT is 100 times more efficient than quartz , another piezoelectric material , " said Michael McAlpine , a professor of mechanical and aerospace engineering , at Princeton , who led the project .
" You do n't generate that much power from walking or breathing , so you want to harness it as efficiently as possible . "
The researchers first fabricated PZT nanoribbons -- strips so narrow that 100 fit side - by - side in a space of a millimeter .
In a separate process , they embedded these ribbons into clear sheets of silicone rubber , creating what they call " piezo - rubber chips . "
Because the silicone is biocompatible , it is already used for cosmetic implants and medical devices .
" The new electricity - harvesting devices could be implanted in the body to perpetually power medical devices , and the body would n't reject them , " McAlpine said .
In addition to generating electricity when it is flexed , the opposite is true : the material flexes when electrical current is applied to it .
This opens the door to other kinds of applications , such as use for microsurgical devices , McAlpine said .
" The beauty of this is that it 's scalable , " said Yi Qi , a postdoctoral researcher who works with McAlpine .
" As we get better at making these chips , we 'll be able to make larger and larger sheets of them that will harvest more energy . "
Qi and McAlpine collaborated with Habib Ahmad of the California Institute of Technology along with Noah Jafferis , a Princeton graduate student in electrical engineering ; Kenneth Lyons Jr. , an undergraduate at Morehouse College who worked in McAlpine 's lab ; and Christine Lee , an undergraduate at Princeton .
The research was funded by the United States Intelligence Community , a cooperative of federal intelligence and national security agencies .
The long - time followers of my blog will almost surely know of my fight against the pollution from libtool archive ( .la ) files in Gentoo packages .
I already said that they are often useless , or even dangerous when dealing with cross-compilation , and that they create problems that can be solved only with -- as- needed ( over - linking ) .
But in particular , I ’ve started making the tinderbox warn me when libtool archive files are found in three particular sub - trees where they are absolutely not useful : Python modules , Ruby extensions and PAM plugins .
Neither of these use libtool for loading the extensions ( for quite obvious reasons ) , so the .la file is not going to be used for loading ; you also should n’t link against dynamically - loaded modules ( and libtool warns you about that if you try to do it ) , so the .la file is not used for build - time linking .
It ’s simply unused .
But it goes even worse than that : the warning has also made me notice that quite a few packages not only install the libtool archive , but build and install a static archive as well !
This is not only an extra file installed ( and in the search path of those implementations ) but also force libtool to build all the source code twice : with and without Position - Independent Code ( the static archives are usually non-PIC but shared objects are PIC ) .
In the bugs I reported for this kind of problems I also linked my own documentation on building plugins with libtool , so maybe the Gentoo developers reaching the bugs would be able to fix both up - and down - stream the issue of double build of both PIC and non-PIC objects .
Not that I count on it but it might be possible .
BRIT HUME SAID WHAT ?….
As regular readers know , I ’ve made no mention of Tiger Woods on this blog .
I do n’t care about golf ; I do n’t care about golfers ’ private lives ; I do n’t care about any aspect of this “ story ” at any level .
But I was taken aback when I saw that Fox News ’ Brit Hume , reflecting on Woods ’ career on the air this morning , talked about whether the golfer may return to his chosen profession .
“ The extent to which he can recover seems to me depends on his faith , ” Hume said .
“ He is said to be a Buddhist .
I do n’t think that faith offers the kind of forgiveness and redemption that is offered by the Christian faith .
So , my message to Tiger is , ‘ Tiger , turn to the Christian faith and you can make a total recovery and be a great example to the world . ”
Hume was not , as the video shows , kidding .
It ’s hard to even know where to start with something like this .
How many high - profile Christians have had damaging sex scandals of late ?
Why is Buddhism deemed inadequate for those with family problems ?
Why is a senior political analyst for a so - called “ news ” network proselytizing , on the air , during one of the network ’s “ news ” programs ?
Jamison Foser added , “ If this was n’t Fox News , I ’d take ‘ Tomorrow , 2 pm ’ in the when - will - Hume - apologize pool .
But it is Fox , so ‘ the Fifth of Never ’ seems like a safer choice . ”
Some , however , think the high price tag will mean they will remain the preserve of those who are willing to spend at least £ 20,000 on a new kitchen .
Linda Bone , the manager of the Smallbone kitchen showroom in west London , said : “ They are getting more popular , they are nice to have but they are n’t essential .
I ca n’t see everyone having one . ”
The First Amendment provides American - based websites with the freedom to report on newsworthy events , including those that happen in other countries to citizens of other countries .
Yet , the global nature of the Internet opens it up to legal challenges from countries with more restrictive speech regimes .
Last fall , for instance , lawyers for the convicted murderers of German actor Walter Sedlmayr sent Wikimedia , an Internet content provider located in the United States that runs Wikipedia , a cease and desist letter demanding that Wikimedia remove from its Wikipedia article the names of Sedlmayr ’s killers in compliance with the German law that protects the privacy of individuals .
German courts have reasoned that criminals are no longer public figures nearly 20 years after being convicted , and thus should be afforded privacy by not having their names published .
The issue here is whether American - based producers of online media are required to comply with foreign restrictions of free speech .
As laws regulating the Internet are still evolving , and most of the compliance has been voluntary , we have yet to find a definitive answer to this question .
In the case of Ligue contre le racisme et l’antisémitisme et Union des étudiants juifs de France c. Yahoo !
Inc. et Societe Yahoo !
France ( LICRA v. Yahoo ! ) , LICRA , a French based human rights organization sued American - based company Yahoo !
because Yahoo ! permitted users to auction off Nazi memorabilia .
LICRA claimed that these auctions violated a French law against displaying Nazi memorabilia .
LICRA argued that because French citizens could theoretically access and participate in Yahoo ’s American - based and - run auctions , the auctions ’ content were covered under French law , and thus illegal .
A French court ruled in favor of LICRA .
Yahoo ! , instead of appealing the French court ’s ruling , sued LICRA in the United States , arguing that the organization had violated Yahoo ’s First Amendment right to free expression .
( See Yahoo ! Inc. v. La Ligue Contre Le Racisme et l’antisémitisme , 433 F.3d 1199 ( 9th Cir. 2006 ) . )
Yahoo ’s case against LICRA was eventually dismissed by the federal court in the Northern District of California on an order from an en banc panel at the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals .
The appellate court determined that it lacked personal jurisdiction over LICRA .
This decision overturned an earlier finding that LICRA had violated Yahoo ’s First Amendment rights of free expression .
As it stands , American courts are not even sure if they have jurisdiction over foreign entities that wish to restrict the expression of American - based companies .
This is a story worth watching .
Thus far , Wikipedia has asserted its right to free expression and not removed the names of Sedlmayr ’s murderers from its English article .

10 questions for Tom Krattenmaker on Onward Christian Athletes : Turning Ballparks into Pulpits and Players into Preachers
Author ’s Intro :
I never have to wait long these days for the headlines to remind me why I thought I needed to write this book examining religion in pro sports .
Through December , we had nonstop coverage of the Tiger Woods scandal constantly reminding us of the temptations that always lie in wait for famous , super - wealthy athletes .
Indeed , one of the purposes of the Christianity movement in sports is to exert a positive moral influence on athletes , who always seem to be getting caught up in various forms of misbehavior off the field , court , and ( in Tiger ’s case ) course .
To get us started on the new decade , we had Fox News commentator Brit Hume reminding us of the other primarily objective of the faith - in - sports movement : to use athletes as poster men for the virtues of faith and as carriers of the evangelistic message .
Recall what Hume said in his now - famous ( infamous ? ) over - the - air faith pitch to Tiger .
Not only would a full Christian conversion bring the fallen golf hero forgiveness and redemption , Hume said .
It would make him “ a great example ” to the world .
And then there was Mark McGwire reminding us of some of the self - serving ways in which athletes are known to invoke faith .
While finally fessing up this week to the steroids use of which he ’s been long suspected , McGwire vehemently insisted that the drug only helped him stay healthy , and did not help him hit the ball out of the park with his legendary proficiency .
The latter , he said , had nothing to do with steroids .
It was a “ gift ” from “ the man upstairs . ”
Far be it from us to question what God has given Mark McGwire .
______
What inspired you to write Onward Christian Athletes ?
What sparked your interest ?
The book has its genesis in the master ’s degree program in religion in public life that I did at the University of Pennsylvania , which I completed about five years ago .
I was reading a lot about the evangelical movement in America , learning a lot about it in my classes , and I started to realize that the conspicuous religious expression I was seeing in pro sports was an important piece of this larger evangelical engagement with American culture and politics .
It struck me as a subject that had n’t received the thorough journalistic examination that it deserved .
It seemed to me there were dozens and dozens of books about religion in politics , but no recent and thorough journalistic analyses of religion in sports .
I was basically trying to figure out why religion has become such a big part of the game and what it meant .
Of course , the seed was planted long before .
I attended an evangelism event in the Minnesota Twins stadium , featuring a star pitcher for the Twins , when I was about nine years old .
I think that stuck with me in some fashion .
What ’s the most important take - home message for readers ?
Pro sports fans see a lot of religious expression in pro sports — players pointing up to God after a touchdown or home run , for example , or thanking and praising Jesus in post - game interviews — and that was my starting point for the research .
As I began to dig into it I was struck by how much organization and strategy exists behind and under all of this .
Not to say it ’s secret or sinister or anything , because it ’s not , but fans do n’t realize how much work goes on behind the scenes by the Christian organizations that minister to athletes and leverage sports to reach the public with their evangelistic message .
Is there anything you had to leave out ?
Writing newspaper and magazine articles , as I ’ve always done , is often a struggle against space limitations .
As a rookie author beginning this project , I figured the book would be my chance to finally be free of these space limits and to say pretty much everything on the subject .
Well , I learned otherwise .
There ’s so much more I could have said in the book — and maybe should have said — that just did n’t “ fit ” for various reasons .
One area of discussion that probably deserves more space is the growing interest on the part of Catholics to get a piece of the action , so to speak , in pro sports ministry , which is now largely dominated by evangelicals .
Catholic social teaching and ethics , and Catholicism ’s historic affinity for sports , make this an interesting possibility for the future .
What would it look like if Catholics had a bigger influence on sports - world Christianity ?
What ’s also missing from my book is acknowledgment of Tony Dungy ’s involvement in addressing the appallingly small number of African American coaches in major college football .
Dungy is one of the most - admired Christian athletic figures in America and , as the first black coach to ever win the Super Bowl , someone with special credibility when it comes to talking about persistent race issues in America .
In my book , I express my disappointment in him and certain other black Christian sports figures for not continuing the tradition of black churches in challenging social and racial injustice .
After my book went to press , however , I learned that Tony Dungy has begun working with — and evidently pressing — the NCAA to address this problem .
I applaud him for that and hope he can help achieve some progress .
I could go on about what ’s left out of the book .
There ’s also the fact that I focus on the “ big three ” men ’s pro sports — the NBA , NFL , and Major League Baseball — and say very little about women ’s sports .
No disrespect intended .
I needed a manageable size and scope for the project , and the issues that interest me most are especially poignant around the big - three men ’s leagues .
What are some of the biggest misconceptions about your topic ?
Maybe “ misconception ” is n’t the right word .
But in talking with people about my book , I find they ’re generally surprised to learn how organized Christianity in pro sports actually is .
For example , most are unaware that all the teams in pro football , basketball , and baseball have Christian chaplains on hand , counseling and supporting players , leading Bible studies and chapel services , and enlisting players to join them in fulfilling the Great Commission , and so forth .
One journalist has called pro sports perhaps the most heavily proselytized segment in our country , and that could very well be true .
Did you have a specific audience in mind ?
I thought the book would interest the more intellectually inclined and progressive - and secular - leaning sports fans , those who typically voice objections and ask questions about outspoken Christian athletes .
I thought it would also attract people who are interested in the role of religion in American culture , folks who are curious about the Christian Right and its influence on American life .
Finally , I very much hoped I would reach some of the evangelical community , especially the more open - minded and nonpartisan evangelicals who are part of the project of reforming their movement and adapting it to our changing culture .
I ’m gratified to see that at least some of that third potential audience is supporting the book .
Of course , it seems there are plenty who are ready to dismiss it or ignore , write it off as just one more attack on their faith by the liberal elite media .
That ’s a shame , because if they read my book they ’d see that I have a lot of respect for Christianity and its potential to change the world for the better .
Are you hoping to just inform readers ?
Give them pleasure ?
Piss them off ?
Well , certainly not the latter .
One of my weaknesses as a writer is my overgrown tendency to be polite , and to go overboard in trying to be fair .
( Not that I always live up to it . )
That said , I know from the reaction in the blogosphere and my e-mail inbox that there are some conservative Christians who are very pissed off about my book .
You ca n’t really write about religion and culture without pissing off someone .
My real motivation was to help sports fans understand why they ’re seeing so much Christianity in the game , whether it ’s something they like or dislike .
I wanted to frame the issue and make some sense of it .
I observe a lot of visceral , knee - jerk reaction to religion in the game — vigorous defenses of it and attacks against it — but not a lot of thoughtful or nuanced thinking about what ’s good and legitimate about it , and what ’s objectionable about it in view of the unifying civic role played by our sports teams .
I also wanted to help readers understand why this is a public issue and why the public has a right to care and comment .
What alternative title would you give to this book ?
“ The Salvation of Sports . ”
It ’s the title of my book ’s closing chapter , and it highlights the largely unrealized potential of sports - world Christianity to serve as a real moral voice against the abuses and excesses of big - time sports in America today .
Since coming on the scene a half - century ago , sports ministry has mainly concerned itself with evangelism and issues around players ’ individual morality , but it has been largely silent on what you might call the systemic “ sins ” of big - time sports .
How do you feel about the cover ?
I feel that my publisher , Rowman and Littlefield , did a great job with the cover .
It captures the spirit and essence of the book .
They gave the cover an eye - grabbing design and muscular , athletic kind of feel .
There ’s a certain ambiguity with the title and subtitle that I like .
( The former was my idea and the latter was theirs . )
We ’ve all been taught that you ca n’t judge a book by its cover , but if people did that with mine , I think we ’d be all right .
Is there a book out there you wish you had written ?
Which one ?
Why ?
In a way , you ’re asking me to name the book or books that I admire most and that represent the best example of the kind of writing I do .
Malcolm Gladwell ’s books immediately come to mind .
His books shed fresh light on longstanding situations and phenomena and help us find new ways of thinking about things — and in a very accessible , engaging style .
That ’s what I try to do in my newspaper columns and in my book .
What ’s your next book ?
This is just tentative , but my agent and I are considering a book exploring the amazing religious innovation happening here in my home base of Portland , Oregon .
Some are calling it “ Jesus ’ Favorite City , ” and with their tongues only 90 - something percent in cheek .
This is fun to think about because of Portland ’s ultra-secular reputation and demographics .
I ’m super intrigued by this idea that Christianity ’s best face would emerge in such a secular , liberal environment .
Is there anything you ’d like readers to know about your book ?
Yes , thank you for asking .
My book is not a sports book per se , so potential readers who think , “ Well , I ’m not really a sports fan , ” need not worry .
The book is very much for them !
I ’d like to think that anyone who reads it will come away with a better understanding of the issues and challenges around religion — evangelical Christianity in particular — in American public life in this age .
When Marianne Zelonis came home from work one Thursday evening in April , she found her beloved three year old German Shepherd Kiera lying motionless just yards away from home on a neighbor 's lawn .
" I jumped out of the car and ran over to her and she had a bullet hole to her temple ... she was dead . "
Zelonis ' next door neighbor admitted it was her son , Arthur Menechini , a 43 year old resident of Pittston Township , PA who shot Kiera , and said the shooting was in self defense .
However , upon investigation police were unsure how Kiera could have escaped her yard and found no evidence supporting Menechini 's claim that Kiera had threatened or attacked him and his mother 's dog Coco on what many have cited as the first time the man had ever walked his mother 's dog on a leash .
In fact , Coco was allowed to run loose at all times of day and night , antagonizing Kiera and other neighbors .
Kiera , on the other hand , was known to have a great personality , be even - tempered and good with both children and other animals .
Moreover , there was a history of animosity between the families and Mr. Menechini had often made it clear he considered Kiera to be a " nuisance " .
Claiming his actions were justifiable , he turned down a plea deal this summer .
This month in a plea hearing , Menechini 's attorney 's request for dismissal of all counts of animal cruelty and disorderly conduct was refused .
A bench trial has been scheduled for early January , with the presiding judge solely responsible for the verdict and if applicable , the sentence .
Mr. Menichini thinks he did nothing wrong - but there should be no tolerance for someone taking an innocent life in such a violent way .
He needs to pay for his actions !
It is our intention to show our support for Arthur Menechini 's conviction for the charges of animal cruelty and disorderly conduct .
We also believe it is of utmost importance that Mr. Menechini receive the maximum sentence allowable ; both to appropriately punish him for these crimes and to send an emphatic message that this type of violent behavior against animals and against a family 's animal companion , will not ever be tolerated .
It wo n't bring this family 's precious pet back to them ... but a strong sentence will in part bring them closure , and by discouraging similar acts of this kind in the future , assure that Kiera did not entirely die in vain .
Parents ' fury as breastfeeding doll for young girls goes on sale
We 've seen dolls that cry , dolls that drink and eat , even dolls that soil themselves .
But now one Spanish toy company has come up with a controversial way of making their products even more authentic - a breastfeeding doll .
But Berjuan has been slammed by parents who complain the bizarre toy promotes the sexualisation of young girls .
Bebe Gloton , meaning greedy baby , looks like any regular toy , but comes with a bra-like halter top featuring symbolic flowers for the child to wear .
Breast is best : Bebe Gloton latches on to a flower - shaped nipple , emitting a suckling sound
Questionable : Some parents have labelled the toy as inappropriate for young girls
To play with the doll , it is latched on to the petals , where it emits a suckling sound , before it has to be burped to stop it from crying .
The bizarre electronic creation , which was designed by Berjuan to promote breast - feeding , has sparked outrage among some parents who have branded the toy ' inapropriate ' .
Posting a comment after watching a demonstration video online , one user wrote : ' This toy would never work in the U.S. because the public would sexualize the act of breastfeeding , thereby deeming it inappropriate for little girl to engage in . '
Another wrote : ' Honestly , I think this is awful .
Now let me just be clear , I think breastfeeding is wonderful and wholeheartedly encourage it , however , it is completely inappropriate to allow a young girl to mimic it .
Novelty : Bebe Gloton retails at around 44 Euros but is only available in Spain
' Yes , breastfeeding is completely natural , but it is something that only adults do , not children .
It would actually disgust me if I were to see a child using this “ toy ” . '
Many parents however were happy to buy Bebe Gloton for their own child as a means of encouraging the natural process of breast - feeding .
One poster wrote : ' I think is great because there are so many teenage mothers like myself that wo n't breastfeed because of the way society has put it in their heads not too .
' it is the best thing for them and it promotes that its the best way to keep your baby healthy , and its free , we can use that in this economy today . '
Another fan of Bebe Gloton wrote enthusiastically : ' This is n’t gross .
What ’s gross is a doll that poops . '
The life - like doll measures 19.6 inches long , the average length of a real new - born , and is available in either gender , retailing at around 44 euros .
It is available to buy in Spain but has yet to hit international markets .
Boston , Massachusetts ( CNN ) -- Republican Scott Brown won a major upset victory in Tuesday 's special election for the U.S. Senate seat formerly held by liberal Democrat Ted Kennedy .
Brown defeated Massachusetts Attorney General Martha Coakley , the Democratic candidate .
Brown 's victory made real the once unthinkable prospect of a Republican filling the seat held by Kennedy , known as the liberal lion , for almost 47 years until his death from brain cancer in August .
Voters across Massachusetts braved winter cold and snow for an election with high stakes -- the domestic agenda of President Obama , including his priority of health care reform .
Brown 's victory strips Democrats of the 60 - seat Senate supermajority needed to overcome GOP filibusters against future Senate action on a broad range of White House priorities .
Senate Democrats needed all 60 votes in their caucus to pass the health care bill , and the loss of one seat imperils generating that support again for a compromise measure worked out with the House .
In a subdued concession speech , Coakley said she expected a tough assessment of her loss and lots of " Wednesday - morning quarterbacking " after losing a seat held by Democrats for more than 50 years .
" I am heartbroken at the result , " Coakley said , later adding : " Although I am very disappointed , I always respect the voters ' choice . "
Massachusetts Secretary of State Bill Galvin said last week that certifying Tuesday 's election results could take more than two weeks -- potentially enough time to allow congressional Democrats to pass a final health care bill before Brown is seated .
But multiple Democratic sources said this is unlikely .
Even if House and Senate Democrats could reach a deal to meld their bills and pass them in the next couple of weeks , there would be a huge outcry from not only Republicans , but also an increasingly distrustful public if they appeared to be rushing it through .
Galvin had predicted as many as 2.2 million of the state 's 4.5 million registered voters would vote -- at least double the turnout from December 's primary .
In one sign of high interest , more than 100,000 absentee ballots were requested ahead of the election , according to Galvin 's spokesman , Brian McNiff .
Coakley was initially expected to easily win the race to replace Kennedy , who made health care reform the centerpiece of his Senate career .
Until recently , Brown was underfunded and unknown statewide .
In addition , no Republican has won a U.S. Senate race in Massachusetts since 1972 , and Democrats control the governorship , both houses of the state legislature , and the state 's entire congressional delegation .
However , Brown surged in the weeks preceding Tuesday 's vote and led in all the final polls .
Democratic sources told CNN that Coakley called Brown on Tuesday night to concede .
In a sign of the high stakes involved , the Coakley campaign held an afternoon news conference Tuesday to complain that voters in three places received ballots already marked for Brown .
i Report : Send us your thoughts on the special election
McNiff confirmed that the secretary of state 's offices received two reports of voters saying they got pre-marked ballots .
The suspect ballots were invalidated and the voters received new ballots , McNiff said .
Kevin Conroy , the Coakley campaign manager , said the " disturbing incidents " raised questions about the integrity of the election .
In response , the Brown campaign issued a statement criticizing Coakley 's team .
" Reports that the Coakley campaign is making reckless accusations regarding the integrity of today 's election is a reminder that they are a desperate campaign , " Daniel B. Winslow , the counsel for the Brown campaign , said in the statement .
Obama has been both " surprised and frustrated " by the race , White House Press Secretary Robert Gibbs said Tuesday .
Obama and former President Bill Clinton hit the campaign trail over the past three days in an attempt to save Coakley 's campaign , which observers say was hampered by complacency and missteps .
Obama crushed Sen. John McCain in Massachusetts in 2008 , beating the GOP presidential nominee by 26 points .
" If you were fired up in the last election , I need you more fired up in this election , " Obama urged a crowd at a Coakley campaign rally on Sunday .
Vicki Kennedy , the late senator 's widow , called on state Democrats to turn out to save her husband 's legacy .
" We need your help .
We need your support .
We need you to get out there and vote on Tuesday , " Kennedy said .
" We need you to bring your neighbors .
We need you to bring your friends . "
Brown , who has trumpeted his 30 years of service in the National Guard , hewed to traditional GOP themes at the end of the campaign .
He promised at a rally Sunday that , if elected , he would back tax cuts and be tougher on terrorists than Coakley .
He also repeated a pledge to oppose Obama 's health care reform effort .
" Massachusetts wants real reform and not this trillion - dollar Obama health care that is being forced on the American people , " he said .
" As the 41st [ Republican ] senator I will make sure that we do it better . "
Forty - four percent of Massachusetts voters cited the economy and jobs as their top concern in a recent 7 News / Suffolk University poll .
Thirty - eight percent mentioned health care as their top concern .
Voters more concerned with the economy were split almost evenly between the two candidates ; voters more worried about health care narrowly supported Coakley .
Brown 's surprising strength came in part because some independents and conservatives who have supported Democrats in the past were having second thoughts .
Democrats far outnumber Republicans in Massachusetts , but there are more independents than Democrats and Republicans combined .
Several Democratic sources say multiple Obama advisers have told the party they believed Coakley was going to lose , despite Obama 's campaign appearance for Coakley on Sunday .
Facing the possibility of Coakley 's defeat , Democrats were trying to figure out if they could pass health care reform without that crucial 60th Senate vote .
The seat is currently held by former Kennedy aide and longtime friend Paul Kirk , who was appointed to the seat on an interim basis .
Two Democratic sources in close contact with the White House told CNN on Monday they 've urged the administration , in the event of a Brown victory , to push House Democrats to pass the Senate 's health care bill as currently written .
Doing so would prevent the plan from having to be taken up by the Senate again .
" I think the Senate bill clearly is better than nothing , " House Majority Leader Steny Hoyer , D - Maryland , said Tuesday .
A third option would be for Democrats to revisit the idea of trying to push health care through the Senate with only 51 votes -- a simple majority .
But to do that Democrats would have to use a process known as reconciliation , which presents technical and procedural issues that would delay the process for a long time .
A number of Democrats are eager to put the health care debate behind them and move on to economic issues such as job creation as soon as possible this election year .
Senate Democrats could also try again to get moderate GOP Sen .
Olympia Snowe of Maine to vote for a compromise health reform plan .
Multiple Democratic sources , however , have said they believe that is unlikely now .
CNN's Jim Acosta , Dana Bash , Kevin Bohn , Ed Henry , Ed Hornick , John King , Suzanne Malveaux , Shawna Shepherd , Jessica Yellin , Alan Silverleib and Tom Cohen contributed to this report .

Gavin , my nephew , continues to do Trojan work on his Freedom of Information campaign and is beginning to get noticed by the wider media .
Here ’s a report from the Sunday Times on 24th January .
Blogger gets big discount on the price of freedom Hats off to Gavin Sheridan , the blogger who has embarrassed the Moriarty tribunal into posting all the transcripts of 370 days of public sittings on the internet .
Sheridan first applied for the transcripts to the Department of An Taoiseach , under Freedom of Information .
It refused on the basis that they can be purchased from Doyle Court Reporters .
Doyles quoted a fee of € 16,600 with a discount of 25 % for anyone bulk buying .
“ I did suggest that since the public had already paid nearly € 1 million for the transcripts , it seemed a little odd that I , as a citizen , have to fork out another € 16,600 to get copies . ”
Sheridan writes on thestorey.ie .
Talk to the Moriarty tribunal , it suggested .
So he did , and they said copyright rested with Doyles .
They later relented , offering Sheridan a disc with the transcripts , but such was the volume of requests that the tribunal is now posting everything online .
A small , but significant victory for freedom of information .
Some questions that come to mind .
What kind of contract does Doyle Court Reporters have with the state and how is it that the Moriarty Tribunal can , on the one hand , say that DCR have copyright and then , on the other hand , publish all the material ?
Exclusive : Apple to Buy Quattro Wireless for $ 275 Million
Apple is set to announce that it has acquired Quattro Wireless for $ 275 million , several sources confirmed .
The announcement of the acquisition might come as soon as tomorrow , upping the ante in the mobile advertising business significantly .
Google ( GOOG ) recently forked over an astonishing $ 750 million for Silicon Valley ’s AdMob , a Quattro competitor , which Apple ( AAPL ) had also made a bid to acquire .
Both innovative start - ups are aimed squarely at the fast - growing market to advertise on smartphones , such as Apple ’s iPhone and Google ’s Android devices .
In fact , the search giant will unveil the Nexus One tomorrow , a mobile phone powered by its Android operating system software , which Google designed and will sell on a Web site instead of via telecom companies .
Waltham , Mass .- based Quattro has raised close to $ 30 million from two main venture investors–Highland Capital Partners and Globespan Capital Partners .
Founded several years ago , its clients include Ford ( F ) , Disney ( DIS ) and the National Football League .
Competitors in the space are many still , despite these big acquisitions , and include Millennial Media and Jumptap , both of which are now clearly in play to other players , from telecoms to other device makers to big Internet companies .
An Apple spokesperson declined to comment to BoomTown about the deal and email inquiries to Quattro have not yet been returned .

Del tha Funkee Homosapien is an alternative hip - hop artist .
Del was born Teren Delvon Jones , August 12 , 1972 , in Oakland , California .
Del was part of his cousin Ice Cube ’s backing band Da Lench Mob and made his first solo album , I Wish My Brother George Was Here , with support from his cousin in 1991 .
Critics and fans had mixed opinions about the album , many feeling that Del ’s and Cube ’s styles were n't an ideal match .
Del decided to part ways with his cousin for his next album , No Need for Alarm , which allowed him to find his own style and subject matter , and also start his own crew , Hieroglyphics .
In 1996 , Del was ready to release his Future Development album .
However , just before its release , Del was released from his recording contract with Elektra Records .
Around this same time , Souls of Mischief , Extra Prolific and Casual ( all members of Del 's Hieroglyphics group ) were all released from their recording contracts with Jive Records .
Frustrated , Del and the rest of Hieroglyphics decided to start their own record label , called Hieroglyphics Imperium .
Because of the problems with Elektra , Future Development was available only on cassette via the Hieroglyphics website for a time , until its eventual widespread release on CD in 2002 , six years after its proposed release date .
The mistreatment of Del & Hieroglyphics by their record labels became infamous in hip - hop circles , as a perfect example of " industry rule # 4080 " ( record company people are shady ) .
After Hieroglyphics ' successful reemergence with their own independent label , Del & Hieroglyphics became an inspiration for some rap artists to start their own labels while keeping the lion 's share of the money for themselves .
Arguably the efforts of Del & Hieroglyphics paved the way for other famous independent rap labels known today , such as Roc - a - Fella Records or Rawkus Records .
In 1998 , Hieroglyphics came out with their first full length album , Third Eye Vision , in which Del shined .
The album was well received by both fans and critics .
Two years later , Del came out with Both Sides of the Brain , and in 2001 , he released Deltron 3030 with Dan the Automator Nakamura and Kid Koala , which garnered extreme praise for its combination of beats and flow and futuristic style .
Deltron 3030 helped expand Del ’s audience , though not quite to the commercial mainstream .
Del collaborated with Gorillaz for two songs on their debut album , both of which became singles : " Clint Eastwood " and " Rock the House " .
In their videos he was portrayed as a clown - like ghost .
2003 saw the release of Full Circle , a second album with the Hiero crew .
This latest album has gotten many mixed reviews , with some people liking its originality and display of talents of the entire crew , whereas some have complained that Del was seen only sporadically on the album , acting more like a guest artist .
Del ’s lyrics often reflect his imaginative interests , offering humor and themes not usually found in most new hip hop , including video games , bad hygiene , intergalactic rap battles , and more .
In 2000 , the song " Positive Contact " from Deltron 3030 was featured in the game Mat Hoffman 's Pro BMX .
In 2001 , the song " If You Must " was featured in the game Tony Hawk 's Pro Skater 3 .
In 2003 , the song " Positive Contact " was again featured in a video game - this time in Tony Hawk 's Underground .
In 2005 , the song " Burnt " featuring Hieroglyphics was featured in the game Tony Hawk ’s American Wasteland .
In 2006 , his song " Catch a Bad One " was featured in the game Mark Ecko's Getting Up : Contents Under Pressure .
Eight years following his last solo album , Both Sides of the Brain , in March 2008 Del released his newest solo , titled Eleventh Hour , under the Definitive Jux record label .
In 2009 , Del released Del 's Leak Pack # 1 ( download ) & # 2 ( download ) via his MySpace page .
In April of 2009 he released his 6th solo album , Funk Man ( The Stimulus Package ) .
The album was released online and can be downloaded for free here .
He also released a second new solo album , Automatic Statik , via his BandCamp site in September of 2009 .
October of 2009 saw the release of Del 's collaboration with Tame One , entitled Parallel Uni-verses .
In January of 2014 , he dropped a free album titled Iller Than Most online .
On April 20th 2018 , Del and producer AMPLIVE collaborated for the entirety of their newest project , GATE 13

MOGADISHU , Somalia 
From the gates of Villa Somalia , the hilltop presidential palace , this ruin of a city almost looks peaceful .
After nearly two decades of civil war , there is very little pollution , since just about all of Somalia ’s industry has been razed .
A clean breeze lifts off the ocean and stirs the bougainvillea .
Few cars remain in the city and relatively few people , because hundreds of thousands have recently fled .
It is surreally quiet , except for the occasional crack of a high - powered rifle .
President Sheik Sharif Sheik
Ahmed sits behind his desk in a pinstriped suit , prayer hat , designer glasses and a chunky , expensive - looking watch .
He is ringed by enemies and guarded around the clock by Ugandan soldiers who literally camp outside his door and , for the rare occasions he leaves the palace , drive him to the airport in an armored personnel carrier .
The few glimpses he gets of Mogadishu ’s deserted streets are through two - inch - thick bulletproof glass .
“ This government faced obstacles that were unparalleled , ” said Sheik Sharif , a former high school teacher , who became president in February .
“ We had to deal with international terrorist groups creating havoc elsewhere .
Their plan was to topple the government soon after it arrived .
The government proved it could last . ”

On his radio show today Rush Limbaugh called for war with Iran , but Rush does n’t want to use ground troops but massive bombing raids .
Limbaugh said , “ The only way to stop them is to destroy the Iranian regime , the mullahs , and that can only be accomplished through war . ”
Here is the audio from Media Matters :
Limbaugh said , “ Now ladies and gentleman as far as Iran is concerned , the only way to stop them is to destroy the Iranian regime , the mullahs and that can only be accomplished through war , and by war , I do n’t mean ground troops , I mean massive bombing raids intended to destroy every one of the key targets .
The question is whether or not we have the will to do this anymore . ”
Advertisements
Limbaugh described the people running Iran as irrational religious fanatics , but then he got back on subject , “ I do n’t know whether we have the will to do this or not .
Bush did n’t because he was engaged in Iraq and Afghanistan , and they would have impeached him if he tried .
Obama ’s tied up in knots with his own appeasement mentality , left wing base .
Everything Obama is touching is coming apart … ”
He went into full neo -con fear mongering mode , “ If we do n’t pound Iran into submission at some point , they are going to get the bomb .
They ’re bragging about it .
They ’ve told us .
They ’ve shunned the inspectors , and they laugh about it all .
If Israel does n’t attack them , the world will forever be a hostage to an Islamic regime that could fire mid range and eventually long range nuclear missiles when it chooses .
Now we know that Obama wo n’t take effective military steps to stop Iran , so Israel does n’t , it will in fact become a nuclear regime . ”
The problem with Limbaugh ’s reasoning is that the National Intelligence Estimate said that , “ We judge with high confidence that Iran will not be technically capable of producing and reprocessing enough plutonium for a weapon before about 2015 . ”
Yet Rush is ready to declare war on Iran .
The neo -con point of view assumes that Iran would sit themselves be bombed without retaliation .
A war with Iran could not be won simply with air strikes .
If the US starts bombing Iran , they will retaliate , most likely by attacking US forces in Iraq .
Iran has 350,000 ground troops , which would make Iraq and Afghanistan seem like child ’s play compared to war with Iran .
The Bush Doctrine has already been proven to be a failure , and perhaps the only move that would be worse that the US attacking Iran would be for Israel to attack Iran .
Such action would result in a large scale regional war , which the US would be drawn into .
The more things change , the more they stay the same on the right wing .
Just occasionally you start to read a book and within minutes you know you are on to an absolute winner .
This is one such book :
James
Tooley grabs your attention right from the very start with a deeply personal story of how he went to India to study private schools for the few and discovered a vast and virtually hidden network of private schools for the poor .
Taken aback by the sheer number of these backstreet schools , he reported what he had seen to his colleagues at the World Bank and was met with a mixture of disdain and bemusement .
These schools were " ripping off the poor " it seems , despite the fact that poor parents were scrimping and saving to afford the fees they could have avoided by simply sending their children to the free state schools .
Why would they do this ?
The answer was very simple - a survey of state schools found that " in only half was there any teaching activity at all " .
Another excuse was that these schools were creaming off the elite , an story I heard just the other day about schools in the UK .
Poor parents were criticised for increasing inequality - another story that will be familiar to UK readers .
What was even more amazing was Tooley 's discovery that the success of the private education sector had been noted by luminaries like development economist Amartya Sen , and had been reported upon by Oxfam .
And both the economist and the charity had then concluded that universal state provision was the correct way forward .
Staggering is n't it ?
It is hard to escape the conclusion that development gurus like Sen and mega-charities like Oxfam are part of the problem here .
The incentive of the charity workers is to keep the people poor so that the problem never goes away .
This is the bad charity of the title of this post .
And the good charity ?
There 's plenty of it in evidence in the book .
Here 's Tooley :
Ten - year - old Farath Sultana also attended Peace High School .
Her father works as a cleaner in a mosque and earned a monthly salary of 700 rupees ( $ 15.55 ) , which he admitted was not enough to feed his four family members .
The family lived rent free with relatives who helped them get through each month by providing food .
Both the mother and the father were illiterate , but they wanted their chidren to be educated .
Peace High School provided both Farath and her six - year - old brother free tuition because of their critical financial position .

North Korea said on Tuesday it had detained a U.S. citizen who entered its territory , apparently confirming a report that an American activist crossed into the
state to raise awareness about Pyongyang ’s human rights abuses .
Robert Park , 28 , walked over the frozen Tumen river from
China and into the North last Friday , other activists said .
The Korean - American told Reuters ahead of the crossing that it was his duty as a
Christian to make the journey and that he was carrying a letter calling on North Korean leader Kim Jong - il to step down .
Park had an exclusive interview with Reuters last week before starting on his journey .
The following are excerpts from the conversation .
He requested that the comments be held until he was in North Korea .
Reuters :
Why are you planning to go into North Korea ?
Robert Park : The North Korean human rights crisis by murder rate is the worst in the world .
An estimated 1,000 people a day die by starvation and starvation is a murder case .
North Korea has been sent more food aid than any nation in the world but the food has not gone to the people who need it .
So this is murder .
But not only that , there are concentration camps in North Korea that are of the same brutality as in Nazi Germany .
Responsible governments are completely silent about the issue .
The United States , China , Russia , Japan and South Korea have a huge responsibility to speak out about this because all these nations played a role the arbitrary division of the Koreas , where not a single Korean was consulted .
Yet the lives of these people are of no issue to these governments .
That is a crime .
It is a huge crime
What is happening in North Korea is genocide .
We know there are legitimate fears about what could happen through nuclear weapons .
But a nation that runs concentration camps , a nation that kills men , women and children without any kind of restraint can never be trusted .
We believe the resolution to this whole crisis is simply addressing North Korea honestly about this has to change .
We do not hate people .
I am Christian , but I do have to say that this is not a legitimate government .
We cannot talk to North Korea as if it is a legitimate government , but we need to liberate North Korea .
We need to have a vision for the unification of Korea .
It has to happen immediately because people are dying by the thousands every single day .
Reuters :
By going into North Korea , how can you change this ?
You are going in well aware of the dangers
Park :
My demand is that I do not want to be released .
I do n’t want President Obama to come and pay to get me out .
But I want the North Korean people to be free .
Until the concentration camps are liberated , I do not want to come out .
If I have to die with them , I will .
I am Christian and it says in the Bible that we must love the lost .
We must love the poor and the needy .
We must love them more than ourselves .
( For ) these innocent men , women and children , as Christians , we need to take the cross for them .
The cross means that we sacrifice our lives for the redemption of others .
I am going in for the sake of the lives of the North Korean people .
And if he ( Kim Jong - il ) kills me , in a sense , I realize this is better .
Then the governments of the world will become more prone to say something , and more embarrassed and more forced to make a statement .
This is serious and it is a crime that America is committing against the North Korean people by not speaking out against this .
President Obama just won the Nobel Peace Prize and I love President Obama and the American government , but they are committing a serious crime .
Through the media and through sacrifice , we are looking for the global leaders to be forced to give an account .
There is no excuse .
We also want the church to repent .
The South Korean church needs to repent .
There has been so much playing around and honestly , there is no time to play games .
The priority of every single person in South Korea must be to end this holocaust of lives .
I was going to go next month but what happened was that here in Korea there has been certain things that have endangered my going next month .
That is why I am going right now .
Because certain people have found out and are trying to prevent me from going .
Initially Christmas Day was what they were thinking of .
It is the coldest time .
It is the most difficult time for me to go physically and also on Christmas Day it is such a symbolic day .
Worldwide is the most renowned day .
It is the happiest day for most of the world but for North Korea , it is like hell .
I have to share their suffering .
That is why I am asking every person who cares about North Korea , let us arise and let us demonstrate .
Let us see mass demonstrations .
This is not a personal agenda .
I think I may not live much longer .
My personal desire is to be married and to have a future .
I am laying that all down because of Jesus Christ and because God loves these people , he does not want them to die .
Reuters :
Do you think you will be able to get support from governments including the United States because you are making this choice on your own , fully aware of what may well happen ?
Park : I want Kim Jong-il and the North Korean government to know that I love them .
I love all these people .
I am going in because it has to change , for the sake of the children , the men and the women who are being brutally murdered .
But as long as this genocide continues , I have no choice .
I have great sorrow for Kim Jong - il .
The North Korean people have been brainwashed from youth and they do not know what the truth is .
I had a vision on July 27 , which was the beginning of the demonstration movement .
I am not someone who was a part of the human rights movement officially .
I was someone who was praying and sharing in the physical help of refugees one by one .
I had a vision where God revealed that there needs to be a mass demonstration movement for North Korean human rights .
That there will be liberation of the North Korean people .
There will be a global compensation movement for a measurable loss and suffering .
There will be calls for unification .
And there will be reconciliation between North and South Koreans .
I am making this choice on my own because it is too slow right now .
There has never been a mass demonstration for North Korean human rights and there needs to be .
Last year , there were hundreds of thousands of people in South Korea demonstrating for this ridiculous thing about the kind of beef we were getting in South Korea .
There was nothing to it .
What does it say about our generation that we can be mobilised to demonstrate about the kind of beef we are getting and we cannot demonstrate for people who are our own kin who are dying by the thousands every day for no reason at all .
One of the issues in South Korea is that there has been a competition among North Korean human rights groups .
People are saying that ‘ I want to be in the leadership ’ .
It is ridiculous .
With that kind of political fighting , trying to be number one , there will never be mass demonstrations because people are selling the issue for their own gain .
I am not saying that everyone is doing that .
My hope is that through going to North Korea , my sacrifice , that there will be a profound repentance among the church and also among human rights ministries – that there will not longer be quarrelling and competition .
Reuters :
Do you see the possibility of your imprisonment helping Kim Jong - il .
The North Korean leaders have used others , like the U.S journalists , who have crossed into its territory as bargaining chips .
Do you see your actions as having the potential to help the North Korean leaders you want to see removed ?
Park : I am aware of this and have been hesitating for a long time .
As a result of what happened to the journalists , I was speaking to a refugee friend of mine , she said it was one of the best things that happened for North Korea ’s liberation .
This was shortly after it happened and they were freed .
But now it has become worse because the journalists have not spoken out about the human rights crisis .
They were ransomed for a lot of money and they went home and wrote a book .
Ultimately , I am more tortured if I allow North Koreas to be like this .
The difference with these journalists is that they were kidnapped against their will .
I am going in saying either kill me or take me .
I am saying to the governments of the world , do not try to ransom me out but address the human rightscrisis .
If you 're willing to volunteer your help in the future in a particular area , post in a thread here so we have a list .
Thanks so much !

K-STATE STUDY FINDS THAT ANTIOXIDANTS AREN'T ALWAYS BENEFICIAL TO YOUR HEALTH AND CAN SOMETIMES IMPAIR MUSCLE FUNCTION
MANHATTAN --
Antioxidants increasingly have been praised for their benefits against disease and aging , but recent studies at Kansas State University show that they also can cause harm .
Researchers in K - State 's Cardiorespiratory Exercise Laboratory have been studying how to improve oxygen delivery to the skeletal muscle during physical activity by using antioxidants , which are nutrients in foods that can prevent or slow the oxidative damage to the body .
Their findings show that sometimes antioxidants can impair muscle function .
" Antioxidant is one of those buzz words right now , " said Steven Copp , a doctoral student in anatomy and physiology from Manhattan and a researcher in the lab .
" Walking around grocery stores you see things advertised that are loaded with antioxidants .
I think what a lot of people do n't realize is that the antioxidant and pro-oxidant balance is really delicate .
One of the things we 've seen in our research is that you can't just give a larger dose of antioxidants and presume that there will be some sort of beneficial effect .
In fact , you can actually make a problem worse . "
David C. Poole and Timothy I. Musch , K - State professors from both the departments of kinesiology and anatomy and physiology , direct the Cardiorespiratory Exercise Laboratory , located in the College of Veterinary Medicine complex .
Researchers in the lab study the physiology of physical activity in health and disease through animal models .
Copp and Daniel Hirai , an anatomy and physiology doctoral student from Manhattan working in the lab , have conducted various studies associated with how muscles control blood flow and the effects of different doses and types of antioxidants .
Abnormalities in the circulatory system , such as those that result from aging or a disease like chronic heart failure , can impair oxygen delivery to the skeletal muscle and increase fatigability during physical activity , Copp said .
The researchers are studying the effects antioxidants could have in the process .
" If you have a person trying to recover from a heart attack and you put them in cardiac rehab , when they walk on
a treadmill they might say it 's difficult , " Poole said .
" Their muscles get sore and stiff .
We try to understand why the blood cells are n't flowing properly and why they can't get oxygen to the muscles , as happens in healthy individuals . "
Copp said there is a potential for antioxidants to reverse or partially reverse some of those changes that result from aging or disease .
However , K - State 's studies have shown that some of the oxidants in our body , such as hydrogen peroxide , are helpful to increase blood flow .
" We 're now learning that if antioxidant therapy takes away hydrogen peroxide – or other naturally occurring vasodilators , which are compounds that help open blood vessels – you impair the body 's ability to deliver oxygen to the muscle so that it does n't work properly , " Poole said .
Poole said antioxidants are largely thought to produce better health , but their studies have shown that antioxidants can actually suppress key signaling mechanisms that are necessary for muscle to function effectively .
" It 's really a cautionary note that before we start recommending people get more antioxidants , we need to understand more about how they function in physiological systems and circumstances like exercise , " Poole said .
Hirai said the researchers will continue to explore antioxidants and the effects of exercise training .
Their studies are looking at how these can help individuals combat the decreased mobility and muscle function that comes with advancing age and diseases like heart failure .
" The research we do here is very mechanistic in nature , and down the road our aim is to take our findings and make recommendations for diseased and aging populations , " Copp said .
The researchers have published their recent findings in several journals , including the Journal of Applied Physiology , Respiratory Physiology and Neurobiology , Microvascular Research , The American Journal of Physiology and Experimental Physiology .

Nine days after the devastating earthquake that struck Haiti on January 12 , 2010 , it 's now clear that the initial phase of the US - led relief operation has conformed to the three fundamental tendencies that have shaped the more general course of the island 's recent history .
[ 1]
It has adopted military priorities and strategies .
It has sidelined Haiti's own leaders and government , and ignored the needs of the majority of its people .
And it has proceeded in ways that reinforce the already harrowing gap between rich and poor .
All three tendencies are n't just connected , they are mutually reinforcing .
These same tendencies will continue to govern the imminent reconstruction effort as well , unless determined political action is taken to counteract them .
I
Haiti is not only one of the poorest countries in the world , it is also one of the most polarised and unequal in its disparities in wealth and access to political power . [ 2 ]
A small clique of rich and well - connected families continues to dominate the country and its economy while more than half the population , according to the International Monetary Fund ( IMF ) , survive on a household income of around 44 US cents per day . [ 3 ]
Mass destitution has grown far more severe in recent decades .
Starting in the 1970s , internationally imposed neoliberal " adjustments " and austerity measures finally succeeded in doing what no Haitian government had managed to do since winning independence in 1804 : in order to set the country on the road towards " economic development " , they have driven large numbers of small farmers off their land and into densely crowded urban slums .
A small minority of these internal refugees may be lucky enough to find sweatshop jobs that pay the lowest wages in the region .
These wages currently average US $ 2 or $ 3 a day ; in real terms they are worth less than a quarter of their 1980 value .
Haiti's tiny elite owes its privileges to exclusion , exploitation and violence , and it is only violence that allows it to retain them .
For much of the last century , Haiti 's military and paramilitary forces ( with substantial amounts of US support ) were able to preserve these privileges on their own .
Over the course of the 1980s , however , it started to look as if local military repression might no longer be up to the job .
A massive and courageous popular mobilisation ( known as Lavalas ) culminated in 1990 with the landslide election victory of the liberation theologian Jean - Bertrand Aristide as president of Haiti .
Large numbers of ordinary people began to participate in the political system for the first time , and as political scientist Robert Fatton remembers , " panic seized the dominant class .
It dreaded living in close proximity to la populace and barricaded itself against Lavalas " . [ 4 ]
Nine months later , the army dealt with this popular threat in the time - honoured way , with a coup d'état .
Over the next three years , around 4000 Aristide supporters were killed .
However , when the US eventually allowed Aristide to return in October 1994 , he took a surprising and unprecedented step : he abolished the army that had deposed him .
As human rights lawyer Brian Concannon ( director of the Institute for Justice and Democracy in Haiti ) observed a few years later , " it is impossible to overestimate the impact of this accomplishment .
It has been called the greatest human rights development in Haiti since emancipation , and is wildly popular " .
[ 5 ]
In 2000 , the Haitian electorate gave Aristide a second overwhelming mandate when his party ( Fanmi Lavalas ) won more than 90 % of the seats in parliament .
II
More than anything else , what has happened in Haiti since 1990 should be understood as the progressive clarification of this basic dichotomy – democracy or the army .
Unadulterated democracy might one day allow the interests of the numerical majority to prevail , and thereby challenge the privileges of the elite .
In 2000 , such a challenge became a genuine possibility : the overwhelming victory of Fanmi Lavalas , at all levels of government , raised the prospect of genuine political change in a context in which there was no obvious extra-political mechanism ― no army ― to prevent it .
In order to avoid this outcome , the main strategy of Haiti 's little ruling class has been to redefine political questions in terms of " stability " and " security " , and in particular the security of property and investments .
Mere numbers may well win an election or sustain a popular movement but as everyone knows , only an army is equipped to deal with insecurity .
The well - armed " friend of Haiti " that is the United States knows this better than anyone else .
As soon as Aristide was re-elected , a systematic international campaign to bankrupt and destabilise his second government set the stage for a paramilitary insurrection and a further coup d'état , and in 2004 , thousands of US troops again invaded Haiti ( just as they first did back in 1915 ) in order to " restore stability and security " to their " troubled island neighbour " .
An expensive and long - term UN " stabilisation mission " staffed by 9000 heavily armed troops soon took over the job of helping to pacify the population and criminalise the resistance .
By the end of 2006 , thousands more Aristide supporters had been killed .
Over the course of 2009 , a suitably stabilised Haitian government agreed to persevere with the privatisation of the country ’s remaining public assets , [ 6 ] veto a proposal to increase minimum wages to $ 5 a day and to bar Fanmi Lavalas ( and several other political parties ) from participating in the next round of legislative elections .
When it comes to providing stability , today 's UN troops are clearly a big improvement over the old indigenous alternative .
If things get so unstable that even the ground begins to shake , however , there 's still nothing that can beat the world 's leading provider of peace and security .
III
In the immediate aftermath of the earthquake that struck on January 12 , 2010 , it might have seemed hard to counter arguments in favour of allowing the US military , with its " unrivalled logistical capability " , to take de facto control of such a massive relief operation .
Weary of bad press in Iraq and Afghanistan , US commanders also seemed glad of this unexpected opportunity to rebrand their armed forces as angels of mercy .
As usual , the Haitian government was instructed to be grateful for whatever help it could get .
That was before US commanders actively began – the day after the earthquake struck – to divert aid away from the disaster zone .
As soon as the US air force took control of Haitian airspace , on January 13 , it explicitly prioritised military over humanitarian flights .
Although most reports from Port - au - Prince emphasised remarkable levels of patience and solidarity by Haitians on the streets , US commanders made fears of popular unrest and insecurity their number one concern .
Their first priority was to avoid what the US Air Force Special Command Public Affairs spokesperson Ty Foster called another " Somalia effort " [ 7 ] – which is to say , presumably , a situation in which a humiliated US army might once again risk losing military control of a " humanitarian " mission .
As many observers predicted , however , the determination of US commanders to forestall this risk by privileging guns and soldiers over doctors and food has only succeeded in helping to provoke a few occasional bursts of the very unrest they set out to contain .
In order to amass a sufficiently large amount of soldiers and military equipment " on the ground " , the US Air Force diverted plane after plane packed with emergency supplies away from Port - au - Prince .
Among many others , World Food Program flights were turned away by US commanders on January 14 and 15 , the New York Times reported , " so that the United States could land troops and equipment , and lift Americans and other foreigners to safety " . [ 8 ]
Many similar flights met a similar fate , right through to the end of the week .
Médecins sans Frontières ( MSF ) alone has so far had to watch at least five planeloads of its medical supplies be turned away . [ 9 ]
On January 16 , for instance , " despite guarantees given by the United Nations and the US Defense Department , an MSF cargo plane carrying an inflatable surgical hospital was blocked from landing in Port - au - Prince and was re-routed to Samana , in Dominican Republic " , delaying its arrival by an additional 24 hours . [ 10 ]
Late on January 18 , MSF " complained that one of its cargo planes carrying 12 tonnes of medical equipment had been turned away three times from Port - au - Prince airport since Sunday [ January 17 ] " , despite receiving " repeated assurances they could land " .
By that stage one group of MSF doctors in Port - au - Prince had been " forced to buy a saw in the market to continue the amputations " upon which the lives of their patients depended . [ 11 ]
While US commanders set about restoring security by assembling a force of some 14,000 marines , residents in some less - secure parts of Port - au - Prince soon started to run out of food and water .
On January 20 people sleeping in one of the largest and most easily accessed of the many temporary refugee camps in central Port - au - Prince ( in Champs Mars ) told writer Tim Schwartz , author of the 2008 book Travesty in Haiti , that " no relief has arrived ; it is all being delivered on other side of town , by the US embassy " . [ 12 ]
Telesur reporter Reed Lindsay confirmed on January 20 , a full eight days after the quake , that the impoverished south - western Port - au - Prince suburb closest to the earthquake 's epicentre , Carrefour , still had n't received any food , aid or medical help . [ 13 ]
The BBC's Mark Doyle found the same thing in an eastern ( and less badly affected ) suburb : " Their houses are destroyed , they have no running water , food prices have doubled , and they have n't seen a single government official or foreign aid worker since the earthquake struck . "
Overall , Doyle observed , " the international response has been quite pathetic .
Some of the aid agencies are working very hard , but there are two ways of reporting this kind of thing .
One is to hang around with the aid agencies and hang around with the American spokespeople at the airport , and you 'll hear all sorts of stories about what 's happening .
Another way is to drive almost at random with ordinary people and go and see what 's happening in ordinary places .
In virtually every area I 've driven to , ordinary people say that I was the first foreigner that they 'd met . " [ 14 ]
Only a full week after the earthquake did emergency food supplies even begin the slow journey from the heavily guarded airport to fourteen " secure distribution points " in various parts of the city . [ 15 ]
By that stage , tens of thousands of Port - au - Prince residents had finally come to the conclusion that no aid would be forthcoming , and began to abandon the capital for villages in the countryside .
On January 17 , Al - Jazeera 's correspondent summarised what many other journalists had been saying all week , " Most Haitians have seen little humanitarian aid so far .
What they have seen is guns , and lots of them .
Armoured personnel carriers cruise the streets " and " inside the well - guarded perimeter [ of the airport ] , the US has taken control .
It looks more like the Green Zone in Baghdad than a centre for aid distribution . " [ 16 ]
Late on the same day , the World Food Programme 's air logistics officer Jarry Emmanuel confirmed that most of the 200 flights going in and out of the airport each day were still being reserved for the US military : " their priorities are to secure the country .
Ours are to feed . " [ 17 ]
By January 18 , no matter how many US embassy or military spokespeople insisted that " we are here to help " rather than invade , governments as different as those of France and Venezuela had begun to accuse the US of effectively " occupying " the country . [ 18 ]
IV
The US decision to privilege military over humanitarian traffic at the airport sealed the fate of many thousands of people abandoned in the rubble of lower Port - au - Prince and Léogane .
In countries all over the world , search and rescue teams were ready to leave for Haiti within 12 hours of the disaster .
Only a few were able to arrive without fatal delays – mainly it was teams , like those from Venezuela , Iceland and China , who managed to land while Haitian staff still retained control of their airport .
Some subsequent arrivals , including a team from the UK , were prevented from landing with their heavy equipment .
Others , like Canada 's Heavy Urban Search Rescue Teams , were immediately readied but never sent – the teams were told to stand down , the Canadian Foreign Affairs Minister Lawrence Cannon eventually explained , because " the government had opted to send Canadian Armed Forces instead " . [ 19 ]
USAID announced on January 19 that international search and rescue teams , over the course of the first full week after the disaster , had managed to save a grand total of 70 people . [ 20 ]
The majority of these people were rescued in quite specific locations and circumstances .
" Search - and - rescue operations " , observed the Washington Post on January 18 , " have been intensely focused on buildings with international aid workers , such as the crushed U.N. headquarters , and on large hotels with international clientele . " [ 21 ]
Tim Schwartz spent much of the first post - quake week as a translator with rescue workers , and was struck by the fact that most of their work was confined to places – the UN 's hotel Christophe , the Montana Hotel , the Caribe supermarket – that were not only frequented by foreigners but that could be snugly enclosed within " secure perimeters " .
Elsewhere , he observed , UN " peacekeepers " did their best to make sure that rescue workers treated onlooking crowds as a source of potential danger rather than assistance . [ 22 ]
Until the residents of devastated places like Léogane and Carrefour are somehow able to reassure foreign troops that they will feel " secure " when visiting their neighbourhoods , UN and US commanders clearly prefer to let them die on their own .
Exactly the same logic has condemned yet more people to death in and around Port - au - Prince 's hospitals .
In one of the most illuminating reports yet filed from the city , on January 20 Democracy Now's Amy Goodman spoke with Dr Evan Lyon of Partners in Health / Zamni Lasante from the General Hospital , the most important medical centre in the whole country .
Lyon acknowledged there was a need for " crowd control , so that the patients are not kept from having access " , but insisted that " there 's no insecurity [... ] .
I do n’t know if you guys were out late last night , but you can hear a pin drop in this city .
It ’s a peaceful place .
There is no war .
There is no crisis except the suffering that ’s ongoing ...
The first thing that [ your ] listeners need to understand is that there is no insecurity here .
There has not been , and I expect there will not be . "
On the contrary , Lyon explained , " this question of security and the rumours of security and the racism behind the idea of security has been our major block to getting aid in .
The US military has promised us for several days to bring in machinery , but they ’ve been listening to this idea that things are insecure , and so we do n’t have supplies " .
As of January 20 , the hospital still had n't received the supplies and medicines needed to treat many hundreds of dying patients .
" In terms of aid relief the response has been incredibly slow .
There are teams of surgeons that have been sent to places that were , quote , “ more secure " , that have ten or twenty doctors and ten patients .
We have a thousand people on this campus who are triaged and ready for surgery , but we only have four working operating rooms , without anaesthesia and without pain medications . " [ 23 ]
Almost by definition , in post - quake Haiti it seems that anyone or anything that cannot be enclosed in a " secure perimeter " is n't worth saving .
In their occasional forays outside such perimeters , meanwhile , some Western journalists seemed able to find plenty of reasons for retreating behind them .
Lurid stories of looting and gangs soon began to lend " security experts " like the London - based Stuart Page [ 24 ] an aura of apparent authority , when he explained to the BBC 's gullible " security correspondent " Frank Gardner that " all the security gains made in Haiti in the last few years could now be reversed ...
The criminal gangs , totalling some 3,000 , are going to exploit the current humanitarian crisis , to the maximum degree . " [ 25 ]
Another seasoned BBC correspondent , Matt Frei , had a similar story to tell on January 18 , when he found a few scavengers sifting through the remains of a central shopping district : " Looting is now the only industry here .
Anything will do as a weapon .
Everything is now run by rival armed groups of thugs . "
If Haiti is to avoid anarchy , Frei concluded , " what may be needed is a full - scale military occupation " . [ 26 ]
Not even former US president ( and former Haiti occupier ) Bill Clinton was prepared to go that far .
" Actually " , Clinton told Frei , " when you think about people who have lost everything except what they 're carrying on their backs , who not only have n't eaten but probably have n't slept in four days , and when the sun goes down it 's totally dark and they spend all night long tripping over bodies living and dead , well , I think they 've behaved quite well ....
They are astonishing people .
How can they be so calm in the face of such enormous loss of life and loved ones , and all the physical damage ? " [ 27 ]
Reporters able to tell the difference between occasional and highly localised bursts of foraging and a full - scale " descent into anarchy " made much the same point all week , as did dozens of indignant Haitian correspondents .
On January 17 , for instance , Ciné Institute director David Belle tried to counter international misrepresentation .
" I have been told that much US media coverage paints Haiti as a tinderbox ready to explode .
I 'm told that lead stories in major media are of looting , violence and chaos .
There could be nothing further from the truth .
I have travelled the entire city daily since my arrival .
The extent of the damage is absolutely staggering [ but ...]
NOT ONCE have we witnessed a single act of aggression or violence ...
A crippled city of two million awaits help , medicine , food and water .
Most have n't received any .
Haiti can be proud of its survivors .
Their dignity and decency in the face of this tragedy is itself staggering . " [ 28 ]
As anyone can see , however , dignity and decency are no substitute for security .
No amount of weapons will ever suffice to reassure those " fortunate few " whose fortunes isolate them from the people they exploit .
As far as the people themselves are concerned , " security is not the issue " , explains Haiti Liberté's Kim Ives .
" We see throughout Haiti the population themselves organizing themselves into popular committees to clean up , to pull out the bodies from the rubble , to build refugee camps , to set up their security for the refugee camps .
This is a population which is self - sufficient , and it has been self - sufficient for many years . " [ 29 ]
But while the people who have lost what little they had have done their best to cope and regroup , the soldiers sent to " restore order " treat them as potential combatants .
" It ’s just the same way they reacted after [ Hurricane ] Katrina " in New Orleans , concludes Ives .
" The victims are what ’s scary .
They ’re black people who , you know , had the only successful slave revolution in history .
What could be more threatening ? "
" According to everyone I spoke with in the centre of the city " , wrote Schwarz on January 21 , " the violence and gang stuff is pure BS " .
The relentless obsession with security , agrees Andy Kershaw , is clear proof of the fact that most foreign soldiers and NGO workers " have n't a clue about the country and its people " . [ 30 ]
V
True to form , within hours of the earthquake most of the panicked staff in the US embassy had already been evacuated , and at least one prominent foreign contractor in the garment sector ( the Canadian firm Gildan Activewear ) announced that it would be shifting production to alternative sewing facilities in neighbouring countries . [ 31 ]
The price to be paid for such priorities will not be evenly distributed .
Up in the higher , wealthier and mostly undamaged parts of Pétionville everyone already knows that it's the local residents " who through their government connections , trading companies and interconnected family businesses " will once again pocket the lion 's share of international aid and reconstruction money . [ 32 ]
In order to help keep less well - connected families where they belong , meanwhile , the US Department of Homeland Security has taken " unprecedented " emergency measures to secure the homeland this past week .
Operation " Vigilant Sentry " will make efficient use of the large naval flotilla the US has assembled around Port - au - Prince .
" As well as providing emergency supplies and medical aid " , notes The Daily Telegraph , " the USS Carl Vinson , along with a ring of other navy and coast guard vessels , is acting as a deterrent to Haitians who might be driven to make the 681 - mile sea crossing to Miami " .
While Senegal 's president Abdoulaye Wade offered " voluntary repatriation to any Haitian that wants to return to [ the land of ] their origin " , US officials confirmed that they would continue to apply their long - standing ( and thoroughly illegal ) policy with respect to all Haitian refugees and asylum seekers – to intercept and repatriate them automatically , regardless of the circumstances . [ 33 ]
Ever since the quake struck , the US Air Force has taken the additional precaution of flying a radio - transmitting cargo plane for five hours a day over large parts of the country , so as to broadcast a recorded message from Haiti 's ambassador in Washington .
" Do n’t rush on boats to leave the country " , the message says .
" If you think you will reach the U.S. and all the doors will be wide open to you , that ’s not at all the case .
They will intercept you right on the water and send you back home where you came from . "
Not even life - threatening injuries are enough to entitle Haitians to a different sort of US reception .
When the dean of medicine at the University of Miami arrived to help set up a field hospital by the airport in Port - au - Prince , he was outraged to find that most seriously injured people in the city were being denied the visas they would need to be transferred to Florida for surgery and treatment .
As of January 19 the US State Department had authorised a total of 23 exceptions to its golden rule of immigration .
" It ’s beyond insane " , O'Neill complained .
" It ’s bureaucracy at its worst . " [ 34 ]
VI
This is the fourth time the US has invaded Haiti since 1915 .
Although each invasion has taken a different form and responded to a different pretext , all four have been expressly designed to restore " stability " and " security ' " to the island .
Earthquake - prone Haiti must now be the most thoroughly stabilised country in the world .
Thousands more foreign security personnel are already on their way , to guard the teams of foreign reconstruction and privatisation consultants who in the coming months are likely to usurp what remains of Haitian sovereignty .
Perhaps some of these guards and consultants will help their elite clients achieve another long - cherished dream : the restoration of Haiti 's own little army .
And perhaps then , for a short while at least , the inexhaustible source of " instability " in Haiti – the ever - nagging threat of popular political participation and empowerment – may be securely buried in the rubble of its history .

Gardner then explained that , with the police weakened by the quake , " thousands of escaped criminals have returned to areas they once terrorised , like the slum district of Cité Soleil [... ] .
Unless the armed criminals are re-arrested , Haiti 's security problems risk being every bit as bad as they were in 2004 " ( BBC Radio 4 , Six O'clock News , January 18 , 2010 ) .
In fact , when some of these ex-prisoners tried to re-establish themselves in Cité Soleil in the week after the quake , local residents promptly chased them out of the district on their own ( see Ed Pilkington and Tom Phillips , " Haiti escaped prisoners chased out of notorious slum " , The Guardian , January 20 , 2010 ; Tom Leonard , " Scenes of devastation outside Port - au - Prince `even worse ' " , Daily Telegraph , January 21 , 2010 ) .

Ives illustrates the way such community organisations work with an example from the Delmas 33 neighbourhood where he 's staying : " A truckload of food came in in the middle of the night unannounced .
It could have been a melee .
The local popular organization was contacted .
They immediately mobilized their members ....
They lined up about 600 people who were staying on the soccer field behind the [ Matthew 25 ] house , which is also a hospital , and they distributed the food in an orderly , equitable fashion .
They were totally sufficient .
They did n’t need Marines .
They did n’t need the UN ...
These are things that people can do for themselves and are doing for themselves . "
Kershaw makes the same point : " This self - imposed blockade by bureaucracy is a scandal but could be easily overcome .
The NGOs and the military should recognise the hysteria over `security ' for what it is and make use of Haiti 's best resource and its most efficient distribution network : the Haitians themselves .
Stop treating them as children .
Or worse .
Hand over to them immediately what they need at the airport .
They will find the means to collect it .
Fill up their trucks and cars with free fuel .
Any further restriction on , and control of , the supply of aid is not only patronising but it is in that control and restriction where any `security issues ' will really lurk .
And it is the Haitians who best know where the aid is needed " ( Andy Kershaw , " Stop treating these people like savages " , The Independent , January 21 , 2010 ) .

Liberalism and Social Control : The New Class ’ Will to Power
Though most likely unintended by the writer , this is an excellent description of the evolution of Multi-Culturalism .
The entire “ progressive ” agenda in the twentieth century was oriented , not toward ending the framework of state policy that supported corporate rule , but increasing state intervention to make corporate rule more bearable .
LIBERALISM AND SOCIAL CONTROL :
THE NEW CLASS ’ WILL TO POWER Kevin A. Carson Twentieth century liberalism , as an ideology of social control , goes back to the Progressive movement in this counry and Fabianism in Britain .
Its primary base of support was the New Class of social engineers , planners , technocrats and “ helping professionals ” who saw themselves as divinely appointed to manage the lower orders for their own good .
Although the term “ New Class ” was coined by Milovan Djilas to describe the bureaucratic collectivism of communist society , it is well suited for the ruling class under welfare state liberalism .
Orwell ’s description of this class is as good as any .
The new aristocracy was made up for the most part of bureaucrats , scientists , technicians , trade - union organizers , publicity experts , sociologists , teachers , journalists , and professional politicians .
These people , whose origins lay in the salaried middle class and the upper grades of the working class , had been shaped and brought together by the barren world of monopoly industry and centralized government .
Walter Lippmann described the phenomenon from a much friendlier perspective in Public Opinion : The Great Society had grown furiously and to colossal dimensions by the application of technical knowledge .
It was made by engineers who had learned to use exact measurements and quantitative analysis .
It could not be governed , men began to discover , by men who thought deductively about rights and wrongs .
It could be brought under human control only by the technic which had created it .
Gradually , then , the more enlightened directing minds have called in experts who were trained , or had trained themselves , to make parts of this Great Society intelligible to those who manage it .
These men are known by all kinds of names , as statisticians , accountants , auditors , industrial counsellors , engineers of many species , scientific managers , personnel administrators , research men , “ scientists , ” and sometimes just as plain private secretaries [ pp. 233-234 ] .
The central theme of this new class ideology , as Joel Spring put it [ Education and the Rise of the Corporate State p. xiii ] , was that “ the good society meant the efficiently organized society that was producing the maximum amount of goods ” — and the most efficient social institutions for this purpose were “ [ l ] arge organizational units and centralized government . ”
The ordinary person was “ viewed as a raw material whose worth was determined by his contribution to the system . ”
Christopher Lasch , a left - wing populist who sounded at times suspiciously like a social conservative , defined the New Class ideology in terms of the ethos of “ professionalism . ”
The Jeffersonian ideal of the independent yeoman farmer or tradesman — a well - rounded citizen capable of competently handling all issues that affected his daily life — was , in the view of the Progressives , obsolete .
Instead , every aspect of life was to be “ professionalized , ” handed over to a class of “ experts ” protected from interference by the lower orders [ Revolt of the Elites ; The Culture of Narcissism ; The True and Only Heaven ] .
This was unabashedly argued in The Promise of American Life by Herbert Croly , who sought to obtain “ Jeffersonian ends with Hamiltonian means . ”
In this progressive manifesto , he praised “ experts ” and “ intellectuals ” in almost messianic terms .
Barton Bledstein admirably described this fetish [ The Culture of Professionalism : The Middle Class and the Development of Higher Education in America , in Boyte ] :
The citizen became a client whose obligation was to trust the professional .
Legitimate authority now resided in special places like the courtroom , the classroom , and the hospital ; and it resided in special words shared only by experts .
John McKnight , in a speech to the 1976 retreat of the Brainerd , Minn .
Community Planning Organization [ “ Are the Helping Systems Doing More Harm Than Good ? ” in Boyte pp. 173-174 ] , described the ways the “ helping professions ” infantilize ordinary citizens .
When the capacity to define the problem becomes a professional prerogative , citizens no longer exist .
The prerogative removes the citizen as problem definer , much less problem solver .
It translates political functions into technical and technological problems .
It is important to remember that the New Class ’ dream of professional control of the population did not arise in a vacuum .
Liberal social engineering was not the only alternative to exploitation by robber barons .
The working class in the nineteenth century had its own culture and institutions , and was attempting to build a society in which workers themselves controlled all the things that affected their daily lives .
Working class children in England sometimes attended “ penny a week schools ” taught by an aged or crippled worker ; the artisan class contained a large proportion of self - educated people , some of them remarkably well - read in the political controversies of the time ( many radical leaders were master tradesmen who found time to educate themselves during breaks in their work ) ; friendly societies often subscribed in common to the radical press and met to read and debate [ E. P. Thompson , Chapter Sixteen , “ Class Consciousness , ” in The Making of the English Working Class ] .
Genuine working class unions , built from the bottom up and controlled by workers themselves , aimed at direct workers ’ control of the production process .
Workers ’ organizations for self - help and mutual aid included collections for charity , and “ friendly societies ” organized on a subscription basis to insure members against funerals and sickness [ They are described in the later chapters of Kropotkin ’s Mutual Aid and in E. P. Thompson ’s chapter on “ Community ” ] .
So every function of the “ progressive ” welfare state so beloved of Arthur Schlesinger Jr. was already being attempted by the workers themselves — but organized from the bottom up , instead of handed down from on high by paternalistic liberals .
The main shortcomings of working class self - organization were those imposed from outside — i.e. , lack of resources , and active suppression by the state .
Had the working class been free to organize without interference by the state — and more importantly , had they had the full product of their labor to dispose of — their provisions for their own health , education and welfare would have been far superior to anything doled out by the state .
But goo - goos like Schlesinger ignore the fact that the welfare state was created precisely in order to prevent the working class from organizing to keep the product of their own labor and control their work .
The entire “ progressive ” agenda in the twentieth century was oriented , not toward ending the framework of state policy that supported corporate rule , but increasing state intervention to make corporate rule more bearable .
The New class saw such self - organization as an atavism , to be eliminated with all the other imperfections of the past when society was reorganized under the benevolent rule of “ professionals . ”
Working class institutions were either supplanted or destroyed : working class free schools were rendered “ obsolete ” by state schools , and in the process the New Class ideology achieved hegemony over the minds of children ; organs of self - help were encouraged to wither away by the “ helping professions ” ; syndicalist unions controlled by the rank and file , and the vibrant labor press , were liquidated by good “ liberals ” during Wilson ’s Red Scare .
One of the best pictures of the ideal world envisioned by the New Class was drawn by Hilaire Belloc in The Servile State .
Belloc believed Fabian collectivism to be less dedicated to state or workers ’ ownership as such than to the idea of control by “ efficient ” centralized organizations .
It would be politically impossible to carry out expropriation of the large capitalists .
Therefore , attempts to regulate industry to make labor more bearable , and to create a minimal welfare state , would lead instead to a system in which employers would be compelled to provide a minimum level of comfort and economic security for their employees in return for guaranteed profits .
The working class would be reduced to a state of near - serfdom , with legally - defined status replacing the right of free contract , and the state fitting the individual into a lifetime niche in the industrial machine .
Such a society would appeal to the authoritarian kind of socialist , whose chief values were efficiency and control .
Let laws exist which make the proper housing , feeding , clothing , and recreation of the proletarian mass be incumbent upon the possessing class , and the observance of such rules be imposed , by inspection and punishment , upon those whom he pretends to benefit , and all that he really cares for will be achieved [ Ibid. pp. 146-147 ] .
Belloc was horrified by bloodless Fabians like H. G. Wells and the Webbs , who dabbled in social engineering in addition to their many other hobbies .
The Fabian movement preferred working within existing institutions to make capitalism more stable and humane .
Since it coincided with the rise of “ Progressive ” industrialists — who envisioned cooperation between business , government and labor in the interest of efficiency — the two phenomena reinforced each other to promote class rule by men in suits who sat behind desks .
In place of the classical socialist movement of the nineteenth century , aiming at workers ’ control of production and largely made up of real workers , the Fabians and Progressives substituted management of workers by their betters .
As Belloc pointed out , if only their lust to manage and regiment the underclass were satisfied , the Fabians would be quite accomodating about capitalist ownership .
Wells favored a minimum safety net of aid to the children of the destitute , in return for responsibility of parents to the state , on pain of rehabilitation in “ celibate labor establishments . ”
Minimum wages and housing standards would be designed , not to guarantee subsistence to poor families , but to end the availability of cheap housing and low - paying jobs on which the destitute subsisted .
The goal was to cease perpetuating “ the educationally and technically unadaptable elements in the population ” and to breed “ a more efficient race by increased state supervision , ” in Wells ’ words to “ convince these people that to bear children into such an unfavorable atmosphere is an extremely inconvenient and undesirable thing . ”
The Webbs wanted relief conditioned on “ treatment and disciplinary supervision , ” with local government councils imposing compulsory vaccination and determining who was “ mentally defective or an excessive drinker ” ( these things became a reality in the Swedish “ social democracy ” ) .
Those too unemployable even for the “ compulsory labor exchanges ” would be required to attend training camps , with “ their whole time mapped out in a continuous and properly varied program of physical and mental work , all of it being made of the utmost educational value . ”
Those refusing to cooperate would be sent to “ Reformatory Detention Colonies ” [ Wells , Mankind in the Making ; the Webbs , The Prevention of Destitution ; John P. McCarthy , Hilaire Belloc , Edwardian Radical ] .
This “ liberalism ” reached maturity during World War I , when a group of statist intellectuals grouped around the British War Office , the Wilson administration , and The New Republic , invented the modern science of propaganda as a tool to engineer public support for the war .
Some members of this circle , like Walter Lippmann and Harold Lasswell , went on to develop theories of “ spectator democracy , ” in which the masses choose among elite candidates every four years , and sit down and shut up the rest of the time .
It is instructive to compare the composition of the socialist movement before and after Wilson .
Before the Great War , Socialist Party congressmen , mayors , etc. , were elected by Montana miners , Milwaukee brewers , and Oklahoma oil workers .
After the Wilsonian terror , the rare “ socialist ” politician comes from a yuppie hog heaven like Burlington , Vt. , and the main demographic base for socialism is academia .
Human services departments today are a favorite habitat of authoritarian statists .
The welfare state , portrayed by conservatives as an instrument of class warfare , is really an instrument of class rule .
It regulates the underclass so as to prevent class warfare from threatening the neat , comfortable , antiseptic world of the New Class .
The Progressive Jacob Riis , in How the Other Half Lives , warned spell - bound middle class readers of the “ Man with the Knife , ” the anarchist raising “ the danger - cry … the shout that never should have been raised on American soil … the solution of violence [ in Spring p. 5 ] . ”
Despite the illusions of aging New Deal Democrats who live in an Arthur Schlesinger time warp , this is the real origin of the welfare state .
Piven and Cloward argue that the two major expansions of the welfare state , under FDR and LBJ , were both spurred by drastic increases in social disorder , with the unemployed and homeless participating in violent demonstrations and being drawn to radical movements [ Regulating the Poor ] .
The welfare bureaucracy serves three functions : it takes the edge off of potential underclass radicalism by minimizing outright homelessness and starvation ; it subjects its clients to close supervision by a network of case - workers who make sure they do n’t get up to any subversive mischief ; and it enforces labor discipline by making the system as unpleasant as possible and scaring away all but the hard - core unemployable .
The most egregious example of the New Class sense of divine right can be seen among the ideologues of the “ public ” education establishment .
Joel Spring draws a close parallel between early Progressivism in society at large and public educationism as a microcosm of that ideology , with the schools being “ a central institution for the production of men and women who conformed to the needs and expectations of a corporate and technocratic world ” [ op . cit. p. 1 ] .
The state school systems were organized about the time that large factories began to need a docile , obedient work force that was trained to line up on command and eat and piss at the sound of a bell .
In the words of Edgar Z. Friedenberg , Whatever the needs of young people might have been , no public school system developed in response to them until an industrial society arose to demand the creation of holding pens from which a steady and carefully monitored supply of people trained to be punctual , literate , orderly and compliant and graded according to qualities determining employability from the employers ’ point of view could be released into the economy as needed [ The Disposal of Liberty and Other Industrial Wastes p. 16 ] .
Public educationists have never been bashful about their self - appointed mission : to take pieces of human “ raw material ” from their families and transform them into useful servants of the State .
James Mill , for example , saw the task of the schools as being “ to train the minds of the people to a virtuous attachment to their government . ”
The writings of leading figures in departments of education , teachers ’ colleges , the NEA and the AFT , were full to overflowing with statements to this effect .
William Bagley ’s Classroom Management was the standard teacher ’s manual for two decades , reprinted thirty times between 1907 and 1927 .
It recommended machine - like organization as the “ educative force ” for “ slowly transforming the child from a little savage into a creature of law and order , fit for the life of civilized society . ”
A teacher ’s efficiency could be judged by “ the manner in which lines pass to and from the room . ”
He recommended the establishment of “ regular habits … with regard to the bodily functions , ” and conditioning to assume a posture of “ head erect , eyes turned toward the teacher , hands … folded ” upon hearing the command “ Attention ! ” [ Spring pp. 46 - 47 ] .
The sociologist Edward Ross , in his 1890s Social Control , treated school - sponsored extracurricular activity as “ an economical system of police ” [ Spring p. 75 ] .
The educrats ’ mania for social engineering dovetails nicely with the corporate state ’s need for easily controlled drones .
From the very beginning of the factory system , the more “ benevolent ” owners tried to exercise paternalistic control over the social lives and morals of their employees , with experiments in “ company planned self - improvement programs or moral and ethical instruction ” to weed out those prone to “ immoral conduct , bad language , disrespect , or… an improper attitude . ”
The goal was to create healthy , well - adjusted workers and prevent the emergence of a “ depraved and shiftless ” proletariat on the European model .
“ The combination of work , self - improvement through education , and moral scrutiny created a wedding between the church , the school , and the factory ” [ Spring pp. 22-23 ] .
This tendency was rapidly augmented by an arsenal of pseudo - science ; personality and aptitude testing evolved into a new industry under school guidance counselors and “ human resources ” departments .
The most ominous development of human engineering is the “ school to work ” movement .
Currently , all fifty states receive federal grants under the terms of the School to Work Opportunities Act of 1994 .
When fully implemented , the program calls for “ comprehensive career guidance ” for every student by seventh grade at the latest .
He is to adopt a “ career major ” within an occupational area , with available choices to be prescribed by a local planning board based on projected “ need . ”
Students at graduation receive “ certificates of mastery , ” based on national standards being developed by the National Skill Standards Board .
If the program develops as envisioned , it will evolve into a system of certification for all occupations , with the federal government using tax and regulatory powers to “ encourage ” businesses to hire only those with certificates of mastery [ Gary Wolfram , “ School to Work ] .
Most of the Progressive - era “ good government ” reforms were aimed at “ professionalizing ” government and removing it from “ politics ” — that is , placing the rule of “ experts ” safely beyond interference by the great unwashed .
In the words of FDR , “ The day of the Politician is past ; the day of the Enlightened Administrator has come . ”
The replacement of ward representation with at - large election resulted ( in Pittsburg ’s 1911 “ reform , ” for example ) in transformation of a council made up of two - thirds common workmen , tradesmen , clerks and shop - keepers , into one composed entirely of “ professionals ” and “ prominent businessmen ” [ Spring p. 86 ] .
The replacement of neighborhood control with city - wide school boards and superintendents was similarly designed to remove education from parental influence and give it over to the care of properly trained “ professionals . ”
The intergovernmental “ authority , ” pioneered in America by the New York Port Authority and Robert Moses ’ Long Island highway system , like many methods of authoritarian government , was resurrected from British law and adopted near - universally as a form of “ professional ” government beyond the control of the electorate .
The New Class ideology of “ progressivism ” appeared in the workplace in the form of “ scientific management . ”
The goal of Taylorism was to take the management of work as much as possible away from master craftsmen on the shop floor , and eliminate the initiative and independent judgment of the worker .
The blue collar worker was to be deskilled , and expertise shifted upward into the ranks of salaried white - collar engineers .
Management would determine the most efficient way of organizing production , and tasks would be transformed into rote repetition which engaged the mental faculties as little as possible .
Workers were to be taught in no uncertain terms that they were paid to do as they were told , not to think .
The bosses feared that , if workers controlled the production process , they might realize that the bosses were parasites and , in the words of the Wobbly slogan , “ fire the boss . ”
[ Stephen Marglin , William Lazonick , David Montgomery , David Noble and Katherine Stone have produced an excellent body of work on this trend ] .
Taylorism was accepted by the labor establishment in the devil ’s bargain of the New Deal .
The Wagner Act was supported by corporations engaged in high - tech , export - oriented production , because labor costs were a relatively insignificant part of their total costs , and they needed long - term stability and predictability in the workplace .
The Wagner Act ended the genuine revolution that was taking place on the shop floors of Detroit and the docks of San Francisco , coopted the CIO leadership as part of the corporate establishment , and turned unions into enforcers of labor discipline .
The position of the new labor bureaucrats was “ Let the bosses manage , as long as they pay us good . ”
The result was that a labor establishment dominated by mediocrities like George Meany was willing to purge itself , during the Cold War , of the same leftist radicals who had led workers to victory in the mid-30s .
William F. Buckley said somewhere that he ’d rather be governed by people randomly chosen from the Cambridge , Mass .
phone book than by fifty Harvard professors .
True enough ; but the same holds true in the workplace .
I ’ll take a decision made by workers on the shop floor over one made by a boss any day .
Conservatives who complain of “ left- liberals ” and otherwise treat liberalism / progressivism as synonymous with leftism are sadly mistaken .
There is nothing left - wing about liberalism .
As Chomsky wrote somewhere about the press , they may be “ liberal ” in the sense that they favor gun control and “ a woman ’s right to choose , ” and listen to NPR a lot ; but they are far from “ left wing ” in the sense of a genuine criticism of the institutional power structure in this society .
In fact , liberalism closely parallels Leninism as a pseudo - leftist ideology of social control by the New Class .
Leninism and liberalism between them wiped out the genuine ( i.e. , libertarian , populist ) left from a major part of the world .
Woodrow Wilson , A. Mitchell Palmer , and their liberal storm troopers tossed hundreds of Wobblies , socialists , anarchists , Nonpartisan Leaguers and other leftists into prison under the provisions of the Espionage act and state criminal syndicalism laws ; many thousands of anarchists and libertarian socialists , labelled “ saboteurs ” and collaborators with White forces , disappeared into Lenin ’s gulag .
Ever since then , the conventional “ left ” has been a movement largely of academics and pseudo - intellectual peckerheads .
Attempts at workers ’ control of production met similar resistance both in Lenin ’s Russia and in corporate America .
Although management of factories by workers ’ committees compared favorably to pre-revolutionary managers , Lenin and Trotskky placed them under increasing restrictions by the people ’s commissariats , finally replacing them with state - appointed managers .
In an April 1918 Izvestiya article , Lenin praised Taylor ’s “ scientific management ” methods and argued that , in the name of the proletarian revolution , workers should unquestioningly submit to one - man management of production [ Maurice Brinton , Workers ’ Control in the Bolshevik Revolution ] .
American corporate experiments with worker self - management were abandoned , even when they resulted in drastic productivity increases and reductions in absenteeism and injury .
The reason , in both countries , was that social control was more important than productivity .
If workers saw how much better they could organize production without the foreman , they might try to decide questions of what and why , instead of just how — and fire the board of directors or people ’s commissar .
New Class progressivism continued to flourish among welfare statists after WWII ; it heavily influenced both interest group pluralism and neo-conservatism , and the shadowy borderlands in - between .
Among others this includes Daniel Bell , Samuel P. Huntington , Zbigniew Brzezinski , and Francis Fukuyama .
The most notable modern descendant of the “ progressive ” social engineer , by the way , is Hillary Clinton .
Her ideal government is a giant matriarch , like Godzilla in an apron , who constantly chants “ Momma do n’t allow , Momma do n’t allow ” — all to protect us from ourselves , of course .
Or as Joseph Stromberg wrote , “ the body of Leviathan and the head of a social worker . ”
Those who view Hillary as a radical leftist are delusional .
A woman who made a 10,000 % profit in cattle futures and served as a director of Wal - Mart , is hardly a threat to the power of the ruling class .
She and her ilk just want to protect upper middle class soccer moms with SUVs and cell phones from any underclass disruption of their white bread suburban world .
The New Class ’ sense of privilege is evidenced by its zealous defense of the publik skools ’ monopoly status ( while they send their own kids to Sidwell Friends ) ; and their relentless struggle against their serfs ’ right to bear arms ( without touching their right to hire armed guards for themselves ) .
And then there ’s the National Health official from Quebec who sneaked across the border under an assumed name to get decent medical care .
There has been a whole host of commentators who have put the New Class at the center of their analysis .
Those who draw the most critical notice are those on the Right like Peggy Noonan , who focus on what I call the “ soft ” New Class .
This category includes mainly academics , teachers , and “ helping professionals . ”
But they tend to ignore the other side of the phenomenon , in the private sector — the “ hard ” New Class of managers and engineers .
The paternalistic welfare state and arrogant “ public ” school establishment cannot be separated , in their origins , from the rise of scientific management and the cult of “ professionalism ” in the workplace .
Both reflect an attempt to alienate the ordinary person from his own common sense , and rob him of the ability to control the things that affect his daily life .
The solution to New Class rule is not the spurious populism of the neocons and New Right .
The dittoheads appeal to the “ aw , shucks ” sensibility of Norman Rockwell ’s America , and play on the producing classes ’ resentment of bureaucrats and welfare deadbeats ; but their real interest is getting government off the backs of bankers , plutocrats , and CEOs .
They carefully conceal the fact that the greatest criminals are in the corporate boardrooms and the national security state , and the biggest parasites and deadbeats are the heavily subsidized , privileged corporations .
The real solution is to revive the kinds of working class self - organization and direct action which the New Class so despises : LETS , mutual banks , cooperatives , militant syndicalist unions , squatting , rent strikes and tenant unions , community - supported agriculture , etc .
We need to appeal to an American populism not limited by traditional left - right fetishes or sectarianism .
We need to fight the New Class in all its manifestations ; while we ’re organizing to “ fire the boss , ” we should also be fighting to “ fire the school board ” and “ fire the department of human services . ”
Those of us on the left who believe in things like workers ’ control , community technolgy , and neighborhood government , need to find common ground with those on the right who are into gun rights , home schooling , and free juries .
Anyone who believes that ordinary people should control their own lives and work , and that producers should keep the fruit of their labor , is an objective ally .

WASHINGTON — Escalating his opposition to what remains of the health care legislation , former Gov. Howard Dean has taken more swipes at President Obama , after a contentious back - and - forth that led to Press Secretary Robert Gibbs publicly sniping at him on Wednesday .
Dean , who outspokenly championed the public option and also supported the Medicare buy - in , said Thursday on MSNBC ’s Morning Joe that he wo n’t “ vigorously ” support Obama ’s re-election in 2012 .

“ I ’m going to support President Obama when he runs for re-election , ” Dean , also a former DNC Chair , said .
“ Not vigorously .
I ’m going to vote for him . ”
Although Dean has n’t withdrawn his support for Obama , he is a leading voice in the progressive community , and his dialed - down support of the Obama presidency as a result of this health care bill is likely to represent and ultimately fuel the sentiments among the president ’s core constituency .
The show ’s host , Joe Scarborough , pointed to this possibility .
“ ‘ Not vigorously ! , ” said Scarborough .
“ Boy , I can almost feel the confetti falling on my head here , ” probably referring to the delight among Republicans .
Dean also penned an op-ed in the Washington Post on Thursday slamming the bill , declaring that “ Any measure that expands private insurers ’ monopoly over health care and transfers millions of taxpayer dollars to private corporations is not real health - care reform . ”
He ended by saying , “ I reluctantly conclude that , as it stands , this bill would do more harm than good to the future of America . ”
ADVERTISEMENT
In an attempt to stave off criticism from progressives , Obama ’s senior adviser David Axelrod said Thursday that Dean ’s criticisms are “ predicated on a bunch of erroneous conclusions , ” adding that it would be “ insane ” to try and defeat this bill .
And Dean ’s push - back did n’t stop there .
His organizing group run by his brother , Jim Dean , sent out a furious email to members slamming Democratic leaders for gutting the public option and for pushing an individual mandate on consumers .
It read :
Senate leaders are all over Washington claiming they finally have a healthcare reform bill they can pass , as long as they remove the public option .
After all , they say that even without a public option , the bill still “ covers ” 30 million more Americans .
What they are actually talking about is something called the “ individual mandate . ”
That ’s a section of the law that requires every single American buy health insurance or break the law and face penalties and fines .
So , the bill does n’t actually “ cover ” 30 million more Americans — instead it makes them criminals if they do n’t buy insurance from the same companies that got us into this mess .
ADVERTISEMENT
Progressives are deeply divided over whether this legislation is still worth supporting at all .
While the blow - back is clear , a number of respected progressives continue to believe this bill remains worth passing as it will do more good than harm .
Obama has strongly championed the legislation , urging the public to get behind it .

“ Your premiums will go up , ” said the president , responding to those who oppose the bill .
“ Employers will load up costs to you , and they potentially will drop your coverage , and the federal government will go bankrupt , because Medicare and Medicaid are on a trajectory that are unsustainable . ”

The IDF prevented a delegation of religious - Zionist rabbis and social activists from entering the West Bank village of Yasuf Sunday , where a mosque was torched on Friday .
Suspect Settlers suspected of torching Palestinian mosque Ali Waked Arsonists spray walls with words ' we will burn you all ' and ' price tag ' – settler slogan for reprisal acts against settlement evacuation efforts .
IDF says mosque door and rug damaged , while Palestinians claim entire library including books of Koran destroyed Settlers suspected of torching Palestinian mosque
The rabbis waited at a central West Bank junction while soldiers blocked them from proceeding into the village .
After a few hours the IDF released a statement saying the visit had been properly coordinated and that the rabbis would be allowed in within hours , but by then it was two late and the parties left the area .
Earlier the army had stated that the delegation was denied entrance by the IDF chief of staff 's office due to security concerns .
Rabbi of Tekoa Menachem Froman said the halacha prohibits doing harm to religious sites .
" This deed was a serious religious crime , " he said , adding that mutual respect between Jews and Muslims could bring peace .
" If we keep hiding our heads in the sand and denying that the conflict ( with the Palestinians ) is religious , we will never get anywhere , " Froman said .

He also condemned similar acts on the Palestinian side , such as the torching of Gush Katif synagogues and the desecration of Joseph 's Tomb in Nablus .
" They also do worse things such as murder Jews , " he said .
" I 'm not saying they are pacifists but enmity exists on both sides , " the rabbi added .
Governor of the Salfit region , Munir Abbushi , met with the rabbis at the junction and told them , " The torching of the mosque was a racist act .
We are in favor of true peace , and I thank you for coming to identify with us on the torching I hope we can live in this country as two states . "
Abbushi also criticized the IDF for failing to prevent the act .
" There are people in the village calling for
revenge , but they are the minority , " he said .
" We are a national movement and not a religious one , and all we want is a Palestinian state . "
The meeting ended with a joint song and dance by Palestinian and Jewish religious officials .
Rabbi Yehuda Gilad , who heads the yeshiva on the religious kibbutz Maale Gilboa , said , " We came to expel darkness , especially during the days of Hannukah .
Light is not added by hurting our brothers , the Muslims , who are the servants of God just as we are .
This is an important message to relay . "
Americans who decided to take out a second mortgage on their home who are now underwater are in big trouble .
In fact , they may finding their bank accounts empty and their paychecks dwindling in the near future :
Housing Doom : Josh Zinner of the Neighborhood Economic Development Advocacy Project in Manhattan said some lenders or trusts for banks that went out of business are selling off second mortgages today to debt collectors for pennies on the dollars .
Those debt collectors are then going after the homeowners ’ bank accounts or pay checks to recoup whatever money they can .
And if a bank or debt collection agency goes after you , for god 's sake , respond to the complaint in a timely manner :
Perhaps in part because they are not notified , people sued in New York City often fail to appear in court to protect their interests , according to a study released last year by MFY Legal Services , a nonprofit law firm in New York .
MFY found that just seven law firms filed nearly one - third of all the cases seeking to collect $ 25,000 or less in New York City ’s civil courts .
Fewer than 10 percent of the defendants in those cases appeared to defend themselves .
“ Then there are these high number of default judgments rates , ” said Carolyn E. Coffey , a staff lawyer at MFY and an author of the study .
She said she was mystified that problems with getting notice could go unaddressed .
Recreational striped bass regulations will be decided at the March VMRC meeting .
The regulations for the bay are pretty set .
The minimum size will rise from 18 to 20 inches .
Everything else will stay the same except for the spring trophy season .
That minimum will rise from 32 to 36 inches and there will be a special permit required ( free ) .
What we do have some options for is the coastal fishery .
Right now , it is at one fish per angler with a minimum of 28 inches long .
These are the options that are being looked at for the rest of this year and on into 2016 :
1. Maintain the current one fish possession limit with a 28 inch size limit ;
2. Establish a two fish possession limit with a 33 inch minimum size limit ;
3. Establish a two fish possession limit , with 1 fish allowed with a minimum size limit of 28 inches and a maximum size limit of 34 inches and 1 fish allowed with a 36 inch minimum size limit ; or ,
4. Establish a two fish possession limit , with 1 fish allowed with a minimum size limit of 28 inches and a maximum size limit of 36 inches , and 1 fish allowed with a 38 inch minimum size - limit .
If you have a preference , let the VMRC know before the March 24 meeting .
Now that we seem to have escaped from the permafrost , anglers are anxious to get back out on the water .
There are several local events this month to help get you started .
The GBFA will be holding their Fishing Flea Market on March 14 at the Hickory Ruritan Club .
The Poquoson Kiwanis Club will hold a Boating and Fishing Flea Market on March 21 at Poquoson High School .
The Hampton Boat Show will be at the Hampton Roads Convention Center March 27 - 29 .
On the water , it is still cold .
Bluefin tuna are being caught by boats running out of the Outer Banks .
A few boats have made the long run from Virginia Beach to get in on the action .
In addition to the bluefin tuna , yellowfin tuna are a possibility and blackfin tuna could be jigged up out of Hatteras but it is the bluefin that have everyone ’s attention .
The offshore waters off of Virginia are still rather quiet .
Tilefish are there for bottom bouncers who want to make the run .
Sea bass remains closed though they are plentiful on the offshore wrecks .
Tautog can be caught on the coastal wrecks with the Triangle Reef area being the center of that fishery .
Inside the bay , it is still too cold for much of a tautog bite or anything else .
Striped bass are moving towards their spawning grounds in spite the cold water temperatures .
The only reports on the speckled trout front are large numbers of dead trout in both the Elizabeth River and Rudee Inlet .
The PSWSFA ’s first monthly meeting of the year will be on March 17 .
Our speakers will be Mark Terwilliger and Wes Sprinkle , the owners of Reel Fast Tackle and the new owners of Grafton Fishing Supply and Seafood .
They will talk to us about what they are doing with the tackle shop and about their line of lures and how to get the best results when fishing with them .
They will have a selection of their lures and some custom rods available for purchase at the meeting : www.pswsfa.com/meetings.htm
The Flounder Bowl will be held on June 27 .
Again , it will be limited to 120 boats .
This event is made possible through tremendous business support .
Participants are encouraged to patronize these businesses that support recreational fishing .
Anglers and sponsors can register for this year ’s Flounder Bowl at www.flounderbowl.com .
March 9 , Capt. Rick Wineman fished the Get Anet out of Oregon Inlet .
The Wicked Tuna boats were fishing around them and they saw a few fish caught .
The Get Anet did not get a bite .
March 9 , Wes Blow tried for tautog and tilefish .
He caught ( and released ) big sea bass and a lot of dogfish .
March 1 , when I got to the boat , Hunter Southall was using a snow shovel .
The rest of the guys were beating on the deck with 5 gallon buckets , trying to break up the ice .
We left Rudee Inlet in the direction of the Triangle Wrecks .
It was too rough running in that direction so we turned south to an inshore wreck .
We got anchored up , in the sleet , and proceeded to catch nothing until the anchor broke free .
We re-anchored and did more of the same .
By the third time the anchor came loose , the seas were settling down .
Since we were not catching anything where we were , we headed to a wreck further offshore and re-found the rough seas .
It was too rough to try and anchor so we made a few drops while I tried to hold the boat over the wreck with the engines .
The guys did catch and release some nice sea bass but no tautog .
We gave up on that and were going to head further out to catch some tilefish but the rain picked up and the water - in - the - fuel alarm went off .
Enough was enough ; we pointed the boat down sea , drained the water from the filters and headed home .
Feb 22 , it thawed out enough to allow us to shovel out the remaining snow in the boat , break through the ice , and go fishing .
We ran out in thick fog , big swells and when we anchored on the wreck , the current was ripping .
We had to break out the heavy sinkers but even 20 ounces was not enough to hold bottom .
We did not catch a single tautog .
We did catch a few really nice sea bass that we had to let go .
Stan Simmerman caught a big striped bass on a jig…also released .
Feb 8 , it was too rough .
We went fishing anyway .
Tagged and released 6 tautog , getting DNA samples from each .
Then we decided that we had had enough and went in for lunch .
Feb 7 , Hunter Southall and myself went out for a short tog trip .
We only caught 7 tautog up to 19 inches long .
We collected DNA from each for VIMS .
Feb. 1 , Capt . Rick Wineman ran to the Triangle Wrecks where they caught 3 tautog to 23 inches long .
They ran through a lot of diving birds between the light tower and the Triangle Wrecks .
Feb. 1 , we ran out for tautog before the Super Bowl .
We caught 16 tog , up to 23 inches long , before running in early for the Super Bowl parties .
We also caught sea bass and a nice hake .
We got DNA samples from each tog and placed tags in those we did not keep .
I dropped my camera down ... only once , after I saw what was down there :
https://www.facebook.com/video.php?v...47337150059912
Jan 25 , Wes and I went over and did some boat work .
We also went and did some tog fishing close to the beach .
We ended up catching 19 togs up to 18.5 inches long .
Kept a couple , tagged and released the rest , got DNA samples from each .
When we dropped the camera down , we did not see much but the fish were biting .
www.facebook.com/video.php?v=864179683623580&l=243784847404677568 .
Jan 23 , we went out after tautog .
We had a slow bite , catching 5 tautog .
We kept 4 between 18 and 20 inches long , tagged and released the 5th .
We got DNA samples from each .
We also kept a nice hake and we had to release some really nice sea bass .
I did drop a camera down to see what was going on down there :
www.facebook.com/video.php?v=863490727025809&l=1449708948391212935
Jan 20 , Wes Blow fished for tautog on one of the ocean wrecks .
He said that the bite was great and they caught about 25 fish keeping their 2 - angler limit .
The fish they kept included 4 that weighed over 9 pounds with the largest weighing in at 16 pounds .
Jan 17 , we went out in rather blustery conditions for tautog .
We stayed close to the beach because it was just too rough to run anywhere else .
We managed to catch 15 tautog up to 23.25 inches long .
That fish was tagged and released after a DNA sample was taken .
We tagged and released all but 3 fish and got DNA samples from each for VIMS .
The carcasses of the kept fish were donated to VMRC .
We caught one fish that had been tagged previously .
Jan 16 , Jody Linthicum fished the Elizabeth River with Wally Veal .
They caught 15 speckled trout over 19 inches long .
Their catch included fish of 25 inches , 27.5 inches and Jody caught a huge gator , 32 inches long !
Hunter Southall was also on the river catching trout .
Hunter said that he caught a dozen or so specks including one over 25 inches long .
He also caught a nice puppy drum .
Hunter 's specks averaged in the 20 - 23 inch range .
Both Jody and Hunter caught their fish casting jigs and those fish are still there as they released their fish ... even that 32 - inch monster !

Biofuel production currently involves a complex mixture of hydrophilic and hydrophobic liquids , along with one or more catalysts .
Getting them all together and separating out the fuel can be a time - consuming challenge .
Researchers have now used carbon nanotubes and oxidized metals to create a solid that is both hydrophilic and hydrophobic and sits between oil and alcohol layers , mediating their interactions .
Making biofuel using current methods can be a bit tedious .
Recipes generally involve mixing some kind of bio-oil , often vegetable oil , with an alcohol , usually methanol , along with a catalyst such as lye .
Once these have all been combined , they react to form the desired biofuel , glycerine , and some excess soap , water , and alcohol .
All of these will , for the most part , separate into layers like with a vinaigrette dressing if allowed to sit for a long enough time .
The glycerine can be drained off easily enough , and most of the impurities will settle between the glycerine and biofuel , but the biofuel must be " washed " a few times to extract any errant soap particles and other impurities that are suspended in it , and boiled to remove the water .
All told , the process can take between a couple of days and a week , depending on how much you 're making .
There are machines that will carry out the mixing and washing , but the process can't be shortened much because of the impurities that are introduced due to the use of lye as a catalyst .
Researchers set out to solve this problem by finding a catalyst that would not introduce any impurities that would be difficult to remove .
They also wanted to find one that would that could stabilize an oil and water emulsion , which would help the reaction components form a stable mix , in the same way that egg yolks stabilize mayonnaise .
A stabilized emulsion would significantly increase the surface area where the two substances can react — typically , this function is performed by the solid catalysts .
Ideally , the newly engineered catalysts would also be reusable .
The researchers ' solution involved a combination of hydrophilic and hydrophobic materials that would both emulsify the oil / water mixture by sitting at the interface of the two substances , and facilitate their reaction to form biofuels .
To accomplish this , they grew hydrophobic carbon nanotubes on small pellets of hydrophilic oxidized metals that contained enough palladium catalyst to speed up the reaction .
They found this combination helped the aqueous and organic phases emulsify , and would remain at the boundary between the two substances ; the palladium facilitated the hydrogenation , hydrogenolysis , and decarbonylation reactions .
Hydrogenation was the dominant reaction at around 100�C , hydrogenolysis at 200�C , and decarbonylation at 250�C .
Each of these reactions is useful for the conversion of different combinations of alcohols and oils , and because of the increased surface area .
Thanks to the inclusion of palladium , these reactions happen at a much faster rate than when performed using lye .
Once the reactions had occurred , the authors found that all of the desired products had moved into the organic phase , or what was once just bio-oil , leaving any waste and water in the aqueous phase , where it was still bound by the catalytic nanoparticles .
To separate the catalyst and waste , they strained the liquid through a regular paper filter , which managed to catch most of the catalyst .
They then passed the organic liquid through a polytetrafluoroethylene filter to catch the nanoparticles that had gotten through the paper filter , leaving them with purified biofuel .
These solid nanohybrid particles seem to be a strong candidate for fuel production , given the greater amount of precision and control they provide fuel makers and the speedier reaction times they enable .
But they do still require a filtration process , an aspect of the experiment that was not extensively studied .
Since reducing production time and increasing purity would be beneficial to the future of biofuel , streamlining the waste - removal step in this process will be critical .
The paper also made no mention of whether their chosen nanoparticles were reusable after their initial reaction .
Still , the basic principles seem solid , provided that these aspects of the catalysts can be optimized .

Weaknesses of Procurement procedures followed by 24 Hours Pharmacies in France
As per the accepted worldwide standards , pharmaceuticals are used in the care , treatment , and prevention of illnesses .
They range from paracetamol used to relieve minor aches and pains , to prescription drugs for ongoing health conditions .
They also include specialized drugs for the treatment of cancers .
24 hours pharmacies ( renseignement téléphonique 24h geoallo ) in France purchase and use pharmaceuticals on a large scale .
It is estimated that over $ 200 million is spent in procuring different types of pharmaceutical products within a year .
Pharmaceutical companies also spend millions of dollars each year in researching and developing drugs .
We can , therefore , conclude that medicines and medical supplies consume are the major portions of the expenses incurred by 24 hours pharmacies in France .
Over the recent years , the rising of drugs and medical supplies cost has directly affected the total expenses of the pharmacies .
Thus , inventory systems implemented by these pharmacies should be developed in a cost - effective manner .
The stock systems that support sufficient products to each department are required .
Nonetheless , any cases of overstock may cause more financial problems and take time to be resolved .
On the other hand , drug shortages can unpleasantly affect drug dispensation , treatment , and may result in a medication error .
According to many of the 24 hours pharmacies in France , causes of drug shortages were described may be ; unexpected demand , natural disasters , reduction in production capacities among other reasons .
This means that having very fewer drugs used over a period of time and low stocks should be prevented .
The purchases of the pharmaceuticals are governed by government policies and public procurement standards .
The procurement policies aim to guarantee pharmacies achieve value for money , give suppliers fair access to government procurement opportunities and demonstrate transparency and accountability .
Compliance with the policies provides assurance the general public and the government that public money is spent appropriately .
The basis of this article is to discuss and examine pharmaceutical purchasing to see if these standards are met .
Pharmaceuticals products that are purchased by 24 hours pharmacies in France must be cautiously managed to prevent illegal access and use .
Most medicinal products are toxic if taken in excess and some are strongly associated with addiction and abuse .
Risks emanating from unauthorized access and use of pharmaceuticals are noteworthy and include :
Financial losses to the pharmacy through pilferage
Pharmacy staff working under the influence of addictive pharmaceuticals , which is a risk to patient care .
Immense effects on health and social due to illicit drug use and addiction .
Pharmaceuticals not being available for genuine medication and patient care .
Poor controls over pharmaceutical procurement procedures mean that there lacks assurance that ; purchases always represent value for money , are transparent , and demonstrate open and effective competition .
During a recent research done to ascertain the weaknesses of procurement procedures implemented by 24 hours pharmacies in France , the following was discovered .
Most purchasing procedures and practice in 24 hours pharmacies in France do not conform to government and Department of Health policies .
A substantial number of the pharmaceutical procurement activities looked into failed to meet government procurement standards .
As if this was not enough , the most common weakness displayed by most pharmacies was failing to adequately document purchasing decisions .
Pharmacies can also utilize the modern purchasing system to help purchasing officers comply with policies .
Some aspects of purchasing contract management used by a number of 24 hours pharmacies have been poor .
In addition , potential conflicts of interest linked to pharmaceutical purchasing are not managed well .
This signifies that there is a probability that purchasing decisions could be inappropriately influenced by individuals for personal gains .
Some pharmacies in France do not have reliable information to identify and manage conflicts of interest evolving from gifts and benefits provided by pharmaceutical companies to pharmacists .
There are policies established by the Department of Health that clarifies staff obligations for reporting acceptance of gifts from suppliers .
However , the Department is yet to finalize its revised policy on acceptance of travel sponsorships .
A few pharmacies did not have an official , documented process to evaluate and approve their officers ’ choice of pharmaceuticals .
In actual sense , some pharmacy has left the choice of medicine to be procured in the hands of their procuring officers .
The officers are at liberty to buy the type and quality of medicine that pleases them .
This is not in conformance to the government standards guiding procurement of pharmaceuticals .
Key controls and procedures have been implemented in pharmacies , particularly in patient care areas .
This has gone a long way in enhancing the administration of pharmaceuticals to patients .
However , some stock management and control deficiencies are yet to be addressed .
This presents an unacceptable risk of unauthorized access and use of pharmaceuticals .
The pharmacy processes for taking receipt of pharmaceutical deliveries from suppliers are not well controlled .
Most pharmacies do not have specific officers or pharmacists to be the over - all in charge of the delivery unit .
This can enhance the correctness of deliveries as may have been specifically noted in the purchase order .
In various pharmacies , there was no clear guidance for pharmacists and doctors ( Dentiste urgence ) on how to measure and account for liquid pharmaceuticals .
This is a risk that may set in motion both under and over reporting , and losses of stock .
Some of the processes used to destroy and dispose of expired or spoilt pharmaceuticals are not well controlled .
Disposing of most of these items has become so casual and this will definitely have a very bad effect on the environment .
Pharmacies should be encouraged to have sufficient and better procedures for waste disposal .
Supervision of patient care area should be in compliance with regulations and policies .
In most pharmacies , it is currently inconsistent and not comprehensive .
The current situation in most 24 hours pharmacies in France has given leeway to a limited guidance of material available to assist staff to conduct effective investigations .
Most of these discussed weaknesses can have easy and satisfying solutions that are readily available for adoption by any pharmacy management .
The solutions to these weaknesses could enhance the performance of pharmacies in procurement activities .
The man who “ made ” the conservative activist who posed as a pimp to undermine the community organizing group ACORN , confessed that he pays him — while at the same time arguing he has “ nothing to do with ” what he does .
James O’Keefe was arrested Monday after “ maliciously tampering ” with the phones at the Louisiana offices of Democratic Sen. Mary Landrieu ( D - LA ) .
After his interdiction by federal marshals , O’Keefe admitted to planning the operation .
ADVERTISEMENT
Conservative pundits have sought to distance themselves from O’Keefe after the arrest .
“ Let it be a lesson to aspiring young conservatives interested in investigative journalism : Know your limits , ” wrote conservative blogger Michelle Malkin Tuesday afternoon .
“ Know the law .
Do n’t get carried away .
And do n’t become what you are targeting . ”
In a statement , conservative heavyweight Andrew Breitbart — who helped O’Keefe become famous after posting videos of him posing as a pimp and chatting with ACORN employees and served as an editor for The Drudge Report and contributor to the Huffington Post — said he had “ no knowledge about or connection to ” any of the alleged plots .
“ We have no knowledge about or connection to any alleged acts and events involving James O’Keefe at Senator Mary Landrieu ’s office , ” Breitbart remarked .
“ We only just learned about the alleged incident this afternoon .
We have no information other than what has been reported publicly by the press .
Accordingly , we simply are not in a position to make any further comment . ”
And yet , on a radio interview the same day , Breitbart told conservative radio host Hugh Hewitt that O’Keefe was all but an employee .
ADVERTISEMENT
HH : Last question , in terms of his relationship with you not connected to this event , are you still , is he in your employ in any way ?
AB… What he does for the site exclusively is he tells his life rights , basically .
So when he puts a story out there , it ’s on the Breitbart sites , the Big sites , that he can tell people what transpired .
So… HH : Do you pay him for that ?
AB : Yes .
HH : And are you free to tell me how much you pay him ?
AB : I ’ll …perhaps at another date , but he ’s paid a fair salary .
HH : Is he …so he is an employee ?
AB : I ’m not sure that ’s technically the thing , but yes , he ’s paid for his life rights .
And he ’s , you know , he ’s still …we reserve the right to say yes or no to any of the stories that he puts up on our site as we do to any other contributor who comes to the site .
HH : Will it be a mischaracterization to say he was working for you when he went about this ?
AB : Well , I mean , no .
He was not involved in anything that was related to Big Government , or Breitbart.com .
At the time of his arrest , O’Keefe was writing for Breitbart ’s website , though there ’s no indication Breitbart had any involvement with the stunt .
In a follow - up posting on his website BigGovernment , Breitbart said he was n’t leaping to any conclusions — but noticeably omitted the fact he was paying O’Keefe .
ADVERTISEMENT
“ Let me state clearly for the record : wiretapping is wrong , ” he wrote .
“ But until I hear the full story from James O’Keefe , I will not speculate as to what he was doing in Louisiana . ”
The exchange with Hewitt was noted late Tuesday by MediaMatters .

O’Keefe and three associates allegedly posed as telephone company employees in a self - confessed effort to tamper with the senator ’s office phones .
6 Tips for Saving Money During the Holidays
During the holiday season , we spend a lot of time looking for ways to spend money .
We spend money on holiday gifts , family dinners , company galas and holiday décor .
We give to charities by donating toys , volunteering and fund - raising .
We tip to service providers who have worked so hard for us throughout the year .
Rarely do we think of ways to save money during this Season of Giving .
There are multiple ways to insert a little savings into your holiday plans :
Create a Holiday Budget – Take the time to create a holiday budget .
Estimate the costs of what you ’re going to spend on holiday gifts , parties , charities and decorations .
Make sure to create a little breathing room by adding a savings column to your budget .
Shop for Savings – Retailers are offering great deals this holiday season .
If you shop smart , you can get everything on your shopping list and have some money left over .
Instead of putting your extra savings back into your shopping activities , funnel it towards your savings .
Make sure to stick your list , avoid impulse buying and cut down on the little extras .
Pay with Cash or Debit – Whenever possible , make sure to pay with cash or debit card .
You might not see the savings right away , but you ’ll be saving yourself from future interest payment from credit card companies .
Give Back to Yourself First –
It ’s important to support charities during the holiday season , but make sure that you ’re also giving back to yourself .
Select a few charities that are important to you and donate your time , money and efforts to where it will do the most good .
The worst thing you can do is stretch yourself thin by giving too much .
Save Your Holiday Bonus –
If you ’re one of the lucky ones to get a holiday bonus this year , make sure to tuck it away into an emergency fund or savings account , rather than adding it to your shopping budget .
With the economy still on recovery , you want to make sure that you ’re prepared for anything that comes your way in the New Year .
Turn a Gift into College Savings –
If you have relatives that send cash or checks to your kids during the holidays , consider taking some of that money and putting away into a college savings fund .
Your kids will be getting plenty of gifts this year , and one more gift is n’t going to make or break your holiday .
As time goes on , those little deposits can turn into big savings once they ’re grown and ready to go to college .
Do n’t wait to till the New Year to start thinking of a savings resolution .
Make an effort now , during the holidays , to save for your future .
After all , peace of mind is the greatest holiday gift that you can give yourself and your family this year .

According to an analysis of federal payroll data by USA Today , the federal bureaucracy has flourished during the current recession .
Federal employees making salaries of $ 100,000 or more jumped from 14 % to 19 % of civil servants during the recession ’s first 18 months — and that ’s before overtime pay and bonuses are counted .
Federal workers are enjoying an extraordinary boom time — in pay and hiring — during a recession that has cost 7.3 million jobs in the private sector .
The highest - paid federal employees are doing best of all on salary increases .
Defense Department civilian employees earning $ 150,000 or more increased from 1,868 in December 2007 to 10,100 in June 2009 , the most recent figure available .
When the recession started , the Transportation Department had only one person earning a salary of $ 170,000 or more .
Eighteen months later , 1,690 employees had salaries above $ 170,000 .
The trend to six - figure salaries is occurring throughout the federal government , in agencies big and small , high - tech and low - tech .
The primary cause : substantial pay raises and new salary rules .
...
The growth in six - figure salaries has pushed the average federal worker ’s pay to $ 71,206 , compared with $ 40,331 in the private sector .
The report notes that the data analyzed do not include employees of the White House , Congress , the Postal Service , and the intelligence agencies or uniformed members of the armed forces .
Adding these employees to the analysis probably would not alter the general outlines of the study ’s conclusions .
This development would be remarkable at any time , but it seems even more remarkable when it coincides with a more - than - doubling of the unemployment rate , a 4 percent decline in real GDP , and the evaporation of trillions of dollars of private wealth in the markets for corporate shares , other financial securities , and real estate .
This development also highlights the division of interests at the heart of classical liberal class analysis : the division between those who gain their income from honest production and trade ( which Franz Oppenheimer called the “ economic means ” ) and those who gain their income by plundering the producers ( which he called the “ political means ” ) .
Plutocrats are no longer only the Daddy Warbucks types , wearing diamond stickpins and puffing on oversized cigars ( although Hank Paulson clearly illustrates that such types have not disappeared ) .
Now they are also the blank - faced bureaucrats , dozing over their desks in nondescript office buildings .
Even Franklin D. Roosevelt made a better showing in this regard , at least at the start of his presidency .
Having campaigned against Herbert Hoover ’s excessive enlargement of the bureaucracy and his large budget deficits , Roosevelt pushed through the Economy Act of 1933 .
This statute provided for substantial cuts in federal spending and veterans ’ benefits and gave the president authority to eliminate some federal agencies to achieve greater government economy .
Subsequent congressional and executive actions overturned most of the act ’s provisions , but at least in this regard , Roosevelt ’s heart was initially in the right place .
Unfortunately , we cannot say the same for Barack Obama ’s heart .
From his campaign , to the massive “ stimulus ” bill enacted in February , to the obscene hypertrophy of the federal bureaucrats ’ pay , perks , and power during the past two years , we see all too plainly that while those of us who use the economic means to gain our living are struggling , those who use the political means are enjoying tremendous success in their plunder of the productive class , and that this conjunction has been anything but accidental .
Members of the plundering class wanted it , and they have brought it about , owing to the threats of violence that serve as the basis for all of their actions under the state ’s banners .
Thus , the current recession cum financial debacle certainly has been a severe misfortune for you and me , but for the federal bureaucracy , it has been a godsend — complete , we might note , with a messiah to lead the way .

( NewsTarget ) Babies born prematurely are at increased risk for a host of health problems .
But now research by Israeli scientists has uncovered a non -drug way to help preemies gain weight and grow stronger quickly .
A new study by Dr. Dror Mandel and Dr. Ronit Lubetzky of the Tel Aviv Medical Center , which is affiliated with Tel Aviv University 's Sackler School of Medicine , found premature infants exposed to thirty minutes of Mozart 's music daily grew far more rapidly than premature babies not exposed to the classical music .
"
It 's not exactly clear how the music is affecting them , but it makes them calmer and less likely to be agitated , " Dr. Mandel said in a statement to the media .
" The repetitive melodies in Mozart 's music may be affecting the organizational centers of the brain 's cortex .
Unlike Beethoven , Bach or Bartok , Mozart 's music is composed with a melody that is highly repetitive .
This might be the musical explanation .
For the scientific one , more investigation is needed .
" By measuring the physiological effects of music by Mozart played to pre-term newborns for 30 minutes , Dr. Mandel and Dr. Lubetzky and colleagues documented that when the babies were exposed to the music , they expended less energy -- a process that can lead to faster weight gain and growth .
That 's important because the sooner preemies attain an acceptable body weight , the sooner they can go home .
The longer they have to stay in the hospital , the more they are exposed to possible infections .
What 's more , a healthy body weight is believed to strengthen their immune systems so the babies are more likely to avoid illness in the future .
The researchers pointed out that several other environmental effects , such as tactile stimulation ( whether the baby is held and stroked adequately ) and room lighting , are already known to affect the survival and benefit the health of fragile premature infants .
The new study , however , is the first to directly study the effect of music on these newborns .
" Medical practitioners are aware that by changing the environment , we can create a whole new treatment paradigm for babies in neonatal care , " Dr. Mandel stated .
" The point of our research is to quantify these effects so that standards and care - guides can be developed .
We still do n't know the long - term effects of the music , or if other kinds of music will work just as well .

Far from overreaching on health care reform , a plurality of the public thinks President Obama and Democrats have done too little to regulate the insurance industry , hold down costs and extend coverage , a new poll finds .
Forty - three percent of Americans said the health care bill goes “ not far enough ” in regulating health insurance companies , according to a new CBS survey released Monday evening .
Just 18 percent deemed it “ about right ” and 27 percent thought it “ go[es ] to far . ”

Thirty - nine percent said the legislation does n’t achieve strong enough cost controls one of the leading goals of reform as opposed to 24 percent who believed it goes too far and 21 percent that are satisfied .
The public was also underwhelmed by the bill ’s provisions to extend coverage .
Thirty - five percent said its efforts are n’t strong enough , as opposed to 32 percent who believed it goes too far and 22 percent who were satisfied .
The study contradicts the common argument made by the Republican Party and some conservative Democrats that the bill forces too much change upon the American people .
This case was famously echoed by Sen. Joe Lieberman ( I - CT ) last month , compelling the Democratic leadership to scrap the public insurance option in a do - or - die effort to secure his vote .
In recent months , the popularity of the overall health care bill has notably dropped , with conservatives and moderates growing increasingly skeptical and liberals disenchanted with the jettisoning of major provisions .

But the public option has remained highly popular among the people — yet highly controversial in Congress — throughout the year .
The day after the provision was scrapped from the Senate bill , a CBS poll found that six in ten Americans supported it .
The Senate bill that passed relies on a combination of federal subsidies and individual mandates to bring more people into the system .
It also restricts private insurers from denying care to sick patients and those with pre-existing conditions .
The Congressional Budget Office says the legislation will insure an additional 30 million Americans , bringing the total covered to 94 percent of legal residents , as well as bend the cost curve and reduce the deficit by 2019 .

The health care bill approved by the House of Representatives included a public plan , but it is widely believed that the final bill will exclude it .
The CBS poll also found that while a majority of the populace ( 54 percent ) disapproves of President Obama ’s handling of health care reform , the public was even more negative on Congressional Democrats ( 57 percent ) and Congressional Republicans ( 61 percent ) on the issue .

Overview & Rationale
The collaborative model of Free Software development has taken the world by storm ; increasingly corporations are contributing to the FLOSS world , and opening up large existing code - bases , while exploring many well - trodden ways of making a return on their investment .
This is , of course , to be welcomed .
Copyright assignment is one of the perennial tools chosen in the equation around monetization , control , and risk .
This is particularly relevant today ; as we are seeing something of a resurgence of interest - with several stake - holders developing a trend towards promoting copyright assignment - even where it was not required previously .
I try to bring the perspective of a long - time , pragmatic Free software advocate to the topic , which ( of course ) intersects with both licensing and governance .
This at least , is how I try to understand this area .
Hopefully some little experience in the signing , and soliciting of both personal and corporate assignment of copyright to several parties helps .
Also , having tried ( and sometimes succeeded ) to contribute code to the FSF 's gcc , Sun's OpenOffice , xpdf by Derek Noonberg , Raph Levien 's libart_lgpl , Novell 's Evolution & Mono , Moblin ( which all require some form of assignment ) , and a large number of eclectically owned projects - I hope I have a useful perspective .
This relevance is increased by the controversy around the acquisition of MySQL by Oracle : as an aside , I believe there are strong technical and business reasons why MySQL should present no obstacle to an Oracle acquisition of Sun .
This post ( as always ) does not represent Novell 's position , but is my own .
Great thinkers in our community have taken either side on MySQL : RMS , and Eben , for example ; and there was recent controversy over Canonical 's new copyright assignment policy , with an interesting LWN article on the topic .
In the past , I have been an enthusiastic advocate of the justice , and reasonableness of copyright assignment ( in some cases ) .
I have many friends , who have seen me trying to collect copyright assignment forms like autographs : sign the JCA today .
Even in those days , I would meet developers I greatly respected who would politely refuse ; indeed , I recall arguing vehemently with Bradley Kuhn that such things were risk free , and necessary .
Thus I hope I have seen the argument from several sides .
An early example of copyright assignment problems
The issue of copyright assignment has been present from the early days of Free software .
The FSF has , for a long time , required assignment , ostensibly to defend against license violations .
Interestingly , one of the early ' religious ' schisms in 1993 - XEmacs vs. Emacs was related to copyright assignment ( though doubtless other things too : eg. should we require an X toolkit ? ) .
A real problem here , making merging impossible was assignment :
Why are there two Emacsen ?
Hysterical reasons .
See the public flames if you must know .
Currently the largest problems is that Sun owns the copyright for large part of the code .
It is copyleft , but they refuse to sign over the changes to the FSF .
Some people think it is good to have an Emacs variant where you can contribute code without signing any papers .
Feel free to disagree .
One position we often hear these days - is that " copyright assignment does not deter contribution " .
At a minimum , XEmacs appears to demonstrate that for some companies , even those ( supposedly ) involved in open development from the beginning - copyright assignment creates a formidable barrier to entry .
Furthermore - this is an undeniable reality from near the beginning of this practice .
More can be read in Ben 's opinion on the split .
He also introduces a new ( and I believe unrealistic , in the FSF 's case ) concern :
One of the dangers of assigning copyright to the FSF is that if the FSF happens to be taken over by some evil corporate identity or anyone with different ideas than RMS , they will own all copyright - assigned code , and can revoke the GPL and enforce any license they please .
If the code has many different copyright holders , this is much less likely of a scenario .
While this problem appears to be precluded by the current FSF copyright assignment - it is in general , a problem worth considering in when assigning copyright to any entity .
Autobiographical , on - topic ramblings
Moving forward in time to 1995 , shortly before I got involved with Linux , we saw a clutch of copyright assignment based businesses setup : Qt - May 1995 , MySQL 1.0 - May 1995 , xpdf - Dec 1995 .
Of these the first two are often held up to be resounding successes both exiting via acquisition : MySQL for a large multiple of its true value to Sun ; and Qt to Nokia .
Today it is often claimed that we must not do , or advocate anything to harm such ' MySQL ' business models .
Personally , my initial experience of copyright assignment was ( I believe ) with the FSF .
In mid 1998 I wanted to get a patch into gcc ; I wrote and posted the patch to RMS ( who graciously replied ) , and put the assignment machinery into action ; after some weeks , I got my company to sign it , posted it , and was done - it even seemed an exciting recognition of my ( somewhat trivial ) work .
Unfortunately my patch lingered for another two years , un - reviewed before being committed .
Sometimes I wonder if that sort of first - impression hiatus could be related to the latency of the assignment approval process .
Needless to say , I moved onto other projects .
Then in 1996 , the KDE project was founded , built on the ( at the time ) non-Free - Software Qt ; and the year after - GNOME was started in response .
Propelled by enthusiasm for the FSF 's mission , and the fun of hacking with Miguel , I and many others joined the GNOME project .
Strategically , this seemed a good move - and , technical debates aside , for years we dueled for different visions of the world : first Open Source vs. Free Software , then - one where any company could write desktop software for Linux vs. one where all proprietary desktop software had to pay a single company ( per developer ) .
Even the FSF chose the LGPL for glibc ; and so the arguments raged .
Seemingly eventually the GNOME vision won ( for now ) , and Qt moved - first to the GPL , and then the LGPL v2 ; well and good - except for the vast amount of acrimony , duplication and wasteage that continues to this day .
Ultimately the choice of asymmetric license plus proprietary option for Qt , at the root of the schism , was enabled by their copyright - ownership , cemented by assignment for external contributions .
Later of course ( in 1999 ) Ximian ( née Helix Code ) , was founded , and from the beginning we insisted on copyright assignment for Evolution : we were building a platform to sell services - travel booking : hotels , cars , flights etc. integrated into your groupware suite ( perhaps a vision in need of resurrection on the web today ) .
Later on , those rights allowed us to switch tack to creating a proprietary Exchange Connector .
However - the GPL licensing of evolution had an untold impact on its adoption ; with several ( known ) others hindered in terms of their business model , depriving Evolution of contributors and keeping it substantially a single - company project .
After Novell acquired Ximian , the Exchange Connector was made Free software , available to all - and this helped grow interest and contribution to the software .
Recognizing these problems , as Evolution was re-licensed from GPLv2 to ' LGPL v2 or 3 ' the requirement for copyright assignment was dropped .
The project now has an expanding contributor base from Novell , Red Hat , Intel , Collabora , to the collection of great individuals working on it .
Another experience of copyright assignment was trying to contribute to xpdf whose regimen is GPL + assignment .
I was re-writing the renderer to get high quality anti-aliased rendering using the ( then ) new & exciting Gnome Canvas infrastructure .
My recollection was that , in stark contrast to the instant gratification of getting code included into GNOME , xpdf was acutely frustrating .
It was really difficult , even despite my willingness to sign the relevant paperwork , and my changes being ( I hope ) reasonably good .
Similarly , it was not so easy to get changes into libart whose regimen was LGPL + assignment .
Raph Levien ( an hirsute man of immense talent & charisma ) wanted to retain copyright to that too .
Of course , eventually my changes worked , I had a beautiful , anti-aliased , PDF rendering Bonobo component - but , they were eventually mostly lost .
As a footnote , it is interesting to see that in more recent times , braver souls have re-re- written the xpdf rendering to target a new and better rendering library ( cairo ) .
The result has been forked as poppler .
As a freedesktop project , that is now used by both Evince and Okular .
Cairo has long ago obsoleted Libart_lgpl which is being written out of the GNOME stack , along with the canvas that depended on it , and Gnome - Print that depended on the canvas is long dead .
I suspect that no small factor in my experience , and the subsequent trajectory of these projects was copyright ownership .
Rolling forwards to 2000 , OpenOffice.org was created , and the StarOffice code released under the LGPLv2 - with copyright assignment .
As an advocate - I spent much of my time talking about the project at conferences , and trying to whip up support for working on it , while encouraging people of the justice and reasonableness of Sun 's copyright assignment regimen .
Subsequently , as Sun open sourced other products such as Java , that copyright assignment regimen was expanded , and strengthened with the SCA .
Some time later , Sun - on the ropes financially - decided ( despite having no ISV community ) that it might be a good idea to try to monetize the OO.o asset by changing the license to GPL to drive proprietary revenue from ISVs .
This came as rather a shock to me .
Although we had no proprietary pieces at all , it was obvious that building an ecosystem to compete with Microsoft Office would be horrible difficult if every proprietary ISV had to pay a single vendor to write plug-ins .
Worse , large companies have high getting - out - of - bed payment threshold .
Thankfully , after several wobbles , and considerable uncertainty it was decided not to re-license to a restrictive license .
Subsequently , of course I 've had to continue working here and there on various projects with strange and wonderful licensing and assignment terms - always with a negative effect .
Even the pain of digging out , cutting and pasting some waiver language into an E - mail forms a real barrier to communication .
So - that 's the part of my experience available for public comment ; but , now synthesizing that into something more concrete , and examining the reality , and potential problems .
Copyright Assignments
What are you signing ?
Of course , there are a diversity of different copyright assignment regimens out there ; in many different flavors .
The best of these include fall - back to a license for jurisdictions where copyright cannot be assigned , cover accounting obligations , copyright registration and so on .
One of the most thorough is Sun's SCA .
you hereby assign to us joint ownership , and to the extent that such assignment is or becomes invalid , ineffective or unenforceable , you hereby grant to us a perpetual , irrevocable , non-exclusive , worldwide , no -charge , royalty - free , unrestricted license to exercise all rights under those copyrights .
This includes , at our option , the right to sub-license these same rights to third parties through multiple levels of sub-licenses or other licensing arrangements ;
However this is phrased , this is essentially you transferring ( or more usually ' sharing ' ) the ownership right .
There is often considerable marketing effort put into the Joint or Shared nature of such assignments , however these provisions are meaningless in most real - world cases .
Having a shared right , to a small part of another code - base , is usually not at all useful , indeed it can be argued that this is a mere fig - leaf of reciprocity .
In addition , there is often either a license , or a covenant covering any patents you hold - that read on your contribution , or even some wider , vaguer scope .
In contrast to many open - source licenses which have termination clauses to allow the defensive use of patents , these tend not to be present in such assignments .
In addition the patent language can be unhelpfully leaky as to what combinations of whose products are covered , and to what extent .
Some - of the better copyright assignments have criteria restricting the outbound license types under which the code could be re-licensed ( FSF , Sun , Apache ) , others focus more on their proprietary licensing intention .
Apache 's example would be :
In return , the Foundation shall not use Your Contributions in a way that is contrary to the public benefit or inconsistent with its nonprofit status and bylaws in effect at the time of the Contribution .
To whom are you assigning it ?
This hints , interestingly , at some fairly broad , generic protections that come from assignment to a non-profit .
Clearly while studying such a starkly one - sided handing over of your work and rights , it is reasonable to question the integrity , stability and actions of the organization to which you are handing it .
Organizations such as the FSF , have traditionally been thought to be good stewards of this trust ; although the transition to GPLv3 has diversified views here .
Other companies - such as MySQL , appear to have a stable and understood business model built around re-licensing the code ; while yet others appear to have no discernible need , or use for such rights .
Other ways to do similar things
Various other methods are used to achieve the same effect .
Some common ones - are asking for a very liberal license : BSD - new , MIT / X11 , or even Public Domain on the contribution , and then including it into the existing , more restrictively licensed work .
These of course have the disadvantage of a lack of clarity over associated patent rights and are often reserved for small code changes .
Some use a copyright waiver for small contributions , and yet others do n't require much for very small changes .
Weighing the risks and benefits
Of course , what a benefit and a risk is , depends very much on your stance ; I 've tried to categorize these from the perspective of an active , non-affiliated Free - software contributor .
It should of course be noted , that I am not a lawyer .
Benefits
Single owner
Having a single point of contact , a steward for a project , who is simultaneously the legal owner potentially can give flexibility to a project .
It is always clear whose code - base this is , governance is ultimately entirely their responsibility and you have a single neck to strangle from a community perspective .
This ownership also yields extraordinary power to change things .
If change is required that can be a benefit .
re-licensing
On occasion , it is thought necessary to re-license code , this could be for a variety of reasons : to facilitate re-use in some larger context , to meet the changed needs of a stake - holder etc .
In these cases , it is easy for a code owner to re-license the code without obtaining consent from all contributors .
This contrasts with the real difficulty of obtaining consent from all contributors in an eclectically owned code - base .
This is particularly a problem when companies enter administration , transferring their assets to new , expensive , community - disconnected owners .
In a similar vein individuals can also ( more tragically ) expire , leaving new ( and potentially unclear ) owners of an asset which they are unlikely to understand .
On the positive side , my experience of encouraging individuals to re-license their small contributions has been that , for the most part , people are only too happy to help the project they loved .
open - source re-licensing
Re-licensing to a new open - source license might be in response to a new threat to freedom identified by developing circumstances such as Tivoisation in the move to GPLv3 , or conversely by the FSF re-licensing some fstype code for gnome - vfs2 from GPL to LGPL .
Having a single code owner makes it easy to negotiate and effect such transitions .
proprietary licensing
A far more commonly advocated advantage - is to allow proprietary versions of a product to be sold , based on an open source code - base .
This has the advantage of providing a simple , traditional , per -unit license based business model , while also having an open source version .
In many cases ( it is argued ) funding technical infrastructure development is hard , and allowing this can provide a large amount of good quality , well maintained , open source software backed by a stable revenue stream .
When making this argument , it is common to look at pieces of software that appear to have been developed only by a single assigning entity , and claim that this is the only way it can be done .
Thus eg. - " MySQL was only made possible by assignment : since it was ~ all implemented by one company - funded by revenue from re-licensing " .
This ' all done by one company ' issue can appear rather circular , when we consider the side - effects of assignment later .
Proprietary versions can also have features unavailable as open - source , and ( often ) competitors can be excluded by choosing a license - such as the GPL - that prohibits others from making proprietary pieces .
This is often called the ' Open Core ' model .
Variations on this can exploit a patent licensing advantage available to a proprietary version , and - unavailable in general , eg. perhaps for some Media codec .
' defending ' the code
Advocates of copyright assignment frequently make much of the need to ' defend ' the code from a potential license infringer .
It is claimed that this is easier for a sole copyright holder .
As a non-lawyer this seems ( to me ) one of the least comprehensible explanations - is the GPL really toothless without a single owner ?
Some of the highest profile license litigations that have been seen are around Linux ( SCO ) , and BusyBox ( 20 suits at a time ) - where there is no aggregated ownership .
It seems to me that this is a hard argument to sustain , and begins to look increasingly self - serving .
Closing the code
While the possibility to close the code , and release all subsequent versions as proprietary software may seem a purely negative benefit - yet perversely the possibility of doing this may well allow timid , or inexperienced management to test the ' Open Source ' water .
This in turn may lead them ( eventually ) into a full embrace of Free Software .
It is also possible that assignment expedites various accounting problems , such as book values of assets , thus avoiding ( nominally ) expensive write - downs impacting the corporate bottom - line .
Sun 's SCA FAQ claims , in answer to How does the Contributor Agreement help me ?
It allows Sun to sponsor the projects to which you want to contribute , while retaining the ability to offer commercial licenses .
Without this ability , Sun could not responsibly open source code bases such as OpenJDK or OpenSolaris that represent hundreds of millions of dollars of shareholder investment .
Risks
Single owner
The owner with whom you are in relationship , and have happily assigned rights to - with no doubt many unwritten expectations attached , may suddenly , and without warning change completely .
The trigger in a business could be acquisition , change in management , inter - corporate politics , shareholder pressure , or any number of other factors .
For a non-profit , there may be similar board - room coups , drifts in attitude and focus , or even bankruptcy necessitating asset disposal to the highest bidder .
With a business , when management changes it is easy to lose the legacy of trust embedded in those relationships .
Worse , a business may ( simultaneously ) hit such hard times - that the relational value of pleasing you ( as a community member ) pales in comparison with the struggle to stay afloat .
Companies on the ropes often suddenly turn toxic with huge switches in strategy - cf. SCO 's transition from a contributor to Linux , to a litigation outfit .
Even worse , a company will always have some threshold where they have a fiduciary duty to sacrifice the community 's valuable ( but abstract ) long - term community status , in favor of financial gain .
Of course , non-profits may have similar problems with changes of control , or perhaps gradual change in attitude of those in control .
Another unfortunate downside of having a single owner , is that it is not jointly owned .
With a joint ( or eclectic ) ownership - each contributor has a valuable ownership right - a part of the franchise .
As such , they are potentially more concerned with and interested in the future of that code .
re-licensing
The need to avoid obtaining consent for re-licensing primarily empowers individual community contributors .
With a single coporate owner there will typically be an appearance of asking the community , about changes , though large corporate interests will be either threatened , or placated behind the scenes .
A single owner can bring about a death of transparency to this process , leading to a corporatist bent .
It is entirely possible , that it is a company 's duty to twist the screws by choosing more restrictive licensing , to try to ' monetize ' an asset they control .
It is also quite possible to end up in a situation where you have invested in , and assigned rights for contributions to a code - base , only to find yourself having to pay for the privilege of continuing to use it , or even being unable to use it .
So - by assigning away your rights , you effectively deliberately dis-empower yourself .
open - source re-licensing
While changes here may appear benign , there are a huge diversity of ( even OSI approved ) licenses with many varying restrictions .
This makes the world of open - source licensing a political minefield .
Enabling the casual adjustment of the license can well be a recipie for endless life - draining politicial discourse and punditry .
While changing license can be positive , it is just as easy to switch an assigned code - base that is popular from LGPL to GPL to QPL , as it is to go in the converse direction .
An obvious change here might be the removal of the non-copy - left SISSL option for OpenOffice ( something I supported at the time ) .
Particularly retrograde changes here would be to licenses incompatible with the GPL .
Often the very logic of community licensing - to encourage maximum use of Free Software - radically conflicts with the logic of extracting maximum financial advantage from proprietary licensing , driven by the disconnect between open vs. proprietary licensing .
This disconnected is created to drive people to purchase a proprietary license - by creating something far less useful ( until you pay , or deal with the owner ) .
closing or abandoning the code
This seems unlikely to be a huge issue for any liberally licensed piece of software that is widely used , potentially this may even be positive : encouraging more contributors to help drive the public version .
However , for more restrictively licensed code , the situation is different - this could be the impetus to a support based model , a pure community based approach , or simply the death of the project .
proprietary licensing - FUD
The possibility of proprietary licensing puts a potential sales - man in a rather unpleasant place .
He could go around explaining exactly how much freedom ( say ) the GPL gives you , or he could go for the quick sale option , by bad - mouthing it , and playing up the risks , while down - playing the rights given you .
That is something I hear of too frequently .
proprietary licensing - confidentiality
One of the problems of proprietary licensing is its opacity .
Whereas open source licenses , necessarily are available for all to inspect and comment on , proprietary licenses are frequently not just unavailable , but protected by severe confidentiality clauses and penalties .
This lack of transparency has the ability to hide the terms on which people enter and interact in ( what can look like ) a community .
This can significantly hinder interaction , discussion , code inclusion , and be highly corrosive to trust .
If you are unable to explain your actions , or even explain why you can't explain , being in community sucks .
proprietary licensing - surrender of rights
Free software enthusiasts tend to see proprietary licensing as somewhat complementary to Free software licensing ; with RMS publicly lauding this Free + Proprietary model .
However , in a world of dominant re-licensing monopolies who alone can combine ( eg. MySQL ) with key plug-ins - it may not be possible to get support from anyone but a single vendor .
At this point , it is entirely likely that in your contract you will find terms substantially limiting , not ( perhaps ) your freedom to modify the code - but certainly your freedom of association : where you can send it ( not to a fork ) , requirements that it must be re-assigned to the vendor , and potentially yet more troublesome terms .
Coming from a community based on openness , these practices are unexpected , and extremely unwelcome , but are entirely commensurate with the normal back - room corporate bludgeoning that occurs daily , safely behind closed doors .
Worse - they can yield a spurious uniformity of behavior , which combined with an inability to use forking to encourage positive change can condemn a project to ossification .
The appearance of community , without the associated dynamism and substance can yield slow death .
proprietary licensing - portfolio confusion / tying
Another risk of copyright assignment ( and the single company dominance that this tends to bring ) , is of product tying .
As a corporation with a diverse set of open source products , it is tempting to form alliances based around supporting one with another .
Thus - as a well publicized example contributors to Java - are simultaneously driving MySQL sales , helping promote Microsoft search , and lifting Sun 's bottom - line .
This is in part made possible by trademark ownership - there are great dangers in building up trademarks you do n't control .
Nonetheless - a community owned project is unlikely to have made this sort of cross- portfolio choice ; and this sort of thing is unlikely to endear Java to a hypothetical PostgreSQL hacker working at Google .
There are less well known examples of even greater perversity .
proprietary patent indemnification
If you assign rights , you give the owner of those rights - the ability to offer special indemnity , for patents , unavailable to others covering their proprietary licensed , or sub - licensed versions ; creating perverse incentives .
Barriers to entry
The Paralysis of Uncertainty
Since corporate entities may not act rationally , or predictably , it can be difficult to know whether it is a good idea to get involved with that code - base for the long term .
That risk of instability creates a barrier of indecision to overcome .
Should we re-use this code ?
or just re-write it .
Sadly far too many programmers , in my experience , prefer to re-write rather than re-use , without any even slightly - convincing excuse like this .
Thus , it is more likely , that as an assigning contributor your code will be re-written , and your contribution lost .
The death of trust
In the ( fascinating ) research paper , in the field of privacy The Best of Strangers it was found that , ( paradoxically ) presenting assurances as to privacy before asking for data created a significant negative bias against yielding it .
While it is extremely hard to measure such a thing , my fear is that the death of trust implied by demanding a signed and faxed legal document before accepting code has a sizeable negative impact - starving your project of contributors .
As an aside , whether it is correct or not , seeing your own , lovingly created software bolted to a Frankenstein ( shouting ) header reading :
* DO NOT ALTER OR REMOVE COPYRIGHT NOTICES OR THIS FILE HEADER .
* * Copyright 2008 by Someone Else , Inc .
Corporate unwillingness
with no trace of who put the work in , tends to breed feelings of a lack of trust with its absence of fair accreditation .
Interestingly while this is case for OpenOffice.org , it is forbidden for OpenJDK
If Free software development is turned into a corporate land - grabbing activity , then those areas where new work is being done will necessarily attract acrimony over ownership of the new pieces .
New pieces will be positioned as extensions of other old ones , and the potential for conflict , and the spread of ill - will can sterilize the space .
Brian
Aker summarises this well , from his experience :
" The conflict inherent in trying to reserve rights , and take the rights from others , leads to conflict . "
Furthermore , getting a copyright assignment read , reviewed , re-negotiated , approved , signed takes significant time for those with the least available time : corporate executives and legal .
Often there are risks , of patent leakage eg. that complicate matters .
Furthermore it is necessary to explain to them why they should invest substantially in adding to code that appears as an asset on their competitors bottom - line .
Communicating an advantage , high up a corporate chain can be hard indeed - thus starving your project of timely corporate contributions .
Corporate Overhead for Consumption
These days , much open - source development is driven by full - time , paid , corporate contributors , who can bring a lot to a project .
However in many cases where public licenses are commercially unfriendly it is necessary to negotiate some form of proprietary sub-license .
Assuming there is no reasonable , boilerplate license , or that there is conflict and competition between companies - the process of negotiating these agreements can be extraordinarily fraught , and take tens of months .
This can consume vast executive , business development , legal and technical resources , and still yield nothing .
These negotiations can be torturous , involve brinkmanship and tricks .
To encourage this in order to attract corporate investment is anathema in a world of rapidly moving development .
By the time a corporation has noticed the opportunity , and successfuly concluded negotiation , it is long gone .
Scarcity mentality
Often this mentality grips a copyright owner ; the thought that someone else might make a dollar from a combined work , is immediately thought of as a loss for the owner .
Thus , perversely , instead of trying to grow the corporate developer base ( and creating competition for themselves ) , the instinct is often to try to suppress and coerce such potential partners and allies .
This in turn can make dominance by a single - company self - perpetuating , and further weaken the value and lifetime of your contribution .
Lack of scalability
An assignment based model , tends to lead to the desire to build , and include into the assigned software only pieces that comply with the commercial proprietary licensing needs .
This in turn requires the use of liberally licensed components all the way up the stack , until the assigned piece - available under a more restrictive license .
eg. X11 below - GPL above .
It is clear , that this is essentially a non-scalable business ; it will work well for a single entity in one vertical , perhaps two ; but if every component in the stack is owned , and licensed by a different vendor - then all proprietary licenses require a cascade of others .
This situation is also of incredible risk - a single malign vendor in the chain could hold the rest effectively hostage .
Compared to this , the problem of internet micro-payments is child 's play .
An example of this failure of scalability might be Pyqt - where Troll - tech re-wrote Riverbank Computing 's Python bindings instead of licensing them .
Some companies make their intention here quite clear : talking of a [ toll ] " ... bridge between different communities using the same code under different licenses . "
How many toll - booths can be erected before no - one uses the road - is left unanswered .
If this underlying model does not scale , then it is unlikely that other corporations will become involved and help grow your community and software .
Where is the opportunity for multiple bridges in this sort of stack :
Delayed Gratification
When you have ( often without asking anyone ) disappeared and written something wonderful to contribute - it can often be a shock to discover , that before even reading it , discussing it , empathizing , and encouraging you - it is necessary to delay until you have signed and faxed / sent a form , it has been reviewed , and you have been approved by some paralegal .
This is particularly frustrating when the change is acutely cool - and you want to get it in immediately ; delay is toxic .
Worse - you know , that every minute you delay increases the chance of someone else ( on the inside ) doing the same thing , denying you the pleasure of getting included .
Duplication
Hopefully , with an Open Development model , decisions are made on the basis of clear , visible - to - all , technical merit - indeed , what is technically best yields quite enough discussion without further criteria .
Adding another criteria - which goes way beyond licensing ( re- writing for licensing reasons is fairly common ) - into ownership is far more pernicious .
Re-writing a piece of code , contributed by an assignee unwilling to give over copyright - yielding a re-write with the same out - bound license is particularly controversial .
The example of Sun rejecting Kohei 's solver for OpenOffice.org was a particularly instructive attempt at coercion here - with predictably community dividing results .
Trying to reason and interact with , and understand the decisions of developers who have non-public , corporate commitments to different technologies can be acutely frustrating .
As a ( banal ) example , recently an Intel / Nokia agreement precluded prior discussion of the rational around oFono / Connman .
Technical separation can itself be highly problematic .
If a plug - in does not have to be assigned , but ( when bundled with the product ) it has to be - then suddenly there are non-technical barriers to creating a well integrated product that have to be engineered around .
That can affect code re-use , choice of libraries , and so on .
If two products need to be integrated , which place the code lives can be dictated not by good house - keeping , but by ownership requirements .
The kind of communal conflict created by such duplication is entirely caustic to the growth of a healthy developer community .
Community strangulation
The combination of these risks , pragmatically appears to lead to a self - stultifying community .
Companies that demand assignment , typically attract very few external contributions ; so for example we hear that " it is a fact that MySQL was almost fully developed by employees of MySQL Ab and later Sun's MySQL division " .
Similar patterns appear to hold for other projects .
This in turn can become a self - reinforcing argument : no - one else is contributing , so why should we open up ?
When no - one else is contributing because the project is insufficiently open , that is a sad attitude .
The counter - examples
I am not aware of a single project that mandates copyright assignment to a corporation that has a diverse , and thriving developer community .
If there was even one , the business model of " communitising " a code - base , then firing all your developers , sitting back , and collecting an effort - free rent might become attractive .
In contrast I am aware of many diverse and thriving communities that have eclectic ownership , and also some less thriving ones that are dominated by single entities .
Of course , there are a number of entities run by foundations that aggregate copyright ( or a similar ownership right via licensing ) that appear to do remarkably well despite that .
Common examples are the Eclipse and Apache foundations .
Interestingly the Eclipse Committer Agreement is not a copyright assignment , and as such Eclipse is not actually an example of assignment .
How then , do these more bureaucratic organisations appear to neutralize the worst problems of copyright assignment ?
Perhaps first by eschewing an asymmetric licensing model ie .
all users get the same license - which necessarily is a fairly weak copy - left ( Eclipse ) , or ( for Apache - non-copy - left ) .
Secondly , they provide strong , stable , governance structures , that include the major players , and that avoid the possibility of disruptive change .
Finally in the case of Apache they try to exclude politics from the technical sphere of the project ; ie .
decisions should based as purely as possible on technical merit .
Of course Apache seems to get governance right : being an organization based on ( roughly ) the very same individuals licensing their copyright to the foundation , with no direct corporate engagement .
Having said all that , the general " red tape " effect whenever some paperwork is involved is an issue .
I asked Gianugo whether he though the apache project would have got going if the whole bunch of Apache policies to abide by ( including assignment ) had been required from day one , and his answer was " No , probably not . " ( when exploring these topics as a corporation you could do a lot worse than talking to Sourcesense incidentally ) .
With Apache - perhaps the only real example of a successful and diverse project that requires copyright assignment , it 's license is not copy - left .
This is highly unfortunate , and once again can make it harder to attract contributions and grow community , particularly corporate contributions .
A prominent example of the effect of licensing can ( perhaps ) be seen in Apple 's non-contribution to the code derived from the BSDs in it 's devices , as contrasted to it 's deep contribution to WebKit , as required by the copy - left .
Then of course there are the counter - counter - examples ; some of the most successful open source projects require no copyright assignment : Linux , Busybox , Xorg , Mozilla / Firefox , GNOME , KDE , GStreamer , and a whole clutch of others too many to mention ; indeed this is arguably the normal state of Free software projects .
Picturing a dystopia
Can we imagine a future world where corporate ownership and deal - making runs to it 's logical conclusion ?
Clearly , there are problems scaling the dual - licensing business - model , which should presumably lead to a large degree of conflict around choices of technology .
Whose stack software is built on , becomes then a question of deep corporate concern , and presumably the stacks will do battle in public and private .
Of course , who owns which vertical silo , and where exactly the toll - booths are located , and who signs what co-operation agreements to ensure their access to other silos is of great interest .
Clearly , those with multiple assets can use them co-operatively to advance the others .
Another thing that will ( no doubt ) cause grief is the proliferation of platforms , which will be exacerbated by ownership concerns .
No sooner than Eclipse created an IDE , than suddenly it became an application development framework to re-write the world in ; arguably , GIMP no sooner factored out it 's toolkit , than there was a desktop platform springing up around it .
With more claims on ownership - expect a plague of yet more ' platforms ' , and duplication of applications to use them .
This has the danger of further fragmenting the Free software developer base , retarding progress , and destroying value .
Acquisition risk also increases here ; without good , widely used mechanisms to ensure the stewardship of a codebase in the event of a hostile takeover , the more agreements that are in - place , and the more consolidated ownership - the greater the risk of a hostile entity purchasing and smothering some key piece of the stack .
But is the wide - spread use of assignment really likely ?
A Gartner analyst predicts :
By 2012 , at least 70 % of the revenue from commercial OSS will come from vendor - centric projects with dual - license business models .
Personally , I profoundly hope that this will not be so , and that we will continue to see rich collaboration among competitors in the world of Free software .
There is , of course hope - that individuals , smaller corporations and consultants will see the dangers , rebel against them and invest and adopt only the truly open technologies .
Finally , perhaps the most destressing aspect of assignment , is the evisceration of influence of even the most productive and valued individual contributors .
Deprived of insight into the web of proprietary licensing , with insiginificant personal assets to apply swapping games with , and providing an essentially expendible contribution they are placed at the mercy of forces beyond their control .
It would be sad beyond belief to work in an un-forkable project , that gets handed technical decisions based on back - room corporate machination instead of merit .
Alternatives to Corporate Assignment
There are a number of possible solutions , that address some of the risks of assignment , or capture some of the benefits without it .
Firstly - without assignment , there are two traditional approaches to re-licensing .
Re-licensing
The first , and most obvious is ' plus ' licensing , with subsequent version language :
* This library is free software ; you can redistribute it and / or * modify it under the terms of the GNU Library General Public * License as published by the Free Software Foundation ; either * version 2 of the License , or ( at your option ) any later version .
This of course , relies on people trusting the FSF 's governance , continuing grip on reality , and is another way of , giving a powerful ownership like right of the code to the FSF .
As such , some corporations are very skeptical of licensing their code under a regimen that may change under their feet , as happened in the transition to GPLv3 .
Indeed , arguably that transition has provoked many to search for new ( more dangerous ) ways of enabling license migration , such as copyright assignment .
A similar clause can be found in Sun's CDDL :
4.1 . New Versions Sun Microsystems , Inc. is the initial license steward and may publish revised and / or new versions of this License from time to time .
Each version will be given a distinguishing version number .
...
Otherwise ,
You may also choose to use , distribute or otherwise make the Covered Software available under the terms of any subsequent version of the License published by the license steward .
Thus , a different license steward can be specified ; but of course new versions of the license have to be published .
The GPLv3 enshrines a proxy who can decide whether a new version of the license should be applied ( section 14 . ) :
If the Program specifies that a proxy can decide which future versions of the GNU General Public License can be used , that proxy 's public statement of acceptance of a version permanently authorizes you to choose that version for the Program .
Which is an interesting twist - giving the FSF the sole ability to create new versions , but allowing the delegation / aggregation of the choice as to whether to adopt them .
Another , common approach is to use the Lesser GPL 's ability to convert to the GPL :
3 . You may opt to apply the terms of the ordinary GNU General Public License instead of this License to a given copy of the Library .
Interestingly , this is what makes the LGPL v2 more compatible with GPLv3 , than GPLv2 .
It appears ( to me ) that choosing a license that can be upgraded and bug - fixed in - flight by a responsible steward or proxy substantially removes the requirement of assignment for re-licensing .
Finally , another - perhaps less optimal - approach to re-licensing is to choose a license so liberal that it can be converted or incorporated into another licensed work , if necessary later , eg. perhaps the BSD - new license .
Assignment with a non-profit
Of course , this can be indistinguishable from assignment to a company if the governance is not open and equitable .
However , assuming reasonable governance , this method can allow re-licensing , defense of the code , and stability - without undesirable asymmetry and proprietary antics .
Joint assignment via a non-profit
As a less optimal , but pragmatic approach - where a company is open - sourcing a large existing code - base , with tangled proprietary agreements in - place surrounding it - onward assignment from a foundation might be the best approach .
Thus two entities would both , individually own the complete aggregate work .
This has the benefit of ensuring continuity , and stability allowing a company to continue it 's proprietary business , and potentially providing community governance too .
By requiring suitable voting super - majorities for changing the constitution , and therein proscribing high thresholds for any sunset clause - a clear path via contribution to a level playing field can be provided .
A much more limited , constrained , and less open ( yet interesting ) foundation , similar to this was created for the FreeQt foundation - that protected Qt from strangulation by acquisition , or sudden death by bankruptcy .
Recommendations
Condensing the risks and benefits , there are perhaps a few clear recommendations - for those corporations and individuals who are interested in open , thriving development communities built around their software .
As a contributor - avoid copyright assignment to corporate entities wherever possible .
As a project leader : use a license , or dual license combination that provides the ability to move to another license .
Use a plus- license of some sort , and include or any later version in your [ L ] GPL headers .
If you cannot stomach this ; then when using a specified version of the [ L ] GPLv3 - specify a proxy whom you trust to approve such things : preferably a well governed , pragmatic non-profit that you feel represents you .
in your [ L ] GPL headers .
If you cannot stomach this ; then when using a specified version of the [ L ] GPLv3 - specify a proxy whom you trust to approve such things : preferably a well governed , pragmatic non-profit that you feel represents you .
If you feel you must demand copyright assignment , consider doing so via an onward assignment from a well - governed proxy non-profit .
First however consider using an extremely liberal , GPL compatible license as an alternative , preferably one that is copy - left .
If signing away your rights appears unavoidable - and all attempts to change the situation : selecting different software , re-writing the software , joining forces with others to fork the software etc. fail , then prioritize assignments that :
Have strong guarantees , and a commitment to future open - source licensing , eg. the FSF's , or Sun's SCA Refuse to sign an assignment that does not ensure that licensees retain their freedom to fork , and contribute to any open source project Mandate that all proprietary licenses will be under F / RAND terms , and ( preferably ) published - this is notably absent from any existing agreements .
Failing that , demand that the ownership should be administered by a separate ( for profit ) blind entity .
Pressure non-profits demanding assignment to have clean , transparent , and representative governance - so your voice is heard .
If you contribute to , or build software based around assigned projects where there is , or may be substantial licensing asymmetry , and conflicts of interest - eg. a project under the GPL , be aware that you are entrenching a non-scalable approach that may ultimately harm your contribution .
Please do not try to present your project as ' open ' , or demonise those wanting to change the situation .
Also - do n't accept sham community governance that has no legal existence or force .
If you want to open - source your code , choose a license for it that you , yourself could accept .
If you are a business , consider what a competitor would want - this way , you can ensure the critical survival of the code - base ; if that means using a liberal license , please use the LGPL as well , as an option in a dual license ( eg. Mozilla 's MPL / LGPL ) .
You should also strongly consider choosing a copy - left license , to encourage contribution back to the project .
If you are faced with aggression from a copyright owner , turn their asymmetry against them : ask them to accept code under the same terms they provide to others .
If they become upset , point out that you 're happy for them to assign their rights to you , and license them back .
Failing that , just soft - fork the project , a - la MariaDB - paradoxically you may want to collect copyright assignment yourself to be able to affect an eventual reconciliation .
If you are considering dropping a copyright assignment requirement , and concurrently re-licensing , be encouraged - this is a good way to go .
Experience suggests this will diversify the contributor base , and increase adoption of your project .
If you have a substantial book - value for the original asset - it is worth re-considering such valuations anyway : do they truly reflect the commercial gap between the public and private license ?
are they accurate , given the high degree of volatility between commercial needs and the license of the day ?
and their fragility : could they be sustained in the presence of a popular fork ?
can the change be viewed as a gradual tax - efficient depreciation of an old re-licensing ability ?
Conclusion
Copyright assignment brings some benefits , but also creates very substantial risks of damage to the Free software developer ecosystem .
In more simple terms : do you want to work with other companies and individuals , growing code in a social environment built for the common good ?
or do you want to work disproportionately for the good of a single entity ?
Viewed from a social perspective - such open development - against the odds , herds competitors together , and excludes business concerns in the single minded , focused quest for technical excellence .
Poisoning that arena with corporate edicts , issued from a faceless business elite who are not present is highly unwelcome .
The risk of creating a dysfunctional community is of course highest when the assignment is to a corporate entity , and the license is restrictive , yet there is some real risk of backsliding and malfeasance wherever copyright assignment is practiced .
As a thought experiment , if you had two projects to choose from which you felt inclined to help out , or re-use in your project : would you choose the one where you were assured of subnormal community growth , dominance by ( and dependence on ) a single corporation , regular inter- corporate conflict , unpredictable changes of license and being surrounded by a web of invisible confidential agreements ?
Or - would you be more likely to choose a diverse , non-vendor - dominated community ?
how about if that community had poorer quality code , and needed more people to work on it ?
( incidentally , that is often a great time to join a project ) .
I believe , that copyright assignment , ( in some way like patents ) grants a monopoly to the holder to dictate terms to , and coerce others in ways that are not public - and , as such , ( depending on the ethics of the holder ) , is always potentially dangerous - and to corporate entities is profoundly unwise .
In the absence of better re-assurances in assignment agreements , it should only be socially acceptable among developers for projects that can be effortlessly avoided .
Of the current clutch of copyright assignments I 've seen , I personally think the SCA is one of the most thorough , although I have yet to see an assignment that guarantees the level of fairness and transparency necessary when sub-licensing .
When assessing whether to assign rights pragmatics needs to rule ; in some cases there will be an alternative that seems more expensive or difficult .
I encourage you to , wherever possible choose that - it is likely to be cheaper in the long run .
Failing that , trying to ensure that your contributions to the project ( at least ) are made available to all under fair terms seems a reasonable thing to ask , perhaps by getting a commitment to using an extremely liberal license for a certain element - from the vendor .
Ultimately , adding copyright assignment to your project is a huge burden to bear ( while swimming ) - but to a reasonable non-profit , with good governance - this can ( apparently ) be compensated for by building an even better , more open and healthy culture .
Finally it is just common - sense - do n't move into your partner 's ramshackle house , and pour years of your life into renovating it to a level of re-sale - able perfection , without taking your partner to the altar first , and you do n't get married in a confidential ceremony .
Civil law is there to help prevent the injustice of having your love and support sold out .
A refusal to consider protecting the rights of the weaker party tends to confirm an intent to exploit - both for copyrights and trademarks .

Of course , many others have written on this topic , no doubt far more lucidly than I , and with different perspectives .

A group of European scientists have successfully connected a robotic hand to an amputee , allowing him to feel sensations in the artificial limb , and control it by thought .
During a month of experiments , the patient made complex movements using only his brain .
It is being heralded as a scientific breakthrough .

For diabetics , monitoring blood sugar levels can be a pain in the finger - - literally .
The standard method currently requires several pinpricks a day to obtain small blood samples for testing .
But new work could make these jabs unnecessary for the more than 10 million Americans diagnosed with the disease .
According to a report to be published in the May issue ofscientists have fashioned a material capable of monitoring glucose concentrations that could one day be incorporated into contact lenses .
A team of researchers from the University of Pittsburgh led by Sanford A. Asher and David Finegold has developed a thin plastic sensor that can detect changes in glucose levels in bodily fluids .
The novel material consists of a crystalline array embedded in a watery gel .
The researchers added specific groups to the gel that bind preferentially with glucose to form a complex of molecules .
The presence of this complex causes more bonds to form within the gel , which changes its size and the way light passes through the material .
According to the report , changes in glucose concentration induce color shifts across the visible range .
A normal glucose level imparts a green color to the sensor , whereas dangerously low concentrations induce a red color and dangerously high levels cause it to turn violet .
Although the levels of glucose present in tear fluid are approximately 20 - fold lower than those in blood , the researchers have shown in the laboratory that their material can detect the lower concentrations accurately .
Human trials are at least a year away , but testing on rabbits is scheduled to begin soon , Asher says .
Ideally , he notes , future diabetes patients will be able to wear contact lenses that have a small section of the plastic sensor embedded in them .
A simple look in a mirror ( and a comparison of the sensor 's color to an accompanying color chart ) could then alert them to potentially harmful blood sugar levels .

Explanation :
These colorful panels both feature a familiar astronomical sight : the stellar nursery known as the Great Orion Nebula .
They also offer an intriguing and unfamiliar detail of the nebula rich skyscape -- a passing comet .
Recorded this weekend with a remotely operated telescope in New Mexico , the right hand image was taken on September 26 and the left on September 27 .
Comet 217P
Linear sports an extended greenish tail and lies above the bluish Running Man reflection nebula near the top of both frames .
Nearby and moving rapidly through the night sky , the comet 's position clearly shifts against the cosmic nebulae and background stars from one night to the next .
In fact , the comet was a mere 5 light - minutes away on September 27 , compared to 1,500 light - years for the Orion Nebula .
Much too faint to be seen with the unaided eye , Comet 217P Linear is a small periodic comet with an orbital period of about 8 years .
At its most distant point from the Sun , the comet 's orbit is calculated to reach beyond the orbit of Jupiter
At its closest point to the Sun , the comet still lies just beyond the orbit of planet Earth .

Socialist Voice , Canada
Dear Comrades of the Socialist Alliance ,
On behalf of Socialist Voice and our network of contributing editors and collaborators , we send to you our warmest greetings and heartiest wishes for a successful 7th convention .
It is an inspiration for us to see your successes in cohering the broadest possible socialist unity in Australia .
We are doubly inspired with your efforts to work hand in hand with fighters for social justice throughout the world , especially those victimised by Australia 's imperialist rulers .
The recent climate summit in Copenhagen served as a stark reminder of the urgency of the worldwide struggle for socialism .
Capitalism is bringing the world to ruin .
Nothing less that the survival of the human race and the biosphere from which all life sustenance is drawn is at stake in the struggle to replace this system with a new economic order based on principles of equality and social justice .
We stand with you in the struggle for socialism in the 21st century !
Comnradely regards ,

Labour Party Pakistan
The Labour Party Pakistan sends revolutionary greetings to the delegates of the Socialist Alliance conference .
Socialists in Australia have taken a step forward , being able to unite under this important platform .
Socialist Alliance has played and will play an important role in bringing together the forces of the left and important trade union activists and leaders .
We also congratulate in advance to the members of the Democratic Socialist Perspective if they merge into Socialist Alliance , thus paving the way for a clear alternative of one platform and no confusions .
This will be a historic example to be followed by others in future to think above and beyond the name cult .
SA has already shown its fruitful usefulness by winning its first seat at council by painstaking persistent work .
Sometime results comes later than you expect .
However , winning a seat means a step forward for building the Socialist alternative in Australia and bringing a hope and confidence .
All we need is a hope for the future for a better life , not only here but all over .
The Labour Party Pakistan considered itself a sister organisation of the DSP , in future , it will be honoured to call ourselves the same with SA .
All the way , in happiness and pain , we will unite and work together for a socialist world .

Dear comrades ,
Unfortunately we will not be able to send a delegate to your conference .
In the next few weeks we are sending delegations to Barcelona , Karachi and Venezuela .
Australia is simply one delegation too far .
Despite this we wish you every success with your conference and look forward to receiving a conference report .
These are exciting times for the left internationally with the twin challenges posed by the global crisis of capitalism and the environmental crisis highlighted by the failed Copenhagen Conference .
We also note the call by President Chavez for the creation of a new Fifth International and see this as a positive initiative ; hence our representation at the Caracas Conference in April .
Again , every success with your conference .
Yours in comradeship ,

Socialist Resistance , Britain
As Britain approaches the most important election for a generation , all the main parties offer the same solution -- austerity for the majority and bail - outs for the rich .
Socialist Resistance , along with our comrades in Respect and the Scottish Socialist Party , and with the important ecosocialist trends in the Green Party , Plaid Cymru and other organisations , are helping present an alternative -- not only in the elections but also in the growing struggles against racism , public sector cuts , unemployment and climate change .
In Australia , working people face similar challenges , and a far more imminent threat from climate change .
Our solidarity is with you !

Message of greetings and solidarity for the DSP Congress and National Conference of SA , Australia
Dear comrades ,
It gives us great pleasure to know that you are beginning the new year with the DSP ’s decision - making congress followed by the 7th National Conference of the Socialist Alliance .
We highly value the invitation extended to us for participation in these important events but unfortunately we are not in a position to send any representative of the CPI ( ML ) to your conferences .
We understand that these conferences will discuss a whole range of pressing questions facing the socialist movement in Australia as well as internationally .
The year that just ended saw global capitalism facing one of its deepest recessions and big banks and financial institutions collapsing like ninepins .
It is significant that the US which is spearheading a global imperialist war in the name of tackling terror had to bear the brunt of this global financial crisis .
Yet capitalism ’s desperate attempts to overcome the financial tremors have inflicted tremendous hardships on the working people with states diverting any amount of tax payers ’ money to bail out crisis - ridden firms .
The war in Iraq and Afghanistan has continued unabated while racism could be seen intensifying in several parts of the world including Australia .
The anti-capitalist class struggle and solidarity of the working class must therefore be integrated ever more intimately with struggles against imperialism and racism the world over .
The left in Australia could play a key role in this context and we revolutionary communists in India feel at one with the left in Australia and other developed countries in the worldwide resistance against global capitalism , imperialism and racism .
We hope the bonds established between our struggles and organisations in the last decade of the previous century will continue to get stronger in the coming days and enable us to play bigger roles in our respective spheres towards attaining our long - cherished common dreams .
Wishing you every success with the congress of the DSP and the National Conference of the Socialist Alliance , Australia .
With warm greetings of proletarian internationalist solidarity ,
Dipankar Bhattacharya
General secretary ,

Green Left , England and Wales
On behalf of Green Left , the ecosocialist current in the Green Party of England and Wales , I would like to send our comradely greetings to the DSP and Socialist Alliance for your Socialist Alliance 's 7th National Congress .
Your work continues to inspire us here , you have done a tremendous job in making Greens redder and Reds Greener .
You have pioneered a politics which is plural and welcoming but also strong and focused .
To create a viable world , which is ecological and just , we must build a global ecosocialist movement , more than most you have contributed to this vital task .
Copenhagen has failed but we can succeed , indeed we must succeed in creating climate justice .
We salute you !

Dale McKinley , South Africa
Comrades of the Socialist Alliance .
The most resolute , revolutionary greetings from South Africa to your 7th National Conference .
It is extremely inspiring to be associated ( even if from afar ) with this crucially important gathering precisely because both Australia and our world need , more than ever , the presence , organisation and struggles of mass , socialist forces .
The Socialist Alliance represents that force in Australia .
For all socialists , despite the setbacks , there have also been victories and now new opportunities opened up by the widening crisis of capitalist economics and social relations .
I have no doubt that this Congress will note the setbacks , affirm the victories and then chart a creative and enabling way forward .
Know that many socialist militants here in South Africa stand by , and with , you all .
In revolutionary struggle and solidarity ,
Dale T. McKinley ( South Africa )
Working People ’s Association , Indonesia
Greeting of Working Peoples !
We , Working People 's Association , are very happy and extend our solidarity to the Congress of Democratic Socialist Perspective and National Conference of Socialist Alliance .
Those agenda will mark a new phase in the struggle for Socialism in Australia .
A step that will strengthen comrades struggle against Imperialism and Neoliberalism .
We will learn a lot from the struggle that comrades done in Australia .
Working People 's Association , since our founding in 2004 stated the need for a Left Unification in Indonesia .
Because in the middle of strengthening bourgeois politic , the working class wandered blindly and do n’t have their own political identity .
The Left Unification itself must be based on political perspective and work together with mass based and programmatic .
The global capitalism crisis that we faced is the biggest crisis in the last 80 years .
This crisis again highlighting that there is no welfare and democracy in capitalism framework .
When 5 billion people worldwide living in poverty , unemployed and without decent health facility , solution of the international bourgeois class is to giving bail out for the banks that they control .
And put all the cost to the working class , directly or indirectly .
But of course capitalism will not be destroy by itself .
The liberation of working people can only achieve by the working people itself with trust and leadership of a Working Class Party that one of its principle is internationalism .
This internationalism is accordance to the Principle of Struggle and result of Second Congress of Working People Association last January 2009 .
That with condition of global capitalism crisis the need of unity is more urgent .
Because of that , Working People Association emphasizing the need to form a stronger unity between progressive and revolutionary political parties , mass organisations and individuals .
Working together with Democratic Socialist Perspective and Socialist Alliance is a very good start to build that unity .
Although at this occasion we cannot come to be with comrades but we belief that we are one in spirit .
Seeing that we have the same noble goal , socialism .
Although our struggle in their early stage is in national framework but we do not conceal our ultimate destination that we have a world to win .
Let the ruling classes tremble at a socialist revolution .
The working classes have nothing to lose but their chain .
We shall unitedly strive to change the existing social order of the exploitative society , so as to usher in a new world order controlled by the toiling people .
Working Men of All Country , Unite !
Socialism , the True Liberation for Working People !
Socialism , the Solution for Global Crisis of Capitalism !
Unite , Build Working Class Party !

Dear friends and comrades !
On occasion of your Seventh International Conference , we send you the warm greetings of DIE LINKE .
We wish your congress constructive debates and good results .
We think that a strong and vital message will come from your congress ; a message which is really needed in today 's Australia : the problems of increasing social injustice , racism , the ongoing destruction of our environment can be only tackled in the spirit of solidarity .
That 's what our common struggle stands for .
We want to built up a convincing alternative to the turbo - capitalist societies of nowadays .
DIE LINKE hopes to develop the ties of cooperation with the Socialist Alliance and the Democratic Socialist Perspective .

People 's Democratic Party ( PRD ) Indonesia
The Central Leadership Committee of People 's Democratic Party Indonesia ( KPP PRD ) would like to convey our warm congratulations on the full merger of the Democratic Socialist Perspective ( DSP ) into Socialist Alliance ( SA ) , on January 2 , 2010 , in Australia .
We feel the enthusiasm that radiates from our comrades on welcoming this historic moment of socialist unity .
We have continued to follow the concrete achievements of the consistent and dedicated campaigns of the Democratic Socialist Perspective ( DSP ) and Socialist Alliance ( SA ) activists , around the problems of workers and the most oppressed people , whether in Australia or other in countries all over the world .
And finally , we see this unity as a new qualitative achievement , in constructively building on socialist traditions in response to the latest development of capitalist exploitation ( and crisis ) as well as the people ’s fightback .
This big step also means that you have agreed to choose new political tools , as a culmination of the DSP ’s work for at least three decades and the last nine years of the left unity process in Australia .
We sincerely express our gratitude to all our comrades in DSP for the solidarity and cooperation built together with PRD over the past years .
It also means , from this moment , the PRD opens a new page of solidarity with Socialist Alliance for a better future , for victories by oppressed peoples , and finally , at the end , for the defeat of greedy and barbaric capitalism .
Once again , PRD expresses our warm congratulations to all Socialist Alliance members !
Yours faithfully ,

This research note is an attempt to map out the range of reasons for governments ' silence on peak oil .
These reasons can be seen along a continuum , from ignorance ( “ we do n't know ” ) , to disbelief , to conspiratorial silence ( “ we know well , and have plans , but we 're not sharing them ” ) .
This post surveys some of the more common ideas regarding governments ' lack of attention to the issue , in the hope of spurring comments from readers regarding which of the scenarios is more plausible in light of available evidence .
Anyone aware of peak oil has had to wonder ( at least briefly ) why the world 's governments seem to be ignoring the issue .
The official silence is difficult to fathom in light of the fact that the IEA has decidedly come down on the side of a likely peak by 2030 , while Fatih Birol ( the Agency 's Chief Economist ) suggests it 's more likely a “ plateau ” from 2020 , or even earlier – a claim recently published in the influential magazine , The Economist .

As the UK's Energy Research Council points out , “ The growing popular debate on ‘ peak oil ’ has had relatively little influence on conventional policy discourse .
For example , the UK government rarely mentions the issue in official publications and …..' does not feel the need to hold contingency plans specifically for the eventuality of crude oil supplies peaking between now and 2020 ' . ”
3
The report notes that “ the UK is one of many countries that are failing to give serious consideration to this risk . ”
4
But are governments really ignoring peak oil ?
Are they unaware of it ?
Or are they aware and taking steps to deal with it – even while they keep silent on it in public ?
Indeed , is their silence a policy choice itself ?
There is a train crash about to happen from an energy point of view .
But politicians everywhere seem to have entirely missed the scale of the problem …
[ G] overnments and multilateral agencies have failed to recognize the imminence and scale of the global oil supply crunch , and most of them remain completely unprepared for its consequences .

This is a guest post by Shane Mulligan .
Shane is a Postdoctoral Fellow at the University of Waterloo , and is working on a book on the security implications of peak oil .
Shane writes on The Oil Drum as bioprospector .
It is worth noting that it is not only governments who have ignored peak oil .
As Charlie Hall and John Day point out , population and resource concerns have “ largely disappeared , at least until very recently , from most public discussion , newspaper analyses and college curricula .
Our general feeling is that few people think about these issues today ...
Even ecologists have largely shifted their attention away from resources to focus , certainly not inappropriately , on various threats to the biosphere and biodiversity .
They rarely mention the basic resource / human numbers equation that was the focal point for earlier ecologists .
” 5
Governments are not alone , then , in avoiding the issue of resource constraints in general , and peak oil in particular .
But given the emergence in the last decade of a well - developed discourse on peak oil , why are they still not talking about it ?
Exploring the Range of Possibility
Governments just do n’t “ get it ”
Politicians and bureaucrats are busy people , who may have little opportunity to explore issues in depth , and especially in parliamentary systems ministers are often not experts on their portfolio .
Thus they may be unaware of the possibility of peak oil , because they have not spent the time required to read the arguments or look at the data behind the claims that oil production is about to ( or already has ) hit its peak .
This view of the situation seems common among those who continue their efforts to engage local officials , who similarly have to attend to a range of problems : convincing these officials of the importance of peak oil seems to be both necessary and effective .
At the national level , one would think that bureaucrats and leaders are aware of the issue , but some still see ignorance as the problem .
As Oil Drum writer Heading
Out suggests , the US Department of Energy seems to have little concern about supply constraints , and “ the Secretary [ of Energy ] seems woefully unaware of the underlying fragility of the energy supply situation ” .
6 Richard Heinberg and Julian Darley have recorded an excellent lecture for policy makers , one that seems designed for an audience that is largely unaware of the problem or its scope .
7
They are overly committed to neoclassical economics
However , information alone is often not sufficient for conviction .
Politicians and bureaucrats , among others , may be committed to a way of thinking that ensures their ignorance of peak oil .
Excessive training ( or faith ) in neoclassical economics , for instance , might incline one to take seriously Robert Solow 's notorious suggestion that “ the world can , in effect , get along without natural resources ” .
This view represents what seems to be a virtually unbreakable faith in technology and the market mechanism 's capacity to provide substitutes for declining fossil fuel energy services .
Many officials seem to believe , as the IEA has long argued , that more investment will lead to more oil production , and that there is therefore no “ physical limit to oil availability ” in the near term .
8
Of course , with sufficient investment , peak oil may be stalled to some extent , for a short while – but whether such investment is available ( given the economic downturn ) or forthcoming ( given price volatility and above ground factors ) remains uncertain .
They are hindered from realization due to cognitive biases
Faith in the market may be supported by innate avoidance or denial mechanisms which preclude us from witnessing any potential disruptions to our welfare .
Nate Hagens has argued here “ that despite facts , we exhibit certain cognitive biases that prevent us from acting on complex or frightening subjects outside of our day to day realities . ” 9
This category would include the notion of “ cognitive dissonance ” and other psychological factors that save us the trouble of facing difficult facts or “ truths ” , including that of our own mortality .
The sheer difficulty of believing , or grasping , as consequential a figure as Hubbert 's Peak , is well supported by anecdotal evidence among peak oilers who commonly report a “ glazed - over ” response to their efforts to present the case in classrooms , at town council meetings , among environmentalists , or at the local pub ( careful out there ) .
Surely most of us are justified in feeling that we live the good life , and we appreciate this image being reinforced with promises of an abundant future .
Albert Bartlett ( 1994 ) has observed the general complacency about the future and writes :
There will always be popular and persuasive technological optimists who believe that population increases are good , and who believe that the human mind has unlimited capacity to find technological solutions to all problems of crowding , environmental destruction , and resource shortages .
These technological optimists are usually not biological or physical scientists .
Politicians and business people tend to be eager disciples of the technological optimists .10
So let 's allow that government personnel may , like the rest of us , have a hard time hearing bad news , and tend to steer our attention to good news .
( The Oil Drum readers are exceptional , no doubt . )
They have been misled by the EIA and IEA
Some claim that this market - based disregard of peak oil is in part the fault of governments ' energy and resource agencies , which tend to be dominated by economists .
The US Energy Information Administration and the IEA are two that have been widely fingered for inappropriately optimistic production scenarios .
According to Dave Hughes , “ One of the reasons politicians , television news anchors and newspaper columnists are so reassuring about our energy future is that the people they get their information from are just as bullish ...
[ The EIA and IEA ] invariably paint a view of the future that is barely distinguishable from the past .
” 11 As Global Witness notes , “ Governments and industry from all across the globe have come to rely on… [ the IEA ] to provide a consistent basis on which they can formulate policies and design business plans .
” 12 The IEA 's flagship publication , the World Energy Outlook , is widely accused of offering overly optimistic statements regarding future production trends .
But in fairness , the WEO has also indicated for a number of years that a peak in conventional production is imminent , and as noted , Fatih Birol has been quoted as suggesting it is likely to arrive by 2020 .
The IEA - WEO has also consistently warned that future supply is dependent upon adequate investment , with its warnings in this regard becoming more stark in recent years .
Indeed , the 2009 WEO estimates that investment in energy production is down by some 20 % in some sectors : “ Energy companies are drilling fewer oil and gas wells , and cutting back on refineries , pipelines and power stations ...
The financial crisis has cast a shadow over whether all the energy investment needed to meet growing energy needs can be mobilised .
” 13 Still , the Guardian reports that IEA insiders claim the agency has , under pressure from the US , especially , consistently overstated future supply projections .
14
Blame it on the Media
No doubt the media also plays an important role , not only in educating politicians themselves , but also in informing the public of important issues , and thereby helping to set the terms of political debate .
But the media has not picked up the story of peak oil in any significant way ( though recent moves by the UK's Guardian may put them at the vanguard ) .
Project Censored named peak oil among its “ Top 25 Censored Stories of 2006 ” .15
In an egregious example , the New York Times appears to have completely ignored the release of the 2009 WEO , as well as the previous week 's revelations regarding the IEA whistleblowers reported in the Guardian .
Instead the Times gave a blog cover story to reporting of CERA 's optimistic scenario , entitled “ No Peak in Oil Before 2030 , Study Says . ” 16
While there have been a smattering of stories on peak oil in major papers and TV stations , there has been little consistency , such that readily distracted viewers and readers can , it seems , just “ forget ” that story until it comes up at a cocktail party ( “ Oh yes I heard about that .
Dreadful , is n't it ? ” )
The absence of sustained media attention leaves the public largely uninformed , thus allowing “ more room than is healthy for politicians to dodge , procrastinate or back - pedal on the policies needed to navigate the dangers facing us .
” 17
Yet the so - called “ CNN effect ” , or the claim that media presentations lead to public demand that then leads to government action , is inconclusive at best .
Research suggests that the media is as much moved by governments ' ( and readers ' ) concerns than the other way around .
Thus the media may be waiting on signals that are not forthcoming .
On the other hand , advertisers too may be wary of being part of the emergence of this story , contributing another reason for avoiding the issue in favour of business as usual .
They get it , but they can't talk about it
If we presume that government agencies have actually paid attention to the IEA 's publications , and in some cases their own advisors , we have to approach the other end of the spectrum :
This is a view of policy makers that sees them as largely aware of peak oil , and simply not being willing ( or able ) to discuss the issue .
In a contrasting view to that of Heading Out , a former colleague of Energy Secretary Chu , David Fridley , has been quoted as saying the Secretary “ knows all about peak oil , but he can't talk about it .
If the government announced that peak oil was threatening our economy , Wall Street would crash .
He just can't say anything about it .
” 19
Sadad al - Husseini ( former VP of Saudi Aramco ) suggests that those “ who are not expressing a concern [ publicly ] ... are doing that with a good intention : they feel like somehow this is a reality that the public at large can't handle ... [ that ] being in ignorance of these realities is better than knowing them ... and that somehow they will be solved .
But in reality , if you do n't have a public understanding of the issues you will never have the public support for the solutions ...
So it 's important to actually talk about the facts ... ” 20 This view suggests , then , that governments know but keep quiet about peak oil because the knowledge is itself seen as a threat to stability ( economic , emotional , social , political ) .
Thoughtful of them , surely – but their silence also stands in the way of efforts to prepare people and economies for the coming transition , and so increases the likelihood that transition will be conducted as a reaction to circumstances that could have been anticipated and planned for ( if not avoided ) .
Colin Campbell has insisted that this is not the result of some “ great conspiracy ” : the fact that companies and governments generally do n't advertise that “ the North Sea is finished ” , for instance , is more a matter of “ practical daily management . ” 21 But that does not mean that leaders are not cognizant of the coming changes :
Campbell : “ I think behind the scenes they are beginning to plan and prepare in sensible ways .
You ’ll find the oil companies , for example , are selling and disposing of secondary marketing chains , secondary refineries and so on , because they know full well that the supply is going to lead to surplus refining capacity .
I think if you look elsewhere , the airline businesses is changing radically because it ’s so dependent on cheap oil .
We see hidden messages that do deliver the correct reading of all of this , but it ’s not something people really want to talk about . ” 22
They are actively avoiding the issue
The growing chorus of reports , websites and media reports regarding peak oil has forced governments to actively resist discussing the issue .
For example , recent efforts by Australia 's Green Party to convene task forces have been voted down in the national Senate and state legislature , though the latter was by a close margin.23 Jeremy Leggett , who edited the UK Industry Taskforce Report ( “ The Oil Crunch ” 24 ) , says that despite “ a number of meetings with very senior people in government ” , efforts to get the British Government to respond to the Taskforce 's concerns have met with little success .
Indeed , the government seems to have made up its mind in advance : the Taskforce had initially invited the Department of Trade and Industry to conduct the study as a joint industry - government initiative .
The DTI reportedly replied , “ and this is the exact words used : ' it would be too risky to do that ' .
Their argument was ... basically , there is n't any risk , so why do a risk assessment , because if you do that you might scare the horses unnecessarily . ”
On the other hand , the government has widely embraced the Wicks review , which ( according to Leggett ) “ dismisses peak oil out of hand ” .
Though the Taskforce had earlier met with the authors , the Wicks review does not mention the Taskforce and ignores all the evidence and arguments made by the Taskforce in that meeting .
“ It takes my breath away ” , says Leggett .
“ This is gross irresponsibility , and a form of betrayal of national interests , and I think the people involved in this will really live to regret it . ” 25
But what if Leggett is missing something still ?
They 're on it , do n't you worry
What if the silence on peak oil is not a betrayal of national interests , but a policy choice informed by national interests ?
What if , with Mike Ruppert , we accept that there are “ conspiracy facts ” , and that the silence on peak oil is one of them ?
“ Most people have ... a serious misconception :
That misconception is a belief that there is an urgent need to somehow make key decision makers and leaders of American and global life aware of the immediate problems of Peak Oil and Natural Gas .
Nothing could be more off base .
The world 's key decision makers have been aware of and planning for this crisis for years . ” 26
Ruppert 's claim is that governments are informed , and are taking the matter very seriously : that is to say , they are not ( as per appearances ) ignoring peak oil at all .
But in the absence of a discourse that reveals that awareness , and that discusses the policy moves being made to meet it , how are researchers to approach the issue ?
Where are we to look for evidence that governments “ have been planning for this crisis for years ” ?
One thing is clear : we cannot look to the statements of political actors as a reflection of their knowledge or beliefs regarding peak oil ( or other issues ) .
Political speech is an activity , directed at moving audiences : it is not a reliable window on the minds of political actors .
A more realistic view , then , says we need to look not at what actors say , but at what they do , and to see whether an interpretation of their actions as responses to peak oil stands up to scrutiny .
Actions speak louder than words …
Middle East Adventures
“ [ T ] he notion that the war with Iraq had nothing to do with oil is simply preposterous .
The US attacked Iraq ( which appears to have had no weapons of mass destruction and was not threatening other nations ) , rather than North Korea ( which is actively developing a nuclear weapons programme and boasting of its intentions to blow everyone else to kingdom come ) because Iraq had something it wanted .
In one respect alone , Bush and Blair have been making plans for the day when oil production peaks , by seeking to secure the reserves of other nations . ”
( George Monbiot , December 2003 ) 27
It is generally recognized that the first Gulf War was “ all about oil ” , even while many cling to the claim that the second , and the invasion and occupation of Iraq , was not about oil .
Chapter 4 of Richard Heinberg ’s The Party 's
Over opens with a four - page summary of the beginning phases of the war on terror : the oil connections of the Bush administration , the pre-existing plans to invade Iraq , the ample evidence that Bush and Co. were well informed about peak oil ( including the fact they had Matthew Simmons on staff ) , the convenience of 9 - 11 for justifying the pursuit of an aggressive and oil - related foreign policy .
The view that the ongoing War on Terror is itself largely about oil is widely acknowledged not only by many peak oilers ( Campbell , Heinberg ) , but also by an increasing number of academic scholars .28
Not surprisingly , the US has been flagged above all for “ covert awareness ” of peak oil .
In 1999 , former Vice President Dick Cheney told an audience that the world would need the equivalent of five Saudi Arabias to meet projected demand , and that “ the prize ” was still the Middle East oilfields .
29
In January 2008 , Bush noted that the Saudis could not very well be asked to pump more oil if they did n't have the capacity , suggesting that even he recognized production limits in the Oil Kingdom30 .
( Might he have actually been listening to Matt Simmons ? )
While official US security literature seems largely free of discussions of peak oil,31 the close correlation between American foreign policy concerns and the oil - rich parts of the world suggests a familiar lubricant is behind recent moves on what Zbigniew Brzezinski called the Grand Chessboard , and what others see as a New “ Great Game ” .
Response to economic collapse of 2008
There is little doubt that the current recession / collapse was in part instigated by peak oil and high prices , exacerbated by high levels of indebtedness which left many consumers in a poor position to navigate an energy price spike .
32
Those who have been watching peak oil coming have long warned of the economic consequences : Kenneth Deffeyes , in The End of Suburbia ( 2004 ) , suggested the peak would result in “ seven trillion dollars wiped from the stock market ; two million jobs gone ; state and municipal budget surpluses GONE . ”
Leggett subtitled his 2005 book , The Empty Tank , with a warning of The Coming Global Financial Catastrophe.33
To the degree that governments have been aware of peak oil , they have also been aware of declining opportunities for economic growth , and the likelihood of a financial shock .
The licenses given by government agencies for banks and investors to pursue carnivalesque capitalism – including the invention of a range of novel instruments that depended on continuous growth ( in order to service the debt they were composed of ) – may also be seen as a plan of sorts , in that if leaders were aware of the coming crisis , they may have sought to enable conditions that could hold it off , at least for awhile , while being fully conscious that they were “ gutting the economy ” and shackling future generations .
34
The ongoing borrowing binge , dressed up as a Keynesian stimulus , seems to many an utterly unsustainable corporate welfare scheme being loaded on the backs of generations yet to come .
If governments realize that the old game of capitalism cannot be sustained under conditions of declining energy , then the future of capitalism – at least under existing rules – becomes somewhat irrelevant .
In that case , perhaps the only thing to do is seek to gain whatever can be withdrawn from the system prior to a major rule - change .
Whether these advantages will still hold under whatever new rules emerge remains an open question .
This does not bode well for hopes that leaders will make any positive decisions regarding energy futures : it suggests they see no future ( surely true , in that 4 - year - electoral - cycle kind of way ) .
To the extent there is a future , it is a low carbon one , and any steps in that direction are surely positive indications that governments are in fact taking steps to address energy insecurity .
A great many programs have emerged in recent years , partly in response to energy prices , and often dressed up in terms of reducing emissions .
Incentives for biofuels production , including government mandated production levels , may help ensure some growth in this sector , which makes a small contribution to liquid fuel supply .
Solar , wind and geothermal will contribute to growth in electricity production , and a number of European states are moving toward establishing an enhanced grid for transmission of low - carbon electricity .
35
Other projects , including massive solar farms in the Sahara Desert , may do much to stem electricity supply concerns and help navigate an energy transition .
They are unlikely to help a great deal with liquid fuel supply problems , however .
“ Climate ” policy
A third peak oil related policy response can be found in government ( in ) actions to curb global warming .
Moves made to address carbon emissions are varied , but many governments seem to be prioritizing low - carbon energy programs as an alternative to fossil fuels .
Fatih Birol recently told the US Council on Foreign Relations of his certainty that developing states are interested in climate negotiations – and in reducing emissions – far more for energy security reasons than for climate ones .
36 Diplomatically , he did not suggest that major industrial states might be acting for much the same reasons .
To the extent that governments are aware of peak oil , climate change actually gives a presentable face to the necessary policy actions .
Presenting these efforts as responses to climate change encourages investments in energy security , allowing them to be legitimized on well - established environmental grounds .
This avoids the political difficulty of presenting peak oil and recommending appropriate policies ( and explaining why they have n't done so sooner ) .
While proposed emissions reductions are in line with depletion rates , the global warming agenda is a voluntary one , in which humans can still pretend we are in control of our destiny ( and our planet ) .
As fossil fuel scarcity begins to bite , the declining supply ( BAD ) can be made to look like reduced emissions ( GOOD ? ) .
Furthermore , the emerging carbon markets contribute a novel “ scarcity ” ( pollution rights ) that may stand in place of natural scarcity .
They also enable profits to accrue , via emissions trading and energy development , in the face in growing material scarcity , and these may help offset declining profits from the fossil fuel industry .
The benefits will accrue to the ruling class , of course , and its executive may be rewarded – or at least preserved – if it follows its mandate .
This thesis is not , of course , unconnected with the thoughts on the financial crisis above .
Conclusions
It is clear that peak oil presents an immense challenge in terms of governance , a challenge that seems to have precluded its uptake in policy and governance circles .
This does not mean that states and their leaders are not aware of the problem , although many individuals within governments may not be .
If governments are aware , as seems likely , their silence may mean that they fear that the public consumption of the scale of the problem may generate more problems than it solves .
It may mean that there is a widespread cognitive barrier to examining the problem and prospects , and ( in part as a result ) they really do n't know what to do .
However , it may also be the case that they are well aware of the problem and are indeed pursuing actions to meet it , in a way ; but the distasteful nature of the response requires that the real reasons for decisions be hidden from view .
The pillage of Iraq and Afghanistan , the wholesale robbery of the public in order to enrich capitalist classes , and the pretence of “ saving the planet ” - and the polar bears – may all be seen as unfortunate necessities for power structures seeking to preserve themselves under difficult circumstances .
If political actors seem to be acting with an awareness of peak oil , the fact that they do n't discuss it is relevant only on that it stands as evidence that not discussing it is part of the policy response .
( Ignorance is strength , or some such thing . )
But whether sticking our heads in the sand will make the challenges of peak oil any easier for governments – let alone the rest of us – remains to be seen .

Today , we are featuring two different posts on closely related topics .
( 1 ) This post , which relates to a proposal for an analysis which would cover a wide range of minerals , and ( 2 ) A report by Rembrandt about a group in Europe which seems to be doing at least some things fairly closely related to what Chris is discussing in his proposal , but probably on a more limited basis .
Below the fold is a proposal written by Chris Clugston relating to developing a better analysis of our non-renewable resources , that he would like our assistance on , in three ways :
Proposal for a Comprehensive Analysis of Global Nonrenewable Natural Resource Scarcity
Nonrenewable natural resources ( NNRs ) — energy resources , metals , and minerals — are the lifeblood of industrialized civilization ; they are the enablers of the “ way of life ” that we in the “ developed ” world have come to take for granted , and to which billions in the “ developing world ” aspire .
As a case in point , approximately 95 % of the material flows into the US economy each year are NNRs .
In the absence of continuously available supplies of enormous quantities of NNRs , industrialized societies would cease to exist .
Rationale
Because NNR supplies are finite — NNR reserves are not replenished by Nature — NNR supplies will become increasingly scarce , given persistent extraction , as reserves are depleted toward exhaustion .
Such has been the case in the US , and compelling evidence supports the contention that NNRs are becoming increasingly scarce on a global level as well .
( See - http://www.wakeupamerika.com/PDFs/Continuously-Less-and-Less.pdf; and Appendix A below . )
Since global NNR scarcity is occurring now , and since global NNR scarcity will undermine , if not preclude , the population levels and material living standards associated with today ’s industrialized and industrializing nations , it is critical that we understand the extent to which global NNR scarcity exists today and the extent to which it is likely to exist in the immediate future .
A comprehensive and objective analysis of global NNR scarcity spanning the period from 1950 to 2050 must be conducted , as the fundamental prerequisite to informed planning and policy development at the local , national , and global levels .
The analysis must incorporate the best available data , analytical tools , and expertise .
Objectives
1. Identify factors , trends , and milestones regarding global NNR demand , supply , and utilization that have impacted or will impact NNR scarcity during the 1950 - 2050 time period .
Specifics per NNR include demand and supply factors that determine global NNR utilization levels :
Socio-economic factors , trends , and milestones that determine NNR demand , e.g. , population levels , per capita goods and services consumption levels ( material living standards ) , economic stability , new technologies , new NNR applications , NNR substitution , conservation initiatives , and productivity increases .
Geological factors , trends , and milestones that determine NNR supply , e.g. , discovery levels , “ reserve growth ” levels , extraction ( production ) levels , and recycling levels .
Geopolitical factors , trends , and milestones that determine NNR supply , e.g. , political stability , NNR husbanding , and NNR exploration and production ( E&P ) investment .
2. Assess the “ adequacy ” associated with available NNR supplies going forward .
Specific considerations per NNR include :
Will NNR supplies be sufficient to meet NNR demand through the year 2050 ?
If “ no ” , when is an NNR supply shortfall ( demand exceeds supply ) likely to occur ?
If “ yes ” , will NNR supplies be sufficiently affordable in terms of financial costs , energy costs , and other natural resource costs to perpetuate an industrialized lifestyle paradigm ?
What is the likely status of each NNR in the year 2050 ?
Abundant : NNR supply is likely to comfortably exceed demand beyond 2050 .
Scarce : NNR supply is likely to be struggling to keep pace with demand by 2050 .
Insufficient : NNR demand is likely to exceed supply by 2050 ; an NNR supply shortfall is likely to occur by 2050 .
3 . Assess the implications associated with global NNR scarcity on the future of industrialized human existence .
Specific considerations include :
What are the likely impacts of NNR scarcity on industrialized and industrializing nations during the analysis period , and beyond ?
What preemptive actions can be taken to mitigate the lifestyle disruptions — population level reductions and material living standard degradation — associated with NNR scarcity ?
Method
Conduct a 101 year ( 1950 - 2050 ) global NNR scarcity analysis associated with each energy resource , metal , and mineral for which the USGS and / or other reputable organizations maintain global demand , supply , utilization , and pricing data .
( See - http://minerals.usgs.gov/ds/2005/140/ - and - http://minerals.usgs.gov/minerals/pubs/mcs/2009/mcs2009.pdf - for the approximately 90 NNRs monitored by the USGS ; add coal , oil , natural gas , and uranium . )
Use actual NNR data for the 1950 to 2009 period ; develop “ best available ” forecasts for the 2010 to 2050 period .
Consider three future scenarios : conservative , probable , and optimistic .
Create , as the core of the analysis , a set of NNR profiles , each of which will contain historical and projected NNR data for a specific NNR over the 101 year period :

Following is a summary table from a work - in - process being conducted in conjunction with Dr. David Roper from Virginia Tech University .
It contains projected global peak extraction ( production ) years and global peak supply years for 19 major metals ( plus phosphate rock ) based upon Verhulst curve fitting .
The results are disturbing — sufficiently disturbing that the exercise must be expanded to include all NNRs for which reliable data exist and reworked to include the best available NNR demand , supply , and utilization projections going forward .
In the most optimistic future NNR supply scenario , which includes estimated recycled NNR quantities in addition to estimated NNR quantities remaining to be extracted , global supplies associated with 14 of the 20 NNRs are projected to peak by the year 2050 .
In the most conservative scenario , which employs estimated NNR “ reserves ” as the measure of NNR quantities remaining to be extracted , global extraction ( production ) levels associated with 19 of the 20 NNRs are projected to peak by the year 2035 .

Last week we learned that Stephen King 's brand new book Under The Dome , about a town sealed off from the rest of the world , is getting a miniseries .
Now Steven Spielberg has stepped in to make sure it's a success .
Advertisement
DreamWorks TV and Spielberg will executive produce the miniseries based on the 1088 - page book .
And it 's good that they are trying for a miniseries , because this novel is big and full of characters .
There 's no way it could be a one - night affair .
Under The Dome takes place in a little Maine village which is quickly and forcibly sealed off by an invisible force field .
So quickly , in fact , that one towns person loses an arm .
If this is done well , it could mean more cable miniseries , which would be a good thing , The Prisoner notwithstanding .
After all , we all know Watchmen would have been a brilliant miniseries .
But let 's hope this big project opens doors for more .

Synopsis :
On an entirely normal , beautiful fall day in Chester 's Mill , Maine , the town is inexplicably and suddenly sealed off from the rest of the world by an invisible force field .
Planes crash into it and fall from the sky in flaming wreckage , a gardener 's hand is severed as " the dome " comes down on it , people running errands in the neighboring town are divided from their families , and cars explode on impact .
No one can fathom what this barrier is , where it came from , and when - or if - it will go away .
Dale Barbara , Iraq vet and now a short - order cook , finds himself teamed with a few intrepid citizens - town newspaper owner Julia Shumway , a physician 's assistant at the hospital , a select - woman , and three brave kids .
Against them stands Big Jim Rennie , a politician who will stop at nothing - even murder - to hold the reins of power , and his son , who is keeping a horrible secret in a dark pantry .
But their main adversary is the Dome itself .
Because time is n't just short .
It 's running out .

The Southern Ocean is the world 's most important feeding ground for whales
Sea levels are likely to rise by about 1.4 m ( 4ft 6 in ) globally by 2100 as polar ice melts , according to a major review of climate change in Antarctica .
Conducted by the Scientific Committee on Antarctic Research ( SCAR ) , it says that warming seas are accelerating melting in the west of the continent .
Ozone loss has cooled the region , it says , shielding it from global warming .
Rising temperatures in the Antarctic Peninsula are making life suitable for invasive species on land and sea .
The report - Antarctic Climate Change and the Environment - was written using contributions from 100 leading scientists in various disciplines , and reviewed by a further 200 .
Rising seas :
A tale of two cities SCAR 's executive director Dr Colin Summerhayes said it painted a picture of " the creeping global catastrophe that we face " .
" The temperature of the air is increasing , the temperature of the ocean is increasing , sea levels are rising - and the Sun appears to have very little influence on what we see , " he said .
SCAR 's report comes 50 years to the day after the Antarctic Treaty , the international agreement regulating use of the territory , was opened for signing , and a week before the opening of the potentially seminal UN climate summit in Copenhagen .
High rise
Two years ago , the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change ( IPCC ) projected that the global average sea level would probably rise by 28 - 43 cm ( 11 - 16 in ) by the end of the century .
But it acknowledged this figure was almost certainly too low , because it was impossible to model " ice dynamics " - the acceleration in ice melting projected to occur as air and water temperatures rise .
Launching the SCAR report in London , lead editor John Turner from the British Antarctic Survey ( BAS ) suggested that observations on the ground had changed that picture , especially in parts of the West Antarctic ice sheet .
" Warmer water is getting under the edges of the West Antarctic ice sheet and accelerating the flow of ice into the ocean , " he said .
Glaciers :
If the world 's mountain glaciers and icecaps melt , sea levels will rise by an estimated 0.5 m
Thermal expansion :
The expansion of warming oceans was the main factor contributing to sea level rise , in the 20th Century , and currently accounts for more than half of the observed rise in sea levels Ice sheets :
These vast reserves contain billions of tonnes of frozen water - if the largest of them ( the East Antarctic ice sheet ) melts , the global sea level will rise by an estimated 64 m
By the end of the century , he said , the sheet will probably have lost enough ice alone to raise sea levels globally by " tens of centimetres " .
The remainder of the projected rise would come from melting of the Greenland cap , melting of mountain glaciers in the Himalayas and Andes , and the expansion of seawater as it warms .
A number of research teams have come up with similar projections .
But this is the first time that an international body such as SCAR has endorsed the likelihood that sea levels will rise enough to threaten some of the world 's biggest cities by the end of the century .
Cold store
The Antarctic Peninsula - the strip of land that points towards the southern tip of South America - has warmed by about 3C over the last 50 years , the fastest rise seen anywhere in the southern hemisphere , according to the report .
But the rest of the continent has remained largely immune from the global trend of rising temperatures .
ANTARCTIC CLIMATE CHANGE
Full report from the Scientific Committee on Antarctic Research [ 20 MB ]
Most computers will open this document automatically , but you may need Adobe Reader Download the reader here Indeed , the continent 's largest portion , East Antarctica , appears to have cooled , bringing a 10 % increase in the sea ice extent since 1980 .
This report backs the theory that it has bucked the global trend largely because of ozone depletion - the chemical havoc wrought over 30 years by chlorofluorocarbons ( CFCs ) and other agents in the stratosphere above the polar region .
" We used to have a big blanket of ozone , and when we took it away we saw a cooling , " said Professor Turner .
" The Antarctic has been shielded from the impacts of global warming . "
But , the report concludes , that will not last forever .
The ozone hole is expected to repair itself in about 50 years , now that the Montreal Protocol has curbed the use of ozone - destroying substances .
As it does so , the SCAR team predicts that greenhouse warming will come to dominate the temperature change across Antarctica , as in other parts of the planet .
Doubling of greenhouse gas concentrations in the atmosphere would warm the continent by 3 - 4C , it says .
The majority of Antarctica is so cold that a rise of this magnitude in air temperature would have little impact .
But more warming of the oceans would speed ice loss still further , the report concludes .
On the basis of declines seen around the Antarctic Peninsula , it would also be expected to bring significant reductions in the abundance of krill , a key foodstuff for baleen whales and other animals .
Among humankind , the frozen continent was once a preserve of explorers and scientists .
But now , about 30,000 tourists a year visit , some setting foot on outlying parts of the peninsula .
This increased human traffic , plus the warming on land and sea , are going to change the region 's ecology , according to Julian Gutt , allowing organisms to enter and survive that were previously excluded through climate or simple geography .
" A good candidate is the stone crab ( aka king crab ) such as those found throughout Norwegian waters - they 're more than a metre across from toe to toe .
" There are hints of it hopping across from South America - and that could completely change the ecosystem on the sea floor , " said the Alfred Wegener Institute researcher .
About one third of one percent of Antarctica 's land surface is ice - free ; but already , non-native species are competing with native mosses for this meagre resource , Dr Gutt noted .

One of the most crucial mistakes Microsoft made with its 2007 perating system ( OS ) Vista was fail to convince gamers that the OS was worth an upgrade .
Vista , by all accounts , slowed down systems more than necessary , making it one more obstacle in the quest to play titles like Crysis at the maximum video frames per second .
It seems , however , that the Redmond - based company 's attempt to rectify that situation with the new Windows 7 is paying off .
According to a recent survey performed by video game download center Steam , users of the increasingly popular operating system account for an incredible 23 per cent , or nearly 1 in 4 , of its total membership .
( Source : torrentbomb.com )
Windows XP Still on Top , Win7 Rising Fast
Steam is a digital content distributor -- in other words , it 's an online store boasting an incredible library of games for purchase and immediate download .
Major titles like Company of Heroes and Team Fortress 2 can be bought , downloaded , and ready to play within a few hours .
It might take longer than going to the nearest EB Games , but it sure is a lot more convenient .
Steam launched its survey to find out what kind of hardware people were using for their games back in December .
According to the numbers , Windows XP 's 32 - bit version continues to lead the pack , with 44.77 per cent of all users , nearly half , employing the still - popular OS .
Vista showed surprisingly well , with its 32 - bit version at 20.71 per cent , followed by Windows 7 64 - bit ( 15.61 ) , Windows Vista 64 - bit ( 10.00 ) , and Windows 7 ( 7.45 ) .
Together , both versions of Windows 7 make up the 23 per cent .
Intel , Nvidia Amongst Most Popular Component Manufacturers
Steam was n't just interested in what operating systems people were using to play its games , however .
It also asked what CPU they were using ( Intel led at 69.06 per cent ) , how much RAM was in their systems ( 30.94 at 2GB ; 29.99 at 3GB ) , and their brand of GPU ( Nvidia wins with 65.01 ) .
( Source : zdnet.com )
The average processor speed was about 2.5GHz .
All of that is certainly interesting , no doubt , but it 's news that gamers are in record time making the switch to Windows 7 that will make these bleary January evenings a little less miserable for Microsoft management .

Weight loss not faster with more meals a day
If you want to lose weight you need to spread your food intake more , so eat more small meals throughout the day , as this keeps your metabolism up .
Diet gurus have been promoting this message for decades now to everyone trying to lose weight .
A small study done at the University of Ottawa dares to contradict this .
The Canadians got sixteen healthy but overweight people to lose weight for a period of 8 weeks , by putting them on a diet that gave them 700 fewer calories than they burned .
The diet was composed in accordance with nutritionists ' guidelines on healthy food .
Half of the test subjects ate 3 times a day : breakfast , lunch and supper .
The other half ate 6 meals and snacked between meals .
The high meal frequency - group consumed 202 kcal a day in the form of snacks .
The total amount of energy that both groups consumed was of course the same .
The table below shows what happened to the subjects ' weight and body composition after 8 weeks of dieting .
high meal frequency low meal frequency Body wt ( kg ) - 4.6 - 5.3
Fat mass ( kg ) - 3.2 - 3.1 Lean body mass ( kg ) - 1.8 - 2.6
The high meal frequency group lost a little more fat and retained a little more lean body mass , but the differences between the groups were not significant .
The same was true for the differences between the production of the appetite hormones ghreline and PYY .
The figure below shows what happened to the ghreline production in both groups .
Triangles : high meal frequency group ; squares : low meal frequency group ; solid line : before the diet ; dotted line : after the diet .
" We thus conclude under the conditions described in the present study that increasing meal frequency does not promote increased body weight loss " , the researchers write at the end of their article .

UPDATE : A man with access to the Ellie Light e-mail account says yes , it 's him .
On Thursday evening , The Plain Dealer 's Sabrina Eaton reported on " Ellie Light , " who'd had virtually identical letters to the editor published in newspapers around the country , with most of them claiming a different hometown in each paper 's circulation area .
, saying " There was lots to write about this week , for example Teddy Kennedy ' seat falling to a Republican , or the Supreme Court 's ruling allowing corporations to donate unlimited funds to causes they support .
Both those events portend unimaginable consequences for democracy in this country .
And Ms. Eaton , a " Washington " journalist , decides to spend a few minutes pasting snippets of letters into Google and come up with a story about a letter writer . "
Since then , others have followed the trail of the Ellie Light letter .
The blog Patterico's Pontifications seems to have the most comprehensive list so far .
To the dozen or so originall listed , the blog adds several dozen more , including the Stamford ( Conn . )
Advocate and the Gainesville ( Ga. ) Times .
The letter has even appeared overseas , including in the Bangkok Post .
And now there 's a Facebook fan page for her .
In most letters , Light claims a nearby hometown .
But in letters published in two papers that have a broader audience -- the Washington Times and USA Today -- her address is listed as Long Beach , Calif .
That 's the same city used in a letter to the Daily Breeze in California .
( Monday update :
One of the papers that appeared to have published the letter , the Green Bay ( Wis . )
Press - Gazette , posted a statement on its site .
It said that the letter was actually printed in sister papers , but appear under the Press - Gazette logo online as well because of the structure of their operation .
And it said , speaking for the other papers , " The editors of the [ Gannett Wisconsin Media} ] papers exercised due diligence to one degree or another , in most cases calling the phone number provided by the writer to confirm she was the author .
However , she responded with false information and a series of different hometowns . " )
Commenters have questioned the coincidence of so many papers deciding to publish this one letter out of all those they 've received .
However , most of the letters have appeared in smaller papers , where competition for published letters is not as high .
And Politico.com 's Ben Smith , who in an unusual decision had published the Ellie Light letter in ful himself , wrote at the time that her words " seemed to crystallize a point his supporters have been trying to make for a while . "
Here 's what Ellie Light wrote :

I recently met with a group of Australian journalists , including editors of some of the leading dailies .
They impressed me as a fair and open - minded group .
In the course of discussions , one elegantly phrased question , not intended to offend , was put to me , which I have been mulling over .
" Did I ever take into account that if virtually the entire world has concluded that Israel is the principal cause for the Middle East impasse , perhaps they are right ? "
The question is particularly pertinent in relation to Europe , which has turned so dramatically against Israel .
In these " enlightened " , postmodernist secular societies , which shun all manifestations of nationalism , Israel is no longer considered a revival of Jewish nationhood , but as a colonial implant that many would be happy to see somehow disappearing as a national entity .
And , of course , there is the " new antisemitism " in which demonisation of Israel has become the surrogate for traditional Jew hatred – just as Jews in the middle ages were blamed for all the ills of mankind , so today the Jewish state is increasingly held responsible for the principal woes facing humanity .
In this environment , the left and many liberals now focus their rage against Israel and have succeeded in hijacking human rights groups to serve as vehicles to undermine the Jewish state .
On the international arena , the automatic majority of Islamic and other radical states guarantees the passage of all anti-Israeli resolutions initiated at the UN , no matter how absurd .
The so - called UN human rights council ( UNHRC ) , which includes some of the worst tyrannies among its leading members , is just one example .
Simultaneously , the realpolitik imposed by oil - producing countries when securing energy has become the national priority for most nations , together with the growing empowerment of radical Islamic groups throughout Europe , has resulted in many countries siding against Israel , rather than confront the jihadists within their own borders .
It is in this context that Israel remains the only country in the world whose very right to exist is challenged .
It also highlights the dilemma facing Israel : the more concessions Israel has made over the last decade in order to reach an accommodation with its neighbours , the greater has been the terror unleashed against it and the more its international standing has eroded .
Yet , Israel remains the only democracy in the region ; 20 % of its inhabitants are Arab citizens , who enjoy equality of rights , freedom of expression and elect their representatives to the Israeli parliament .
In contrast , Israel 's despotic neighbours are autocracies or dictatorships , which deny freedom of religion and many other basic human rights .
They also include the only countries in the world that deny Jews the right of domicile .
But it is Israel that is depicted as a racist apartheid state .
Even under a rightwing government , a broad consensus in Israel supports a two - state solution and is desperate not to rule over the Palestinians .
Two Israeli prime ministers offered to cede virtually all of the territories gained in wars initiated by Israel 's enemies seeking to destroy it .
The offers were rejected both by Yasser Arafat and his successor , Mahmoud Abbas .
The Sharon government unilaterally disengaged from Gaza and dismantled long - standing settlements .
Yet the moment the settlements were evacuated , they were converted into launching pads for intensified missile attacks that culminated in the Gaza conflict .
Israel is confronted by two Palestinian entities .
Hamas , ruling Gaza , unequivocally demands the total destruction of the Jewish state and unashamedly calls for the physical extermination of Jews .
The other is the Palestinian Authority ( PA ) in the West Bank , headed by Mahmoud Abbas , whom we are told represents a moderate partner for peace .
Yet Abbas still honours suicide bombers as martyrs and provides their families with state pensions .
The PA - controlled media , education system and mosques continue to promote rabid antisemitism and demand the rejection of the Jewish state .
Fully aware of these realities , most European states nevertheless apply double standards against the Jewish state .
Many either applauded or stood by while the Arabs and their allies accused Israel of committing war crimes .
This , despite the fact that the conflict against Hamas was only launched after thousands of missiles had been directed at Israeli civilians for years , and the submission to the UNHRC by the former commander of British forces in Afghanistan , Colonel Richard Kemp , who stated that " the IDF did more to safeguard the rights of civilians in a combat zone than any army in the history of warfare " .
It is frequently alleged that Israel is responsible for the world turning against it .
We are told that Israel 's military superiority has created sympathy for the Arab underdog .
There is no disputing Palestinian misery and suffering , but it is rarely pointed out that this is a consequence of the intransigent policies adopted by their leaders .
Israel is admonished and told to negotiate with Hamas ; would anyone seriously suggest that the United States negotiate with al - Qaida ?
Any objective evaluation would morally validate Israel 's broad efforts to achieve peace in the face of Palestinian intransigence .
It would also demonstrate how the false Islamic narrative of the conflict and constant portrayal of Israel as a rogue state by the UN and other purportedly reputable international organisations controlled by Arabs and their supporters , became embedded in the public consciousness .
This has been facilitated by the realpolitik , bias and cowardice of much of the " enlightened " world .

Modern manufacturing techniques generally require high degrees of control and intervention to get materials linked together in precise configurations .
But researchers have become interested in the prospect of self - assembling systems , which can simplify existing manufacturing and allow us to produce devices on the nanoscale .
Above a certain size it 's possible to use gravity to drive self - organization ; on the nanoscale it 's possible to use chemical processes , like the base pairing of DNA , to drive the assembly process .
That leaves an awkward range of devices on the micrometer scale in between that are n't heavy enough for gravity to drive assembly , but too big to be pushed around by substances like DNA .
A paper that will appear in PNAS describes how it 's possible to use an oil - water interface to drive the self - assembly of 20 micron silicon solar chips into a functional array .
To give some context , this is a problem that goes well beyond academic interest .
The authors , Robert Knuesel and Heiko O. Jacobs , note that a lot of the silicon in a typical photovoltaic cell is n't active — it 's there to provide structural support .
And , although silicon is n't expensive compared to many metals , there are certainly cheaper materials out there that could replace it , lowering the cost of devices .
It should also be possible to incorporate small photovoltaic chips into flexible and transparent materials , much as was done with LEDs , which could greatly increase the places where solar devices could be deployed .
To give some context , this is a problem that goes well beyond academic interest .
The authors , Robert Kneusel and Heiko O. Jacobs , note that the majority of silicon in a typical photovoltaic cell is n't active — it 's there to provide structural support .
And , although silicon is n't expensive compared to many metals , there are certainly cheaper materials out there that could replace it , lowering the cost of devices .
It should also be possible to incorporate small photovoltaic chips into flexible and transparent materials , much as was done with LEDs , which could greatly increase the places where solar devices could be deployed .
The photovoltaic devices used in this case are small silicon cubes , 20 - 60 ? m on a side , and have a gold contact on one face .
The authors referred to these as " chiplets . "
These are light enough that the force imparted by gravity is quite small , but heavy enough that brownian motion should n't be a major problem .
The authors then set about creating a set of conditions where the free energy of the two interfaces ( silicon and gold ) should dominate the behavior .
So they coated the gold surface with an organic acid to make it hydrophilic , and used an organic methoxy - silane reaction to enhance the hydrophobic properties of the silicon .
When placed in an oil - water mixture , these modified chiplets will self - organize into tightly packed arrays at the interface between them , driven by the free energy .
Put in terms of milliJoules per square meter , the gold surface - water interactions are favored by roughly - 55 mJ / m2 .
The silicon surface prefers interacting with oil by another 7 mJ / m2 , making the spontaneous organization quite favorable , and far stronger than the forces of gravity or Brownian motion .
Of course , it 's not simply feasible to leave the chiplets floating in a solution — they need to be hooked up to a conducting surface if the electricity they produce is to be harvested .
Here , things were quite easy ; provided the mixture was kept at 95 ? C , it 's possible to find solders that will remain molten .
Interactions between the gold and the solder is a whopping 400 mJ / m2 more favorable than the water - gold interactions , meaning the chiplets should spontaneously link up with the solder and displace any water between them .
The actual process the authors developed involved creating a propylene - terepthalate ( PET ) polymer surface covered in a thin copper sheet .
Squares the size of the chiplets were etched into the PET , and the exposed copper was coated with solder simply by dipping the sheet in a bath of it .
With the solder in place , the sheet was simply drawn slowly through the oil / water / chiplet mixture , and the chiplets spontaneously occupied the solder - filled holes .
The authors were able to fill about 98 percent of the surface with chiplets by making several passes through the oil - water mix at 30 mm / second .
That may not sound like it was that fast , but they were able to assemble about 62,000 chiplets in three minutes .

Once assembled , the researchers simply layered some epoxy on top of the chiplets , locking them into place , and added a second conducting electrode layer .
The resulting device operated nearly as efficiently as single , isolated chiplets .
The devices could also handle bending without a significant drop in performance — the authors attribute the differences to the fact that bending the device took some of the chiplets out of direct illumination , dropping their power output .
All told , their device reduces the silicon needed in the final product by a factor of 10 , largely replacing it with cheap polymers .
The authors also demonstrated devices with different spacing , irregular substrates , and triangular chiplets , showing the technique 's flexibility .
Greater automation of the process , they suggest , could probably improve the yields and speed of manufacture .
It 's difficult to tell how this will play out , because the cost - performance ratio in photovoltaics seems to be changing on a weekly basis , with silicon competing with various forms of thin - film metallic materials .
Still , it 's likely that different technologies will find homes in specialized applications , and a flexible polymer is likely to have advantages in some use cases .
But the approach itself may be as important as this specific result .
Some people working in the area have suggested that the problem with photovoltaics wo n't be manufacturing enough capacity ; it will be hooking what we can manufacture into the grid fast enough , a problem that has led to the suggestion that a form of self - assembling solar paint will ultimately be required .
This sort of simplified self - assembly may be a step in that direction .

Our Keynote
The David Report Bulletin always has a design perspective , and issue 7/2007 is not an exception .
This time we will take you on a trip into the ongoing convergence between design and art .
It ’s a growing phenomena that interests us in several reasons , and we have invited special friends to add more wisdom into the field .
Enjoy the ride .
Design is design and art is art ?
Is design flirting with art , or is it art flirting with design ?
What is it that we see ; a smart convergence between the two or an “ easy ” way to earn a buck and get massive PR , for both designers , producers and gallery owners ?
The merge between design and art is not a new phenomena and it has been discussed before .
Our curiosity today derives from the fact that the market driven design - art style today boosts and gets lots of attention .
We know by experience that everything comes and goes in various cycles ; fashion , politic , names etc. , the list is long .
We ask ourselves if this phenomenon is the inner symptom of a confused design world desperately hunting for something new , or simply a waited and natural evolution in our contemporary lifetime ?
The market is not slow to react to the design - art whiz and capitalize on it .
So where is this phenomena going ?
Does it or does n’t it benefit the design and / or the art world ?
Below we are trying to explain and describe what is happening .
We will also give the style a name .
To get some further indication we have asked Oliver Ike , Giuliana Stella and Christian Geissbühler to give their views from their particular insights and standpoints .
The seed - bed for the design - art
We at David Report are probably not the only ones that have felt a vacuum in the design industry during the first years of the new millennium .
It has been like a collective search for something new .
If we look at the past every decade had its certain style or - ism .
Like the modernism in the 20s , the plastic excesses during the 60s or the minimalism in the 90s .
We have regularly since the late 80s been visiting the Milan Furniture Fair , the worlds epicentre of design .
Our opinion is that the last couple of years have been poor in offering interesting and clever design .
The kind of design that really makes a difference .
Today a kind of sketchy design that does n’t really make sense is paramount .
If you would like to be harsh you can say that parts of the Milan Furniture Fair has turned into a large amusement park which delivers entertainment to ” design - tourist - sapiens ” , as our journalist friend Ana Domínguez calls them .
It is obvious that this circus does n’t have smart user - orientated and functional design as first priority any longer .
Today it is probably more about showmanship .
Media could partly be blamed for the sprawly superficiality , as a result of their stressful hunt for news .
If you would like to take part in the media hamster - wheel you nowadays have to imitate the fashion industry and preferably come up with spectacular new products several times every year .
The fuzz around a , preferentially Dutch based , kitschy design style is a good example .
It ’s like a convergence between design and art and at this year Milan Furniture Fair it was more visible than ever .
Teapots in super size , huge Pinocchio dolls in mosaic , porcelain horse heads and knitted dogs .
It was almost like to travel in a time capsule back to the glory days of Piero Fornasetti or the Memphis group and the postmodernism .
Visiting the shows of Studio Job and Marcel Wanders , among others , almost makes you feel as if visiting Alice in wonderland or the wizard from Oz.
Everyone seems to be part of the mass psychosis , the market is praising it , the press is writing about it and the consumers are gaping .
It looks like a scene from the HC Andersen fairy tale The Emperor ’s New Clothes .
An adequate question to highlight is if we should call it design , art or design - art or if we have to invent a new category and word for these experiments .
Some people call it neo-surrealism or expressionism - design , but we would prefer to refer to it as Vulgarism .
If we compare it to the postmodernism there is at least one big difference between the work of Ettore Sottsass and the others involved in the postmodernist movement from the 70s and 80s and the riders of the new Vulgarism ; the lack of an intellectual standpoint and an impugning discussion .
Where the former group of people were reacting against the dictates of modernism the latter are more or less just doing extravagant objects .
A kind of design on dope .
Anyway – it is not an exaggeration to say that we are experiencing a boom .
Our producer friend says :
by Oliver Ike
Design - Art
The first time I read about a designer who analyzed the difference between art and design was in the book of Bruno Munari .
He outlined that design for him has to have a function at its base in order to be called and considered as design .
I totally agree with him on this .
The recent phenomenon of so called “ design - art ” is for me a fashion that could not be more out - dated .
It is neither design nor art , it is “ vulgar pollution ” .
Installations like the ones of the Dutch Marcel Wanders can only recall the worst excesses of postmodernism of the Memphis area in me .
Why go backwards ?
People like Ron Arad at least experimented in the 90s with the borders of art and design .
But he was the only one .
Today every designer wants to jump on the bandwagon and make some easy , fast money in the role of the artist .
I ask myself how the real artists must feel nowadays …
Why do design objects fetch high prices ?
If we currently look at the number one design auctioneer wright20 in Chicago we can understand why certain design objects from designers such as Angelo Mangiarotti , Osvaldo Borsani or George Nelson get paid very significant fees by a selected circle of sophisticated collectors .
Either the objects were made in very rare series by renowned craftsmen or manufacturers or these objects were revolutionary for their respective period in terms of materials used .
As well the locations for which these objects were designed might give them a historical value .
The rarity of these designed objects and the galleries where they are sold should however not make people believe that these pieces are art .
They are simply design objects that ended up to become important in the history of design .
Where is the design going ?
This is a question that is quite difficult to answer .
An Italian manufacturer who does not want to be named recently at the Salone di Mobile 2007 said to me : ” As long as you have a buyer you can continue to do what you want ” .
I find this statement astonishing and frightening at the same time .
The market seems to manipulate the production companies entirely .
In my opinion companies in the new millennium should be more conscious of ecological matters .
Artek presented a beautiful chair of Bamboo in this direction at the pavilion from Japanese architect Shigeru Ban ( one can feel the influence of smart designer Tom Dixon who is their new art - director ) .
The new trend of trying to mix art and design as practiced at the Miami Basel fair reflects one more time the current fashion .
If though a piece of these new designs , that , – as said before have nothing at all to do with contemporary art - , will attract the interest of collectors in 2020 or 2030 remains to be seen .
Maybe some pieces of Vitra will , but then again it is because of the experimentation of new materials and not because the designer became an artist .
Oliver Ike is manager of the IKEBRANCO production company as well as consultant to various Swiss watch companies .
The Vulgarism – as we see it
Relatively few designers make a big income from their profession .
As for people in general ( for good or bad ) money is probably a strong motivation in their lives .
Maybe that ’s why some of them are tempted to change sides and start to imitate the artists ?
The auction houses are of course happy .
Now they are able to not only sell vintage pieces from the designers , they also invite them to do limited editions and one - off pieces .
Philips De Pury new design gallery and Gagosian gallery ( who recently made a bespoken exhibition with Marc Newson ) both in New York are good examples .
The new Thaddeus Ropac gallery ” design line ” with a Matali Crasset and Peter Halley exhibition and some parts of the second Vitra Edition are other examples .
Another sign of our time is the new fair Design London which will take place parallel with Frieze Art Fair .
It was revealed with a press release recently : “ Design London is aimed at serious collectors , curators , directors , dealers and artists and it is hoped that it will also broaden the public ’s knowledge of the ever - growing contemporary furniture market .
Design furniture is a new sector of the fine arts …
Design London will coincide with Frieze , further underlining the synergy between art and design . ”
The design journalists swallow the bait and reports about the Vulgarism in never ending articles .
The market applauds and the wheel is rolling .
Time Magazine recently wrote about Studio Job : “ Museum curators and gallery owners praise them as leaders in the hot Expressionist - design movement . ”
At David Report we assume that a lot of design hotel owners with large lobbies in new - chick countries are praising them as well .
Alice Rawsthorn at International Herald Tribune says likewise : “ There is a commercial logic to the neo - Surrealists ’ madness .
Sensation is a smart defence for European furniture manufacturers against their customers ’ boredom with the sameness of globalisation and aggressive competition from China in the mass market . ”
Some of the pieces in the design - art style are made in gigantic proportions .
Let ’s quote Alice Rawsthorn again : “ This seemingly nutty sizing is calculated to appeal to the art collectors who ’re splashing out on spectacularly impractical examples of design . ”
So – what is the Vulgarism , is it design or art ?
Or a merge between the two ?
Let ’s listen to what art curator Giuliana Stella has to say about the matter .
Our curator friend says :
by Giuliana Stella
Design - Art
It strikes me as strange that things that seemed to be implicitly obvious and clear for a long time , in truth are n’t at all .
The people do not or do not want to , have any historical memory .
In the beginning of this new millennium , instead of taking with us the beautiful and great things of the last century , we are constantly developing more and more the “ aberrant attitudes ” of the 80s and 90s , years in which one started to think that all was “ easy ” and “ to consume ” with the maximum of indifference , favouring the arrogance of a “ new wealth ” and a “ generation ” that was convinced to do everything “ in a hurry and instantly ” with the maximum of return ( in terms of profits … obviously ! ) .
See the period of the yuppies and DINKS etc … .
Manipulated markets
I am convinced that anyone who does serious research and experiments ( in the field of art or design ) does not have to redefine the terms of the issue at all … … but in my opinion on who is to blame , it ’s the “ market ” that by itself is moving everything in “ determined ” directions and in the end constructs a communication system that makes the “ nothing ” become “ a part of history ” and “ legitimates it ” to its very own purposes of consumption .
This in order to make everything fit within “ the rules ” that this very market “ creates for itself ” in order to become the absolute MUST of the moment for the “ avant - garde ” .
If I think of the extraordinary moment of the Bauhaus and all the great instruction that it has left to us I remain truly astonished that we have to be taken backwards to a certain problematic of such an “ old ” world ; for sure , things are never simple and every passage implies transformations within which a lot of things are mixed up ; in the past surely as well the life was never easy for “ revolutionaries ” and “ experimentalists ” ….
And every real artist can never rest on his laurels , if he does he will risk a loss of creativity , which is strictly connected to research and continuous growth .
How to define art and where art is going
A while ago I was reading a very beautiful sentence in the preface of the book of Victor I.Stoichita , who is one of the most acclaimed historians of Art history .
I remember it more or less like this : “ Art , the true Art is like the Consciousness , the true Consciousness ; it is always an overcoming of oneself . ” … in a certain way I identify myself with a sort of restlessness that looks at things with a deep desire that it for mankind truly exists a possibility of “ consciousness ” and for me art is a form of consciousness that proceeds according to methods and languages that cannot belong to disciplines that have determinate purposes , specifically linked to precise functions ;
Art does have to be free of presuppositions in order that it succeeds to form its own original way and that it gives a vision to other possible perceptions , to other possible “ configurations ” .
In my opinion it is not a coincidence that art always finds very specials ties to the science of Mathematics etc. .
I believe that the future of Art will be versus new “ forms ” of visions and perceptions of spaces that are more “ dilated ” , more “ different ” and for “ beyond ” …
Returning to the problem design , I would like to come to the Dutch artist Joep van Lieshout , who in my opinion represents a somewhat bright and intelligent vision of the currently complex reality .
Joep did start to produce design ( furniture , objects etc.. ) , then , as an artist , at a certain point he wanted to experiment with forms completely free of any functions and he started to do real sculptures like an artist .
I met him during that period around 1994 / 95 ; a little later he formed a sort of “ society ” named Atelier van Lieshout , that produces art , design and architecture ; the interesting thing though is , that despite doing all the three things , it results very evidently what is art and what is design , even though if they sometimes play with the ambiguity and with the extremes , but that is part of their research .
This research never lends itself to please the market by doing what is functional or not ; they have their own identity and “ authenticity “ .
An “ authenticity ” that I do not find at all for instance in the work of Marcel Wanders or of Philippe Starck .
When Starck takes up a series of “ suggestions ” from modern art , like at the museum of Baccarat in Paris that I visited recently , they seem to me badly made copies of interesting works of contemporary artists and he inserts them in an “ exasperated ” and “ pretended ” context and in the end he does not even succeed to be consistently super - luxurious ( like his work for Baccarat was intended to be ) .
However , in my opinion , even a designer who made somewhat interesting things in the past like Marc Newson for instance , cunningly lend themselves to the game of playing the artist , because first it increases their media presence and secondly they do not really have to force their brain – which in most cases does not work anymore like before – to really elaborate seriously other true designs .
Because design is also research and innovation and like some artists play the designer , in the same way designer play the artists , if they already were successful in one way or the other to enter in the “ meshes ” of the system .
Giuliana Stella is teacher of history of contemporary art at the Academy of Fine Arts in Rome .
She at the same time work as a freelance art curator .
In 2005 she organised in this function the first important exhibition of modern art at the Colloseum in Rome by the artist Gary Hill and she also co-organised the section “ Aperto ” with Achille Bonito Oliva in the Biennale of Venice in 1993 .
The luxury market and Design Miami / Basel
The luxury market is of course involved in the vulgar trend .
The new online magazine Luxuryculture recently wrote : “ Jaime Hayon is the latest proponent of design ’s new feel - good factor , creating artistic hybrids honed on human appeal .
Hayons magnificent setting resembles a Disneyland for the discerning design buff ! ”
They refer to him as Willy Wonka in his chocolate factory , actually a quite good simile according to us …
Luxuryculture also writes about Studio Job : “ Studio Job redefines design , instilling everyday objects with fine - art savoir faire and fairytale - like fables ” .
They continue by saying that Job Smeet and Nynke Tynagel of Studio Job “ exemplifies the current cross-fertilization taking place in art and design , creating autonomous works that are hard to categorise ” .
Already a couple of years ago Studio Job made artsy pieces but was criticised as superficial .
They have continued to work in the same spirit and suddenly they are in the middle of a boosting trend – design in the realm of art – or Vulgarism as we prefer to call it .
Two important persons behind the Vulgarism explosion are the founders of Design Miami and Design Basel , Ambra Medda and Sam Keller .
They offer a new kind of playground where celebrities are as important as the designers themselves .
Ambra Medda ’s own words in a recent Luxuryculture interview ; “ I think the celebrity aspect does add to the event … at the normal decorative art fairs you would not see Diddy , Beyoncé , Steve Martin and Keanu Reeves …
I think it makes everyone turn around and think , ‘ Wow this is so cool ! ”
She continues : “ There is so much attention now on limited edition design and it has allowed designers to respond to the trend in going completely crazy and creating these pieces of furniture which , in some cases , have lost their functionality ” .
According to Ambra Medda there is a great demand for expensive on - off and limited - edition design - art objects and together with a couple of gallery owners Design Miami and Design Basel are among the most important compellers of the Vulgarism .
We have heard that they also have plans for branches in China and Dubai , which is logical since these areas are full of nouveau riche people and consequently there is an interest for vulgar design - art .
This way even more galleries will get the possibility to offer a spectacular scene where designers are invited to play artists and they certainly line up like marionette puppets .
The wheels keep on rolling and money is the true engine .
Is the Vulgarism a disservice to design ?
There has been a lot of discussions lately concerning a possible backlash against design .
A suitable question is if the vulgar trend boost is partially responsible for it ?
The blog Core 77 recently wrote : “ This rising tide of disaffection tends to share two themes : a distaste for the superficiality of design ’s media - celebrity nexus ; and a growing discomfort with design ’s role in generating ’ useless stuff ’ .
These two complementary critiques could be abbreviated as Anti-fluff and Anti-stuff . ”
Paola Antonelli , Curator of MOMA ’s Department of Architecture and Design says : ” Design is treated as fluff and pushed to the lifestyle sections of newspapers . ”
Likewise we would like to quote a good designer friend of ours who refers to the Vulgarism as design for girl ’s magazines ( no hard feelings towards girl ’s magazines though ) …
Jaime Hayon , one of the fixed stars of the Vulgarism , sees himself as an artist , not a designer : ” I think design can be much more like art .
I work with intuition .
If they say white , then I go black ” .
It is an interesting quote .
As a response to it we would like to bring forward an opinion from the British design council concerning the difference between a designer and an artist :
“ Designers , unlike artists , ca n’t simply follow their creative impulses .
They work in a commercial environment which means there is a huge number of considerations influencing the design process .
Designers have to ask themselves questions such as : is the product they ’re creating really wanted ?
How is it different from everything else on the market ?
Does it fulfill a need ?
Will it cost too much to manufacture ?
Is it safe ? ”
Maybe design is too important to play around with ?
The thought - provoking exhibition ” Design for the Other 90 % ” at the Cooper - Hewitt National Design Museum in New York City showed us that nearly all design made is targeted for 10 % of the people on earth .
Almost no design is made for the other almost six billion people .
According to us the superficial objects of the Vulgarism is definitely not made for them .
A lot of the fans of this hyperbolized design style will be found around the wealthy Gulf .
The proposed store for Villa Moda by Marcel Wanders located in Bahrain is a good example .
Our architect friend says :
by Christian Geissbühler
” Less is a bore ” or ” Less is more ” ?
After brewing neo - art déco , neo 50th , neo 70th , rationalism , etc. at the end of the 20th century , trends superimpose themselves ; what is the identity of the beginning of 21st century ?
Nowadays creativity is conditioned by profit either in term of money or brand image .
Temptation is great to create exceptional and superlative pieces out of this mass production environment .
Where is the limit between and artist and a designer , Donald Judd creates chairs and Ron Arad created sculptures !
It is still creativity and cleverness we are talking about !
If these two are missing we are drifting into the vulgarism .
Christian Geissbühler is architect SIA and used to teach architecture of the 20th century at the EPF Lausanne .
Our windup
At David Report we believe in long lasting values as one of the best and most valuable sustainable solutions .
Today we live in an overcrowded world that is melting .
We are producing new stuff as if our resources were unlimited .
We need to buy less but better products .
We need to re-use and re-cycle .
The maximalistic work of the Vulgarism is unfortunately something completely different .
It ’s a blown up bubble of exercise in decoration offering only a hollow shell .
Tom Hedqvist , principal at Beckmans college of design in Stockholm recently tried to describe the climate of design in the 70s compared to today ; “ We did not design just for the fun of it .
People were acting well - advised .
Just like the over - consumption is reflecting our society of today ” .
Will the Vulgarism be something more than a small question mark in the history books ?
Will it just be a parallel to the rise and fall of the artist Mark Kostabi in the 90s ?
Designers have a responsibility and as Tom Dixon recently said in an Inhabitat interview “ Design could save the world , for that to happen we have got to become more interested in the values that design can bring to solving problems ” .
A good example of long lasting value are the iconic design classics , like the Ant chair by Arne Jacobsen .
It ’s created by pushing the limits of production process and technology in combination with a true reflection of present time .
The perpetrators of the Vulgarism are sadly doing neither .
Who will be the first to shout that the emperor is naked ?

Malcolm has been spinning further and further out of control .
So where does he go from here ?
SPOILER ALERT :
This weekly blog is for those who are watching The Thick of It series three .
Do n't read on if you have n't seen episode seven
The king is dead .
Long live the king ?
Throughout this series Malcolm Tucker ( Peter Capaldi ) , the government 's press chief , has spun further and further out of control .
A couple of weeks ago , his opposite number , Stewart Pearson , responded to one characteristic rant ( the one about tracking down and murdering a radio phone - in caller ) by saying Malcolm sounded " quite mad " .
The note of pity in his voice was as damning as the jibe itself .
Last week hapless departmental press officer Terri Coverley took him to task – rightly – for flaws in his PR strategy .
And this week an old nemesis from Malcolm 's past returns : Steve Fleming ( David Haig ) , the PM 's fixer , who Malcolm once drummed out of the party .
Special adviser Ollie Reeder calls him " the man who brought us back into power " , which perhaps identifies him as a Mandelson figure , but with his sinister fake charm and disgusting moustachioed grin Fleming has none of the business secretary 's Morrissey - esque wit or grace .
His return worries Malcolm enough for him to invite several top journalists to dinner at his house to impress upon them that he is still in charge , although typically he pretends he has gathered them there as a favour : " I know that these are hard times for print journalists .
I mean , I read that , on the internet . "
Is he threatened by Fleming ?
" This is about a guy sharing his ghee – that 's it . "
This was a very sharp episode , the first half consistently funny , with banter and insults zinging from one side of the court to the other like volleys from Andy Murray , whose name was taken in vain throughout .
The programme 's switches in tone have been awkward recently , but the last 10 minutes of tonight 's episode , as it made a gradual swerve into serious drama , were genuinely tense and chilling .
The descent began with an ominous cameo from another of Malcolm 's old sparring partners , the blue - skies thinker Julius – now Lord – Nicholson ( Alex McQueen ) , who seems to be partly based on Lord " more Andrew than " Adonis , the transport secretary .
The last scenes during which Fleming sneered his final lines of triumph , Malcolm 's BlackBerry stopped working , and his career crashed to a halt on a TV screen behind him were fantastically brutal , although I was taken aback by all the cheering , hugging and drinking wine among the staff .
I think I would have been more with Glenn : " It feels good , but is it good ? "
What are we to make of Malcolm 's final threat : " You will see me again !
You will fucking see me again . "
Will he use the media that he was once so adept at handling to try to bring the PM down from outside the government ?
The next series of The Thick of It will almost certainly centre on opposition characters such as the brilliant Peter Mannion MP .
Is it remotely plausible that Malcolm could cross the floor ?
I hope not .
The Thick of It is at its best when it mirrors real life .
Malcolm
Tucker worked so well as a character because he represented that aggressive , ultra - macho style of politics typified by Alastair Campbell , Damian McBride , Ed Balls and others .
Although David Cameron has a snarling former tabloid editor as his press chief ( Andy Coulson ) , this is far from the default mode of the government - in - waiting .
The era of Campbell / Tucker has already come to a close .
Far better for Armando Iannucci and the other writers to take stock of the Cameron government when it arrives and write a series of The Thick of It that has something to say about the new politics sure to be ushered in after the next general election .
Malcolm
Tucker is now old news – as the last few episodes have shown .
As this series closes next week , Malcolm should bow out too .
Best swearing
" Andy Murray 's Henman - fisting us in the press . " - Malcolm .
Is that swearing ?
It 's pretty rude .
Best insult
" Good cock , bad cock . " - Minister Nicola Murray on Malcolm and Fleming .
Best description of Malcolm
" The man from Hell Monte . " - Ollie .
Best description of the leader of the opposition and the shadow chancellor
" Ant and Dec. " – Steve Fleming .
Only a few hours left to Double your gift
The New York Times has another piece encouraging a flare - up in the cage match between organic farmers and those in favor of genetic engineering as the solution to future food needs .
This one is centered on the “ unlikely ” but happy marriage of a plant geneticist and an organic farmer :
Pamela Ronald and Raoul Adamchak have every reason not to get along .
Ronald , a plant scientist , has spent her past two decades manipulating rice from her lab bench , bending the grain ’s DNA to her whim .
Adamchak , meanwhile , is an organic farmer , teaching college students the best practices of an environmentally gentle agriculture at his California market garden .
As Adamchak confesses , few have been more vociferously opposed to the genetic engineering practiced by Ronald than his organic movement , which has steadily grown in recent years to constitute an influential , if tiny , part of the U.S. farm system .
So it can come as some surprise when Ronald and Adamchak let slip that they have been happily married for more than a decade .
Such a union should not be shocking , the couple argues .
And a more modest version — sans marriage — must be considered by any farmer or consumer hoping for a sustainable future for agriculture . …
To spread their message to two communities that rarely speak in measured terms , Ronald and Adamchak have written a book , Tomorrow ’s Table : Organic Farming , Genetics , and the Future of Food , which came out in paperback last month .
What Adamchak and Ronald pursue in the book is in essence a unified theory of farming .
While critical of Western seed companies that have co-opted genetically modified ( GM ) crops for questionable business practices , the couple argues that both current and future generations of altered crops will , if responsibly managed , allow much of the world ’s hungry to be fed from land already degraded by the plow ’s slice and the tractor ’s compressing wheel .
Photo courtesy illuminating9_11 via FlickrIn addition to offering the shocking revelation that opposites attract , this news gets the usual contrarian suspects cheering .
But to read the article , you ’d think there are all these fantastic genetically engineering seeds just waiting to be planted if only the “ powerful ” organic lobby would let it happen .
Only there are n’t .
Not a one .
And while Ronald , the plant scientist , urges open - mindedness among sustainable agriculture folks , her own major plant breeding project on flood - tolerant rice uses advanced breeding techniques and not genetic engineering .
It ’s worth revisiting a Newsweek article from the summer that talked about the “ return ” of conventional breeding as the favored technique for developing new crops :
Part of the story is that conventional breeding can still do certain things extremely well — even better than genetic manipulation .
What GM techniques are best at is isolating particularly useful bits of DNA in a prized plant , and transferring that single gene to another plant that is less well endowed .
( In the best - known example , Monsanto spliced a gene from naturally herbicide - tolerant grass into soybeans , so farmers could apply the chemicals without killing their crops . )
Conventional breeding still does better at building up qualities that require a complex suite of genes , such as the ability to fight off certain insects or to resist drought , which involves a host of genes that determine the way plants take up and manage water .
Roland would surely agree .
And the fact is that the agricultural challenges before us require more than dropping in a gene here or there .
To date , genetic engineering techniques have simply not shown themselves to be up to the task .
The result is that the debate over GMOs as a sustainable solution remains entirely theoretical .
The existing GMO seed lines require heavy doses of synthetic fertilizer and water ( in the case of the Bt crops mentioned in the article ) or heavy doses of synthetic pesticides , fertilizer , and water ( in the case of Roundup Ready crops , the only other GMO seed line ) , neither of which are consistent with organic — or sustainable — practices .
In essence , this is an argument about federal research dollars not an argument about which seeds to plant .
Wake me up when Monsanto invents a seed that can actually do all the things they ’ve been promising us for the last couple of decades .
In fact , do n’t .
It ’s likely to be decades and decades before someone sees fit to rouse me .
I could use the sleep .
Saw a rant today about Go. I was genuinely impressed with the amount of piss and vinegar the author managed to conjure up over this .
He ’s more upset about this language than I am excited about it , and I wrote a library in it and an article about it already .
He brought up some valid points , but overall , he completely missed the mark .
The author brings up two major gripes with Go : it has an ugly syntax , and it lacks innovation .
I ’ll cede both points , but with a few reservations .
Go is experimental .
It ’s not complete yet .
In fact , the language is still changing .
The Go authors released it so that other people could see what they were working on , but even they do n’t suggest using it for anything critical .
Go is not intended to replace Java , or even C++ ( though maybe ) .
It ’s an upgrade to C .
Ugly Syntax !
I ’m not a huge fan of Go ’s syntax .
It ’s a curly - brace language .
I do , however , understand why the syntax looks like it does .
It is a similar reason to why JavaScript looks like Java .
I do n’t have a direct line into the Go authors ’ thoughts , but I ’d wager they wanted something familiar .
So we end up with another curly - brace language .
I forgive them .
That said , I ’d love to hear what the author suggests as alternative syntaxes for the statements he calls out .
In fact , I ’m sure the Go authors would love to hear any constructive suggestions he might have on a better syntax for these things .
I know that the mailing list has frequent discussion regarding ways to improve the syntax .
The Go authors are willing to consider changes , especially changes that are proposed along with patches that show how to implement them .
I do want to call him out on his hate of the condition initializer .
That new syntax , along with multiple return values allows programmers to replace C code like this :
int result = someCall ( ) ; if result < 0 { /* Handle Error */ } else { /*
Do something with result */ } /*
Or worse ... */ if ( result = someCall ( ) ) < 0 { /* Handle Error */ } else { /*
Do something with result */ }
With
Go code like this :
if result , err := someCall ( ) ; if err != nil { /* Handle Error */ } else { /*
Do something with result */ }
Notably , in the Go code , both result and err are scoped to just inside the if statement .
They do n’t clutter the surrounding block .
I ’ll talk more about this pattern in the part about exceptions .
Innovation ?
I will take the author ’s statement that Go lacks innovation , and go one step further .
Go offers no real innovation over other languages that exist today .
The three things that the author calls out are n’t really innovative .
Analogs to both channels and goroutines have been present in Erlang for twenty years .
The interface - only inheritance is just a way to apply the duck - typing concepts of Ruby and Python to a statically type - checked language .
There is nothing new to see here .
Move along .
The point the author fails to see is that Go is not meant to innovate programming theory .
It ’s meant to innovate programming practice .
This is an upgrade to C .
It ’s a language that applies the innovations of the last thirty years to the systems world , where the state of the art is still portable assembler .
So no , the language is n’t introducing brilliant new ideas .
It ’s taking tested old ideas , and introducing them into a new arena .
Exceptions
Oh no !
Go does n’t have exceptions .
Everybody knows that every modern language has exceptions .
You ca n’t write real programs without non-local transfer of control .
Wait ?
What ’s that you say ?
C does n’t have exceptions ?
People still code in that unusable language ?
Do n’t get the wrong idea .
I think exceptions are useful .
I use them in languages that have them .
I also strongly dislike the C idiom of returning out - of - band values to indicate errors ( thus requiring that some value be out of band ) .
However , I think Go has a reasonable way to handle this .
Using multiple return values , named return variables , and the comma-error pattern , a decent error reporting facility can be created without exceptions .
Here is an example :
func magic ( ) ( result int , err io .
Error ) { if err = moreMagic ( ) ; err != nil { /* Calculate result */ } return ; }
This allows the error from moreMagic to propagate up without reserving an out - of - band result value .
It provides no more syntactic overhead than explicit exceptions in Java ( and arguably less ) .
The argument was made that people can fail to check return codes .
People can be just as stupid in languages with exceptions .
I ’ve lost count how many times I ’ve seen this in Java :
try { /*
Do something that might blow up */ } catch { }
The catch block is empty on purpose .
People do that .
They catch all exceptions and then do nothing with them on purpose .
You can be an idiot in any language .
Generics
I ’ll be honest .
I ’ve hated every implementation of generics I ’ve seen in non- functional languages .
That is to say , C++ , Java , and C# .
They are a poor attempt at implementing the polymorphic types that ML - derivatives have enjoyed for decades .
The syntax for them is inevitably terrible and the semantics just as awful .
However , plenty of modern languages do n’t have generics .
The author is whining because the language does n’t have his favorite language feature .
New Jersey style
The author wants to suggest that the Go authors subscribe to the New Jersey school of programming .
He suggests that his two favorite features ( exceptions and generics ) are n’t in the language because the Go authors were too scared to implement them .
He even cites the Language Design FAQ as proof .
If this were a reading report , I would give it a grade of D , maybe a C - if I felt charitable .
Why ?
Because the author of the article clearly had nearly no comprehension of the FAQ .
He suggests that the Go authors decided not to include the features because they could n’t figure out how to implement them .
When the truth is , Go is incomplete and they cannot figure out how to include exceptions or generics yet and are open to suggestions .
Just like with his syntax improvements , I ’d encourage the author to post to the mailing lists with suggestions on how to implement exceptions and generics in such a fashion that they fit in with the philosophy of the language .
The Go community is interested in those topics .
The discussions are happening right now .
TL;DR
Go is incomplete and experimental .
Even recently it went through a fundamental syntax change ( making semi- colons optional virtually everywhere ) .
The Go authors are very willing to listen to suggestions that are backed up with code .
So , what I have to say to the author is : nut up or shut up .
Lesson # 14 : Not everyone is your friend in this world .
" I 'll never be like my parents . "
Many youngsters must have said this at least once in their lives .
The truth emerges as soon as you have your own children : you increasingly become more like your own parents .
Dutch researcher Freek Bucx analysed data from more than a thousand young adults , their parents and partners .
Children make you more like your own parents , but a partner who does n't get on well with his or her ' in - laws ' can really sour the relationship between you and your parents .
Freek Bucx investigated the link between parents and children in the ' middle phase ' of the parent / child relationship .
The children were between 18 and 35 years of age and the parents were in the 50 to 75 years age bracket .
Bucx discovered that one of the most disruptive factors affecting the relationship between parents and children is the relationship between partners and in - laws .
If your partner does not get on well with your parents , there 's a significant chance of contact with your parents being weakened .
Fortunately , this is quite easy to resolve -- all you need to do is have your own child .
Living close to your parents
Bucx discovered that the parent / child relationship in this ' middle phase ' period is very strong .
For instance , children often end up living close to their parents .
But the relationship between parents and children is n't always plain sailing .
According to Bucx , changes in the children 's living situation is the main reason for this : they go and set up home on their own and spend more time with their partners than with their parents .
The relationship between parents and children deteriorates a bit during this period .
There is less contact with parents , less mutual support , and ideas about immediate and extended families start to drift apart .
As soon as young adults have their own children , however , the relationship gets stronger again .
There 's more contact , for example , often because the grandparents come round more often to help look after the children .
But it 's not just a matter of increased contact : similarities also increase between parents and children .
The results suggest that the birth of a child makes young adults think more like their parents about issues of divorce and marriage , and the allocation of household duties .
However , the relationship between parents and children also changes in another way : the emotional distance increases .
Family relationships :
The ties that bind Freek Bucx 's research is part of the NWO research programme ' Family relationships :
The ties that bind ' .
This research programme is about the social causes and consequences of changing family relationships ; it started in 2003 and was concluded on 12 November this year with the symposium on ' Families in Flux ' in Madurodam .
The research programme opened with an enormous data collection among no fewer than 10,000 indigenous Dutch nationals and 1350 Dutch people of Turkish , Moroccan , Antillean or Surinamese origin , between the ages of 18 and 80 .
This ' Netherlands Kinship Panel Study ' ( NKPS ) provides a valuable collection of data concerning relationships between partners , parents and children , brothers and sisters , the nuclear family and the wider family circle , and about living , employment and care .
Freek Bucx also used these data .
The NKPS will be used by hundreds of other researchers in the future for socio-scientific research .

However , in comments around the Bloggernacle , some of the faithful made it clear that having apostates hanging around is cramping their style .
( Note that this is not an invitation to respond to them in kind by dumping on the Bloggernacle . )
As much as I do n’t like this “ us - vs - them ” mentality within Mormonism , it makes sense for the non-TBM - Mormons to have a separate set of awards .
Our discussion on the Internet is big enough , vibrant enough , and diverse enough to have a wide range of writings and other creative endeavors that deserve recognition !
As in the William Law X - Mormon of the Year ( which we ’re still voting on ) , the “ X ” in X - Mormon is a variable that can stand for whatever you like , such as “ ex ” , “ post ” , “ former ” , “ cultural ” , “ New Order ” , etc .
Since a lot of the discussion takes place outside of blogspace , I ’ve contacted the admins of some forums and other sites in hopes of getting participation and nominations from their communities as well .
Since this is the first batch of “ Spawn of Brodie ” awards ever , we need suggestions on award categories as well as nominations for specific posts , threads , comments , pages , sites , etc .
You can start by looking at the Niblet categories for ideas , but do n’t be limited by them .
My opening suggestion is that we should have an award for “ best deconverstion story ” ( on changing your beliefs ) and a separate one for “ best exit story ” ( on actually leaving the fold and / or getting excommunicated ) .
But feel free to suggest anyone / anything that you think deserves positive recognition for online X - Mormon excellence !
For your consideration on this first day of 2010 , two charts : the 10 - year chart of the Dow Jones Industrial Average ( DJIA ) and a one - year chart of the VIX " fear index . "
( As always , please read the HUGE GIANT BIG FAT DISCLAIMER below to refresh your awareness that this is not investment advice but merely the freely offered musings of an amateur . )
In early December I ( along with many others ) noted the deteriorating conditions beneath the widely trumpeted " breakout to new highs " of the past few weeks : A Megaphone Announcing Extremes of Sentiment and Indecision ( December 3 , 2009 ) and Bearish Cross in NYSE Volume Suggests Rally Will Crumble ( December 4 , 2009 ) .
If we look at the past decade in the Dow , the steep V - shaped rebound is clearly visible .
This sure looks like a market which is absolutely convinced the U.S. economy is not just on the road to recovery but is already " burning rubber " and shifting into second gear .
Compare this classic V - shaped panic drop and surging euphoria with the choppy , 3 - year - long " slope of hope " decline exhibited during the 2000 - 2002 recession .
The disconnect between the reality of a disintegrating economy propped up solely by unprecedented Federal borrowing , spending , subsidies , giveaways , swag , guarantees , secret intervention in the markets , Fed purchase of Treasury bonds , Fed purchases of toxic - trash mortgage - backed securities , etc. etc. and the market 's euphoria about the " recovery " could not be sharper .
Beneath the " happy story " propaganda about the " recovery " :
1. employment is still falling
2. credit / lending is still declining
3. sales and income taxes are still in free - fall
4. commercial real estate is about to crash The Gathering Storm in Commercial Real Estate ( CRE ) ( October 21 , 2009 )
5. the residential housing market is totally dependent on Federal support of the mortgage market and tax - credit giveaways : The Final Demise of A Speculative Housing Bubble ( September 16 , 2009 )
These are just the highlights of a deteriorating economy propped up by unsustainable Federal stimulus and interventions .
The stock market has priced in a rapid rise in " real growth , " i.e. growth which is n't created by / totally dependent on Federal borrowing / largesse / guarantees .
By any historic measure , it is priced to perfection : the slightest wavering in the " sharp rebound in consumer spending , GDP and profits " story will call into question the 10 - month long 60 + % rally since early March , 2009 .
What is Mr. VIX saying about this euphoric confidence in a V - shaped recovery of the real economy ?
It seems Mr. VIX is like a nervous suitor , wavering in wild manic - depressive fashion between the absolute euphoria of " she loves me " ( the economy tanked , so a sharp rebound is guaranteed ! ) to the icy fear of " she loves me not " ( the economy is still imploding , lending has seized up , banks are actually insolvent , toxic assets are still priced at 100 % nominal valuation on the books , Federal borrowing is unsustainable , the consumer is retrenching , everyone is deleveraging , real estate is not reflating , the propaganda is n't taking , it 's only fueling populist rage , etc. ) .
This indecision is reflected in a giant megaphone pattern :
There is a rich trove of irony here : the megaphone pattern began at the very point that the economy was declared " out of recession . "
It seems Mr. Market is not quite as sure about that as the cheerleaders in the Fed , Treasury , White House and mainstream media .
Like Mr. VIX , Mr. Market wants to believe that the " recovery " is real , but all those nagging facts are triggering anxiety attacks in the VIX as punters rush to buy puts ( options ) as insurance against a sudden implosion of the " recovery " story .
If everything is truly peachy and stunningly robust growth is just around the corner , then the VIX should trend around 19 or 20 .
No need for insurance against a market implosion if the entire economy is fundamentally sound , secure , and low - risk .
On the other hand , this is also the perfect set - up for a spike in volatility and a " what goes up must come down " crash back to the March 2009 lows .
( A double - bottom / retest would be par for the course . )
A " story " built on lies , prevarications , extend - and - pretend accounting , Federal funding of everything under the sun , bogus statistics ( birth - death model of adding millions of phantom jobs , anyone ? ) and transparent propaganda can come apart with ferocious speed .
There are a lot of punters who are long and the exit is the size of a pet door .
Disclosure : I am short the market via puts , i.e. long the truth and short the propaganda .

( CNN ) -- Sometimes terrible movies -- the ones with such bad acting , dumb dialogue and cheesy special effects that they 're unintentionally hilarious -- are the ones we remember the most .
No genre is immune , but movies about technology -- ominous Web sites , evil hackers and so on -- seem to fail more often than not .
Maybe that 's because it's hard to dramatize someone sitting at a computer .
Maybe it 's because Hollywood does n't understand tech .
So that got us thinking about the worst tech movies ever made .
Not science fiction movies , with their planet - killing asteroids , journeys to the Earth 's center , and homicidal dinosaurs , but movies about the digital world .
Movies with technology that , even by Hollywood standards , is ridiculous .
For help , we enlisted some people who either know about movies or technology or both : Steven James Snyder , a film critic for Time magazine 's Techland ; Matt Atchity , the editor - in - chief of Rotten Tomatoes , the movie site ; and Sidney Perkowitz , a physicist at Emory University and the author of " Hollywood Science : Movies , Science and the end of the World . "
" There are good movies that have bad tech in them , " Atchity says .
" And then there are bad movies with bad tech . "
Read Steven
Snyder 's list of the best sci-fi movies of the decade
Bad movies , bad tech -- here 's our list , which is by no means comprehensive or definitive .
You probably have strong opinions about what movies should and should n't be on this list .
So , post your comments below and we just may include them in a future story .
Antitrust ( 2001 )
Ryan Phillippe is a computer whiz kid who 's hired by NURV , a software company led by a guy named Gary Winston ( played by Tim Robbins ) .
Winston has ambitions of constructing a giant communications system which will transform the world .
Winston -- a character who appears to be based on Microsoft 's Bill Gates -- turns out to be a ruthless man who'll " stop at nothing " to launch his project .
Milo learns the meaning behind the movie 's tag line : " A good idea can get you millions .
A great idea can get you killed . "
Despite the argument it makes about open source software , what earns the movie a spot on the list is the absurdist ends it takes the stereotype of the evil , massive tech corporation bent on destroying anyone in its path .
My favorite line in the movie , to quote Winston : " This business is binary .
You 're a one or a zero -- alive or dead . "
Feardotcom ( 2002 )
Four people in New York City die within 48 hours of visiting a Web site where a sadistic doctor , played by Stephen Rea , tortures women before killing them .
All four die of what they fear most :
One dies in a car wreck , another is swarmed by insects and so on .
Detective Mike Reilly ( Stephen Dorff ) and researcher Terry Holt ( Natascha McElhone ) are charged with tracking down the killer .
" Promise me one thing , that you wo n't visit the site , " Terry asks of Mike .
We all know he will .
And if the subtext of the dangers of Web voyeurism were n't blatant enough , all four victims are shown bleeding from the eyes .
" What could have been a pointed little chiller about the frightening seductiveness of new technology loses faith in its own viability and succumbs to joyless special - effects excess , " wrote Lisa Schwarzbaum of Entertainment Weekly .
The most absurd part of the whole movie ?
You'd think the movie 's Web site would be fear.com .
Nope .
It 's actually feardotcom.com .
Hackers ( 1995 )
The movie has become something of a cult classic since its release more than a decade ago .
Angelina Jolie is " Acid Burn " and Jonny Lee Miller is " Zero Cool " and they 're both hackers .
They and their friends come across an evil hacker , " The Plague " ( played by Fisher Stevens ) , who is skimming money off a faceless , multinational corporation .
He frames the kids , the kids fight back .
" There 's one decent thing about ' Hackers ' and that 's Angelina Jolie , " Athchity says .
" The rest of the movie is a nightmare . "
Independence Day ( 1996 )
Sure , this summer blockbuster starring Will Smith is pure popcorn fun .
It 's the ending that leaves some people scratching their head .
An alien race invades Earth and methodically begins destroying the planet .
The end seems imminent until Jeff Goldblum writes a computer virus that damages the alien ships and saves the day .
So , let 's get this straight :
An alien species whose technology seems centuries ahead of humankind , with ships whose shields render nuclear missiles ineffective , are vulnerable to a computer virus ?
" And you 're telling me this guy can suddenly decipher the programming minutiae of a completely alien life form that 's got an alien language ? "
Atchity says .
Of course , says one of my co-workers .
" It 's Jeff Goldblum , he 's a genius . "
Johnny Mnemonic ( 1995 )
It 's 2021 and Keanu Reeves is a data courier .
He carries the information -- 80G , enough to fill a few iPods -- in his head .
On his last job before retirement , he agrees to transport some vital information from Beijing to Newark .
The twist ?
The amount of data in this upload is too much for his head and he must download it before he dies .
And , of course , the bad guys want the information too .
" Keanu Reeves has too much information [ in his brain ] ? " wonders Atchity .
" That ca n't be possible . "
The movie also stars Henry Rollins , Ice - T , a dolphin ... and Dolph Lundgren as a born - again hit man who 's obsessed with Jesus .
" It is a disaster in every way , " wrote Caryn James in The New York Times ' review .
But honestly , I enjoyed this movie when I saw in the theater years ago .
And I still can't stop grinning about it .
The Lawnmower Man ( 1992 )
Based on a short story by Stephen King , this is one of the first movies about virtual reality .
The plot revolves around Jobe Smith , played by Jeff Fahey , who is an innocent , mentally challenged gardener .
A scientist ( Pierce Brosnan ) experiments on Jobe with intelligence - enhancing drugs and virtual reality to increase his mental ability .
It works , until it all goes wrong .
" It 's a legendarily bad film , " Atchity says .
" It was based on a Stephen King story , but the only thing it has in common is the title . "
Oh , and , there 's a sequel .
The Net ( 1995 )
Sandra Bullock is Angela Bennett , a computer expert who debugs software , orders pizza online and vacations with her laptop .
She 's sent a floppy disk -- remember those ?
-- with a program to examine and before you know it , she 's unwittingly exposed to a grand criminal conspiracy .
The bad guys , who want the disk back and who can apparently do anything they want ( like causing a plane crash ) , erase her identity and make her a fugitive .
" The absolute worst film ever about the Internet is the one whose brain trust could n't come up with a better title than ' The Net , ' " wrote Christopher Null in PC World Magazine last year .
Atchity sees the movie as a cautionary tale of sorts .
" If you do n't want your parents or grandparents on the Web , have them watch this movie and they 'll be terrified , " he says .
Swordfish ( 2001 )
John Travolta is a crook who wants to get his mitts on $ 9.5 billion locked away in a DEA account .
He brings in Hugh Jackman , an expert hacker down on his luck , to break in to the government 's computer .
The more entertaining scenes of the movie involve Jackman trying to figure out how to hack some computer or another .
" I think a lot of people would argue that watching someone sitting around programming a computer is really boring , " Atchity said .
But , Jackman is " drinking wine , and acting like he 's in some kind of concert or something . "
" This beat - the - clock set piece , tricked out with dazzling computerized bells and whistles , is one of the movie 's desperate attempts to transform the tedious task of computer hacking into a sexy activity , " the New York Times ' Stephen Holden wrote at the time .
" [ Jackman ] stirs up further excitement by dancing around like a mad cowboy to conjure up his brainstorms .
Who knew that typing could be so intense ?
Weird Science ( 1985 )
It 's difficult to put " Weird Science " on this list .
After all , it 's a 1980s film directed by John Hughes , which has a certain cachet .
It has Bill Paxton as obnoxious older brother Chet .
And I even watched the TV show based on the movie when it was on years ago .
But , really , two teen - aged boys using a computer to create the ideal babe ?
" Maybe computers still seemed somewhat magical back in 1985 , " Perkowitz says . " [ It 's ] the only way to explain how two dateless teen - aged boys , desperately trying to program a computer simulation of a woman , end up with Lisa , a living , breathing and totally beautiful creation with supernatural powers . "
OK , so " Weird Science " is n't that bad .
Maybe we 're simply being bitter that none of us ever managed to use our computer skills to create Kelly LeBrock .
The British mercenary Simon Mann today vowed to testify in court against Sir Mark Thatcher and the oil tycoon Eli Calil , the two men he alleges were co-conspirators in the failed attempt to take over Equatorial Guinea in 2004 .
Speaking as he flew back to Britain from the west African state , Mann made clear he had no intention of drawing a line under the episode , and would welcome a fresh inquiry that could lead to him giving evidence against his two old friends .
Mann warned Thatcher and Calil , who deny any involvement in the plot , that he will repeat in a British court the allegations he has made to Metropolitan police detectives and in front of a judge in Equatorial Guinea that they were both key players .
" As far as I 'm concerned , I am very anxious that Calil , Thatcher and one or two of the others should face justice , " Mann said .
" I am very happy to restate those things in court in the UK as a witness for the prosecution . "
He added he was " happy we did not succeed [ in the coup attempt ] in 2004 " .
After receiving a pardon on Tuesday from President Teodoro Obiang , the Old Etonian former army officer touched down at Luton airport in a private Falcon 900 jet at 1.32 pm yesterday with his brother Edward and sister Sarah .
He had served five and half years in jail , including just over a year of a 34 - year jail sentence in Black Beach prison in Malabo , the country 's capital .
Mann , 57 , was convicted of trying to take the oil - rich country by force as part of a coup plot in March 2004 .
Detectives from Scotland Yard 's counterterrorism command will interview Mann as part of an investigation into allegations that the failed plot was partly hatched in the UK .
A team of anti-terrorist officers have been investigating the claims since the end of Mann 's trial in July last year .
A small team of British detectives interviewed Mann in jail over three visits in 2008 in which Mann is understood to have co-operated fully .
A spokesman for Thatcher said he remained delighted at Mann 's release , despite the possibility Mann could now testify against him .
A court date might be some way off .
Anti-terrorist officers are working closely with the Crown Prosecution Service in what they say is an active criminal inquiry , but a decision on charges is not thought to be imminent and no one has been arrested or interviewed under caution as part of the investigation .
Mann 's homecoming at a cold Luton airport was a long way from the heavily guarded courtroom in a steamy equatorial city where he was sentenced in 2008 .
His plane taxied to a private hanger where he was met , out of public view , by officials before leaving by a side door to an unknown destination , possibly his £ 6 m mansion in the New Forest which he shares with his wife , Amanda .
In a statement , he said his return was " the most wonderful homecoming I could ever have imagined " .
" There has n't been a moment during the last five and a half years when I have not dreamt of one day being back in Britain with my family .
I 'm especially looking forward to meeting my son Arthur , who was born a few months after I left the country and whom consequently I have never seen .
" I am hugely grateful to President Obiang for releasing me .
It 's the best , best early Christmas present my family and I could ever have imagined .
As I know you will understand I have been away for five and a half tough years , much of it spent in solitary confinement .
I now need time to adjust and so I would ask that you respect my privacy and that of my family during this period . "
Mann has said he " felt like a guest … and not like a prisoner " at Black Beach and there were reports he dined on wine , chicken , steak and vegetables brought in from a nearby restaurant .
Niek du Toit , a South African who was also convicted of involvement in the coup attempt and was released alongside Mann with three others , claimed Mann was critical to the plot .
" If you get to Mann , you get to everything , " he told the South African Star newspaper , before flying back to South Africa .
" He was the key to everything … the only time I met any big players was when I met Thatcher , and that was when I met him for two hours to talk about helicopters he wanted for his business in Sudan .
Only when we got to Equatorial Guinea did I know exactly what his business opportunities were . "
Last night there was fresh speculation about why the plotters have been released now .
Du Toit said it was to coincide with the visit by the South African president , Jacob Zuma , and he had been told , " Zuma and his government were involved in the negotiations for our release " .
The four mercenaries who were released on Tuesday have been told they can never return to Equatorial Guinea .
Henry Bellingham , the Conservative shadow justice minister and a friend of Mann who campaigned for his release , said the Equatorial Guinea government appeared keen to rebuild international relations in order to secure markets for its reserves of oil and gas and that " Simon Mann was becoming an embarrassment to the government " .
Mann 's return to the UK is likely to spark a bidding war for his story .
Besides newspaper interview rights , publishers said Mann 's memoir , which is likely to read in parts like Frederick Forsyth 's novel The Dogs of War , could attract an advance of up £ 250,000 .
One cautioned that to attract such a sum Mann must reinvent himself in the public eye as an " officer class Andy McNab " to attract readers who may otherwise be squeamish about his mercenary past .
Sir Mark
Thatcher :
The unanswered questions
The meeting in London
Mann has claimed he met Thatcher and Lebanese - born oil tycoon Ely Calil at Calil 's London home in May 2003 prior to the coup .
This meeting is likely to be central to any potential prosecution by British authorities .
Thatcher could explain what happened at this meeting and whether the coup was discussed , as Mann claims .
Calil has strongly denied being a coup plotter .
The money
Thatcher said he thought the money he provided to Mann was to be used to buy an air ambulance rather than for a coup .
Mann has said
Thatcher knew what his funds were being used for and that Thatcher was " part of the management team " .
Mann has also said he was at a meeting with Thatcher where they discussed how to run Equitorial Guinea after the coup .
The middleman
What was Thatcher 's relationship with Niek Du Toit , a convicted co-conspirator ?
South African Du
Toit said he met Thatcher in South Africa before the failed coup attempt to discuss the sale of helicopters for use in Sudan , where Du Toit said Thatcher had interests .

UPDATE 1/12 : Conan O'Brien vetoes NBC 's move of " Tonight Show " : " I cannot participate in what I honestly believe is its destruction "
UPDATE 1/11 : NBC finally listens to affiliates it bullied into primetime experiment , moving Jay Leno back to late night ; Conan O'Brien weighs options
Johnny Carson routinely turned missteps to his advantage with uncommon grace and skill , becoming an enduring icon of late - night TV on NBC's " The Tonight Show " partly because of what Dennis Miller has described as a " Houdini - like ability to extricate ( himself ) from the bad joke . "
Carson 's gone , but they 're still making mistakes at NBC , especially around " Tonight , " and only making a bad joke worse .
First in trying to keep Conan O'Brien from leaving , then in trying to keep Jay Leno from leaving and now in trying to keep affiliates burned by those first two moves from open rebellion , Carson 's old network has found it can't wriggle out of its straitjacket .
Forget about the shackles , the locked trunk and swimming to the surface .

The drug was first isolated from a parasitic mushroom Scientists have discovered how a promising cancer drug , first discovered in a wild mushroom , works .
The University of Nottingham team believe their work could help make the drug more effective , and useful for treating a wider range of cancers .
Cordycepin , commonly used in Chinese medicine , was originally extracted from a rare kind of parasitic mushroom that grows on caterpillars .
The study will appear in the Journal of Biological Chemistry .
The cordyceps mushroom has been studied by medical researchers for some time - the first scientific publication on cordycepin was in 1950 .
However , although the drug showed great promise , it was quickly degraded in the body .
It can be given with another drug to combat this - but the second drug can produce side effects that limit its potential use .
As a result , researchers turned their interest to other potential candidate drugs , and exactly how cordycepin worked on the body 's cells remained unclear .
It could lay the groundwork for the design of new cancer drugs that work on the same principle
Dr Cornelia de Moor
University of Nottingham Researcher Dr Cornelia de Moor said : " Our discovery will open up the possibility of investigating the range of different cancers that could be treated with cordycepin .
" It will be possible to predict what types of cancers might be sensitive and what other cancer drugs it may effectively combine with .
" It could also lay the groundwork for the design of new cancer drugs that work on the same principle . "
The researchers have also developed a method to test how effective the drug is in new preparations , and combinations with other drugs , which might solve the problem of degradation more satisfactorily .
Dr De Moor said : " This is a great advantage as it will allow us to rule out any non-runners before anyone considers testing them in animals . "
The Nottingham team observed two effects on the cells - at a low dose cordycepin inhibits the uncontrolled growth and division of the cells , and at high doses it stops cells from sticking together , which also inhibits growth .
The knowledge generated by this research demonstrates the mechanisms of drug action and could have an impact on one of the most important challenges to health
Professor Janet Allen
Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council
Both of these effects probably have the same underlying mechanism - that cordycepin interferes with how cells make proteins .
At low doses cordycepin interferes with the production of mRNA , the molecule that gives instructions on how to assemble a protein .
And at higher doses it has a direct impact on the making of proteins .
Professor Janet Allen is director of research at the Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council , which funded the study .
She said : " This project shows that we can always return to asking questions about the fundamental biology of something in order to refine the solution or resolve unanswered questions .
" The knowledge generated by this research demonstrates the mechanisms of drug action and could have an impact on one of the most important challenges to health . "

Just wanted to let you know that my husband , son , and I have loved the recipes !
They have been simple to prepare and delicious …
I especially like the ease of planning …. printing the menu and grocery list has been a lifesaver !
Roll it into your apartment and show off to the world !
The apartment units at Creer Ukimafunado are not for Bugaboo strollers , they are for Hondas , Ducatis , Harleys , and BMWs .

Sandra Gregory had gone back to Thailand to " tie up loose ends "
Sandra Gregory , the Briton jailed in Thailand for drug smuggling , has been held at Bangkok airport after trying to enter the country , the BBC understands .
She was pardoned by the King of Thailand in 2000 after initially being sentenced to death in 1993 .
The 44 - year - old , of West Yorkshire , has texted friends in the UK to say she was refused entry to Thailand , despite having a valid visa .
She told them she expects to be deported within 48 hours .
In a text message she said : " I have n't eaten or slept for days .
They 're telling me I do n't get to choose . "
' Deeply regretted '
Gregory , of Sowerby Bridge , was caught with 86.9g of heroin inside a condom in her body at Bangkok airport in 1993 .
The initial death sentence was commuted to 25 years imprisonment after she admitted the charge .
She spent four - and - a- half years in the notorious Klong Prem Prison - nicknamed the Bangkok Hilton - where she had been held in a room with 80 other women , before being transferred to a jail in Kent .
After receiving the royal pardon , she went on to gain a 2:1 honours degree in geography from Oxford University .
Friends said Gregory had gone back to Thailand to " tie up loose ends " .
Friend Susan
May said : " She said she loves the country despite everything that happened , and she deeply regretted what she did .
" She wanted to go back to visit friends she made in the jail and lay some ghosts to rest . "
The British Foreign and Commonwealth Office was unable to confirm any details .
BERLIN ( JTA ) —
A mainstream Swiss political leader is calling for a ban on separate Muslim and Jewish cemeteries .
Christophe Darbellay , president of the Christian Democratic People ’s Party of Switzerland , made the statement in a television interview Tuesday , two days after Swiss voters passed an initiative to ban minarets .
The anti-minaret initiative came from the opposition ultra-conservative Swiss People ’s Party and other right - wing political organizations .
Critics say Darbellay is starting a " crusade " to attract voters by proposing similarly xenophobic measures .
Mainstream politicians and religious leaders across Europe have reacted with dismay to the anti-minaret vote .
According to the Swiss online daily Tagesanzeiger , Darbellay also wants to ban the wearing of burkas , head - to - toe veils worn by some fundamentalist Muslim women .
Darbellay reportedly said that existing cemeteries would not be affected by a ban , but that there should be no separate cemeteries in the future .
The Swiss People ’s Party called for crackdowns on expressions of Muslim fundamentalism in 2006 .
Observers said the demand for separate cemeteries is an escalation .
Take a close look at your Christmas tree – it has seven times more genetic material ( DNA ) than you do !
Why this is so is still largely unknown , but now the DNA of the spruce is going to be mapped by Swedish researchers from Umeå Plant Science Center ( a collaboration between the Swedish University of Agricultural Sciences ( SLU ) and Umeå University ) , the Royal Institute of Technology ( KTH ) , and the Karolinska Institute ( KI ) , with the aid of a SEK 75 million grant from the Knut and Alice Wallenberg Foundation .
Coniferous trees have dominated major parts of the earth for hundreds of millions of years .
When primitive batrachians crawled around Carbon Age forests , they were surrounded by conifers .
Conifers survived the geological disaster 250 million years ago that paved the way for the age of the dinosaurs .
When the impact of a meteorite wiped out the dinosaurs , conifers lived on .
Today conifers dominate major regions of the earth – the combined weight of all the people on earth is less than that of the conifers in Jämtland County in central Sweden .
Apparently conifers managed as early as 300 million years ago to create an extremely successful genetic make - up that has allowed them to dominate the globe , but what does it look like ?
All conifers have twelve chromosomes , but they are extremely large : a cell from a spruce or pine has seven times as much DNA as a human cell does .
Why do conifers have so much DNA ?
Does it have to do with their having thrived for millions of years on earth , and do they really have more genes than you and I , or are their genes simply more ‘ diluted ’ ?
This is not known , but their enormous amount of DNA has entailed that scientists have not dared to tackle a mapping of the complete genome of coniferous trees .
Now a Swedish research team , consisting of scientists from Umeå Plant Science Center ( UPSC ) , a research center that is run jointly by Umeå University and SLU , and from KTH and KI , both in Stockholm , will finally be addressing this huge challenge with the aid of a grant of SEK 75 million from the Knut and Alice Wallenberg Foundation .
The spruce is Sweden ’s ecologically and economically most important plant .
Spruce dominates the forests of southern and central Sweden and is the most important raw material for the Swedish forestry industry .
“ The genetics of the spruce are truly exciting , ” says the project director , Professor Pär Ingvarsson at UPSC .
“ Genetically , trees differ tremendously from each other , and while Swedish forest genetics has always been prominent , this constitutes a giant step forward in the work to achieve tree nursery material that is adapted to the very different conditions that prevail in our country , above all in the time of climate change we are facing . ”
“ The fact that the Swedish spruce will be the first conifer to have its genome mapped is extremely important to both Swedish forestry research and the forestry industry , ” says Professor Ove Nilsson at UPSC , who chairs the project ’s steering group .
“ A complete mapping of the genes of the spruce will revolutionize Swedish tree research and enable us to make more efficient use of wood raw material . ”
“ For example , it will provide us with the possibility of developing genetic tests for the various properties of trees , such as the fuel value of the wood , or the trees ’ frost resistance and resistance to diseases , just as the mapping of the human genome has made this possible in medicine , ” says Stefan Jansson , a professor at UPSC .
These scientists are now able to take on this challenge largely because DNA sequencing technology has been developed so extremely rapidly .
“ It would have been impossible to tackle this project just a couple of years ago , ” says Professor Joakim Lundeberg , KTH .
The government ’s major allocation to the Science for Life Laboratory , which is slated to be northern Europe ’s largest center for genome research , gives us access to this equipment , and the spruce project will be the Laboratory ’s first flagship project .
“ Many other Swedish scientists will benefit from this project , so the eventual aggregate impact will be huge , ” says Jan Stenlid , a professor at SLU in Uppsala .
“ For instance , we will have an entirely new capacity to understand and thereby combat two major scourges for Swedish forestry , root rot and the pine weevil . ”
The project is projected to take four to five years , and besides the eight Swedish researchers – Björn Andersson , KI , Rishikesh Bhalerao , UPSC , Rosario Garcia Gil , UPSC , Pär Ingvarsson , UPSC , Stefan Jansson , UPSC , Joakim Lundeberg , KTH , Ove Nilsson , UPSC , and Björn Sundberg , UPSC – Canadian , Italian , and Belgian researchers will contribute to the project , which , as far we know , is the largest project in the world to tackle the species that has the largest DNA .
By now , you know the details of Google 's first Google - branded , Google - sold " superphone , " the Nexus One : huge AMOLED touchscreen , thin - and - light form factor , available unlocked or on T - Mobile , pervasive voice input , etc .
And many have already reached for the easiest narrative in which to fit Google 's announcement : the Nexus One is Google 's attempt at an iPhone - killer .
But regardless of the simple conflict stories that the Nexus One announcement evokes , the reaction on Twitter and the comment thread for our liveblog show that the tech - savvy public already understands that the Nexus One is just another Android phone — the latest and greatest Android phone , and possibly even the latest and greatest smartphone — but an Android phone nonetheless .
The Nexus One may or may not be an iPhone killer ( it probably is n't ) , but it does n't matter , because the Nexus One was arguably the least significant thing that Google announced today .
The real news at Google 's event this morning — news that could shake up the mobile industry just as thoroughly as the original iPhone announcement — was n't a phone at all , but a URL : http://google.com/phone.
An online storefront that , if successful , could knock one of the major pillars out the current , much - reviled US carrier model and result in faster , cheaper , more flexible service for mobile users .
Here 's how it works .
Divide and conquer
Google has confirmed that Nexus One , and all subsequent Google phones sold via the company 's online store , will be available unlocked for use on every participating carrier .
If a particular Google - branded phone is not on a particular carrier , then that 's only because that phone does n't have the proper radio to support its network .
In addition to being unlocked , the phones will also have bundled plan options where the pricing and details are up to the carrier , but every carrier will offer a plan for every phone that 's radio compatible .
By offering a lineup of phones that is essentially carrier - independent ( with the radio compatibility caveat ) , Google has separated the two previously interlocked parts of the phone / plan - buying experience — phone selection and carrier selection — and has done so in a way that threatens one of the most important enablers of carrier lock - in .
In short , what Google announced today was n't just the Nexus One , but America 's first carrier - independent smartphone store ; the Google store is now the only smartphone store in the US where , for every phone on offer , you first pick which phone you want , and then you pick a network and a plan on that network , choosing from among every network on the platform .
So you can comparison shop among networks based purely on plan price and network quality , because you already have your phone picked out .
You can be sure that carriers are n't thrilled about giving up phone - based lock - in , so it 's a little surprising to see them going along for the ride .
If customers turn en masse to Google 's online store the way they did to Apple 's iPhone a few years ago , then even more networks will be forced to either sign on or lose out .
And once they 're on Google 's platform , they 'll be forced to compete purely on the kinds of things that consumers actually want them to compete on , namely , price and quality .
And when networks compete on price and quality , prices will go down and quality will go up .
Aligning incentives , and the iPhone curse
To understand just how big of an impact Google 's store could have on wireless in the US , take a moment to think about economic incentives for carriers under the current regime .
Right now , with specific phone models available only on specific carriers , consumers must pick a carrier and phone combination .
Many consumers actually pick a phone first , and then pick their carrier based on it ( witness the mass customer defection to AT&T when the iPhone was announced ) .
If you want to keep using that phone , you have to keep using that carrier .
If you want to switch phones without incurring a huge early termination fee ( ETF ) , then you 're limited to the selection that your carrier offers in your area .
This is bad for consumers , but it 's great for carriers .
Carriers do n't have to compete solely on network quality ; rather , they compete based on a combination of network quality and phone selection .
And because they compete partly ( mostly ? ) on phone selection , their incentives are twofold :
They want to offer the largest number of attractive , leading - edge phones in order to attract a user base , and They want to wring the most money out of that user base for the lowest possible cost .
Incentive number 2 is why wireless networks have performance issues , and why AT&T 's network gets more complaints than all others .
Call it the " iPhone curse , " after the " resource curse " that seems to leave oil - rich nations mired in petty tyranny .
Because AT&T has ensnared — and locked in —legions of consumers with the iPhone , the company 's incentive is to minimize their infrastructure spending so that they can maximize per-user profits .
AT&T also has a motive to nickel - and - dime you to death , because it has you locked in with that amazing phone and its accompanying ETF .
In sum , as long as Apple 's red - hot iPhone keeps new customers coming to AT&T and keeps existing customers around in spite of the poor service quality , the carrier has little incentive to actually improve its network , and every incentive to cram as many iPhone users as possible onto each cell tower .
If Google 's carrier - independent store succeeds spectacularly , it could break the curse .
If the idea behind it succeeds , that could break the curse as well .
Would n't it be great if Apple ran a similarly carrier - independent iPhone store , or Nokia did the same with its smartphone lineup ?
I , for one , want to live in a world where a carrier competes for my business by being cheaper and faster than the next guy , and not because it has a phone I want .
That 's why I 'm rooting for Google 's store idea to catch on , regardless of what the Nexus One kills or does n't kill .

In today 's newspapers and magazines :
" Newborns cry in their native language " .
" Babies cry with an accent within the first week of life " .
" Babies cry wiith the same ' prosody ' or melody used in their native language by the second day of life " .
" Newborn babies mimic the intonation of their native tongue when they cry " .
" French babies cry in French , German babies cry in German and , no doubt , the wail of an English infant betrays the distinct tones of a soon - to - be English speaker " .
The science behind these statements is in a paper released yesterday : Birgit Mampe , Angela D. Friederici , Anne Christophe and Kathleen Wermke , " Newborns ' Cry Melody Is Shaped by Their Native Language " , Current Biology , in press .
Does it support these journalistic generalizations ?
Before reading the paper , I give ten - to - one odds against , on the general principle that journalistic statements involving generic plurals are almost never true .
Mesdames et messieurs , faites vos jeux .
Let 's spin the wheel .
Mampe et al. recorded and analyzed the crying of 30 French babies ( 11 female , 19 male ; mean age 3.1 days , range 2 – 5 days ) and 30 German babies ( 15 female , 15 male ; mean age 3.8 days , range 3 – 5 days ) .
They recorded 2500 cries , of which they selected 1254 " simple cries containing single rising - and - then - falling melody arcs " — an average of 21 per French baby , range 3 – 54 ; an average of 18 per German baby , range 10 –38 .
Cries of the type selected had pitch contours that the authors schematize like this :
They found the location of the pitch peak in each cry , and expressed it in terms of normalized time , where the overall duration of the cry is set to 1 ; and the same analysis was performed for amplitude .
It was by no means true that French babies cried in one consistent way , and German babies in another .
As the experimenters write :
Only simple cries containing single rising - and - then - falling melody arcs were analyzed .
These cry types were selected because they predominate in the crying of healthy newborns .
These melody arcs can be assigned to four basic melody types : ( 1 ) quickly rising and slowly decreasing melody : left - accentuated type — “ falling contour ” ; ( 2 ) slowly rising and quickly decreasing melody : right - accentuated type — “ rising contour ” ; ( 3 ) symmetrical rising - and - then - falling melody : symmetric type ; and ( 4 ) a relatively stable fundamental frequency with a rising or falling trend : plateau type . [… ]
Newborns of both groups generated all four basic melody types typical at that age .
This observation reflects a general aptitude for generating melodies with varying contours and explains the observed partial data overlap in Figure 1 .
They do n't actually give the proportions of French and German cries in their four categories , but they do quantify their results as follows :
[ A ] marked difference in the median values of t norm ( F0max ) points to group - specific preferences for produced melody contours ( French group , 0.60 s ; German group , 0.45 s ) .
The arithmetic means of t norm ( F0max ) were significantly different in French ( 0.58 ± 0.13 s ) and German ( 0.44 ± 0.15 s ) newborns ( Mann - Whitney test , p < 0.0001 ) .
Whereas French newborns preferred to produce rising melody contours , German newborns more often produced falling contours .
These results show a tendency for infants to utter melody contours similar to those perceived prenatally .
A significant difference was also found for the intensity maxima of melody arcs [ t norm ( Imax ) : mean 0.59 ± 0.12 versus 0.47 ± 0.12 for French group versus German group ; Mann - Whitney test , p < 0.001 ] .
Regular readers of Language Log , and other sensible people , will now be estimating the effect size — and this is a fairly large one .
A difference of 0.58 - 0.44 = 0.14 in time - normalized F0 peak location , with a pooled standard deviation of 0.14 , is an effect size of d = 1.0 .
That is , the mean values for the two groups are separated by one standard deviation .
And the same is true for the difference in mean amplitude peak locations .
Despite this large and impressive difference , the authors indulge in a bit of rhetorical exaggeration by presenting the following picture of " typical " French and German cries :
The F0 peak of the " typical " German cry is at about 0.25 , seconds in a vocalization whose expiration phase lasts about 0.95 seconds , for a normalized peak time of about 0.26 .
This is more than a standard deviation below the reported German mean value of 0.44 , and thus is hardly " typical " .
The F0 peak of the French cry is at 0.68 seconds , in a cry whose expiration lasts about 0.9 seconds , for a normalized time of about 0.75 .
Again , this is more than a standard deviation greater than the French average of 0.58 .
This technique of cherry - picking atypical " typical " values for rhetorical effect is fairly common in scientific writing , but it should alert us to the fact that the authors are perhaps not trying quite as hard as they should to disprove their own hypothesis .
Though I 'd bet that their findings are basically valid , there are a few reasons to wonder whether equally large differences would be found in a replication .
For one thing , the babies were recorded in different places , apparently under different circumstances , by different experimenters .
Specifically , the French babies were recorded in the Cochin Hospital in Paris .
The authors write that " For the German newborns , existing digital sound files of cries that were recorded as part of the German Language Development Study ( http://glad-study.cbs.mpg.de) were used " , but they do n't say whether these were also hospital recordings or were recorded at home .
( So it 's possible that the headlines should have read " Babies in hospital cry differently from babies at home " … )
In any case , the German recordings were apparently made by a different set of people .
Given the procedures described in the paper , there are also several ways that unconscious experimenter bias might creep into the analysis phase .
The process of choosing roughly half of the recorded cries as suitable for analysis is one place that this might happen .
In doing this sort of selection , there are always a lot of marginal cases , where the decision as to whether an observation fits the criterion ( here , whether the cry is a " single rising - and - then - falling melody arc " ) could go either way .
These marginal cases can be influenced by the experimenter 's perception that a particular exemplar is " typical " or " not typical " of expected patterns .
And another place where experimenter expectations could affect the data is in marking the time - pints of amplitude and pitch maxima .
This was apparently done by hand on narrow - band spectrograms , and again was apparently not done " blind " — that is , the experimenters knew whether they were coding French babies or German babies .
And again , there would have been many cases with flat - topped peaks , or with multiple peaks , where choosing the location of the maximum point would have been a somewhat ambiguous task .
Finally , the choice about where the cry begins and ( especially ends ) is often ambiguous , and the national difference in mean F0 - peak location was only about 140 milliseconds .
As a matter of intellectual hygiene , it 's a good idea either to make all such decisions " blind " to the independent variables of interest , or else to use automated techniques of measurement with parameters chosen before the data is analyzed .
( It 's a good idea to publish the data as well , but that 's another story . )
So let 's sum up .
This is a really interesting and suggestive study , which needs to be replicated to be entirely convincing .
It finds a fairly large difference in the distribution of pitch and amplitude profiles of French and German neonates , with the French babies tending to produce cries with later peaks that the German babies .
The effect size in the reported data is a large one ( d=1.0 ) , which is large enough that ( if the estimates generalize to new data ) a randomly selected French or German baby would be correctly classified as French or German , on the basis of one cry , about 2/3 of the time .
The authors attribute this difference to the typical differences between French and German intonation patterns , through exposure in the womb .
It 's certainly true that the proportion of final rises in French speech is much greater than in German .
But French non-terminal intonational patterns — the ones that generally involve final rises — are not at all like the pitch contour of the " typical " French neonate shown in this paper .
The adult phrases will typically involve a large rise on the first or second syllable — to a peak that will often be the highest point in the phrase — with a subsequent fall and then a rise at the very end of the very last syllable , so that there is no final fall .
( Today 's breakfast hour is over for me , but I promise to give more information on this question within the next few days . )
So if the differences in this experiment 's data are caused by pre-natal experience with adult intonations , the explanation must be a somewhat indirect one .
And it 's not clear to me why the authors reject without explicit consideration the hypothesis that the babies were responding to a few days of French vs. German " motherese " .
Oh , and the journalistic generalizations were false as an expression of the authors ' findings .
Of course .

On Friday Dec 4,2009 the ladies of The View on their “ Hot Topics ” segment were discussing how because of the passing of Proposition 8 , a measure that banned gay marriage in California , is trying to submit into next year ’s polls a proposition banning divorce .
This act , as they said , has brought negative opinions from both the left and the right .
The ladies , led by Whoopi Goldberg , instead of exploring the real issue here , which was a minority civil rights , instead started exploring that marriage needs divorce so everyone can have a “ way out . ”
Joy Behar , a gay marriage supporter , was very vocal about this , leaving Elizabeth Hasselbeck and Sherri Shepherd , a divorced woman herself , against it .
Joy argued that you need a way out , otherwise one spouse would kill the other just to get out of said marriage .
The arguments back and forth were – as you would expect – silly , however , Sherri ( to my surprise ) said something insightful ( and I ’ll paraphrase ) : “ If you go into marriage with a way out , you will never work on your marriage so it can last . ”
When the topic starts as a gay marriage / civil rights / equality debate instead of debating pros or cons for / against gay marriage , the ladies - unwillingly - discuss how heterosexual couples actually regard the “ sanctity of marriage . ”
The ladies were discussing marriage as a college course that if you do n’t like you can drop .
As a shirt that if it does n’t fit you can return .
Marriage is not a decision which should be taken lightly and thinking there ’s “ a way out . ”
Marriage is a commitment .
When you commit to someone , you say vows , vows that just like in a contract you should honor – for better or for worse .
It took actress Portia Di Rossi , to teach the ladies that marriage is not hard - work and reminded them that gay marriage is a civil rights issue not a religious one .
She also taught Elizabeth Hasselback that the word “ marriage , ” really has a value not only for the gay community , but for everyone .
( Watch what Portia Di Rossi said below ) .
How can the gay community leave the fate of their rights up on the hands of people who do n’t respect marriage themselves ?

Former criminal justice professor acquitted of sex abuse
Posted : Wednesday , March 21 , 2012 7:04 pm
Matt Elofson
A Houston County jury found a former Dothan criminal justice professor not guilty of molesting one of his students .
Attorney Billy Joe Sheffield II said his client Ronald Phillip Bae , 65 , of Cottonwood , was acquitted of his felony first - degree sex abuse charge .
Sheffield said the jury deliberated less than 20 minutes before returning their verdict late Wednesday afternoon in front of Circuit Court Judge Kevin Moulton .
Dothan police arrested Bae on Nov. 4 , 2009 , less than a week after the alleged sex offense happened .
Police charged him with felony first - degree sex abuse of a 21 - year - old female student at Troy University Dothan where he formerly worked as a professor .
Sheffield said Bae retired after the accusation came out .
Bae had worked at the university for more than 20 years .
Attorney John
White also represented Bae at trial .
Police said the alleged crime happened at Baes business , Bae Polygraph & Hypnosis Center , located on North Oates Street near downtown Dothan .
Court records show the offense is alleged to have happened on Oct. 29 , 2009 .
If convicted of the class C felony charge of first - degree sex abuse , Bae faced one to 10 years in prison .
Court records show Bae was also charged with misdemeanor harassment in 2006 , during which a woman alleged he had inappropriately touched her .
White represented him on that charge , and he was later acquitted of that charge .
Sheffield said he questioned the alleged victims timing in reporting the offense to the police , and why she waited four days to report it .
 He performed a polygraph test on her , but all the accusations she said were unfounded ,  Sheffield said .
 She indicated Dr. Bae told her to take off her shirt , but our witness that was in the office said that never occurred . 
Sheffield said after his client was acquitted of a similar offense several years earlier his client started a policy to never do a polygraph test at his office alone .
Sheffield said his clients wife was supposed to be there that day in 2009 , but instead the parent of another student was there in another nearby room .
Sheffield said his client planned to reopen his polygraph business in Dothan .
 When you re running a business its always best to have a witness there to protect you .
In this case its her word against his except for the fact Dr. Bae had somebody else in the office ,  Sheffield said .
 Were a hundred percent in agreement with the verdict , and were just glad its all over with . 
Assistant Houston County District Attorney Patrick Amason questioned why Bae didnt do the polygraph test at the school where there would be more people around .
 This is a student teacher relationship .
She trusted him and he was her instructor .
Theres no evidence whatsoever she fabricated her story ,  Amason said .
 The defense pulls out a magic witness two and a half years later that now claims he was there when this happened , yet he never went to the police . 
Amason said these types of cases are very  tough because its often the victims word against the defendants word .
 It came down to the fact this girl stood up for what was right .
She had the courage to stand up and do whats right and follow it through all the way to court with the hope they would hear her story so this wouldnt happen to anybody else ,  Amason said .
 Unfortunately the jury didnt see it that way .
Shes very upset about the outcome , but she understands how the judicial system works .
She can hold her head up high knowing she did the right thing by coming forward . 

MIT boffins this week have taken the wraps off a new kind of nuclear fusion reactor , different from the humdrum tokamaks and laser - ignition chambers which have thus far offered such disappointing results .
The new kit is called the Levitated Dipole Experiment ( LDX ) , and features a half - ton magnetic doughnut suspended in midair by super powerful force fields .
The underlying principles were discovered by observing the behaviour of space plasma interacting with the magnetic fields of planets such as Jupiter .
Most Reg readers will be familiar with the idea of fusion reactors , intended to replace today 's nuclear fission powerplants .
Rather than splitting heavy atoms to release energy , fusion machines would instead fuse light ones together - the same process which powers the sun and stars .
This would have major advantages : less radioactive waste and abundant fuel - the necessary isotopes could easily be obtained from sea water , by contrast with scarce and troublesome uranium .
And the hysterical levels of security which surround fissionable fuels would be unnecessary , as fusion juice can't be made into an atomic bomb * .
On the day that working fusion reactors are developed , the world 's energy problems are largely over : the non-fossil ( low carbon ) all - electric future can actually be delivered with the whole human race living at Western levels of luxury .
So much has been known for many decades , however .
Despite much experimentation , a fusion reactor able to put out more energy than it consumes to run itself seems almost as far off as it did to start with .
Most research thus far has focused on " tokamaks " - toroidal chambers intended to crush and heat a ring of plasma to fusion conditions using magnetic fields - and laser ignition , where a pellet of fuel is almost instantaneously brought to fusion by high powered laser blasts coming from all around it .
But now boffins at MIT and Columbia University have built the LDX , which seeks to exploit the phenomenon of " turbulent pinching " seen in space plasmas interacting with the magnetic fields of Earth and Jupiter .
This has never been recreated in the lab .
The LDX 's hovering dipole , made of superconducting coils housed inside a steel container , " flies " inside the larger chamber in which the experiment 's plasma is held .
It 's intended to use " turbulent pinch " effects to squeeze superhot 10,000,000 °C deuterium until it begins fusing into helium .
Deuterium is more common than the tritium needed for more commonly - researched reactions , which could be a useful feature if the machine can achieve positive power output .
For now , the dipole must draw its million - amp current from external sources .
According to Jay Kesner , MIT 's LDX honcho , the difference between his baby and a regular tokamak is simple : with the tokamak the plasma is inside the magnet , whereas in the LDX the magnet is inside the plasma .
“ It ’s the first experiment of its kind , ” he says , and “ could produce an alternative path to fusion , " though he cautions that other methods are likely to be operational sooner .
Kesner sees the floating - dipole reactor as " second generation " kit , though even the first generation has yet to materialise thus far .
Kesner and allied boffins have just published a paper on LDX fusion in Nature Physics , here ( subscription required ) . ®
Bootnote
* Admittedly fusion fuel is one ingredient for building an H - bomb , but you can only make one of those if you already have a working fission nuke to use as the trigger .
Mark Anderson is the writer behind the Strategic News Service , a predictive newsletter with a wide following among technology executives and venture capitalists , which he publishes from the island redoubt of Friday Harbor , Wash .
And each December , he comes to New York , hosts a dinner and delivers a set of forecasts for the coming year .
Kimberly White / Reuters
The dinner was at the Waldorf - Astoria on Thursday night , but I caught up with Mr. Anderson earlier for a preview of his after - dinner performance .
One of his predictions , in particular , caught my attention .
“ Except for gaming , it is ‘ game over ’ for Microsoft in the consumer market , ” he said .
“ It ’s time to declare Microsoft a loser in phones .
Just get out of Dodge . ”
Regardless of Microsoft ’s performance , amid the rise of Apple ‘s iPhone and phones using Google ‘s Android software , it seems unlikely Microsoft will heed Mr. Anderson ’s advice .
The smartphone is becoming the innovative hub of software development and applications , far more so than the personal computer .
If Microsoft loses in smartphones , Mr. Anderson noted , “ It is pretty grim .
Those applications are going to move upstream . ”
The underlying problem , Mr. Anderson said , is cultural .
“ Phones are consumer items , and Microsoft does n’t have consumer DNA , ” he said .
“ Walk the halls at Microsoft and you can see it is not a place that gets consumers , ” Mr. Anderson said .
“ Just as if you walk the halls at Google , it ’s obvious it is not a place that gets the enterprise world . ”
Unlike many , Mr. Anderson does not see cloud computing as a unifying force that would make consumer and business technology increasingly similar .
“ The computer world is splitting apart , into two separate continents , consumer and enterprise , ” he said .
In the consumer camp are Apple , Google and most of the Asian hardware makers , Mr. Anderson said .
In the enterprise camp ( large companies and government agencies ) will reside I.B.M. , Dell , Cisco and Microsoft .
Hewlett - Packard , he said , will straddle both worlds .

How complicated really is it to understand why the US does n’t belong in Afghanistan ?
We invaded the country illegally after 9/11 , supposedly in search of Osama bin Laden .
Eight years later we have n’t found him .
David Ray Griffin , America ’s leading scholar on 9/11 has written a book , Osama Bin Laden – Dead or Alive , which presents a great deal of factual proof that Osama died at the end of December , 2001 in Pakistan and was buried there in an unmarked grave , according to Muslim tradition .
Theoretically that should collapse our entire reason for being there .
Yet we are still there .
Obama should be booed off the stage with his slick political patois : give them anything but promise them change .
And of all sources , Israel ’s daily HAARETZ.com , ran an article , Senate report : US decided to let bin Laden slip through their fingers .
Well swell .
I could have told you so .
It was in the mountains of Tora Bora where “ Osama bin Laden was unquestionably with reach of US troops … when American military leaders made the crucial and costly decision not to pursue the terrorist leader ( itals mine ) with massive force , a Senate report reveals . ”
This was in late December 2001 , according to the report , “ when he was at his most vulnerable . ”
Yes , he was sick unto dying .
But the Senate ’s spin on it is that “ Bin Laden ’s escape laid the foundation for today ’s reinvigorated Afghan and inflamed the internal strike now endangering Pakistan . ”
No , dear Senators , it was the unmerited attack on Afghanistan to “ smoke him out , ” i.e. , “ bomb Afghanistan back into the stone - age ” that angered Afghans , and the pressure we put on Pakistan to cooperate with the US via deposed puppet President , General Musharraf .
Our initial attack was arbitrary , that is not even based on having real evidence that bin Laden was the leader of the 9/11 attack .
In fact , the FBI removed him from their Most Wanted Terrorist List for that particular crime for lack of evidence .
Scroll down the linked document and it clearly reads “ CAUTION – Usama Bin Laden is wanted in connection with the August 7 , 1998 , bombings of the United States Embassies in Dar es Salaam , Tanzania , and Nairobi , Kenya .
These attacks killed over 200 people .
In addition , Bin Laden is a suspect in other terrorist attacks throughout the world . ”
Right , he ’s Mr. Terror , but he ’s not credited with 9/11 .
Yet , Osama Bin Laden had a history of working as an asset for the C.I.A .
His asset name was Tim Osman .
Bin Laden was receiving kidney dialysis at a U.S. hospital in Dubai just prior to 9/11 .
He also stated on Al Jazeera Television on September 16 , 2001 that he had no knowledge of the attacks , and that they appeared to be carried out by individuals with their own motivation .
And what could that be , but to instigate “ The War on Terror ” via the false - flag op of 9/11 .
P.S : That interview was aired once , and never heard of again .
Bin Laden was in fact recruited by the CIA in 1979 to partake in Zbigniew Brzezinski ’s Mujahedeen ( holy warriors ) jihad against the Russians who invaded Afghanistan as the US fomented trouble against the then - Russian leaning Afghanistan government .
The Mujahedeen were subsequently trained , weaponized , and paid for by the CIA .
“ Al Qaeda ” appeared first as the name on file in bin Laden ’s laptop .
“ Al Qaeda ” means “ the base ” of fellow fighters that bin Laden thought worthiest in that struggle .
They were worthy enough to drive the Soviet Union out after a decade of bloody fighting .
Is this what the US is looking for again — or a defeat like the one that Afghanistan handed to the British Empire , or Alexander the Great centuries before that .
It boggles the mind the way we forget the lessons of history .
As to Pakistan , historian Webster Tarpley in an interview with Russia Today spoke of “ very plausible Taliban charges that the CIA and Blackwater are behind the recent bombing atrocity in Peshawar , Pakistan .
This attack is coherent with the US policy of provoking all - out civil war in Pakistan to break up that country to prevent it from serving as an energy corridor between Iran and China . ”
He went to say that “ The Pakistani Taliban are a proxy of the CIA .
If the government in Islamabad collapses completely , or especially if Taliban forces appear to be taking control of some of Pakistan ’s nuclear forces , Wall Street could also get something it would like very much : a spectacular world shock that could send the world ’s hot money fleeing into the supposed safe haven of the US dollar , which is otherwise near collapse . ”
He noted that the current “ wave of Islamophobia … being ginned up with the Fort Hood shootings , the KSM trial in New York CIty , the seizure of allegedly pro-Iranian mosques , the Zazi case , and the incendiary anti-Moslem statements of Pat Robertson , the patron of the new reactionary governor of Virginia , ” were the cherries on the deadly cake .
He predicted that “ Obama is about to announce another massive escalation of US forces in Afghanistan within days .
If a Wall Street - CIA Operation Safe Haven is indeed at hand , it could also include a coup in Saudi Arabia , or a clash between Saudi Arabia and Iran over the civil war in Yemen .
An Israeli attack on Iran , although much discussed , remains the least likely variation , with Pakistan still at the top of the US hit list . ”
What a dirty laundry list of priorities .
As to Osama ’s subsequent announcements , these would have been made with one of bin Laden ’s doubles which have been used for years .
Osama ’s statements have been created with a voice - morphing technology that could allow a sample of General McChrystal ’s voice ( or anyone else ’s ) to sound exactly like Osama’s .
This technology is duly noted and explained in Griffin ’s book .
So , through Obama ’s blurry vision , the real , sharp - edged bottom line of US thinking really seems to be the destabilization of the entire Mid-East , not the making of peace but of havoc , which is the CIA ’s way of controlling world situations .
Unfortunately , as with using the Mujahedeen in Afghanistan , and subsequently inviting the Taliban to Texas in 1999 to talk with Unocal about oil and gas pipelines for that country , there was a formidable “ blowback ” from the victorious Mid-Eastern fighters .
[ efoods ]
The realization that they succeeded against the Russians gave them the ‘ audacity ’ to challenge us , the US , for our continued presence on their soil , dictating the rules of the game , including the disposition of oil and the opium crop , the latter of which the Taliban had managed to cut down to 2 % of what it was .
It has since soared back up 98 % since our arrival and its revenues undoubtedly finance the CIA off - book dark ops in the region .
So the Mujahedeen victory strengthened a sense of insurgency in Afghanistan as it has in Iraq , people fighting for their independence , their lives .
You remember Iraq ?
The country we attacked to save it from Saddam Hussein , who was about to nuke us any day with his invisible Weapons of Mass Destruction .
It was more like the mass deception of an ADHD administration , distractible to its death .
And you remember George Bush , declaring victory in 2003 , in his calculated carrier landing , in his tailor - made flight - suit , with an armada of cheering sailors behind him .
Well , seven years later we ’re still at it , now dealing with a troubling insurgency that has no intention of going away , especially as we re-distract ourselves to Afghanistan , this time under Barack Hussein Obama .
The ironies are crippling , mind - boggling , but somehow thoroughly expected .
The trouble is , this is a tough game we ’re playing with seasoned veterans of endless war .
Thus , the New York Times headline , Obama ’s Speech on Afghanistan to Envision Exit , seems to be at odds with the realities of the situation we ’ve created .
And a new surge of 30,000 plus troops could be ushering in another Iraq , only worse .
We ’ve already been in Afghanistan for eight years .
How many more years will it take to extricate ourselves from what Santa ’s Helpers have been creating ?
Another decade , or two or more ?
Our economy can’t bear it , even though Wall Street will make money , along with the defense and oil industries , and the entire military - industrial and now mercenary complex .
Yet sanity , that rarer than radium element in US politics , would dictate packing up the circus tent , withdrawing Blackwater and the other clowns from the region , and ship the whole show home , including those battle - worn soldiers and the still innocent , in - one - piece fresh meat .
Of course there ’s one chance in a million that the simple , sane reality could come about .
After all , for the most part it is not Congress ’s sons that are falling , but those struggling young men and women who have to think of military service as a job ‘ opportunity , ’ not endless war .
The notion of rebuilding a peace - time economy and the creation of jobs with the monies saved on war - making , to be used for government infrastructure projects , would be a more likely plan for reviving America .
But as the on - going Empire of the New World Order , the marching orders are coming from the top , from those who vetted the green Obama as they did the born - again Junior — those ever - present elites , the money , the banksters , Streeters , the Rockefellers , et al .
You know who you are .
And , of course , Obama will bring all the powers of his rhetoric to reconcile what one of his senior officials called his mission :
“ He wants to give a clear sense of both the time frame for action and how the war will eventually wind down . ”
Good luck .
We know all about time frames .
We ’re in the middle of several , being squeezed , right now .
And winding down to what , Karzai and his banditos , stuffed election boxes , hands in the tills .
Our war - making creates this excrescence of soured humanity wherever we go .
Yet the Times paraphrases Obama ’s thinking as , “ how the American presence would be ratcheted back after the buildup ( ratcheted back ? ) after the buildup , while making clear that a significant American presence in Afghanistan would remain for a long while ( a really long while ) .
That is designed in part to signal to Pakistan that the United States will not abandon the region and to allay Pakistani fears that India will fill the vacuum created as America pulls back . ”
Well , let them have their own little nuclear stand - off , I suggest , and work it out .
I ’m quite sick of hearing this crap .
And let Obama give his speech not at West Point , the US Military Academy , in front of hundreds of cadets , trainees for new and grander wars , cheering him on ; but let him give his speech at an abandoned car factory in Detroit , with thousands of workers on unemployment benefits , welfare and ( thank god ) food - stamps to keep their families bellies full .
Let this government and its real rulers be shaken by the awful reality they have created in the U.S. Poverty , homelessness , blown - up credit rates , foreclosures , and derivatives rising again exponentially , for another round of bursting financial bubbles .
Obama should be booed off the stage with his slick political patois : give them anything but promise them change .
Change this !
You have n’t delivered peace , Mr. President .
You are delivering more bad news .
Even to a believer who voted for you , you are a vast disappointment , so much the flip side of Bush , so much the Muppet whose words and mannerisms are manipulated .
Some of your Democratic colleagues are even talking “ a surtax , ” yes , a war “ surtax ” to pay for this disaster , whose keystone is , was , and always will be “ the inside job of 9/11 . ”
You see I do n’t believe the Afghans are the people who killed my fellow New Yorkers , fellow Americans , on that awful day .
I believe it was your flip - side , the stumbling , numbing George Bush & Company , which you seem to have joined , right at the hip .

Iran Starts War Games
Iran is on the defensive .
To protect the country ’s nuclear facilities against possible attacks , the Middle Eastern nation commenced a five - day war games program simulating attacks to the sites .
The United States and Israel stated before that they would resort to military attacks to stop Iran from developing nuclear weapons .
The games are to be conducted in an area of 600,000 sq km ( 230,000 sq mi ) with the aim of displaying “ Iran ’s combat readiness and military potentials . ”
Iran rejected a proposal by the International Atomic Energy Agency ( IAEA ) that it send its low - enriched uranium stocks to Russia and France where it can be converted to fuel rods as this will lessen chances that the stocks will become nuclear weapons .
Permanent members of the UN Security Council – United Kingdom , United States , China , Russia and France – expressed dismay over Iran ’s continuing non-cooperation and urged it to reconsider their rejection of the proposal while sanctioning it with restrictions in nuclear material trading , finances and travel .
New three - dimensional radar and hi-resolution aerial images of Port - au - Prince and the surrounding areas released starting Friday could boost both recovery and research efforts in Haiti in the wake of the magnitude 7.0 earthquake that struck on Jan. 12 .
Satellite images and aerial photos have been important resources , but the flatness of those images makes it hard for viewers to identify what they ’re looking at .

" We have dozens of points located along [ a satellite image of ] the fault with annotations after these points saying things like , ' I do n’t know .
This may be a footpath or maybe it is a fracture , ' " said U.S. Geological Survey geophysicist Ken Hudnut , who 's been trying to map the Enriquillo - Plantain Garden fault that caused the earthquake .
" With the resolution of the [ old ] imagery … it 's hard to be conclusive . "
On Thursday , remote - sensing scientists from the Rochester Institute of Technology in New York began collecting new aerial images of the Port - au - Prince area .
They 're using a twin - engine Piper PA - 31 Navajo that houses numerous sensors , including a light - detection and ranging , or LiDAR , instrument that generates the 3 - D data .
It has a camera that shoots with enough resolution to make out cars and occasionally people and multiple infrared instruments that sketch out details invisible to the naked eye , such as hidden sources of heat and water .
The preliminary 6 - inch resolution data shows enormous refugee areas dotted with brightly colored red and blue tents .
" You ca n’t miss them , " said Stefi Baum , director of RIT 's imaging - science center .
It also shows rubble piled precariously along hillsides , which could amplify the threat of mudslides .
" Everything is OK until the rainy season , " Baum said .
" But then all of that rubble will just flow down those structures . "
The data they gather will also help identify access roads that have been cut off by debris , broken bridges and unstable buildings that remain standing , as well as provide much clearer images of the fault , said RIT remote - sensing specialist Jan van Aardt , one of the project ’s coordinators .
Scientists studying Haiti are most excited about the LiDAR instrument , which emits a pulse of light and then measures how fast that light takes to return to the aircraft .
Because data from taller points will arrive faster than data from lower points , the points stitch together to form a 3 - dimensional snapshot of the scene .
" You can almost hold up your fist in the middle of the air and assign it an ' X ' a ' Y ' and a ' Z ' [ coordinate ] , " van Aardt said .
" You can think of LiDAR data as millions of such positions … each with an X a Y and a Z coordinate . "
Those points will also be tied to geographic coordinates to help people pinpoint specific locations on the ground .
In the image below and the image at the top of the post , the first point hit by the LiDAR is shown .
Blue represents lower surfaces , green is higher .
Sorting out the logistics of the $ 200,000 World Bank - funded project has been challenging , van Aardt said .
Because of limited air space in Haiti , the team will be based in Puerto Rico and refuel every four hours in the Dominican Republic .
Every night , researchers at the University of Puerto Rico will help the RIT team transfer the aerial images to Rochester and the huge LiDAR data files to Kucera International aerial imaging company in Ohio , where they will be processed .
Then the images will be made public .
Companies , such as GoogleEarth , Microsoft and Yahoo , have all expressed interest in uploading this data , said Ron Eguchi , CEO of ImageCat , a California - based company that specializes in disaster management , and an RIT partner .
Because RIT 's team plans to assess damage in Port - au - Prince first , Hudnut will likely have to wait a day or two to receive images of the Enriquillo fault , which lies just outside the city .
The new data could reveal major ruptures along the fault .
With no such ruptures currently visible , Hudnut and his colleagues are worried that the ground beneath Port - au - Prince remains under a great deal of stress that could potentially trigger another , even larger earthquake .
" Our dour view of the situation is that it looks like where the fault broke is pretty far to the west and we 're now concerned that it did n't rupture in the eastern part , " Hudnut said .
Because the possibility of another major earthquake of equal or greater magnitude remains low – around 3 percent over the next 30 days – even if no major ruptures are found , researchers hope to use these images primarily to create computer models that show how the fault has behaved in the past and how it might behave in the future .
For instance , about five years ago , researchers used LiDAR data to map the San Andreas fault in California .
Scientists had previously concluded that an earthquake in 1857 caused the ground to shift 30 feet .
But the LiDAR data made clear that the shift was caused not by one , but two , earthquakes .
" Past earthquakes … leave their imprint on the Earth , " said Eric Calais , a geophysicist at Purdue University .
LiDAR data records those imprints , such as distinctive fracture patterns in rock and furrows in the topography of the land .
Scientists should be able to use the Enriquillo images to predict the strength of future earthquakes and calculate how often the fault has ruptured in the past .
" Then this information can be used to prepare a city , prepare a country , " Calais says .

Greens Leader Bob Brown says New Zealand has shown a nasty streak in its refusal to help end a stand - off involving a group of asylum seekers onboard an Australian Customs ship .
The 78 Sri Lankans are refusing to get off the Oceanic Viking because they do not want to be sent to an Indonesian detention centre and the stalemate is now in its fourth week .
The New Zealand Immigration Minister says he rejected Australia 's request to help resettle the group because " queue jumpers " should not be rewarded .
Senator Brown says it is disappointing .
" The New Zealand Government has shown a streak of nastiness , of indifference , which wo n't hold them in good stead , but we 've seen that before here in Australia and it will ultimately be a vote loser , " he said .
The Federal Government says it is still hopeful of handing 78 Sri Lankan asylum seekers over to Indonesia , despite New Zealand rejecting the re-settlement plan .
Acting Prime Minister Julia Gillard says the Government is working on a way to resolve the stand - off .
" We made an agreement with the Indonesian Government to disembark the people rescued in Indonesia and we remain committed to ensuring that that disembarkation does occur , " she said .
" We have been patient with this , we continue to be patient with it . "
The Immigration Minister Chris Evans has confirmed that New Zealand has refused to re-settle some of the Sri Lankans , but says reports that the Government is considering sending the ship to the Philippines are incorrect .
" There 's been no approach by the Australian Government to the Philippines government on this matter , " he said .
" We 've committed to a regional solution through the Bali process , we 're working closely with Indonesians seeking to enhance our co-operation , we 've got strong co-operation in anti-people smuggling efforts . "
Turnbull backs New Zealand
The Government has come under fire from the Opposition over New Zealand 's refusal to take some of the asylum seekers .
The Opposition says it supports New Zealand 's decision to reject a request from Australia to resettle some of the Sri Lankans .
Opposition Leader Malcolm Turnbull says Prime Minister Kevin Rudd 's approach has failed again .
" He 's tried the Indonesian solution and now the New Zealand solution and there 's no solution in sight , " he said .
Refugee lawyer David Manne says Australia should agree to quickly resettle all of the Sri Lankans .
" It needs an ironclad guarantee that these people will be resettled to safety , " he said .
The Government says it is continuing discussions for them to disembark in Indonesia .
Under former Prime Minister Helen Clark , New Zealand accepted 131 asylum seekers from the Tampa .
New Zealand Green Party MP Keith Locke says the current conservative government should show more compassion .
" New Zealand 's a lucky county in a sense in that boat people never make it to our shores , so surely we should share some of the burden of resettling people who are in quite desperate circumstances , " he said .
Chris Kerr from Amnesty International says it is very disappointing .
" New Zealand has previously showed compassionate leadership during the 2001 Tampa incident .
Then , as now , that leadership is sadly lacking in Australia , " he said .
Could the world ’s religions survive the discovery of extraterrestrial life ?
Or would their beliefs be so shaken that they would eventually collapse ?
A survey ( pdf ) discussed on Tuesday at a meeting on the search for alien life at the Royal Society in London suggests religion would survive .
The survey , designed by Ted Peters , a professor of Systematic Theology at the Pacific Lutheran Theological Seminary and the Graduate Theological Union in Berkeley , California , asked 1300 people whether they thought the discovery of extraterrestrial intelligence would shake their individual belief , the strength of their religion as a whole or would adversely affect the beliefs of other religions .
The survey included both religious and non-religious people , and most respondents were based in the US .
None of the 70 Buddhists questioned thought that the discovery of ET would undercut their belief systems , although 40 per cent thought it could pose problems for other religions .

More Roman Catholics believed ET could pose a problem for their faith .
Only 8 per cent of the 120 surveyed thought that their individual beliefs would be shaken , but nearly a quarter – 22 per cent – said it could adversely affect their religion .
Even more – 30 per cent – thought it could threaten the beliefs of other religious people .
Singled out
The patterns were similar for the other Christian sects surveyed , including evangelical and mainline Protestants , but there was not enough data to draw firm conclusions about people of other religions , such as Hindus and Muslims .
Of the 205 people who identified themselves as non-religious ( either atheists or those who describe themselves as spiritual but not religious ) , only 1 per cent thought it would affect their atheist or spiritual outlooks .
But 69 per cent thought the discovery of ET could cause a crisis for other world religions .
An average of only 34 per cent of religious people shared that belief .
Paul Davies , an astrobiologist at Arizona State University in Tempe was one of the first to suggest that the world ’s religions would not cope with the discovery of ET .
And he still believes such a find would pose theological problems for Christians .
“ They believe that Jesus came down to earth to save humankind – not dolphins , Neanderthals or extraterrestrials , ” he said in response to the survey results .
“ To make sense of this , either you need multiple incarnations [ of Jesus on other planets ] or a reason why this planet and this species was singled out for special attention . ”
‘ Extraterrestrial brothers ’
Many survey respondents expressed no such qualms .
A Roman Catholic said : “ I believe that Christ became incarnate ( human ) in order to redeem humanity and atone for the original sin of Adam and Eve .
Could there be a world of extraterrestrials ?
Maybe .
It does n’t change what Christ did . ”
Another wrote : “ From an evangelical Christian perspective , the Word of God was written for us on Earth to reveal the creator …
Why should we repudiate the idea that God may have created other civilisations to bring him glory in the same way ? ”
“ There is nothing in Christianity that excludes other intelligent life , ” asserted an evangelical respondent .
Indeed , Vatican astronomers have said in recent years that there is no conflict between believing in God and in the possibility of “ extraterrestrial brothers ” .
The Future of the United States , Systemic Fraud , Corruption and Financial Instability
Craig Harris writes :
As we close out 2009 and look forward into 2010 and beyond , this has been a year of near financial catastrophe and monumental change , none of which benefited America or ordinary Americans .
Late in 2008 and throughout 2009 , events have happened in the US which would have been labeled unfathomable just a few short years ago , and yet already these monumental changes are expected to be filed into the memory hole and Americans are expected to believe nothing has changed .
As we exit the year , we are told the US is a laissez - faire free market economy and yet the US government is now the largest owner of housing in the US as well as the owner of last resort for some of the largest and completely insolvent US corporations .
The Federal Reserve , a privately and anonymously owned and controlled corporation chartered with issuing the nations currency , were given the green light by themselves to transfer to themselves and their shareholders the people 's wealth in the form of their future labor .
The FED balance sheet has ballooned to become a junk bond warehouse as they overtly and covertly buy their own debt , immune from any sort of oversight , regulation or auditing and operating above the law .
Along with that , increasingly coercive brute force measures are now routinely necessary to manage and manipulate so called " free market " asset prices which are cheerled by so called " financial news media " whose board members and management are all the same people who transferred the people 's wealth to themselves .
The corporate media party line idea of a " free market US economy " now seems like a distant memory and it all feels like systemic fraud , corruption , malfeasance and organized crime at the very highest levels .
During 2009 we have seen the continued collapse of American industry amid wave after wave of layoffs .
The corrupt corporate media cartel likes to trot out a group of FED sponsored shills who call themselves " professors " to call this a " jobless recovery " although it 's difficult to imagine a recovery where American industry has collapsed and is now owned by the government .
US cities both large and small have been decimated by the loss of the US manufacturing base .
Detroit now resembles a third world country with a 50 % unemployment rate .
Ransacked , foreclosed houses go for a dollar apparently because no one who has a choice is willing to own property or live there .
The US has an officially stated unemployment rate of ten percent and a real unemployment rate of over 20 percent .
Wall Street may have recovered due to a direct injection of capital from the future labor of the people , but there has been no action taken whatsoever to improve the situation of the average citizen as the disconnect between the ruling Oligarchs and Wall Street , the real economy and the lives of ordinary Americans continues to widen .
The people 's bailout money , which represents the future labor of Americans , went directly into the pockets of the people who created the crisis in the first place because they are in the enviable position of being " too big to fail " .
Interestingly , or sadly , the same people and institutions responsible for and who profited from the catastrophe are still in charge and have handed even more power and control to themselves .
Although there has been talk in Washington of " too big to fail " being undesirable , the result of the post collapse policies have resulted in ever fewer , ever larger players with more power and control and instead of being " too big to fail " now wield so much money and power that they demonstrate wholesale ownership of the entire US political body .
Due to the post collapse monetary and fiscal policies , the people have now been saddled up with an unpayable level of debt .
The cause of the near total collapse of the financial system was too much debt and the " solution " has has been even more debt piled on to the original debt .
During the year , the Dallas FED estimated the financial obligations of the US government at 99 trillion dollars .
The head of the TARP program estimated the bailout cost at 24 trillion dollars .
Totaled together the US has in the neighborhood of 120 trillion dollars of current and future obligations on an annual revenue of around 2 trillion dollars which is falling due to high unemployment , higher state and local taxes and fees and lower wages .
Cutting that down to size , imagine earning 200,000 a year and having a debt of 12 million dollars .
In short , the US dollar has become a token of an unpayable debt and thus the anchor of the entire global financial system is a ponzi fraud .
It becomes impossible to compute the value of anything as measured in a fraudulent currency that represents an unpayable debt .
The banking system is not lending money because it 's still insolvent .
The people , having lost over 5 trillion dollars in the real estate bust are also collectively insolvent .
Many US states and cities are bankrupt or near bankrupt .
One in nine Americans subsist on food stamps .
Even as a college education has become unaffordable to most Americans , college graduates now find themselves jobless .
One in seven households now have their adult children living back at home due to the inability to find a job .
The homeless population is growing and tent cities sprouted up across America during 2009 .
The estimated homeless population in LA alone is 40,000 people a night .
People in the US if they have a job are working longer and harder to make the same income .
Wages have remained stagnant and the real cost of living continues to spiral ever higher for ordinary Americans .
The new man in charge , elected on a platform of " change " , has delivered his change in the form of change=no change , or how do you like your change now ?
By any metric you choose , whether it 's the median home costing half the median income even at artificially low interest rates , to the ballooning cost of insurance , healthcare , education or anything else people spend their money on , the US is experiencing a rapid decline in the standard of living for ordinary Americans and an emerging ultra rich ultra powerful shadow oligarch rule amid a generalized and widespread financial and social decay .
The US population is becoming a nation of voiceless serfs with fewer and fewer remaining civil and property rights and a rapidly decaying standard of living , the antitheses of everything America is said to represent and strive for .
The hypocrisy and fraud of the oligarch rule corporate media story line is now nearly impossible for an educated , informed adult to digest .
As Jim Grant pointed out recently , according to Section 19 of the Coinage Act of 1792 , the penalty prescribed for any official who fraudulently debased the people 's money is death , yet in 2009 debasing the people 's money resulted in a " man of the year " award from the self serving corporate media who will be next in line for a bailout from the people for their good service to the new oligarch rule .
This organized crime , this theft , occurring right out in the open , may explain why employees of the largest US financial institution are now not allowed to gather in groups larger than 12 outside and their executives are carrying firearms .
In an affront to the intelligence and sensibility of any citizen of this planet , the new US president expanded a war he was elected to end and started a new frontier in Pakistan , for that he was awarded a Nobel Peace Prize .
The people who were awarded hundreds of billions of dollars of the people 's money because they lost all their money are skimming millions and billions off the top for themselves and their associates in what they call " bonuses " .
2009 has been a year of egregious assault on the American public by the people in charge .
The " people 's representatives " as they like to be called , no longer represent the people at all but instead solely represent and pledge allegiance to the special interests and corporate lobbyists who have bought and paid for their votes , along with the media oligarchs who control who sits in the seats .
Regardless of whether they call themselves Democrats or Republicans , they are a group of self important , self serving , morally bankrupt , corrupt , clueless buffoons and criminals running unchecked by a complicit corporate media .
Every American should be ashamed , embarrassed and sad that their country has been bought and sold to an organized criminal enterprise which includes the entire political body and the media .
The only thing the " people 's representatives " have in common is contempt for the people they are ostensibly representing .
It is revolting for any American to watch these cretins heaping praise Ben Bernanke at the congressional theater of the absurd .
His institution has already debased the dollar by 95 % and failed miserably in every mandate they had since they took over in 1913 .
If any American has managed to retain or save any money , he can now put it on deposit in their banking system and earn a negative real return ( a loss of his purchasing power ) while at the same time the banks will take his deposit and loan it to his brother at 30 % interest .
So Mr Bernanke the money printer has control over the largest legal loan sharking operation ever concocted and it is funded by the America people , against the America people .
During 2009 , the leadership has taken actions which benefit the corporations and special interests who own them , while showing nothing but wanton disregard for the millions of citizens whose lives their sponsors have destroyed .
What we are headed towards in the US if we are not there already , is a Straussian society of ultra rich , ultra powerful oligarchs and a serfish powerless population with no middle class to speak of .
The US president De Jour is , and from here on out will be a yes man , subservient to the ultra powerful too big to fail oligarchs who control the money and power and are responsible for putting him in the drivers seat .
This is not compatible whatsoever with prosperity , democracy or anything else the US still holds itself out as .
Here at the end of 2009 , the United States has morphed into a bankrupt fascist oligarchy which owns the military machine as a policy enforcement tool , the entire political body and the media .
It is n't going to fix itself because the fraud , corruption and malfeasance is systemic .
It meets every definition of organized crime and it's all happening right out in the open .
In my way of thinking , this is not at all unlike the breakdown of the Soviet Union where for a period of time a sort of mafia of oligarchs weilded the wealth and power , carved up the remaining wealth of the country among themselves and had their way with the country amid a climate of manufactured fear , chaos and decay .
The key point being that the people in control are out to make money and increase their power at the expense of the citizens .
Mr Orwell said " the purpose of power is power " and that statement needs to be well understood .
These megalomaniac , sociopathic aspirations of ever more power and control by an elitist group of criminals come at the expense of America and future Americans .
It does n't matter whatsoever to the oligarchs because they have property waiting in Croatia .
When the remaining wealth has been extracted from America , they will all pull out and the citizens will be left with a rusted out bankrupt hull .
I believe the circumstances for this eventuality have already been created , just not yet realized due to the enormous size of the economy and the momentum it has .
In other words , I believe it 's collapsing as fast as it can although living through it seems like slow motion .
When viewed from the future in a historical context however , I think it will have seemed fairly rapid .
The financial markets have deteriorated into a Las Vegas casino atmosphere where the the only consistent winners are the house and the too big to fail entities trading on foreknowledge and inside information shared freely between the treasury and the few remaining large trading houses .
The entire system is bankrupt , fraudulent , corrupt and irretrievably broken .
The anchor of the global financial system , the US dollar , has become the worlds largest ponzi scheme and the remaining 95 % of the worlds population would like a new , viable standard .
At this point however , despite any action the FED may or may not take , the US debt is far too large to ever be repaid .
It is questionable if the interest payments will even be serviceable if interest rates were to rise , and the only reason interest rates are low is because the FED is using brute force .
At this time the only way out without a complete collapse is to inflate away the debt , thus turning a deflationary collapse into a long period of inflationary decay and declining standard of living .
I have been of the opinion that what we saw in October 2008 was a collapse of the global fiat financial system which was more or less expected due to the collapse of the real estate bubble .
I have reminded my subscribers that when I was forecasting a drop in real estate prices of as much as 50 % during the heyday of the mania , that sounded unfathomable .
What I believe is in store for our future sounds nearly as unfathomable now as that idea did back then .
I believe the reason it sounds unfathomable is due to the constant barrage of lies , misinformation and propaganda from the tight knit corporate media oligarchy which has essentially merged with the new power structure of the US in a corrupt , overt form of fascism that would make Mussolini blush or Goebbels the propagandist nod in approval .
Over a period of decades and with one FED induced serial bubble after another , the financial system finally reached an unsustainable level of debt and leverage in 2008 .
When the FED started raising interest rates , when the real estate bubble burst , it involved so much debt and leverage that the whole system failed , pricing models and risk models failed , and the banking system quickly became insolvent .
I believe we have already had a systemic collapse , and the only thing the FED can do now is alter the look and feel of the collapse and to manage the allocation of the remaining wealth .
In the end , whether by deflationary collapse or inflationary decay , the result of the collapse will feel the same to the US general population regardless of the interim path taken .
If the FED had done nothing , the whole system would have quickly degenerated into a deflationary collapse and failure of the financial system due to insolvency .
The course the FED chose however is the one myself and many others predicted beforehand ... the FED chose to solve the problem of too much debt by creating even more debt by taking the unprecedented action of buying it's own debt under euphemisms like " quantitative easing " and " debt monetization " and also covert buying to artificially force negative real return rates of interest .
Through this course of action , the FED so far has been able to turn what would have been a rapid deflationary collapse into a decaying inflationary depression which is euphemistically called " a recession that is now over " by the six people who control 96 % of the global media and attempt to pass off propaganda as " news " to a woefully mis informed , dumbed down and apathetic general public .
Going forward ,
If the FED does n't buy enough of their own debt , then interest rates on the long end would rise and the risk becomes a deflationary collapse into insolvency for the FED and it 's banking system .
If interest rates remain effectively at zero on the short end and artificially suppressed by quantitative easing on the long end , then the real estate market can recover and the banks can regain solvency .
If interest rates rise as the free markets would argue for however , then the real estate market sinks even further , the US dollar rises , and greater insolvency of the banks follows .
The higher interest rates go , the thinner the knife edge gets and the FED would quickly find itself staring into another October 2008 collapse kind of situation .
On the other hand , if by buying enough of their own debt they can keep short and long term interest rates down , then the free money percolates through the banking system , puts pressure on the dollar , lifts commodity and real estate prices and pulls out of the collapse via inflating away the debt so long as they can avoid run away hyperinflation in the process .
This is the path we have traveled throughout 2009 .
The key point is that the FED has had the option of doing two things ... creating even more debt in order to save itself and the banking system , or do nothing and watch themselves collapse into a mass of failure , loss of power and control , insolvency and domino style bankruptcy and default .
They have chosen the expected course , which is to increase the debt and print money , which is the way they save themselves and their banking system .
In short , given a choice between saving the people and saving themselves after a collapse , they have taken the expected course which is to attempt to save themselves .
What else would you expect ?
If they had wanted to save the people they would have taken the peoples bailout money and handed it to them in the form of a check .
Instead they handed it to the banks .
Although they have been somewhat successful in reducing the insolvency of the banking system , they have effectively created a giant wealth transfer mechanism whereby all the money that disappeared in the collapse was re created out of thin air and given to the banks and wall street .
I think of it as a sort of shell game .
The money disappeared from Mom and Pop 's 401k and re appeared on the balance sheets of the banks via freshly created new money ( debt ) .
As a result , we have something still called " free market capitalism " which is not free market capitalism at all .
We have emerged from this crisis with a sort of financial oligarchy where a few entities who control all the wealth and power also control politics and media .
Understanding this will help to understand issues like " healthcare reform " which will involve you paying more and getting less , with the primary beneficiaries being the oligarchies who control health care and insurance .
The one major point I have to make at this time is throughout 2009 , there was no action taken that put the average citizen in a better position , but instead during the course of the year there was a gigantic wealth transfer from the citizens to the banking system , effectively orchestrated by the so called " people 's representatives " who are in fact , all owned by the banking system and Wall Street with half a dozen or so oligarchies and lobbyists in a public display of fraud , malfeasance and corruption that sets a new historical precedent .
I have been and remain of the opinion that the ultimate " solution " to this crisis will be for the entities who now control the wealth and power to accumulate even more wealth and power via a global central bank and global currency which now for the first time in public has been discussed on and off throughout 2009 and described as the New World Order by such luminaries as Henry Kissinger .
So looking out beyond 2010 , I see a new global reserve currency emerging and a global central bank which will effectively also be a global governing authority where the heads of state effectively report to the group of central bankers and their anonymous shareholders who effectively control the money , power and politicians on a global scale .
When the global currency is introduced , only then do I expect a sort of collapse of the US dollar versus this global currency .
In this way , the world can carry on while the former global reserve currency called the US dollar will be free to depreciate to a level where solvency is regained and the now unpayable US debt is inflated away to the point where it can be repaid in depreciated dollars .
US citizens will experience a continued decay as the US becomes to resemble more and more , a third world country .
Detroit is already there .
The corporate media wo n't show it to you but if you do a youtube search on Detroit what you see will shock you .
My view of the world tends to be the long view .
Throughout 2009 I have been positioned and trading in various hard assets including but not limited to gold silver , back month crude oil , Soybeans , raw land and Americana .
I own and trade some Chinese shares but no US equities or bonds .
I have lost confidence in the US leadership .
I have lost confidence in the fairness of the " system " where some elite entities are free to keep the profits and nationalize their losses .
I have opted to opt out by embarking on a long term effort to transfer more and more capital " off wall street " and their organized crime ring they call the banking system , and instead investing in things without fraudulent or impaired balance sheets .
At some point in the future , I want to be short US 10 and 30 year bonds because it is nonsensical to me that anyone would be willing to loan a bankrupt country money for 30 years at an interest rate of 4 % or so .
The only reason this situation exists today is due to the FED monetizing debt and attempting to manipulate the long end using brute force .
So as we head off into 2010 , I see a lot of uncertainty in the short term .
If interest rates rise and the US dollar gets stronger , by mid year I would expect a repeat of October 2008 .
What I expect to happen over the longer term however is that the FED will ultimately print enough money to attempt to slowly inflate the debt away to a manageable amount amid a generalized and severe decay in terms of the standard of living for Average Americans .
At some point along the line , I expect the world reserve currency role to be moved into a global currency and for the US dollar to be allowed to float against it without the benefits associated with the world currency role , and for the US standard of living to continue to decline and eventually decay into a societal collapse followed by something different .
I expect China to emerge as the dominant economic power in the world and to purchase a large amount of US assets .
Somewhere along the line I also expect the Nobel Peace Prize recipient to bomb Iran because he will be ordered to do so by the people who control the money .
Personally , based on what I see coming over the long term I have elected to forego city life and have embarked on a long term project in the picturesque Appalachian foothills in an effort to increase my degree of self sufficiency and insulate myself from the continued decay and declining standard of living sweeping the country .
My long view for the US is high inflation which will not show up in the government 's fraudulent statistics , along with a declining standard of living , increasing decay and ultimately leading to chaos , societal and government collapse in the US within a decade or two , maybe sooner .
I would like to end by quoting Marc Faber with one of the most compelling quotes of 2009 .
I find this quote compelling because the price of anything as measured by a fraudulent standard is meaningless .
To me , it is a gift to be able to still exchange US dollars for anything with real value .
" I would buy every three months some gold and not worry so much about the price because the weight stays the same "

Thank you for an insightful , comprehensive and harrowing article .
All of the points made strike home too convincingly to be " gloom and doom " and are difficult to rebut , even with detailed critical analysis .
I do think 9 out of 10 people are financially very naive , and that even in the most astute 10 % , at least half are not paying enough attention to what is going on .
I do think that critical thinking on the part of the average Canadian and US citizen has fallen increasingly by the wayside .
This is not to say that intelligence of the populace is decreasing - only that education levels ( certainly in content if not formal certification ) are down and healthy skepticism is notable by its near absence .
Gone are most intelligent television programs like All in the Family and Frasier , and these are replaced by " fluff " , such as many reality shows like Jon and Kate Plus Eight .
Honestly !
Mainstream media is seeming more and more simplistic and propaganda - like .
I may have to scream if I see the word " unexpectedly " again in supposedly objective journalism .
" Personal bankruptcies were ' unexpectedly ' double the revised predicted levels .
Economists see no connection to the massive increase in layoffs and credit refusals . "
Yeesh !
The US Federal Reserve is printing fiat money , and printing money is really just an illicit wealth grab that punishes anyone who has been prudent enough to amass any level of savings ; the global " wealth pool " remains the same , yet others ( unfortunately the big banks and other chosen recipients rather than pro rata to citizens ) are given new currency , which dilutes ( nay , embezzles ) the savings of private individuals .
There seem to be many " stealth wealth grabs " at work , and the effect will be , as you indicate , to wipe out any significant middle class :
1 . Printing money 2 . Likelihood that the whole reinvestment in the stock market is from sources directly connected to government .
3 . Keeping interest rates low so that savings will not generate any money to live on 4 .
Propping up house prices by keeping inventory on the banks ' books ( also keeps the losses off the banks ' income statements for now ) .
5 . Falling tax revenues 6 .
Increased health care spending in return for lowered health care services .
This is not a complete or balanced list , but just those that come to mind .
What does a person do ?
I am very lucky to have a paid - for home , but I always have lived frugally , and delayed acquiring all the " toys " that my near - bankrupt neighbours just had to have .
I have ten years to retirement , what seems like a very secure job , a defined benefit pension ( twenty years in at this point ) , and a decent level of savings .
I smelled something rotten in October 2008 and sold nearly all my stocks just prior to the fall in the markets , but am earning a pittance in interest ; I guess I heard the phrase " the fundamentals are good " one too many times and a chill travelled up my spine .
I did not buy back in to the stock market after March 2009 , because I am sure the fundamentals have become markedly and increasingly worse , even though the markets are still mysteriously rising - and significantly .
I am not naive enough , however , to think that the stealth wealth theft will not eventually enter my life like fog through an open window , but I want to ensure that I do n't lose everything , which could so easily happen , especially if there is , after all , no pension for me when retirement hits .
Being in Canada , my analysis is one step removed from what is going on in the US or the UK .
I routinely read many articles on the Market Oracle site , and though intuitively I cannot see that Canada is isolated in any way , I do n't know why we have n't had a big fall in real estate prices here yet .
Our unemployment rate ( and I do think U6 is more relevant than U3 ) is not quite as high as in the US ( say perhaps 80 % of the US rate ) , but we have had our share of plant and retail closings , too .
The Canadian dollar is not yet seriously " quantitatively eased " , but I can see that coming as our local banks ' investments go bad ( we only have five or so major banks , however , and no small ones other than credit unions ) , and many of the multinationals ( Canada / US ) corporate groups in the automobile and lumber industries , for example begin to push more and more for bailouts .
Canada 's tax revenues are falling precipitously , and there will be pressure for proportionate bailouts of the Canadian parts of multinationals , and as our more delayed crisis hits full force , our national debt could quickly balloon , and our currency could follow the ( I think ) imminent downward spiral of the US dollar .
The assets that would tempt me at this point are good agricultural land , gold ( more attractive than a month ago because of a continuing high Canadian dollar and a price decrease from peak levels - which could soon be surpassed again ) , and certain commodities or commodity futures .

VERY good article and right on the mark .
Even undereducated Americans , ( like me ) , can see what is happening to our country .
Most are awestruck at how fast everything is changing .
Those of us who can are paying off debt , especially home mortgages and land .
Many are storing food and weapons .
We are aware that we need to be prepared for a drastically different way of life .
Quite a few older Americans in the south know how to hunt , grow food , build a fire for warmth , and survive on very little .
Some of us are fortunate enough to have rural land and private water wells .
The wells need electricty to work , so generators are a backup .
Not all Americans are dependent on this government to provide for us .
We do not want handouts .
We only want to keep what we work for .
Unfortunately , in the USSA it is getting harder for independent people of character to resist the pressure of BIG government takeovers .
Please pray for America and ask God to deliver
His people from the coming collapse .

Last change for the people of our country to take our country back .
Easy answer to fix the problem .
since the debt will never be paid off anyway .
The problem the gov made will be the one that the little people will solve for them .
Let the people vote to just default on the national debt .
All 100 % of it .
an yes there will be some pissed off over seas governments .
But then again make it a law from now on the USA goverment has to live year to year on what it has to spend .
since no goverment will ever lend us an other dime .

21 Jan 10 , 01:24 death of the criminals who created the crises
Dang , you almost got it right .
Should have said " .. the problem the government made will be the one the government will solve .
Let the people vote to transfer the national debt back to the government .
All 100 % of it .
Then make it law that the government MUST pay it back , or else the government will be tried and sentenced for fraud and corruption .
In China the penalty would be death to all responsible .
I 'm sure Americans can come up with an even more just punishment .
Death would be too easy for the criminals .
The End of East West German Secret Service Opens GDR Files
Germany 's foreign intelligence agency recently released some of its files from the run-up to the collapse of East Germany .
The papers show that West German spies had conflicting information .
At times they were well sourced , but they failed to see that the Berlin Wall was about to collapse .
New Poll Shows Correlation is Causation [ The Happy Hour Archive | obereed .
net ]
NEW POLL SHOWS CORRELATION IS CAUSATION WASHINGTON ( AP )
The results of a new survey conducted by pollsters suggest that , contrary to common scientific wisdom , correlation does in fact imply causation .
The highly reputable source , Gallup Polls , Inc. , surveyed 1009 Americans during the month of October and asked them , " Do you believe correlation implies causation ? "
An overwhelming 64 % of American 's answered " YES " , while only 38 % replied " NO " .
Another 8 % were undecided .
This result threatens to shake the foundations of both the scientific and mainstream community .
" It is really a mandate from the people . " commented one pundit who wished to remain anonymous .
" It says that The American People are sick and tired of the scientific mumbo - jumbo that they keep trying to shove down our throats , and want some clear rules about what to believe .
Now that correlation implies causation , not only is everything easier to understand , it also shows that even Science must answer to the will of John and Jane Q. Public . "
Others are excited because this new , important result actually gives insight into why the result occurred in the first place .
" If you look at the numbers over the past two decades , you can see that Americans have been placing less and less faith in the old maxim ' Correlation is not Causation ' as time progresses . " explained pollster and pop media icon Sarah Purcell .
" Now , with the results of the latest poll , we are able to determine that people 's lack of belief in correlation not being causal has caused correlation to now become causal .
It is a real advance in the field of meta-epistemology . "
This major philosophical advance is , surprisingly , looked on with skepticism amongst the theological community .
Rabbi Marvin Pachino feels that the new finding will not affect the plight of theists around the world .
" You see , those who hold a deep religious belief have a thing called faith , and with faith all things are possible .
We still fervently believe , albeit contrary to strong evidence , that correlation does not imply causation .
Our steadfast and determined faith has guided us through thousands of years of trials and tribulations , and so we will weather this storm and survive , as we have survived before . "
Joining the theologists in their skepticism are the philosophers .
" It 's really the chicken and the egg problem .
Back when we had to worry about causation , we could debate which came first .
Now that correlation IS causation , I 'm pretty much out of work . " philosopher - king Jesse " The Mind " Ventura told reporters .
" I 've spent the last fifteen years in a heated philosophical debate about epistemics , and then all of the sudden Gallup comes along and says , " Average household consumption of peanut butter is up , people prefer red to blue , and ... by the way , CORRELATION IS CAUSATION .
Do you know what this means ?
This means that good looks actually make you smarter !
This means that Katie Couric makes the sun come up in the morning !
This means that Bill Gates was right and the Y2 K bug is Gregory 's fault . "
Ventura was referring to Pope Gregory XIII , the 16th century pontiff who introduced the " Gregorian Calendar " we use today , and who we now know is to blame for the year 2000 .
The scientific community is deeply divided on this matter .
" It sure makes my job a lot easier . " confided neuroscientist Thad Polk .
" Those who criticize my work always point out that , although highly correlated , cerebral blood flow is not ' thought ' .
Now that we know correlation IS causal , I can solve that pesky mind - body problem and conclude that thinking is merely the dynamic movement of blood within cerebral tissue .
This is going to make getting tenure a piece of cake ! "
Anti-correlationist Travis Seymour is more cynical .
" What about all the previous correlational results ?
Do they get grandfathered in ?
Like , the old stock market / hemline Pearson 's rho is about 0.85 .
Does this mean dress lengths actually dictated the stock market , even though they did it at a time when correlation did not imply causation ?
And what about negative and marginally significant correlations ?
These questions must be answered before the scientific community will accept the results of the poll wholeheartedly .
More research is definitely needed . "
Whether one welcomes the news or sheds a tear at the loss of the ages - old maxim that hoped to eternally separate the highly correlated from the causal , one must admit that the new logic is here and it's here to stay .
Here to stay , of course , until next October , when Gallup , Inc. plans on administering the poll again .
But chances are , once Americans begin seeing the entrepeneurial and market opportunities associated with this major philosophical advance , there will be no returning to the darker age when causal relationships were much more difficult to detect .

In July 2008 , while traveling on a Greyhound bus between Edmonton and Winnipeg , Vincent Li beheaded his sleeping seatmate , a man he had never met , with a butcher knife .
Li held up the head in crazed triumph as the bus screeched to a halt and the other passengers rushed out .
He then began to pace back and forth along the aisle , witnesses report , tearing off the ears , gouging out the eyes , pulling out the tongue , and eating them .
This event , as well as Li’s recently concluded trial — not guilty by reason of insanity — might serve as an opportunity to take measure of the present state of cannibalism studies , mostly a minor academic industry , though one not without its star performances and its polarizing debates .
For a long time , the field was dominated by a curious variety of négationnisme , most famously spelled out by William Arens in his 1980 book The Man-Eating Myth : Anthropology and Anthropophagy .
According to Arens , cannibalism is nothing more than a projection of fear - induced fantasies upon unknown others , and in the past 500 years this projection has served as part of the ideological soundtrack to the European conquest of the rest of the world .
As the incident on the Greyhound reminds us , however , sometimes people really do eat people .
The title of the original Romanian version of Cătălin Avramescu ’s giddy book , Filozoful crud , translates as both “ the cruel philosopher ” and “ the raw philosopher . ” “ Crude ” in the sense of “ uncooked ” ( think of “ crudités ” ) and “ cruel ” share the same etymology , and in at least one Romance language — the easternmost and most obscure , yet in some sense also the purest , because the closest to Latin — these two meanings remain packed into one and the same word .
In what sense , now , could a philosopher be both “ cruel ” and “ raw ” ?
Does Avramescu want to say that philosophers have somehow been both the perpetrators and the victims of anthropophagy ?
When Columbus encountered the Arawak tribe of Hispaniola , they reported to him on the vicious , man-eating Caribs of the neighboring islands , whose name would later become our “ cannibal . ”
Did the Caribs in fact eat the Arawaks ?
Is it naïve to wish to know ?
Part of what an intellectual history involves , Avramescu thinks , is a disregard for the question as to who , precisely , was eating whom , and when .
His book is “ in no way a history of cannibalistic practices . ”
Of course , he adds , “ the instances of verifiable anthropology have sometimes left their traces in the ideal productions of the philosophers .
However , whether cannibals existed or not is in fact of marginal importance . ”
Avramescu ’s cannibal “ is in the first place a scholarly creature , a personage who animates theoretical texts , and only to a lesser extent , if at all , is he a subject for the anthropology of the aberrant . ”
Avramescu wants to know why the history of thinking - with - cannibals is coextensive , more or less , with early modern history , the period from the age of discovery to the age of enlightenment .
Why did the historical life of the cannibal seem to come into existence at a certain moment , and die out at another ?
The question of origins is easier to answer : it was the encounter between Columbus and the Arawak and others like it that exploded in frequency towards the end of the 15th century .
The reasons for this history ’s end present a larger intellectual challenge , but Avramescu believes he knows why , by sometime in the early 19th century , the cannibal is no longer capable of “ constituting any starting point for the articulation of a moral philosophy . ”
I have mentioned that Avramescu hints cryptically in his original title that philosophers are somehow implicated , as actors rather than just as thinkers , in the history of cannibalism .
This hint is repeated early on ( page 2 ) , in a delightful ad hominem directed at academic philosophers : “ Having ended up as functionaries who know very well where their next meal is coming from , the philosophers of our times teach us one or another version of utilitarianism , moral relativism , or juridical positivism . ”
Avramescu follows up this mild rebuke with an admittedly endearing compliment — for himself , that is .
“ Sensitive to the pleasures of the no longer topical , ” he tells us , “ I have elected to present the reader with a study about a period of the past during which the eater of human flesh made his atrocious hegemony felt with the bounds of the science of natural law . ”
What could this mean ?
Throughout the rest of the book , Avramescu charts what he sees as Western civilization ’s broad shift from natural - law theory to juridical positivism through the lens of ideas about cannibalism .
His thesis is that the cannibal ceases to play an important conceptual role in thinking about human nature , morality , and social order at precisely the moment that natural law begins to decline in importance and positivism moves in to replace it .
Natural - law theory , defended by Thomas Aquinas , Hugo Grotius , Samuel von Pufendorf , John Locke , and others , holds that nature itself dictates human law , its dictation is everywhere the same , and the good legal system is the one that takes this dictation faithfully .
( Today , we may note by way of illustration , the few remaining defenders of natural law are generally opposed to gay marriage , on the grounds that , before the laws prohibiting it were written down in books , they were already written into human anatomy . )
Legal positivism , in contrast , is the view roughly speaking that law is not or should not be based in morality .
This latter view is at least closely allied , if not overlapping with utilitarianism and relativism , and all three seem to involve a recognition of the impossibility of valid universal claims about how society in general should be organized .
Curiously , however , the eclipse of natural law by positivism leads to a universalism of another sort , as cultural differences that could once be assessed through the judgmental lens of civilization vs. savagery are now assessed as “ each valid in its own way , ” and accordingly the only thing to bemoan about the natives is not that they are morally backward but only that , poor things , they are living in squalor .
Avramescu explains : “ the anthropophagus disappears in favor of the impoverished wretch , a figure who is discovered in all types of society and may thus become the subject of a universal science of inequality and want .
In order for this to occur , the question of aberrant diet will appear as a social problem and not as a key to decipher human nature . ”
With enough irony mixed in to make its nostalgia bearable , even admirable , Avramescu ’s book weighs heavy with longing for a return to the age of cannibals .
In this at least its author resembles Tobias Schneebaum , the “ retired gay anthropologist ” ( in the words of an oft - cited blurb ) and subject of the 2000 film Keep the River on Your Right : A Modern Cannibal Tale .
In the film , an elderly Schneebaum makes a trip back to the Amazon to track down the surviving members of the tribe with which he had lived several decades earlier , and with whom he had , so he claimed , eaten human flesh .
When he finally finds his old friends and shows them photographs of their younger selves taken during his previous stay with them , one of them proclaims ( to paraphrase ) : “ Oh yes , that was back before we wore clothes . ”
The anthropophagy and the nakedness went out together , in other words .
What covered up their nakedness was not , of course , just any kind of clothes , but defective sweatpants that never made it from the sweatshops to the first world , t- shirts celebrating Selena , My Little Pony , the team that lost the 1994 Superbowl .
This simultaneity , the retreat of cannibalism and the advent of clothing , might lead one to believe that it was Euro - American global hegemony rather than juridical positivism that put a stop to our preoccupation with man-eating savages .
Avramescu believes that the idea of cannibalism ceased to have much significance for moral discourse when we lost the absolute moral order that enabled us to distinguish between true civility and true barbarity .
What this order was replaced with was one in which all human beings participate in the same progressive historical narrative , and the most fearsome others left are the filthy mendicants and the drunken Indians .
Here , interestingly , is where conservative critique starts to look a good deal like postcolonialism with a twist .
For the gradual decline of talk of cannibals also appears to occur simultaneously with the Western powers ’ gradual gain of control over the dark zones of the globe that once fed their wild fantasies .
The decline of the cannibal as a meaningful figure might not , or not only , signal the decline of the old moral universe ; it might signal that the natives are no longer restless , and they are no longer restless because they are now subdued by the overwhelming force of the colonial powers , by urbanization , ghettoization , alcohol , and corn syrup .
One sign of their subdued state is the dirty pink sweatpants they are wearing ; another is the traveler ’s confidence that he will not be eaten .
The moment of the decline of natural law , and of the rise of Western global hegemony , seems also to be roughly the moment we started saying , of every new moral atrocity announced in the news , “ Why , in this day and age ?
Who would have thought it possible ? ! ”
There is of course absolutely no evidence that moral atrocities are less frequent in our age than in ages past .
What is distinctive about our age is the sense that they belong to ages past , and that when they happen today they are like some prehistoric coelacanth popping up in an industrial fishing net .
The problem during the early modern period is that indigenous European cannibalism presents a sort of conceptual impossibility , not because no European would do such a thing , but because , if it is a European doing it , it is ipso facto not cannibalism .
By “ European , ” of course , one should not understand any ethnos that happens to find itself west of the Urals .
Tales of vampirism generally involve mysterious Balkan folk , “ others ” of a different sort than the savages of the West Indies , yet others who in many ways provide a Medieval template for the conceptualization of the new kinds of others introduced in the age of discovery .
It is the mundane medical cases , conceptualized by the actors as something quite different from the barbarity of distant islands or the dark secrets of Transylvanian fortresses , that are often most alarming .
In Protestant areas of Germany , Avramescu reports , “ the blood of those beheaded on the scaffold was sold , and sometimes drunk at the scene by epileptics and other unfortunates . ”
This custom was attested in Marburg as late as 1865 .
One might indeed ask whether exoticist travel literature ever really told Europeans anything new about the range of human behavior , or whether what in fact differs from culture to culture are only the descriptions with which the underlying , and basically unchanging , things that human beings do are ornamented .
Here then we might see a way to save natural law from the cannibal problem : we all already are cannibals , and this is perfectly natural .
We may not all drink the blood of the condemned , yet as Robert Boyle observes in a vivid passage cited by Avramescu , we should not “ count [ the cannibals ] so barbarous merely upon the score of feeding on man ’s flesh and bloud , ” since “ a woman ’s milk , by which we feed our sucking Children , is , according to the received Opinion , but blanched Bloud . ”
Boyle goes on to tell of men who , in order “ to prevent the Scurvy and the Gout , drink their own or Boy ’s Urine , ” and he relates that “ under the name of ‘ album graecum ' ” dog feces are “ commonly given to Patients of all sorts and qualities against sore Throats , ” while in Holland it is usual “ to mingle Sheep ’s dung with their cheeses , only to give them a colour and a relish . ”
Boyle just ca n’t let it drop : “ We devour Oysters whole , ” he moans , “ guts , excrements , and all ; nay , when not for Physick , but only for Delicacies , and our Courtiers and Ladies are themselves wont to make sawce for the bodies of Lobsters of that green stuff , which is indeed their Dung . ”
Disgusting , certainly , but is n’t anthropophagy a problem of an altogether different order ?
Or might it be that Avramescu is onto something in picking up Boyle ’s treatment of kreophagy and anthropophagy , of carnivorism and cannibalism , as variations upon the same basic problem ?
Consider this curious feature of the way we eat animals : unless you are a preening showman like Anthony Bourdain , you are always already a vegetarian of sorts relative to the vast majority of meats .
You ca n’t eat dog or rat or parakeet , even though these are perfectly reliable sources of calories .
Arguments about the relative toughness or stringiness of their flesh do not get to the heart of the matter .
You ca n’t eat them because to do so would be to break the rules of the game .
There are no such rules for the consumption of vegetable matter : whatever nourishes will do .
This distinction reveals something significant about meat eating : it is what you might call a charged domain of human activity , like sex and violence , and it is so no matter what kind of moral arguments you might offer up for or against culling deer herds , free range farming , and so on .
Meat eating , like sex and violence , is regulated by religions , while for the most part plant - eating is not .
Who can have sex with whom , or who can kill whom , or who can eat what meat when , are practically what religion is about .
( The stuff about God is a later development , of interest to only a few . )
Why meat - eating should be seen as charged in this way , prior to any moral - philosophical considerations , is worth some reflection .
It seems that at least from Porphyry on , the metaphysics and natural philosophy of nutrition required some sort of transformation in order to count as nutrition at all .
That is , nutrition must involve at a minimum the transformation of matter that is non-identical with the matter of my corporeal substance into identical matter .
Each creature then has a suitable range of non-identical food sources that it is able to convert into its own substance , but nature herself limits the range of possible conversions .
Cannibalism would involve no conversion at all , and thus beyond its moral repulsiveness it is also naturally inefficacious as a source of nutrition .
Thus the 2nd- century Chrisian apologist Athenagoras of Athens maintains that anthropopophagi , no matter how many human beings they eat , will gain no weight .
“ On the contrary , as soon as such meat , for which there is such a great antipathy , enters the space of the stomach , nature revolts and immediately eliminates it . ”
“ Nausea , ” Avramescu comments , “ thus has an eschatological virtue . ”
Human flesh is identical in kind to the flesh of the cannibal , but must remain perpetually other in number .
In one way or another , food must be sufficiently different from its consumer in order to be a suitable candidate for sameness .
( The same logic holds for rules prohibiting incest , a parallel to which we will return shortly . )
On this scheme , it might seem that vegetarianism is inherently superior to carnivorism , since it involves the incorporation — note the etymology of this last word — of matter that is , at least in the organic world , as other as things get .
Certainly , many early modern philosophers believed , as had Pythagoras , Plato , and a number of other ancient philosophers , that meat should be avoided , and that slaughtering animals is , if not “ inhumane ” at least obscene .
The Enlightenment was not so restrained .
As Avramescu notes , some eighteenth century philosophers argued that “ a meatless diet was unhealthy , a ‘ mortification ’ proposed by their adversaries , the religious fanatics . ”
Along this line of reasoning , we might imagine an Enlightenment thinker proposing in the dietary realm what Sade had in the sexual , that , namely , tout est permis .
And just as Sade approved not just wanton sodomy but also incest , breaking down the very last stronghold of an already greatly weakened natural law , so we might imagine an Enlightenment argument in favor of eating our fellow men , on the grounds that nature prescribes no diet , and it is nothing but pointless mortification to subdue our appetites .
That these two appetites , for the flesh of humans and for the flesh of family , are linked in the Western imagination , is clear from as early as the first detailed report on cannibalism in the new world , Hans Staden ’s 16th - century report on the Tupinamba people of Brazil .
“ No one has anything , ” Staden writes , “ but all things are held in common .
And the men have as wives those who please them , be they mothers , sisters , or friends , therein make they no distinction …
They also eat each other even those who are slain , and hang the flesh of them in the smoke . ”
Most of us today , even those of us most keen on breaking down taboos , do not spend much of our time sodomizing our siblings or eating our deceased grandmothers .
Could it be that natural law is not as thoroughly dead as Avramescu has made it out to be ?
Very speculatively , one might suggest that cannibalism and incest function somewhat like negative regulative ideas in the Kantian sense .
They are unthinkable , yet the unthinkable thought of doing them anyway , of doing those deeds we can’t really picture even as we spend our lives in fear of picturing them , seems to give shape and meaning to all those things we can do .
Meat would not make a feast if the pig it came from were not , in a sense , on its way towards being human ; traditionally , a bride would not be accepted by the family she marries into unless she were similar enough to them to pass as a blood relative .
In both cases , similarity provides a meaning - endowing semblance of identity .
Some years after Columbus met the Arawak , a new set of explorers began expanding the limits of Europe ’s power by taking the territory of those notorious anthropophagi , the Mesoamerican people widely referred to as “ Aztecs . ”
Just as their own God was losing prestige , some anthropologists and historians have argued , Europeans were themselves gaining prestige abroad as gods .
Arens , who denies that the Mesoamericans , or anyone else for that matter , practiced anthropophagy as a part of their culture , also argues that the Aztecs were no dupes , and understood full well that Cortés was no god .
Cortés and his men could not have been mistaken for gods by the Aztecs , since , Arens writes , “ their human qualities were apparent enough from the first moment of contact with an Aztec provincial official , from whom Cortés demanded in all candor ‘ some gold ’ to show his good intentions . ”
Two paragraphs later Arens tells us that it was the foreigners ’ “ interest in precious metal which made the most vivid impression on the natives . ”
He cites an anonymous native informant who describes the way the Spanish behave in the presence of gold : “ Like monkeys they seized upon the gold .
It was as if they were satisfied , sated , and gladdened .
For in truth they thirsted mightily for gold ; they stuffed themselves with it , and starved and lusted for it like pigs .
And they went about moving the golden streamer back and forth , and showed it to one another , all the while babbling ; and what they said was gibberish . ”
One might reasonably ask :
Well , which is it ?
Was the Spanish lust for gold perfectly transparent to the Mesoamericans , or was it incomprehensible ?
Does greed make one ’s humanity “ apparent enough ” or is it a distinctly European idiosyncrasy that the Mesoamericans could only interpret on analogy to the business of monkeys and pigs ?
To ask these questions is not to make a knitpicking demand for consistency , but rather to approach the heart of the themes that have been occupying us since the beginning of this review .
What in a stranger ’s actions is transparent and what , in contrast , opens that stranger up to the projection of fantasies of otherness ?
Greed and cruelty are , one might think , both universal and easy to recognize , even in complete strangers .
But there is no a priori reason why a god should not be greedy and seek to get as much gold as he can , even if this stretches our usual understanding of the concept of God .
There is similarly no reason why a person should have to be exceptionally cruel to participate in an anthropophagous feast .
There is already something inherently cruel about the slaughter of animals , but this inherent cruelty does not and cannot allow an exceptional portion of cruelty to everyone who benefits from the slaughter .
So Cortés may have been met as a god by a nation of man-eaters , but this does not in itself make Cortés impressive , nor the Mesoamericans savage .
What would make Cortés ’s apotheosis impressive is if , for the Mesoamericans , by definition ‘ gods are great . ’
I do not know whether they in fact held this .
What would in turn make an instance of Mesoamerican cannibalism exceptionally savage is if it were executed outside of the ordinary , rule - governed practice of human ritual sacrifice and consumption .
But the Aztecs were not a multitude of Vincent Lis .
They were a civilization .
The early modern fantasy of cannibal savages in the New World was of groups of people who lived by no law , as animals : hence the constant coupling of cannibalism and incest in the European imagination .
There is , to be sure , something asocial , lawless , and ‘ animal ’ about a certain kind of cannibalism , namely , the kind that is deviant relative to the culture of the cannibal .
This much is clear from the figure of the cannibal in another , very different Native American culture : the Cree of Canada and the Northern US .
For them , the ultimate form of asociality is a condition diagnosed these days as “ Windigo psychosis , ” the apparent transformation of an individual into a mythological creature , whose primary distinguishing trait is that his lips have been eaten away and his teeth are left exposed in a skeletal smile .
The Windigo is the sorry soul who has become so detached from the social world that he will eat anything — including himself .
One might suppose that with their figure of the cannibal , early modern European thinkers did not go far enough in imagining what life would be like for those who live under no law .
If there were truly no law , we would all be gnawing our own lips off .
Life would be far too nasty , poor , brutish , and short to afford the time to even think about appointing a sovereign .
But the Europeans ’ cannibal served his purpose , just as the much more fearsome one imagined by the Cree serves his : as a mirror that reflects society by showing it in the negative .
Even if Avramescu ’s affectionate revival of the figure of the cannibal is not a project of its time , his work reminds us nonetheless of the treasures to be found along the via negativa through the history of political philosophy .

All this talk of unemployment is preposterous .
Think of it .
We live in a world with lots of imperfections , things that need to be done .
It has always been so and always will be so .
That means that there is work to be done , and therefore , always jobs .
The problem of unemployment is a problem of disconnect between those who would work and those who would hire .
What is the disconnect ?
It comes down to affordability .
Businesses right now ca n’t afford to hire new workers .
They keep letting them go .
Therefore , unemployment is high , in the double - digits , approaching 17 % or more .
Among black men , it is 25 % .
Among youth , it is 30 % or higher .
And the problem is spreading and will continue to spread so long as there are barriers to deal - making between hirers and workers .
Again , it is not a lack of work to be done .
It is too expensive to pay for the work to be done .
So ask yourself , what are those things that prevent deals from being made ?
Let me list a few barriers :
The high minimum wage that knocks out the first several rungs from the bottom of the ladder ;
The high payroll tax that robs employees and employers of resources ;
The laws that threaten firms with lawsuits should the employee be fired ;
The laws that established myriad conditions for hiring beyond the market - based condition that matters : can he or she get the job done ? ;
The unemployment subsidy in the form of phony insurance that pays people not to work ;
The high cost of business start - ups in the form of taxes and mandates ;
The mandated benefits that employers are forced to cough up for every new employee under certain conditions ; Speaking of Liberty Jr. , Llewellyn H. Rock ...
Best Price : $ 1.80 Buy New $ 8.65 ( as of 07:35 EST - Details )
The withholding tax that prevents employers and employees from making their own deals ;
The age restrictions that treat everyone under the age of 16 as useless ;
The social security and income taxes that together devour nearly half of contract income ;
The labor union laws that permit thugs to loot a firm and keep out workers who would love a chance to offer their wares for less .
Now , that ’s just a few of the interventions .
But if they were eliminated today , and it would only take one act of Congress to do so , the unemployment rate would collapse very quickly .
Everyone who wanted a job would get one .
Depending on the credibility of the new approach , businesses would begin hiring immediately .
It would be a spectacular thing to behold .
However , the new approach would have to be certain and not something to be reversed in a couple of months .
No one wants to invest in employees only to have their investment taken away .
So there could be no expiration date on the new laissez - faire approach .
The Left , The Right an ... Llewellyn H. Rockwell Jr Best Price : $ 7.33 Buy New $ 40.00 ( as of 07:55 EST - Details )
What is the objection to this approach ?
I seriously doubt that many people would dispute that it would work to end unemployment .
But many people say , oh , this wo n’t do at all .
It is not just jobs we want .
It is good - paying jobs !
If that ’s the case , you have to understand what is being claimed here .
People are saying that it is better that people be unemployed rather than being exploited at low wages .
If so , it all comes down to your definition of exploitation .
If $ 10 per hour is exploitation , we should be creating even more unemployment by raising the minimum wage .
We could dis -employ all but a few by raising the minimum wage to $ 1,000 per hour .
If you like this site , please help keep it going and growing .
In a market - based labor contract , there is no exploitation .
People come to agreement based on their own perceptions of mutual benefit .
A person who believes it is better to work for $ 1 an hour rather than sit at home doing nothing is free to make that contract .
In fact , a person who works for a negative wage — who pays for an internship , for example — is free to make that deal too .
I propose to you , then , a definition of exploitation that comes from the writings of William H. Hutt : violence or threat of violence implied in the negotiation of anything affecting the life of a worker or employer .
In that sense , the present system is exploitation .
Workers are robbed of wages .
Employers are robbed of profits .
Poor people and young people especially are robbed of opportunity .
Read any account of economic history from the late Middle Ages through the 19th century and try to find any evidence of the existence of unemployment .
You wo n’t find it .
Why is that ?
Because long - term unemployment is a fixture of the modern world created by the interventionist state .
“ We ” tried to cure it and “ we ” ended up doing the opposite .
So it is hard for me to take seriously all the political plans for ramping up intervention in the name of curing unemployment .
There is no involuntary unemployment in a free market , because there is always work to be done in this world .
It is all a matter of making the deal .
All that stands between the present awful reality and 0 % unemployment is a class of social managers unwilling to admit error .
How much higher does the rate need to get before we admit the error of our ways ?

While the world economy is rebounding , knock - on effects from the downturn are still being felt .
Another 60 million people will lose their jobs , globally , in 2010 according to The Economist .
200 million people risk falling into poverty .
Thus the new year brings with it heightened potential for social unrest as , for many , financial difficulty wears on .
The Economist :
But poverty alone does not spark unrest — exaggerated income inequalities , poor governance , lack of social provision and ethnic tensions are all elements of the brew that foments unrest .
Mexico , Russia , and China are particularly at risk .
One can imagine that social powder kegs are slow burning .
Economic inequalities or perceived injustices start to simmer when problems first emerge ... but explode much later as people exhaust other avenues of hope .

The Federal Government is reminding people they risk fines of up to $ 110,000 if found trying to bring illegal handheld lasers into the country .
It follows an alarming increase in the number of laser pointers seized in the past six months .
Nearly 6,000 lasers were seized by customs and border protection officers , compared to just over 6,500 in the entire previous financial year .
The pointers are a device that use a highly focussed beam of light and are a professional tool in a range of industries but ones that emit more than one milliwatt are prohibited in Australia without a permit .
Home Affairs Minister Brendan O'Connor says in the wrong hands they can be a dangerous weapon .
" Members of the public should also be warned that some retailers selling handheld laser pointers on the internet advertise them as being under 1 milliwatt threshold when they are in fact many times over that limit and therefore are illegal to bring into this country without a permit , " he said .
" If someone operating machinery a car or plane for example experiences temporary blindness or disorientation , this can have disastrous effects . "

Leonid over Mono Lake
Credit & Copyright : Tony Rowell
Explanation : Eerie spires of rock rise from shore of Mono Lake in the foreground of this early morning skyscape .
The salty , mineral - laden lake is located in California 's eastern Sierra Nevada mountain range and the spindly rock formations are naturally formed limestone towers called tufa .
In the scene , recorded near the peak of the annual Leonid meteor shower ( now subsiding ) on November 17th , a meteor trails through the frigid predawn sky .
Arcturus is the brightest star to the right of the meteor streak , while the constellation Leo and the shower 's radiant point lie well above the field of view .
Reports for this year 's Leonids suggest the peak activity briefly exceeded 120 meteors per hour , but rates were typically much lower for many locations .
Two gay couples are testifying at the trial
The first US federal court case to determine whether states are allowed to ban same - sex marriages has opened in San Francisco , California .
Any ruling reached is expected to be challenged , possibly taking the case all the way to the US Supreme Court .
A Supreme Court ruling would determine the fate of gay marriages nationwide , without the possibility of appeal .
The suit , filed by two gay couples , challenges Proposition 8 - a ban on gay marriage in the state of California .
Being able to call him my husband is so definitive
Paul Katami
plaintiff , talking about his partner Jeffrey Zarrillo
The law amended California 's constitution to restrict marriage to a union between a man and a woman .
Supporters of the challenge are comparing it to landmark cases which ended segregation in US schools and overturned a ban on interracial marriage , the BBC's Rajesh Mirchandani reports .
They say the Constitution enshrines the right to marry but , by limiting it to heterosexual couples , it discriminates against gay people .
' Social fabric ' Backers of Proposition 8 say the federal case is the latest attempt to overturn what they say is the will of the people as expressed by the 52 % who backed the amendment in a 2008 referendum .
CALIFORNIA GAY MARRIAGE 2004 San Francisco begins issuing marriage licences to same - sex couples - a move annulled by Supreme Court months later May 2008 Supreme Court votes 4 - 3 to legalise same - sex marriage ; introduced in June November 2008 Voters approve Proposition 8 limiting marriage to heterosexual couples March 2009 Civil - rights lawyers argue before Supreme Court that referendum is anti-constitutional May 2009 Supreme Court rules Proposition 8 is constitutional Chief US District Judge Vaughn Walker will have to decide whether the ban on same - sex marriage in California is constitutional .
The case is being argued by high - profile lawyers Theodore Olson and David Boies .
Proceedings opened on Monday with testimony from two plaintiffs in the case , Kristin Perry and Sandra Stier , who wed in California 2004 only to have their union later declared invalid .
Ms Stier said that being allowed to wed her partner would " provide me with a sense of inclusion in the social fabric of the society I live in " .
" I want our children to feel proud of us , " she told the court .
" I do n't want them to worry about us . "
Kristen Perry said : " I want it to happen to me .
The state is n't letting me feel happy . "
Paul Katami and his partner Jeffrey Zarrillo described slights in gay life that ranged from being pelted with stones and eggs in college to the awkwardness of checking into a hotel and not being able to clarify the relationship .
This lawsuit is an attempt by Judge Walker to put the voters of California on trial , and it 's wrong
Brian Brown
director of the National Organization for Marriage " Being able to call him my husband is so definitive , " Mr Katami said .
" There is no subtlety to it .
It is absolute . "
Supporters of Proposition 8 will argue California does not discriminate against the gay community , as the current law allows them to get married - as long as they wed a partner of the opposite sex .
" This lawsuit is an attempt by Judge Walker to put the voters of California on trial , and it 's wrong , " said Brian Brown , director of the National Organization for Marriage , which opposes gay marriage .
" I think our founding fathers would be rolling over in their graves if they heard that the constitution guarantees the right to redefine marriage , " he told AFP news agency .
' Media circus '
The pros and cons of broadcasting the proceedings have become an issue of debate .
Please turn on JavaScript .
Media requires JavaScript to play .
Less than two hours before the trial was started , the Supreme Court temporarily blocked a plan to post video of the proceeding on the internet site YouTube .
The Supreme Court complied with an emergency request by lawyers who had argued that broadcasting the trial would turn it into a media circus .
The court has blocked the broadcast until Wednesday afternoon to allow for further consideration of the arguments brought by both sides .
Judge Walker had agreed to the taping after a recent rule change allowed for televised coverage of some civil cases .
He said the case was appropriate for wide dissemination because it dealt with an issue of wide interest and importance .

Flight Planning January 19 , 2010
[ We studied methods of computing sines in a previous exercise .
In today ’s exercise , guest author Jos Koot , a retired physicist , amateur pilot , and Scheme enthusiast , gives us an example of the use of sines .
Feel free to contact me if you have an idea for an exercise , or if you wish to contribute your own exercise .
Jos writes this disclaimer :
Do not use the example program for real life flight planning .
It may not be fool proof !!!
Use more appropriate equipment and procedures after studying aeronautics more profoundly .
I do not accept any claims .
There is a lot more to flying than presented in this exercise . ]
When preparing to fly , a pilot must know :
The direction and distance from the airfield of departure to the airfield of destination .
This direction is called the ground track ( GT ) .
The name ( WN ) and speed ( WS ) of the wind .
The name is the direction from which the wind blows and is measured in degrees clockwise from north .
The direction proper ( WD ) is opposite to that of the name .
which the wind blows and is measured in degrees clockwise from north .
The direction proper ( WD ) is opposite to that of the name .
The air speed of the plane ( AS ) This is the speed of the airplane relative to the moving air .
Directions are measured in degrees clockwise from geographic north , 360 degrees on the compass - card .
You may measure distances and times in any unit you like .
Speeds should be in unit of distance per unit of time , of course .
We take the air speed as a given datum and we ignore time needed for climbing and descending .
Because the plane may be drifted by the wind , the pilot must calculate which direction to head for in order to compensate the drift .
For this purpose the pilot may draw a triangle whose sides are speeds :
Ground track .
This side is to be drawn in the direction from takeoff to destination but with unknown speed .
This still unknown speed is called the ground speed ( GS ) .
Drift caused by the wind .
Both direction and speed are known thanks to meteorologists .
The drift points in the direction the wind blows to and is opposite to that of the name of the wind .
For example , wind from east causes drift to west .
True heading ( HT ) .
This is the direction the pilot must choose in order to compensate for the drift .
The direction is unknown , but the speed is : it is the air speed , also called the cruise speed .
It is instructive first to draw some navigation triangles by means of a pair of compasses and a ruler .
The air speed is significantly greater than the wind speed , of course .
First draw a line in the direction of the ground track .
On this line choose a point B . Draw the drift ending in point B . Now we have point C. Draw a circle with point C for its centre and the air speed for its radius .
The circle has two points of intersection with the ground track .
One of the intersection points is A. Point A and the other point of intersection correspond to the two roots of the quadratic equation .
Because the ground speed is directed from point A to point B it is not difficult to see which point of intersection is the right one .
Now the vector equation AB = AC + CB is satisfied .
The known data are : ground track GT , distance ( D ) from departure to destination , wind name WN , wind velocity WS and the air speed AS .
The air speed is significantly greater than the velocity of the wind , of course .
From these data we want to compute : true heading TH , ground speed GS and time of the flight ( FT=D / GS ) .
One solution uses the law of sines , which states that the ratio of the length of a side to the sine of the opposite angle is the same for all three sides of any triangle .
We have , hence .
The ground speed can be calculated as .
Another solution uses the cosine rule c² = a² + b² – 2 ab cos(θ ) to compute the third side of a triangle when two sides and the included angle are known , a quadratic equation is obtained .
Solving this equation for the unknown ground speed , we have .
Because we want a positive ground speed , take the root with the plus sign .
Finally use the cosine rule again in order to compute the angle of correction ( angle A ) , which is the angle between the ground track and the required true heading : , so the true heading is .
This angle must be added or subtracted from the direction of the ground track depending on which side the wind drifts the plane .
Your task is to write two functions , as above , that take a distance , ground track , wind speed and direction , and air speed and computes the true heading , ground speed , correction and duration of flight .
When you are finished , you are welcome to read or run a suggested solution , or to post your own solution or discuss the exercise in the comments below .
Your government just blew it again .
Big time .
How ?
By allowing the biggest zombie banks , Bank of America and Citigroup , to pay back TARP before we dealt with the biggest problem plaguing our financial policy of the past few years : Too Big To Fail .
As long as the banks were on the hook for that TARP money , the government had some ability to dictate reform .
Now it has none .
And in case you missed what is really going on here , the banks that repaid TARP are now getting all the benefits of government help with none of the drawbacks .
They just ditched the bad stuff -- namely , pay caps -- and kept the good stuff ( implicit bond guarantees , subsidized super - low interest rates , no obligation to do anything for anyone ) .
Obama can jawbone all he wants about " fat cats , " but that 's all he can do .
Wall Street has him and the rest of Washington right where they want him :
By the balls .
Why does this matter ?
Because , as Alan Greenspan of all people just observed , taxpayers are still on the hook for everything , and the government now has no bullets left .
If all goes well over the next few years -- if the economy continues to recover , if the Fed keeps interest rates low , and if the US continues to be able to borrow at reasonable long - term rates -- none of this will matter .
This latest gift to Wall Street will just become a bad memory like all the rest .
If all does not go well , however -- if the economy relapses into a double - dip , if the Fed is forced to raise short - term rates to combat inflation , if loan losses exceed expectations -- the government ( and Wall Street ) will have a big problem on its hands .
If the banks get in trouble again , or if it becomes plain as day that they 're never going to start lending because their balance sheets are in rotten shape , the government wo n't be able to do anything .
After watching the appalling bailouts and bonuses of the past year , taxpayers will start a revolution before they allow the government to put hundreds of billions of dollars directly into the pockets of Wall Street again .
If we come to another crisis , therefore -- or even if we simply crawl along sideways -- this will put the government into a bind .
In a just world , the way out would be to finally make the bank bondholders pay for their stupidity , converting bank debt to equity and correcting the error made last time .
In the heat of another crisis , however , the government will likely be terrified at the thought of rocking the boat and will fight tooth and nail to give bondholders another free pass .
If this proves politically impossible , the government might actually have to let some firms fail , or risk being run out of town .
And because we have yet to create a system in which banks CAN fail in an orderly manner without taking the whole economy down , this could put us on a path to Japan ( zombie banks ) or another Lehman - like disaster .
What should the government have done while it still had some leverage ?
Raise capital requirements , forcing the banks to use their tremendous profits to build big cushions against future problems instead of paying huge bonuses .
Given the forced bailouts of last year , why on earth should banks be allowed to pay out normal compensation ratios for the next few years ?
Why should n't they be forced to keep this money on hand for a rainy day ?
Make every bank build " contingent convertible " bonds into their capital structures , thus creating an automatic bailout mechanism whose cost will be borne by the banks ' capital providers instead of the taxpayer .
These bonds , which automatically convert to equity if the banks ' capital falls below a certain level , eliminate the need for government intervention .
If the bank runs low on capital , the bond converts , and the bank is automatically recapitalized ( and its ownership changes accordingly ) .
Instead of implementing these simple fixes , however , the government has given up its last bit of leverage .
It continues to implicitly guarantee all the big banks under Too Big To Fail , but now all it can do to shape their behavior is make disapproving noises about " fat cats " ( who , by the way , are doing exactly what any sentient being would do under the circumstances , which is take the free money and use it for the benefit of employees and shareholders ) .

The July 7 attacks in London were not an individual act of terrorism but one episode in a worldwide conflict , say researchers at Oxford University .
Philip Ball reports
The third world war has already started .
It is not George Bush 's rhetorical " war on terror " , but terrorism itself .
In other words , terrorism is the new war .
Journalistic cliche ?
Apparently not .
A recent analysis of the casualty statistics of global terrorism shows they follow the pattern previously observed for conventional conflicts ranging from small local skirmishes to the second world war .
In at least two continuing conflicts not generally regarded as terrorist in nature - in Iraq and Colombia - the statistics are converging on the form seen for global terrorism , perhaps indicating that governments need to deal with wars differently .
According to Neil Johnson , a physicist at Oxford University and one of the team that studied the figures , the findings raise the possibility that both conflicts " are a part of one big ongoing global war - a mother of all wars " .
If that is so , London is embroiled in it , too .
The casualty figures for the July 7 bombings " absolutely fall in line " with what the analysis of terrorism statistics predict , says Johnson .
But how can a single , simple ( if gruesome ) statistic such as the number of people killed in attacks tell us anything meaningful about events and conflicts conducted in completely different places for what seem to be totally different reasons ?
Is n't this like expecting to understand a country 's culture by counting its population ?
That depends on what you are looking for .
When he first studied the statistics of " deadly quarrels " 80 years ago , the British physicist Lewis Fry Richardson wanted to understand why wars happen .
Richardson , a Quaker who served as an ambulance driver in the first world war , hoped that such insight could promote world peace .
He decided first to find out how wars were distributed according to their size .
In the 1920s , Richardson plotted the fatality statistics for 82 wars fought since 1820 on a graph showing the size of the conflicts on one axis and the number of conflicts of that size on the other .
He found that the data fitted onto a smooth curve which , when the numbers were plotted as logarithms , became a straight line .
This sort of mathematical relationship is known as a power law .
The line slopes " downwards " because there are progressively fewer conflicts of ever greater size : little wars are common ; big ones rare .
The power law continued to hold as the data embraced conflicts such as the second world war and Vietnam .
Richardson 's discovery of power - law statistics of conflicts has been followed subsequently by the recognition that power laws govern all sorts of " social " statistics , from the sizes of towns to the fluctuations of economic markets and the network structure of the world wide web .
Power - law statistics of event sizes are also found for natural phenomena that occur close to points of instability , such as earthquakes and avalanches .
This suggests that social systems prone to power - law statistics , such as economic markets and international relations , also operate on the brink of instability .
Earlier this year , computer scientists Aaron Clauset and Maxwell Young at the University of New Mexico showed that the fatalities from acts of terrorism since 1968 also follow a power law .
" We were very surprised , " Clauset says .
" It made us think that there may be some deep , underlying connection between terrorism and wars . "
But they found that not all terrorism is the same .
There are two different power laws - one that fits the figures for terrorist attacks in industrialised ( G8 ) nations ; and another for attacks in the rest of the world .
The slope of the straight - line plot was steeper in the latter case , indicating that attacks in industrialised nations are more rare but more severe when they do occur .
The attacks of September 11 indicate precisely that , as do the London bombings .
Johnson has teamed up with economist Mike Spagat at Royal Holloway College in London , a specialist in the Colombian conflict , and researchers in Bogotá , Colombia , to apply the same kind of analysis to this continuing struggle between the government and several left - and rightwing insurgent groups .
The conflict has been going on since the 1980s , and at face value it resembles neither a terrorist - style confrontation nor a conventional war .
But the researchers found that the fatality statistics for individual attacks since 1989 also follow a power law .
More strikingly still , the slope of the power law has been decreasing steadily over time and appears to be converging on precisely the value that Clauset and Young found for global ( non - G8 ) terrorism .
The Colombian " war " may have started out as something unique , but it seems now to have mutated into a conflict with the fingerprint of terrorism .
And the team found the same trend for the statistics in Iraq since the coalition invasion in March , 2003 .
Here , the slope of the power law initially had much the same value as that seen by Richardson for conventional wars .
But it has crept up steadily since 2003 , and now it , too , is equal to that for global terrorism .
Johnson argues that , while the conventional approach of political analysts is to look for micro-explanations of the course of a conflict in terms of the motivations of the groups concerned , that statistical analysis suggests that the outcomes are much more to do with " the mechanics of how people now do war " .
" It 's like looking at different markets , " he says .
" We now know that a lot of the fluctuations are universal , irrespective of whether you 're looking at trading in New York or Shanghai . "
With that in mind , he and his colleagues have developed a simple mathematical model of how insurgent forces are organised into small groups that are continually coalescing and fragmenting .
Assuming that the destructive capacity of a group depends on its size and resources , this model predicts the value of the power - law slope found for global terrorism .
The team 's conclusion supports the assertion of Mary Kaldor , a political scientist at the London School of Economics , that " the ongoing war in Iraq is a new type of war " .
Kaldor says that US military action in Iraq has been predicated on the assumption that they are fighting an " old war " .
" This is immensely dangerous , " Kaldor says .
That , it seems , must also be the message for any global " war on terror " - it is not one that can be won by military might , but by new strategies .
In " new wars " , says Kaldor , military forces should be deployed for law enforcement , and " forces are needed that combine soldiers , police and civilians with the capacity to undertake humanitarian and legal activities " .
But if , as Johnson 's work suggests , these conflicts have indeed turned into a form of terrorism , they will not be over soon .
According to Clauset , the power - law statistics of terrorism show that it " is an endemic feature of the modern world and is likely not something that can be completely eradicated .
Instead , it should be considered in a similar way to other endemic problems , such as crime and natural disasters . "
